Government 's Replacement Of Military Judge In 9/11 Cases Is Transparent Attempt To Ram Through Cases Before Administration Changes , Adds Group
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

NEW YORK – The American Civil Liberties Union strongly praises President - elect Barack Obama 's promise on CBS ' " 60 Minutes " Sunday night to close down Guantánamo and its unconstitutional military commissions being used to prosecute detainees .
" After eight years of a Bush administration that thumbed its nose at the Constitution and the rule of law , it is incredibly gratifying that President - elect Obama plans to put an end to the Guantánamo prison camp and its sham military commission system which have been a stain on America 's name at home and abroad .
We strongly urge him to take such action on Day One with the stroke of a pen , by executive order , " said Anthony D. Romero , Executive Director of the ACLU .
" The Bush military commissions that violate core constitutional principles and rely on hearsay , secret evidence and evidence obtained through torture have no place in our democracy .
Federal civilian or military courts are perfectly capable of handling terrorism prosecutions and accommodating sensitive national security concerns , as has been demonstrated time and time again . "
On Monday morning , immediately following President - elect Obama 's promise to close Guantánamo and its shameful commissions , it was announced that a new military judge would be assigned to the military commission cases against Guantánamo detainees accused of perpetrating 9/11 crimes , effective immediately .
" The timing of the announcement to replace the military commission judge on the 9/11 cases is highly suspect and disturbing , " said Romero .
" We cannot allow the Bush administration to sabotage President - elect Obama 's plans by ramming through these cases in its last days while the new administration is making plans to dismantle the military commission system .
This seems like a quintessential set - up by a defeated administration bitter about its failure to achieve the real justice Americans deserve . "
As part of the John Adams Project , a partnership with the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers , the ACLU is sponsoring expert civilian counsel to assist the under - resourced military defense counsel for several Guantánamo detainees .

The mammoth Large Hadron Collider is offline after a pretty big malfunction during testing .
CERN , the agency in charge of the LHC , has released its preliminary findings of what happened .
The current flow in the LHC depends critically on it being a superconductor .
That means the electricity flows with almost no resistance ( think of it like water flowing in a pipe that has no friction ) .
For some reason -- why it happened is still unknown -- a small patch of resistance developed in the circuit .
If left alone , something like this can cause massive damage ; for example electricity flow can generate a vast amount of heat in such a patch .
However , the LHC automatic safeguards kicked in , and appeared to work as designed .
However again , an electric arc was triggered , and we 're not talking about a little spark .
It was big enough to punch a hole in the dewars containing the liquid helium needed to cool the magnets down to superconducting temperatures .
The helium leaked out , and started to fill a region of the LHC which is supposed to be kept in vacuum .
It also leaked out into the tunnel holding the LHC itself , causing some damage to the structure , including partially tearing the 1 ton magnets out of their brackets holding them down .
Yikes .
So there is some mechanical damage , but it 's limited to where the problem occurred ( other magnets appear to be fine ) .
About 30 magnets were damaged , and they lost about six tons of helium , which needs to be replaced .
The repair will take some time , as will figuring out exactly what happened , and , more importantly , why .
They 're being cautious about this , as you might expect :
Although the cause of the initial growth of connection resistance has not yet been established , and knowing that a similar event has not occurred in the test of all other sectors and of their thousands of connections , it has nonetheless been decided that additional measurements to generate early warnings and interlocks , improvements in pressure relief devices and in external anchoring of the quadrupole [ magnet ] cryostats with vacuum barrier will be implemented before any further powering of the LHC circuits at high current .
So they will proceed carefully , but I 'm guessing they will have it up and running in a few months time , certainly sometime next year .
This is a major setback for the program , of course , and will cost them time , money , and some PR , no doubt .
But they will get it back up to speed , and soon they 'll be back in the business of science , poking and prodding the Universe on a quantum scale .
Thomas Edison ( or his students , one really never knows with him ) worked on the carbon microphone in 1876 .
Since then , microphone technology has come a heck of a long way , from liquid microphones that rendered speech so you could actually understand it ( early mics could n’t render speech intelligibly ) , to condenser mics used for studio recordings and scientific recordings .
We ’ve also got digital mics , silicon mics on a chip , parabolic microphones for spies and eavesdroppers , ribbon microphones , laser mics , electret condenser microphones , lavalier microphones that clip onto clothing for interviews and even speakers are sometimes used for mics in intercoms and walkie talkies ( and by creative sound engineers ) .
We ’ve come a long way .
Throat microphones are used to pick up voice in environments with lot of ambient noise and are a type of contact microphone .
Some contact mics are used to pick up the sound from acoustic instruments ( piezo mics ) , but a company in Japan called Sanken have a moving - coil contact microphone called the MO - 64 that is sensitive enough to pick up the footsteps on an ant , or amazingly the heartbeat of a snail ( which , by the way is about 10 - 40 bpm .
( example of 2 contact mics on an anthill )
This mic , which was developed a few years ago but has n’t been available commercially until recently , is n’t the only high - sensitivity mic out there , but the great thing about this microphone is that it uses a tiny pin to detect vibration on a surface , therefore sound in the air is not picked up by the microphone .
This allows very faint sounds to be amplified a great deal with little ambient noise .
Of course this little microphone may not necessarily be the absolute most sensitive microphone in the world – that prize arguably goes to these huge concrete behemouths .
Sanken also make an interesting new microphone that they describe a a perfect omni-directional condenser microphone , claimed to be the first microphone that displays a perfectly circular polar pattern at up to 20k Hz .
Presumably this type of mic would be of great interest to engineers who record orchestral music
How much is it going to set you back to buy a mic that you can practically use to record yourself thinking ?
Around $ 4000 .
While at that price they are n’t going to be flying off the shelves , it ’s still a lot less than other professional quality setups like the “ Neumann Solution D Large Diaphragm Studio Microphone with 96 kHz A/D Converter ” which will set you back a cool $ 13,200 .
this one .
There is also a portable version of the microphone .
A rock star insect singing into a mic ?
( right )
The mic is really cool , but I ’d like to point out one thing : I tried to contact Sanken to find out more about the microphone and its applications , however my polite inquiries were treated with a bit of a rude refusal to answer any questions .
In fact , they refused to even confirm that the video above actually uses their mics .
I cannot fathom how this approach to inquiries leads to success in business , but heck , what do I know ?

Microsoft is taking its first major step towards OpenID adoption by becoming an OID provider .
Once enabled , users will be able to login to any OpenID enabled site with their existing Windows Live IDs .
The first iteration is provider only — it will not be possible to use other OpenID providers with Windows Live services , unfortunately .
While we 're generally pretty down on " provider only " OpenID implementations , Windows Live has enough members to make this announcement pretty exciting for OpenID proponents .
Yahoo , AOL , and Microsoft users can now login to any OpenID enabled site using their existing user accounts .
Google users can as well , though it 's through an unsupported AppEngine implementation .
Although OpenID is becoming a viable option for independent sites , particularly after this announcement , there 's still a great deal of friction preventing serious uptake .
Major Internet hubs that offer OpenID are generally providers only , so a Windows Live user is still going to need a Yahoo account to use any Yahoo service .
As long as this is the case , the utility of OpenID will be constrained .
Even assuming 100 percent OpenID coverage , there 's still a massive UI problem to overcome .
In many cases , users do n't have any idea what OpenID is , simply do n't understand how to use it , or can't wrap their head around the concept of " using an account from another service to login . "
With this announcement , millions more people will have an OpenID enabled login account somewhere , but it 's still quite a long road to real adoption .

Standing in front of more than 100,000 supporters in Civic Center park , Barack Obama said today he is ready for the final nine days of the presidential campaign and vowed to stay focused on improving the country ’s faltering economy .
“ What we need right now is a real debate about how to fix our economy and help middle class families , ” Obama said .
“ But that ’s not what we ’re getting from the other side .
A couple of weeks ago , my opponent ’s campaign said that ‘ if we keep talking about the economy , we ’re going to lose , ’ so they said they ’d be focusing on attacking me instead .
“ And that ’s one campaign promise they ’ve actually kept .
Sen .
McCain has been throwing everything he ’s got at us , hoping something will stick .
He ’s even called me a socialist for suggesting that we focus on tax cuts , not for corporations and the wealthy , but for the middle class . ”
As he was introduced , Obama walked down a long runway stage to thunderous applause .
“ Do you ever have small crowds in Denver ? ” Obama asked the crowd , which shouted back “ NO ! ”
Denver police estimated the crowd at more than 100,000 .
Civic Center park holds 34,000 , and there were several thousand more in the streets surrounding the park and on the steps of the state Capitol .
The Obama campaign said it was the largest U.S. crowd to ever attend rally to see the Illinois senator .
Obama addressed a crowd in Berlin that was estimated at 200,000 .
He thanked Americans for those who “ sent letters , and flowers and well wishes ” to his ailing grandmother .
Obama left the campaign trail on Thursday and Friday to visit his grandmother in Hawaii .
In Denver , Obama gave basically the same economic speech that he has been giving at stops where he has drawn huge crowds .
Last weekend , he drew 100,000 in St. Louis .
He continues to try to tie Republican presidential nominee John McCain to President Bush — and he chided his rival for trying to turn the tables .
“ The other day , he took it to a whole new level .
He said that I was like George W. Bush .
You ca n’t make this stuff up , folks , ” Obama said .
“ In what may be the strangest twist of all , Sen. McCain said that I would somehow continue the Bush economic policies — and that he , John McCain , would change them .
“ But then , just this morning , Sen. McCain said that he and President Bush ‘ share a common philosophy . ’
That ’s right , Colorado .
I guess that was John McCain finally giving us a little straight talk and owning up to the fact that he and George Bush actually have a whole lot in common . ”
After rattling off the numerous economic challenges facing the country , Obama said he was confident that his administration , if elected , would be able to get the country on the right track .
“ I know these are difficult times .
I know folks are worried , ” he said .
“ But I believe that we can steer ourselves out of this crisis because I believe in this country .
Because I believe in you .
I believe in the American people .
“ We are the United States of America .
We are a nation that ’s faced down war and depression ; great challenges and great threats .
And at each and every moment , we have risen to meet these challenges — not as Democrats , not as Republicans , but as Americans … But Colorado , I know this .
It will take a new direction .
It will take new leadership in Washington . ”
Security opened the gates 45 minutes early as a line of supporters snaked around the park , down Colfax to Cherokee Street and then south on Cherokee for several blocks .
Gates were scheduled to open at 10 a.m. , but there were several thousand people in line at 8:30 a.m .
Obama has two rallies in the area today .
After addressing the crowd in Denver , Obama heads to Fort Collins for an event scheduled to begin at 3:30 p.m .
In Denver , the Obama campaign said it was expecting a crowd of about 34,000 , but it appeared far more than that attended .
Those who tired of standing in line took up positions on the steps of the state Capitol and in the areas around Civic Center .
Police finally closed Broadway and Lincoln to handle the overflow crowd .
Walt Young , a 61 - year - old substitute teacher from Boulder , was proudly wearing a hat designating him as a Vietnam veteran .
“ I want to show that veterans are supporting Obama , ” he said .
“ The McCain people are trying to say that they are supporting veterans , but they really do n’t . ”
As with most of the political rallies held in the state , there are a number of anti-war protesters in attendance , chanting to the crowd .
Eric Verlo of Colorado Springs was holding a large sign that read : “ Democrats please stop funding the war . ”
Democrats have control of the Congress and they keep funding the war , the 47 - year - old said .
“ It ’s just a reminder .
Barack is talking about sending more soldiers to Afghanistan and a slow withdrawal from Iraq . ”
Obama has been spending his time in battleground states , those won by President Bush four years ago .
Several , including Colorado , are leaning toward the Democrat , according to the latest polls .
He has steadily built a lead by focusing on the economy .
In Denver , he again defended the federal government ’s bailout of Wall Street , saying it was a “ necessary first step . ”
The McCain campaign has been criticizing Obama as “ tax - and - spend liberal , ” and cautioning the country that if Obama wins , the White House and Congress would be controlled by Democrats .
There are signs that the Democrats could pick up numerous seats in the House and Senate on Nov. 4 .
“ It ’s true that I want to roll back the Bush tax cuts on the wealthiest Americans and go back to the rate they paid under Bill Clinton , ” Obama said .
“ John McCain calls that socialism .
What he forgets is that just a few years ago , he himself said those Bush tax cuts were irresponsible .
He said he could n’t ‘ in good conscience ’ support a tax cut where the benefits went to the wealthy at the expense of ‘ middle class Americans who most need tax relief . ’
Well , he was right then , and I am right now .
“ So let me be crystal clear :
If you make less than a quarter of a million dollars a year — which includes 98 percent of small business owners — you wo n’t see your taxes increase one single dime .
Not your payroll taxes , not your income taxes , not your capital gains taxes — nothing .
That is my commitment to you . ”
Obama also pledged to address renewable energy and “ fix ” health care .
“ And if I ’m president , we ’ll give every child , everywhere the skills and the knowledge they need to compete with any worker , anywhere in the world , ” he said .
“ I will not allow countries to out - teach us today so they can out - compete us tomorrow . ”
The £ 5bn Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) is intended to smash protons - one of the building blocks of matter - into each other
Repairing the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) near Geneva will cost almost £ 14 m ( $ 21 m ) and " realistically " take until at least next summer to start back up .
An electrical failure shut the £ 3.6 bn ( $ 6.6 bn ) machine down in September .
The European Organization for Nuclear Research ( Cern ) thought it would only be out of action until November but the damage was worse than expected .
It is hoped repairs will be completed by May or early June with the machine restarted at the end of June or later .
Cern spokesman James Gillies said : " If we can do it sooner , all well and good .
But I think we can do it realistically ( in ) early summer . "
Fundamental questions
The LHC was built to smash protons together at huge speeds , recreating conditions moments after the Big Bang , and scientists hope it will shed light on fundamental questions in physics .
The fault occurred just nine days after it was turned on with Cern blaming the shutdown on the failure of a single , badly soldered electrical connection in one of its super - cooled magnet sections .
The collider operates at temperatures colder than outer space for maximum efficiency and experts needed to gradually warm the damaged section to assess it .
" Now the sector is warm so they are able to go in and physically look at each of the interconnections , " Mr Gillies told Associated Press .
The cost of the work will fall within the Cern 's existing budget .
Dr Lyn Evans , the Welsh - born project director has called the collider " a discovery machine , the most sophisticated scientific instrument of our time . "
Marketing Directors find opportunities to drive traffic , improve their SEO and PPC , and uncover the best marketing strategy .
“ I did a trial of about 30 SEO tools and I think that Alexa has the lowest barrier to entry of them all .
It ’s easy to use .
And the data visualizations make digesting the information quick and easy . ”

I love how quick everything was processed and the fact that I was able to track my order .
I absolutely love the service and will recommend this place to anyone in need of favors at a reasonable price . "

Maybe you 've never heard of the wild indie - rock band Portugal .
The Man .
But chances are good you 've heard of their hometown of Wasilla , Alaska .
And when we found out that the band , which just released its third album , Censored Colors , was from the same town as Republican vice - presidential candidate Sarah Palin , we figured it 's a small enough burg that they'd have some good stories to tell .
Last month , singer / guitarist John Baldwin Gourley — who grew up in a remote generator - powered log cabin with no telephone outside Wasilla — wrote a passionate essay on his feelings about his former mayor 's ascension to the national stage , but it was bassist Zach Carothers ' story about his battle with Palin over a skate park that really caught our attention .
We asked him to recount his tale for us .
The Saga Of Sarah Palin , A Bunch Of Alaskan Small - Town Teenagers , And The Wasilla Skate Park
Growing up in Wasilla , Alaska , was not the most exciting time .
Out of all the thousands of things there are to do in a land as beautiful as that , there is a lot of downtime .
My family brought me up to love the outdoors .
Almost every weekend , we were fishing , hiking , camping or snowboarding .
I loved all of it .
As boys become teenagers , we get bored .
And , in a small town such as ours , it 's incredibly easy to get caught up in bad habits .
I was lucky enough to discover skateboarding .
My parents bought me my first skateboard in Santa Cruz , California , while we were on a family vacation when I was 12 .
I returned home and talked most of my friends into getting skateboards as well .
Honestly , my Think deck , Independent trucks and Alien Workshop wheels saved my life .
Starting the summer before eighth grade , my friends and I would do nothing but ride into town and skate all day .
As we got older and more skilled , we were quite limited on where we could practice our hobby .
Businesses were obviously not too fond of anyone hurting themselves for hours a day on their stairs or handrails , and those who have been to Wasilla know there is a general lack of pavement .
Being extremely jealous of the skate parks that we 'd seen in movies and magazines , we decided to make some of our " California dreaming " a reality .
We started small .
During my sophomore year of high school , I talked a few friends into signing up for wood shop .
The five of us earned our grades by building all sorts of ramps and rails that we carried across the school parking lot to the outdoor basketball courts that never really got used .
We had the time of our lives , skating all day in a place where no one would bother us and we would n't bother anyone else .
This did n't last long .
Several times , we showed up after school to see most of our ramps ruined either by guys who did n't like us or by kids trying to jump four - wheelers and dirt bikes off our ramps .
After fixing our little park a few times , we decided we needed a more permanent — and safer — solution to our boredom .
Our parents brought up the idea of going to the city to ask about the chances of getting a real , concrete skate park built .
The number of kids skating was growing like crazy , and with all the baseball diamonds , hockey rinks , and tennis courts around , it seemed like a reasonable request .
Apparently , the City of Wasilla did not agree with us .
Bummer .
Sarah Palin , the mayor of our small town , informed us that a skate park simply would not fit in the budget .
Oddly enough , a few years later , we heard rumors of a multimillion - dollar hockey rink that was going to fit in the budget .
Now , I do n't have anything against hockey , I played my whole life , but there were already several places to play hockey in Wasilla .
Of course , us dumb kids would n't take " no " for an answer .
A few of my friends and our parents attended city hall meetings every week .
Eventually , our persistence paid off .
Mayor Palin made what could be considered a " safe bet " when she suggested that if we could raise half the money , the city would match it and we would start construction .
We were very happy and very determined .
The " Wasilla Skate Park Committee " went to work immediately .
Over the next few months , we held bake sales , car washes , raffles and six or seven benefit concerts .
We convinced local businesses to donate goods , services or labor to help support us .
We even put up one of those giant , lame thermometers in city hall and colored in every $ 5,000 we made .
And , incredibly enough , we raised roughly $ 42,000 .
Not too bad for some punk kids in a small town in Alaska .
I really do n't think that Palin thought we could do it .
She was certainly surprised when we filled in the red ball at the top of that stupid thermometer .
And boy , did she have a surprise for us .
After all of our hard work , she informed us that the project was going to have to be delayed ... indefinitely .
That slippery little skate park had gone off and slipped right out of the city budget again .
The Wasilla Skate Park Committee was not too pleased , and once again , we were back at city council meetings every week .
Overall , the demeanor of the council was not a kind one .
We felt looked down upon and generally not taken seriously .
As we loved to skate , they probably thought of us as hoodlums .
They may have thought we all did drugs , skipped school and defaced public property — and , you know , some of us did .
But that is what I tried to explain to them .
Wasilla 's youth needed a place to go .
We needed activities that would keep us from getting into trouble .
Skateboarding is a sport .
If kids were constantly playing football in front of the grocery store , the city would have had a problem with that as well .
Eventually , and after jumping through numerous hoops , our persistence paid off .
Over a year and a half later , the project was finally under way .
Now , 10 years later , the Wasilla Skate Park I fought for as a 15 - year - old boy is still functioning and as busy as ever — and celebrated its 10th anniversary on October 10 .
Despite the hoops that Mayor Palin and the city council made us jump through , I think the city agrees it was a very worthwhile investment and that it 's done much more good than bad .
I 'm proud of myself and everyone who helped the Wasilla Skate Park come to be .
All in all , I 'm very grateful to have been part of the experience .
Filed under : News items , Expansions , Wrath of the Lich King
As much as some Blizzard reps might have wanted to play coy on the official forums , the official World of Warcraft site leaked a link to Pre-order Wrath of the Lich King which will — according to the page — indeed come out on November 13 , 2008 .
So while there has mysteriously been no big announcement on the Blizzard websites , this Pre-order page pretty much confirms what Wowhead and Thottbot unveiled earlier today .
Participating retailers include Amazon , Best Buy , Circuit City , and GameStop .
Interestingly enough , all the official links except for Best Buy peg the official release at November 3 , a date leaked out in earlier reports .
GameStop words it as “ ships in 11/03/08 ” which could mean that the games will reach retailers over a week before the official release date .
[ EDIT : Or yeah , it could be that they have n’t updated their sites yet .
Good morning !]
The details include both normal and Collector ’s Edition versions of the game .
The official Blizzard site has , as of this writing , now been updated to reflect the official release date with a splash page .
[ UPDATE : GameStop has revised their release date to match the announced date of 11/13/08 ]

In a series of scathing critiques , some psychologists have argued that this computerized tool , the Implicit Association Test , or I.A.T. , has methodological problems and uses arbitrary classifications of bias .
If Barack Obama ’s victory seemed surprising , these critics say , it ’s partly because social scientists helped create the false impression that three - quarters of whites are unconsciously biased against blacks .
The I.A.T. , which has been taken by millions of people on an academic Web site , measures respondents ’ reaction times as they follow instructions to associate words like “ joy ” or “ awful ” with either blacks or whites .
It generally takes whites longer to associate positive words with blacks than with whites , although some do show no bias .
( To meet one of these exceptional cases , go to TierneyLab , at nytimes.com/tierneylab . )
The test is widely used in research , and some critics acknowledge that it ’s a useful tool for detecting unconscious attitudes and studying cognitive processes .
But they say it ’s misleading for I.A.T. researchers to give individuals ratings like “ slight , ” “ moderate ” or “ strong ”  and advice on dealing with their bias  when there is n’t even that much consistency in the same person ’s scores if the test is taken again .
“ One can decrease racial bias scores on the I.A.T. by simply exposing people to pictures of African - Americans enjoying a picnic , ” says Hart Blanton , a psychologist at Texas A&M .
“ Yet respondents who take this test on the Web are given feedback suggesting that some enduring quality is being assessed . ”
He says that even the scoring system itself has been changed arbitrarily in recent years .
“ People receiving feedback about their ‘ strong ’ racial biases , ” Dr. Blanton says , “ are encouraged in sensitivity workshops to confront these tendencies as some ugly reality that has meaning in their daily lives .
But unbeknownst to respondents who take this test , the labels given to them were chosen by a small group of people who simply looked at a distribution of test scores and decided what terms seemed about right .
This is not how science is done . ”
Two of the leading I.A.T. researchers , Anthony Greenwald of the University of Washington and Mahzarin Banaji of Harvard , say that some of the past criticism about their measurement techniques has been useful .
But they dismiss most of the current objections as moot because the I.A.T. ’s validity has been confirmed repeatedly .
But many economists say a lasting price collapse is unlikely because the emerging middle class and growing populations in developing economies will continue to have strong appetites for fuels and metals .
Some say that the other commodity bull markets in modern history  approximately spanning 1906 to 1923 , 1933 to 1955 and 1968 to 1982  lasted more than twice as long as the current run .
They included some sharp corrections before they ran their course , suggesting that the current drop , however precipitous , could be temporary .
Though the picture is slightly different for every commodity , prices generally hit a low point for the decade soon after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , then rose as the global economy strengthened in the following years .
From late 2001 until mid-2008 , the price of oil rose 800 percent , copper rose 700 percent and wheat rose 400 percent .
The decline of recent weeks has taken virtually every major commodity more than halfway back to its late 2001 price , adjusted for inflation .
The recent drop has been so rapid that if the pace continued , it would take only a few more weeks to erase the gains of the bull market entirely .
That suggests to some analysts that prices could hit a floor fairly soon .
“ The underlying fundamentals of strong demand for energy , food and industrial commodities will come back , ” said Michael Lewis , global head of commodities research for Deutsche Bank .
Many analysts think oil could fall to $ 70 a barrel in the next few months , if not sooner .
But it is hard for them to believe it will go much lower : oil is not becoming easier to find , as fields in Mexico peter out and suppliers like Iran , Nigeria and Venezuela remain unreliable .
The costs of finding oil in deep waters or mining oil sands in Canada remain high , in the $ 60 to $ 70 a barrel range  and since those are now vital sources of supply , they could help put a floor under the oil price .
Additionally , the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries could cut production to try to shore up prices , probably at an emergency meeting it will hold Nov. 18 .
Analysts note that the credit crisis and economic slowdown will inevitably stall new industrial projects , reducing demand for metals .
But the falling prices will also discourage new mining and drilling .
When economic growth resumes , that could produce metal shortages that would drive prices back up .
SWAT Fever : It 's Epidemic ( Sorry About The Dogs )
It 's sad , of course , that Cheye Calvo 's dogs were blown away , left for hours in two pools of blood on the floors of his living and dining rooms .
It 's unfortunate , to be sure , that Calvo 's front door had to be burst open , that it was necessary to plant his mother - in - law on the floor , arms bound , a high - caliber weapon pointed at her head , or that his house had to be trashed , every drawer flipped over , his belongings strewn about .
Tragic , really .
But no apology is necessary , you see .
Even though Calvo and his wife were exonerated of any criminal act almost instantly after their house was raided in July , even though the officers had done next to zero investigative work before smashing into the Calvo house , " The guys did what they were supposed to do , " Prince George 's County Sheriff Michael Jackson says .
" They had a legitimate court order to be there . "
Never mind that the dozen or so officers from the county police and sheriff 's SWAT team did n't have a warrant with them when they stormed Calvo 's house in Berwyn Heights .
Never mind that the authorities seem unaware that a 2005 Maryland law spells out exactly when " no - knock " raids are permitted .
No , an internal review concluded by the sheriff 's office last week has -- surprise , surprise -- cleared the officers of any wrongdoing , even though no investigator had spoken with Calvo , his wife or his mother - in - law .
" Unfortunately , we had to engage the animals , but that engagement was justified , " Jackson says .
The story of the raid on Calvo 's house -- a 32 - pound box of marijuana had been FedExed there , part of a drug dealer 's scheme to intercept the package before the innocent residents got home -- was appalling enough when it first broke .
But as we learn more about what happened , and as the authorities deflect questions , it becomes a much deeper scandal .
Anyone in town , especially the Berwyn Heights police , who were never consulted about the plan to raid the Calvo house , could have told the county authorities that they were raiding the home of the town 's mayor , who seems as straight as they come , who works at an education foundation downtown , and whose wife is a Medicaid finance expert .
But this is n't an argument that police ought to back off when important or middle - class people are involved .
This is about what they already knew -- and failed to act upon .
That night , more than three hours into his ordeal , after Calvo had begged to be allowed to put on pants or to wipe his tears , he says one officer told him that drug dealers in the area had been drawing package deliverymen into their operations , directing drug shipments to the homes of innocent people , where dealers could intercept the stuff .
" The more I think about that , the angrier I get , " Calvo says .
" They knew this scheme was going on , yet it never occurred to them from the moment they found out about that package that we were anything but drug dealers . "
Once investigators knew that the box of pot was addressed to Calvo 's wife , Trinity Tomsic , Calvo says they were obliged to question the couple .
But he says there was no legal or tactical cause for a no - knock raid .
Ah , but it 's so much easier and so much more fun to barrel into someone 's house with big guns and storm trooper uniforms .
The proliferation of SWAT deployments in this country is stunning , up from 3,000 a year in the mid-1980s to more than 40,000 now , according to Peter Kraske , who studies the militarization of policing as a criminal justice professor at Eastern Kentucky University .
Kraske 's studies detail the spread of SWAT teams even to small towns -- 75 percent of communities with a population under 50,000 have squads , he found .
He attributes the growth to federal grants that help outfit the teams , surplus military equipment given to local police by the Pentagon , and seizure laws that let police cash in or keep contraband found during raids .
Maryland lawmakers , recognizing that SWAT teams are overused , have limited no - knock raids to cases in which a suspect is fleeing into a house , is considered to be armed or may be destroying evidence .
" SWAT should be a last resort , " Calvo says .
" But they did it first -- no investigation , no questions . "
Calvo says officers told him they did n't even know there was a law specifying when no - knock raids are permitted .
Critics of no - knock raids say they not only result in too many errors , sometimes with tragic results , but undermine efforts at community policing , the building of trust and relationships that is critical to effective crime - fighting , such as Berwyn Heights ' requirement that its officers go to every local youth ballgame , get out of the car and walk around chatting with people .
" Telling the people that these officers followed procedure and did nothing wrong sends a chilling message , " Calvo says .
" And then we wonder why people who live in high - crime areas do n't trust the police .
They treated us like animals .
They were not there to protect and serve , they were there to search and destroy . "
Calvo intends to seek stronger county oversight of SWAT deployments , and that would certainly help .
But as long as we continue to glamourize the police when they take on the trappings of the military , more people will be shocked out of bed in the middle of the night , more dogs will be shot on sight , and we 'll have ever more reason to wonder why the police are treated like enemy occupiers .

Romance is a puzzling thing .
But scientists are doing their best to unravel the mysteries of human attachment and have now discovered that women wearing red appear more attractive to men .
Men , however , are unaware that the color red turns them on .
Researchers at the University of Rochester conducted five psychological experiments to assess how color can affect how men view a woman 's attractiveness .
In one study , the men were shown photographs of women framed by a border of either red or white .
The men tended to find the women more attractive when they appeared in the red frame .
In another study , the men were shown pictures of women wearing red followed by pictures of the same women wearing another color .
When wearing red , the women were more likely to score an invitation to the prom and to be treated to a more expensive date .
Red did not change the attractiveness ratings for females rating other females , the authors noted in their study , published today in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology .
And it did not change how men rated the women in the photos in terms of likability , intelligence or kindness .
The color red is linked to romance throughout nature , said the study 's lead author , Andrew Elliot , a professor of psychology .
Research has shown that nonhuman male primates are more attracted to females displaying red .
Female baboons and chimpanzees redden when nearing ovulation to send out sexual signals .
" Our findings confirm what many women have long suspected and claimed -- that men act like animals in the sexual realm .
As much as men might like to think that they respond to women in a thoughtful , sophisticated manner , it appears that at least to some degree , their preferences and predilections are , in a word , primitive , " the authors said .
Other studies have shown that color can provoke a certain mood or feeling .
The behavior provoked by color also depends on the situation , Elliot said .
For example , seeing red in competitive situations tends to lead to a worse performance .

I ’ve taken a first look at jQuery , and while I ’m generally averse to frameworks , this truly is a library , one that you can use as little or as much as you like , and does n’t try to do too much .
Its obvious strengths are being CSS selector based and having a consistent approach to collections and chainability .
An example of not trying to do too much is how you enable / disable an element .
That could easily have been encapsulated , but jQuery ’s approach seems to be to not sweat the small stuff .
Using jQuery , one quickly picks up a few idioms .
For example , replacing an element typically is done via inserting the replacement before ( or after ) the current one , and them removing the current one , all in a chain , thus : $ ( " #foo " ) .before ( bar ) .remove( ) .
The net effect of all of this is that you can “ write less and do more ” , as promised .
But something that more fundamentally changes the way one writes scripts seems to have gone under - reported , at least to my quick scan of the web .
I discovered this trying to make a small mod to an existing data entry application , involving four fields per entry .
This has been used for some time now to create new entries , but now I want to adapt it to handle the updating of existing legacy data which only had three fields .
The approach I selected was to define a button which , when pressed , would cause an “ AJAX ” request to be issued downloading all of the legacy entries .
Once received , the first input field would be replaced by a dropdown selection box .
Once a selection was made , the selection box would revert back to an input field , three fields would be filled in , a hidden field gets information on the original record to be replaced ( in case there is significant editing of the entry ) and focus placed on the original fourth and final field .
Nothing fancy , but we have to deal with the fact that everything is asynchronous .
The final code is below :
$ ( " #archive " ) .click ( function ( ) { $.getJSON ('unscanned.cgi ' , {} , function ( unscanned ) { // replace realname input field with a selection list var select = $ ( ' < select name = " realname " id =" realname " / >' ) [ 0 ] ; for ( var i=0 ; i<unscanned.length ; i++) { select.options [ i ] = new Option ( unscanned [ i ] [ 1 ] , i ) ; } $ ( ' # realname ' ) .before ( select ) .remove ( ) ; $ ( " #archive " ) . attr ( " disabled " , " disabled " ) ; // process selection $ ( ' # realname ' ) .focus ( ).change ( function ( ) { var icla = unscanned [ $ ( " #realname option : selected " ) .
val ( ) ] ; $ ( " #realname " ) .
before ( '< input type =" text " ' + ' id =" realname " name = " realname " / >') .remove ( ) ; $ ( " #realname " ) . val ( icla [ 1 ] ) ; $ ( " #pubname " ) . val ( icla [ 2 ] ) ; $ ( " #email " ) . val ( icla [ 3 ] ) ; $ ( " #replaces " ) . val ( icla [ 0 ] + ':' + icla [ 3 ] ) ; $ ( " #filename " ) .val ( '' ) . focus ( ) ; $ ( " #archive " ) .removeAttr( " disabled " ) ; } ) ; } ) ; return false ; } ) ;
The notable thing about this is that despite all of the asynchronous events taking place , the code is sequential ( nested , but sequential ) , and that the JSON results of the AJAX call are immediately available to the function that is invoked when the selection changes .
With this in place , all that is required is for the server to return a bit of JSON ( and all popular languages these days have good libraries for doing so ) .

It may be legal , but it sure sounds shady
by Jeremy Hooper
Do you ever wonder how churches , with their non-profit status , get away with funneling political donations from their pews to organizations like the one that wants to end marriage equality in California ?
Well , we can tell you :
They use a very careful process using plain white envelopes that do n't identify their church - affiliated nature .
Here , check out these carefully worded instructions that Prop.
8 's backers are distributing to California pastors :
Geez , are they " pro-family " advocates in search of a kosher donation or kidnappers in search of a hushed ransom ?
Because call us uber - suspicious of the anti-gays if you must , but this sounds a teensy bit like a mob offering up some " Do as I say and you wo n't get hurt " instructions .
And quite frankly , we would question the morality of ANY process that required us to quietly stuff money in an unmarked envelope !
But what do we know ?
We 're just Godless sodomites whose loving marriages so evil , even the toughest of financial climates cannot defund the attempts to diffuse them .
Church Resources [ Protect Marriage ]
Your thoughts
How clever !
Here is a way to bend , or is it stretch the law a bit .
With the convoluted political and charitable fundraising laws , this makes them look sooo clean .
After all , they can just say that they did not pass the forms and envelopes out , they just found them lying around the church one day .
Posted by : Bob Miller | Sep 25 , 2008 5:20:55 PM
Right , Bob .
And the thing is , the distinctions do n't matter at all to the average congregant .
All they know is that they went to church , were given some sort of a reason to donate funds to Prop 8 , and did .
Whether the church is specifically asking them for donations or if they are using a workaround , the difference in effect and outcome is likely to be negligible .
Posted by : G - A - Y | Sep 25 , 2008 5:30:49 PM
This really does n't sound legal to me .
Technically , if the church pays for the envelopes , paper , computer , printer and ink and the salary of the person doing this illicit act , then that church is in violation of IRS laws .
Because they would be using funds raised by a tax - exempt entity , and funneling those funds ( in the form or envelopes , printed forms , etc. ) to a taxable entity .
The legal term for that is money - laundering .
A similar scheme is why Tom Delay resigned from the House , and may end up in jail .
Albeit , the cost of those items might be minuscule in comparison to the benefit to the h8 group , it is nonetheless prohibited by the IRS .
Though , proving the act and the conspiracy might be difficult .

After listing 9 detailed , nuanced steps to bend the law , I love how step # 10 says " That 's it ! "
Posted by : fannie | Sep 26 , 2008 1:37:47 PM
Sorry to say , I believe the " tax exempt " status should be taken away from all religious institutions - church and ministries ( which includes paying for the fine dining and eccentric living of the " ex- gays " , such as Stephen Bennett ) .
As crappy as the economy is nowadays , it boggles the mind that in the area which I live in the DFW area , there 's been a couple new " megachurches " built in the past year or so , and 2 - 3 more in the process of being built - marquee , separate gym building and all .
But not a single shelter for the homeless , or battered women and their children .
That 's fucking ridiculous .

Comic strip artist J. Scott Campbell , known for his work on Danger Girl and Marvel 's Spider - Man , created the book covers .
" Those are very super hero - type poses , " he told the Orange County Register of the animated senators ' stances .
" The chest out , hands on the hip - even that angle , like they might jump up and fly at any moment . "
Where does a character go once he 's been reinvented ?
Stripped down to the bare essentials , the James Bond of Casino Royale - the 007 that Ian Fleming would have approved of - proved extremely popular with audiences and critics alike , enough for them wipe the slate clean and agree to start afresh .
Bond now rebooted , battered physically and emotionally , therefore comes into this sequel a fully - formed , grounded character with places to go : a man with drive , reason , purpose .
But despite his passport getting a workout thanks to a jet - setting narrative that takes him half way across the globe , the James Bond of Quantum Of Solace goes precisely nowhere .
At times , you feel you can see the character - and by proxy the writers - actually thinking , " So what now ? "
We pick up with Bond , James Bond , mere minutes after the finale of Casino Royale - in Italy with the sinister Mr. White ( Jesper Christensen ) in the boot of his car , nursing a painful looking leg injury .
But perhaps British intelligence is n't what it used to be .
" We used to be so paranoid , " laughs White , " looking over our shoulders , thinking you were listening to our conversations .
But you did n't even know we exist ! "
White claims his organisation Quantum - think SPECTRE but without the awesome lairs - has men everywhere , and he 's not wrong .
Bond travels to Haiti , London , Bolivia and Russia chasing Quantum goons , principally the weasely Dominic Greene ; a smarmy eco-crusader in public , but reptilian facilitator of evil deeds behind closed doors .
Think Al Gore gone insane with power .
Bond 's arc here ought to be revenge ; the death of Vesper Lynd the righteous cause .
But Craig 's emotionless visage is so blank , the script so bereft of character , Quantum Of Solace feels like just another day at the office for 007 .
Sure , he kills a few people he should n't .
He breaks the rules .
He goes off the grid .
But what kind of Bond would he be if he did n't ?
It is n't until the final scene that you 'll actually remember Bond 's motivations , so meaningless are his exploits up until that point .
Craig , it must be said , is excellent .
Any doubt he could inhabit the role must surely now evaporate .
His Bond is a real bruiser : smacked , cracked , bleeding and beaten from pillar to post , Craig looks like hell in the best possible way .
The problems with Quantum Of Solace should not fall at his feet .
This is the best Bond he could be given the circumstances .
No , the issues are with the studio's choice of director in Marc Forster .
This is a man who knows how to put dramatic audiences through the wringer ( Monster 's Ball , Finding Neverland , The Kite Runner ) but he 's completely out of his depth handling a franchise this large .
High - tempo sequences , like the opening car chase and an extremely Bournian rooftop pursuit , are disorientating in the extreme : too fast , too sloppy and too ruthlessly edited .
Often , things change in the blink of an eye - one second Bond is lying on his back , the next he 's jumping out a window , the next he 's swinging from a rope .
It 's often impossible to keep up .
Fight scenes often seem practised and stagey ( Bond smashes an opponent through a wall with ridiculous ease ) , while one shot sees 007 riding a motorbike ... at about 25 mph .
These are all hallmarks of a director unfamiliar with action ; perhaps former Paul Greengrass protege Dan Bradley should be held responsible ( it would certainly explain the feeling of deja vu - as Bond jumps through yet another window , you may feel like yelling , Alan Partridge style , " STOP GETTING BOURNE WRONG ! " ) .
What 's more , the realistic tone struck by Martin Campbell in Casino Royale has taken something of a leave of absence here .
MI6 use flashy , over - the - top Minority Report - style holo - computers , when anyone who reads the papers knows that British intelligence can't even hop in a taxi without leaving their laptop in the back .
Bond , leaping on a bad guy 's bonnet , finds time to fire of a clunky quip before his bullet .
Amalric 's bad guy lurches uncomfortably from believably slimy to ridiculously evil , lunging at Bond with an axe in a final showdown .
Though I hesitate to compare it to Indy 's infamous ' fridge ' escape , the scene where 007 jumps out of a plane without a parachute and survives seems a little too far - fetched even for a Bond movie .
All we ask is for some consistency - this is n't Crank , this is Bond .
This is not a disaster on par with Die Another Day .
In fact , in parts it 's quite watchable - Craig is a magnetic lead , those piercing blue eyes are quite the attention grabber .
Judi Dench , meanwhile , is once again magnificent ; all British reserve , stiff upper lip and frosty delivery ( a low - key scene with M at home , removing her make - up while issuing orders , is perhaps the most disarming in the entire movie ) .
The Bond girls look the part , too , even if Olga Kurylenko ( ticking the boxes marked ' feisty ' and ' headstrong ' ) lacks personality and Gemma Arterton ( Agent Shagwell ) lacks any decent screen time .
On a second viewing , perhaps the topsy - turvy storyline settles a little - a menagerie of accents does mean some important plot points will be missed first time around .
But make no mistake , Quantum Of Solace is a crushing disappointment .
Try as you might , you 'll be unable to invest in any of the characters - now Bond 's heart has been broken , it 's like nothing ever changed and the character exists simply to get to the next location and car chase and gun fight .
It 's a perfectly average action film , certainly better than the last few Brosnan outings .
But when Casino Royale set the bar so high , it 's not acceptable for a follow - up to simply stroll under it .
Once again , Bond finds himself at a cross-roads , standing still , without direction .
So ... what now ?

I 'm going to start a series of detailed posts about the comprehension module .
This is the section that translates a grammar tree into a logical statement .
For this discussion , we 'll be looking at a simplified version of my simplified version of English grammar .
We 'll expand our grammar in future posts .
Since I 've started this post , I 've improved my approach in this area as well , so you 'll be seeing the evolution of this code , with a couple weeks lag time .
It also gives me an opportunity to introduce a bit of Haskell .
I 'll introduce you to Haskell just enough to understand what I 'm doing .
If you want to learn it well enough to use it , I suggest one of these fine This post is written in literate Haskell .
The lines begining with " > " are source lines , everything else is a comment .
You can copy this post to a file and load it into an interpreter if you like .
What I 'm doing here is defining three new types , Sentence , NounPhrase , and VerbPhrase , each with one or more type constructors .
So a Sentence can be constructed with Declarative , a NounPhrase with ANoun , AProunoun , or Name , and VerbPhrase with Verb .
Everything after the type constructor 's name are the types each constructor requires to build a value of that type .
In other code , here 's a rough equivalent to Sentence 's Declarative constructor in a bastard Java - like : So type constructors are like functions that return values of a given type ( but more useful , as we 'll see later ) .
Here we see another syntax for declaring a data type .
It is common to name the constructor for a type the same thing as the type itself when there is only one constructor for that type .
The :: can be read as " has type " , so we can reason that a Word is made of wordString of type String , a partOfSpeech of type PartOfSpeech , and isPlural of type Bool .
Each of these identifiers is a function that can be applied to a Word to get it 's corresponding field .
You 've probably noticed that Haskell is case sensitive .
Actually , the upper / lower case convention I 'm using is n't convention at all ;
It 's required by syntax .
All types and type constructors ( and names of modules , but I 'm not going there ) are required to be uppercase , everything else is must be lowercase .
One last definition .
Here I 'm enumerating the types of speech that I 'm using .
This is the same syntax as before , except none of these have any parameters , and I compacted the formatting .
Now I can build Sentences out of Strings , PartOfSpeeches , and Bools .
As a quick example , let 's quickly build a Sentence representing " I win . " : Tada .
Again , we 're going to take for granted that some other nice module has generated these grammatical trees for us .
We should only be concerned with converting them to logical statements .
First , we define a representation of logical statements .
This representation wo n't describe all logical statements ;
I 've left out constructors that I wo n't be using here to keep things simple .
The [ ] brackets in [ Term ] indicate a list of that type , and the last line defines ID to be a type equivilant to a String .
The deriving statements for Term and LogicSentence tell the compiler to generate a default implementation of a class .
In this case , we want these types to be instances of the Show class so we can convert them to strings and display them on our terminals .
This default necessarily be pretty , as we 'll see later .
We could also have it derive other classes like Read ( to convert strings to the type ) , Eq ( equality ) , and Ord ( ordering , i.e. less than , greater than ) .
Think of derive as saying " You 're so smart , Mr Compiler , I 'm sure you can figure out this on your own .
" Now we can start building LogicSentences .
Here I 've put
And inside backticks to change it from a prefix operator ( like " f " in " f( x , y ) " ) to an infix operator ( like " + " in " x + y " ) .
The braces are back , and again they denote lists . [ x ] creates the list with x as it's only element .
We've arrived at the point where we can work on what we came here to do .
We 'll tackle a bit at a time , starting with converting just the noun phrase to a logical sentence .
Here I 've declared the type of something I 'm calling convertNounPhrase .
All this says is that it's a function that takes a NounPhrase and returns a list of LogicSentece .
The compiler is smart enough that it could infer the type of the function on it's own , but it 's common practice to specify it explicitly .
There are two reasons for this .
First , it serves to improve readability and provides documentation for the author .
Second , it helps to locate compile errors by making sure the compiler arrived at the same type the author intended Haskell is nice and lets us define functions in parts .
Here we define the convertNounPhrase function when given a NounPhrase built with the Name constructor .
This is called pattern matching , and it ' sfor building functions like this cleanly .
Haskell will try each definition of convertNounPhrase in the order defined until a match is found ( if none are found , it throws an exception ) .
Note that name here does n't refer to the NounPhrase built with Name , but the word used to build Name with .
A name , by itself , indicates that there is something that is called by that name .
In other words , our representation of " Adam " is : there exists some x such that called - Adam ( x ) is True .
(++ is the concatenation operator , and strings are just lists of Chars , so that ( " called - " ++ wordString n ) buisness builds strings like " called - Adam " . )
Besides specifying the manner in which a parameter is constructed , we can also place / guards / in our pattern matches .
This definition only matches Nouns built with a Word that satisfy is Plural .
For the moment , we 'll assume that no non-plural nouns without articles ( the , a , an ) are passed by the grammar tree builder .
The case statement draws near !
I wo n't go into the syntax of case ; I 'm sure you can figure out how it works .
Note I 'm leaving out a number of possibile pronouns here in the name of brevity .
We 're getting trickier here .
convertVerbPhrase is a function that takes a VerbPhrase and returns a list of .
These functions each take a Term and return a LogicSentence .
In Haskell , all functions are curried , so I could remove the parentheses from this type definition if I wanted to .
I 'm leaving them in for readability .
Why do we want to return a function here ?
A verb phrase describes an action or relation .
It needs the subject of the sentence to complete it 's meaning .
If I say " dances a jig . " , it 's not a complete sentence ; there is an immediate question of " Who ? " .
It needs the who for the full meaning .
We 'll expand verb phrases soon , but for now , we 'll just deal with a single verb .
This definition shows the syntax for a lambda function : ( \x -> ... ) .
When we apply a term to the result of convertVerbPhrase , that term will be used in place of subject .
Finally , the goal of the post .
This demonstrates a let block .
Those equal signs do n't mean what they do in imperative programming .
That is to say , we are n't evaluating convertNounPhrase np and storing the result as nounSentence , we are declaring that nounSentence is equivalent to convertNounPhrase np .
We could have wrote this function asSo now we need to define subjectOf and combineNVSents , and we 'll be done for now .
Another feature of Haskell 's pattern matching : we can tell the compiler that we do n't care about some terms .
" _ " is a wildcard .
It will match anything for that term .
Note that we do n't have to define subjectOf for all possible Sentences .
We 'll accept a Exception if it 's called for a Sentence it 's not defined for .
We 're careful above to have convertNounPhrase only return these two types of sentences , precisely so this funtion will work .
Nothing new here .
Now we can load this post into a Haskell interpreter ( I 'm using ghci ) and try it out : I win .
Detroit Mayor Kwame M. Kilpatrick , shown in a 2006 file photo , said Thursday he will resigns his post .

DETROIT , Sept. 4 ( UPI ) -- Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick
Thursday pleaded guilty to obstruction and perjury charges , forcing him out of office .
Kilpatrick pleaded guilty to two felony counts , will serve 120 days in jail and pay as much as $ 1 million in restitution .
He also will be required to serve five years probation and agreed not to seek political office during that time .

The deal apparently was reached late Wednesday after prosecutors reduced the proposed jail time by two months , the Detroit Free Press reported .
Kilpatrick initially had been charged with eight counts stemming from a whistle - blower case that cost the city $ 8.4 million and text messages between himself and a lover who was also on the city payroll .
Kilpatrick good - naturedly jousted with reporters before court was called into session , the Free Press reported .
The plea came as Gov. Jennifer Granholm was organizing hearings on whether to remove Kilpatrick from office .
example : cgi , before & after , still life , landscape , people , animals , brands , agencies , photographers , etc. combine different search strings separated with a comma to filter the results .

LLVM contains the letters " VM " , but it 's actually a framework for building compiler backends .
In short , it comes with an instruction set ( immediate representation ) and a backend which optimizes the code and generates native code for a host of platforms ( x86 , ARM , ... ) .
One of the real world uses is in Apple 's OpenGL JIT .
Llvmruby ( llvmruby GitHub repository ) is project by Tom Bagby .
It provides Ruby bindings to LLVM .
Llvmruby is well integrated into Ruby .
For instance , this code adds an add instruction ( codeblock is an instruction builder ) .
codeblock.bin_op( Instruction :: Add , 41.llvm , 1.llvm )
Llvmruby opens Object and adds llvm to turn them into values LLVM can handle .
After following the instructions in the README ( getting and compiling LLVM and compiling llvmruby ) , it 's possible to start experimenting , eg. with irb .
Here a sample session ( with some snippets of code taken from the samples in the llvmruby project ) :
# Set up LLVM >> require ' llvm ' => true >> include LLVM => Object >> m = LLVM::Module.new ( " test_module " ) => ; ModuleID = ' test_module ' # Create a function type - the second argument is the method signature , # ie .
the return type and the types of the arguments #
In this case , there are no return values or arguments >> type = Type::function ( MACHINE_WORD , [ ] ) => #
>> f = m.get_or_insert_function (" test " , type )
=>
declare i32 @test ( )
# Create an LLVMBuilder object which allows to call methods and
# generate instructions
>> builder = f.create_block.builder
=> #
# Create an Add instruction - note how it 's possible to pass regular Ruby Fixnums
>> ret = builder .
bin_op ( Instruction :: Add , 41.llvm , 1.llvm )
=> #
>> fcode = builder.return ( ret )
=> #
>> ExecutionEngine.get ( m ) ;
=> true
# Finally : execute the generated code
>> ExecutionEngine.run_autoconvert(f )
=> 42
For more information on using LLVM , the LLVM Tutorial shows how to implement a JIT for a simple language and more .
Two bigger examples using llvmruby come from Miura Hidek :
regexpllvm : turns regular expressions into LLVM code .
yarv2llvm : takes Ruby 1.9's opcodes ( the 1.9 VM was called YARV before it was made the official Ruby 1.9 VM ) and translates them to LLVM .
It follows in the footsteps of similar projects , such as _why 's Unholy ( translates Ruby 1.9 opcodes to Python VM opcodes ) or HotRuby ( a Javascript interpreter for Ruby 1.9 opcodes ) .
Unlike these projects , llvmruby is tightly integrated with the Ruby 1.9 VM , which offers interesting possibilities .
Regexpllvm shows one possible way of speeding up the execution of code , ie .
compiling a DSL down to LLVM opcodes .
Other systems use this approach , eg. Java 's XSLT implementation compiles XSLT stylesheets to JVM bytecode
Another possibility : compiling Ruby code hotspots .
At the moment , if a piece of Ruby code turns out to be a performance bottleneck , the pragmatic solution is to rewrite it in C ( the idealist 's solution is waiting for the Ruby VM to get a performance boost ) .
With llvmruby , another option is possible : compiling the Ruby code to LLVM , ie .
using yarv2 llvm as a booster .
Whether this provides the necessary performance boost depends on the code , though .
Llvmruby allows to experiment with LLVM without having to touch any C++ and also allows to do so incrementally with irb .
A useful property , eg. for contributors to Rubinius ( the project plans to use LLVM ) to prototype ideas .
The Rubinius team has been busy rewriting the VM in C++ and cleaning up some internals .
This work is currently happening on the CPP branch of Rubinius in the Git repository , which also contains LLVM as an external library .
The C++ branch should soon turn into the master branch .
According to some recent Twitters , Rubinius has regained the ability to run a lot of Ruby code with the new C++ VM .
Eric
Hodel twittered this week
Rubinius ' new vm can now run the core specs without crashing
Evan Phoenix recently reported :
Huzzah !
IRB works again under the new Rubinius C++ VM !
How would you use LLVM with Ruby ?

Pricing tables play an important role for every company that offers products or services .
They are a challenge from both a design and usability standpoint .
They must be simple but at the same time clearly differentiate between features and prices of different products and services .
A pricing table should help users pick the most appropriate plan for them .
A company should carefully examine its product portfolio and pick the most important features to present in its pricing plans .
Visitors should be given only the information they would be interested in : available features , options and costs .
The rule of thumb is : every unnecessary cell in your pricing table increases the probability of losing potential customers , because you make it more difficult for them to compare various plans and select the best one .
Once you have identified the most important features , go ahead and create a more detailed list of features for users who are interested in a particular plan .
Users must know what kind of a product they are spending their money on and all of the features associated with it .
For a good grounding in exactly how to design and present a pricing table , let ’s examine some that other designers have created and analyze them according to the following important criteria :
Design : colors , style , typography , icons .

Best Practices and Guidelines
Designing a pricing table is a tricky task .
A pricing table is a design element that requires the designer to communicate information clearly and precisely , exposing as many features as possible and making it as easy and as intuitive as possible for a user to make the best choice .
1. Communicate not too much and not too little
Intuitively , one would assume that a feature - rich pricing table with dozens of various aspects would make a good impression on potential customers .
However , the more information you provide , the more information visitors need to absorb .
TypePad ( screenshot below ) uses a quite lengthy pricing table .
Although it ’s informative and goes into detail to explain the differences between various plans , it is really hard to scan : users need to remember which plan each column represents .
Furthermore , although the plan titles are mentioned at the bottom of the table , the prices are not mentioned there .
So a user who has landed below the middle of the table will have to scroll to the top to see how much each plan costs .
ConceptShare is an example of a short but concise and visually appealing form .
Notice that the fourth row of the table combines two aspects ( users and reviewers ) in a single row and avoids a fifth unnecessary field .
This is a beautiful and informative pricing table .
Still , it ’s important that your visitors get a good understanding of the differences between different plans .
Communicate not too much and not too little .
If a potential customer walks into your store and wants to know the difference between two specific devices , you would n’t explain the similarities between the devices first , right ?
Communicate the information that your visitors are looking for ; they will be grateful .
This leads to our second point .
2. Communicate differences , not similarities
Instead of focusing on displaying similar features of available plans , communicate the differences between them .
It is often a good idea to visually distinguish between similar features ( available in all plans ) and special features ( available in only some plans ) .
To achieve this , you could place the most distinctive features at the top of the table while leaving the common features at the bottom of the table .
Take a look at eTribes.com ’s pricing table ( screenshot below ) .
The design manages to communicate the differences effectively while conveying additional information .
The choice of icons fits the overall design and supports , rather than distracts , the visitor .
This is effective and user - friendly .
3 . Make the price stand out
Price is the first thing users want to see when they visit a product or service website , and leaving it out is the number one design mistake on B2B and B2C websites .
So , you had better make sure you show it to your visitors as quickly and as clearly as possible .
Font selection usually depends on the type of product or service offered , and it also must be consistent with the overall design .
On many pricing tables , the font size of prices , titles and important headlines are larger and stronger to make them stand out .
As a designer , you need to make sure that the price is given the appropriate weight , both visually and semantically .
It is also a good idea to sort pricing plans by price , from highest to lowest or vice versa .
Because users scan websites in an F - shape , some designers put the cheapest offer on the left side of the table , so that users see it first .
It ’s in designer ’s best interest to make sure that users see the most attractive offer first .
4 . Use visuals sparingly
Unfortunately , many of the designs we are considering in this showcase have one major shortcoming : they use overly vibrant visuals too often and often for the wrong purpose .
Designers try to make pricing plans look as attractive as possible , and , apparently , numerous green check marks and red crosses are supposed to help to achieve this effect .
And if these icons are spread widely across the table , then with each additional feature it becomes increasingly harder for visitors to read the table and identify differences between plans .
Beanstalk communicates its information effectively while avoiding the visual noise .
The support of a feature is indicated by a neutral circle that does n’t distract the eye but conveys the message .
Plans that do not have a particular feature simply do not have a circle in the corresponding cell .
Goodbarry.com uses color to indicate the main details in the table .
Notice how the font - size is used to make the different pricing plans more distinctive .
Also notice how well green is used to animate the visitors into trying out the product .
So , use visuals sparingly and avoid visual noise .
Feel free to use icons if you are sure they are not too vibrant and if they help a user ’s understanding of the table and , more importantly , convey some information .
For instance , a green check mark next to the word “ Unlimited ” does not convey any information .
It ’s important also that icons and thumbnails be extremely useful .
For instance , if a table compares physical products , then thumbnail of those products should be present .
Almost all of the pricing tables we ’ve examined use different background colors to differentiate pricing plans .
Designers use color theory and vivid colors to keep the visitor ’s focus on the specific plan that the company wants the most sales on .
5 . Illustrate the difference vividly
Some designers use illlustrations and vivid images to clearly illustrate the difference between various plans in a memorable way .
Metaphors ( e.g. cartoons ) are used very often .
For instance , if a company is offering the poll service in several various plans , you may want to use a “ lightweight ” box with tools for a lite version and a bigger , larger toolbox for the corporate version .
In fact , that ’s what wany designers do .
6 . Be consistent in your design
All website elements , not only pricing tables , should be consistent with the overall design .
BigFilebox.com makes the mistake of breaking this rule :
The second pricing table ’s design is not consistent with the website ’s whole design .
7 . Do n’t lose your customers
On a product or service website , pricing tables play an important role in making a successful sale .
Pricing tables are the window to a product ; therefore , it is important that they be usable and accessible to everyone .
Pricing tables should support not just modern Web browsers , but all forms of Web browsers , screen readers , etc .
Companies can create pricing tables that are rich in features and effects , but they should make these features unobtrusive for users with browsers that do not have CSS or JavaScript enabled .
This is one example of how a pricing table should look when CSS and JavaScript is disabled :
An example of a pricing table that uses JavaScript obtrusively is on Mailchimp :
If you go to this pricing table and click on the “ View plan details … ” links , you will see a JavaScript accordion effect showing hidden elements .
If we disable JavaScript in our browsers , the links do n’t work anymore .
One solution to this problem would be to show all hidden elements when JavaScript is disabled .
Pricing Table Showcase 2008
Horizontal or vertical ?
Which should a designer choose ?
Either a horizontal or vertical layout is good as long as the plan ’s features are clearly separated ; although there is a strong trend towards column - based ( vertical ) layouts .

Best Practices : Summary
The week 's television highlights as poetry
Writing television listings – hey , it 's a bit like writing poetry , is n't it ?
Well , no , obviously it absolutely is n't , in any way , shape or form , but bear with me because I 'm trying to go somewhere with this , and if you 're not prepared to suspend your disbelief ( and your critical judgement ) for 10 minutes this is going to prove excruciatingly embarrassing for both of us .
So then .
Surely there 's no doubt that writing accurate listings is something of an art form .
Squeezing a precise description of a potentially complex programme into a single sentence is a rigorous test of anyone 's prose skills , and the end result is often more functional than emotive - a mere explanation of events rather than a flavoursome portrayal .
How , for instance , could anyone hope to convey the unique tear - jerking magic of This is My Moment ( ITV1 , Sat , 7 pm ) in just 12 words , without hand signals ?
The answer is this : television listings writers really ought to turn to poetry .
Or , to be more specific , they should write their listings in the form of haiku .
Yes , haiku - the wistful , 17 - syllable Japanese art form that 's as delicate as a bone china teacup and almost twice as beautiful .
What better device to evoke the mood of a broadcast than a five - seven - five formation stanza ?
And so , with this in mind , and in the spirit of wild experimentation , this week , in place of the usual guttersnipe sneering , I bring you art .
I bring you poetry .
Ladies and gentlemen - I bring you the week 's television highlights , as viewed through the winsome lens of haiku .
Do n't snigger .
They 'll be doing this next week in the Radio Times .
Just you wait and see .

i Phone Rideshare App To Cut 73.6 M Tons of CO2 Annually
November 17th , 2008 by Jerry James Stone
In an attempt to save the planet — and possibly just to piss off Canada — the company Mapflow is bringing a ridesharing app to the iPhone .
The app is called Avego and Mapflow hopes it will help save the world .
Hey , they had me at pissing off the Canadians .
[ social_buttons ]
The company hopes to have a user base of 20 million by 2020 .
They claim one of that size could cut greenhouse gas emissions by 73.6 M tons .
That is equivalent to 146 billion less miles driven a year , and nearly 42 % of California ’s 2020 climate protection goal they say .
Well , at least one Ontario will get some ridesharing play .
Oh snap !
The app works by tracking a user ’s driving habits and then matching them up with people looking for rides .
It ’s kinda like Match.com for potential serial killers and would be victims .
Using the GPS - enabled iPhone , the app will track common routes the user takes .
The app then notifies the user of potential victims ..er , riders .
From there the app will suggest a place they can meet .
It will also show a picture of the person so you use a little hot - or - not in your decision making .
The neat part is that would be victims do n’t actually have to have an iPhone .
Which makes sense , since there are only going to be so many people sharing the same route to work .
If you limit it to iPhone users , then you limit how many people you can hack up and go all Jeffrey Dahmer on .
If you are anxious to get the app or if you just like watching clocks count down , you can visit the Avego website for more information on its release .

Consciousness is overrated .
With tiny brains and force of numbers , social insects have achieved most of the things we consider quintessentially human — farming , warfare , air conditioning — and have taken over the world .
Ants alone weigh as much as the planet ’s people , even before you add in bees , wasps , and termites .
When it comes to pollination , composting , hunting , and gathering , these insects do most of the heavy lifting , and long after we have nuked / warmed / polluted / eaten ourselves to extinction , it is likely that they will keep the place ticking just fine .
Renowned sociobiologists and ant experts E. O. Wilson and Bert Hölldobler go so far as to call the most advanced insect societies — like the leaf - cutting ants , which cultivate fungus in air - conditioned nests with their own hygiene and waste disposal systems — “ civilized . ”
It ’s hard to disagree , although these civilizations are more Alien than Star Trek , dark and squishy worlds with buildings made from living bodies or stitched together by workers using silk - extruding grubs as sewing machines .
Communication is mostly by smell , and it is staggeringly efficient :
A milligram of a pheromone that ants use to mark their paths would lay a trail 60 times around the earth .
So what good is a big brain ?
It lets you work out what these social insects do , and why .
Hölldobler and Wilson have done more than most in this regard , and their books — this is the follow - up to their Pulitzer Prize–winning The Ants , from 1990 — are landmarks , yielding huge rewards to anyone willing to tackle the scientific basics .
These guys make you proud of your own lumbering species .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation Tuesday that lifts a longstanding ban on offshore oil drilling , opening most of the U.S. coastline to exploration .

The package proposed by Democrats would give states the option to allow drilling between 50 and 100 miles ( 80 and 160 km ) off their shores .
Areas more than 100 miles from the coast would be completely open to oil exploration and drilling .
The House voted 236 to 189 in favor of the package .
Until recently , Democratic leaders in Congress strongly opposed lifting the moratorium on offshore drilling , saying drilling would have only a small impact on gasoline prices in the immediate future .
But as gasoline prices rose to levels above $ 4 a gallon this summer , public opinion shifted in favor of offshore drilling .
Republicans made removing the ban on drilling a key campaign issue for their party in this election year .
With the moratorium facing expiration on September 30 and voter sentiment changing , Democrats supported repealing the ban as part of a larger energy package .
House Republicans , however , strongly protested the Democrats ’ package , calling the bill a “ sham ” and a “ hoax . ”
The bill faces a possible veto from the White House .
“ At a time when American families are in need of genuine relief from the effects of high fuel prices , this bill purports to open access to American energy sources while in reality taking actions to stifle development , ” the White House said in a statement .
Opponents of the bill say since the bill does not include a revenue sharing plan , states will not have an incentive to open their coasts to exploration .
Another complaint is that the requirement that drilling occur at least 50 miles away from the U.S. coast closes a great deal of the outer continental shelf where oil may be located .
Democrats countered that their package would open 319 million acres to 404 million acres off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts to drilling .
“ This legislation is a result of reasonable compromise that will put us on a path to energy independence by expanding domestic supply , ” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
Conservation groups blasted the House bill , however , for not protecting the environment .
“ As it stands , the clean energy provisions in this bill are dwarfed by the push for outdated , dirty and expensive energy , ” said Natural Resources Defense Council President Frances Beinecke .
Later this week , the Senate is expected to take up energy legislation that would expand offshore drilling , but not as much as the House .
Both chambers would have to reconcile differences between their bills before a final energy package could be sent to the White House to be signed into law .
Time is running out for lawmakers to pass legislation as Congress is scheduled to adjourn on September 26 .
Other provisions in the House energy package include :
-- Selling 70 million barrels of light crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve , to be replaced with heavy crude oil .
-- Offering renewable energy and efficiency tax credits that would be funded by repealing some tax breaks for the oil industry .
-- Allowing oil shale development in some western states , if the states approve .

WHEN RAGE Against the Machine played their first show in seven years at last April 's Coachella Festival , it invoked the wrath of none other than Ann Coulter .
Within days of their comeback , the archconservative pundit was on Fox News denouncing comments made by front man Zack de la Rocha as " violent " and " hate speech , " before labeling the group " irrelevant . "
Though it may be easy to chalk the segment up to Murdoch - fueled bluster , it also showed that Rage was doing something right .
In an era where bands reunite merely to cash in on empty nostalgia ( for example , Smashing Pumpkins ) , Rage Against the Machine have returned as their rabble - rousing selves .
The past year and a half have seen them put action behind words much as they did before their breakup in 2000 .
They have spoken out for immigrant rights , publicly allied themselves with Iraq Veterans Against the War ( IVAW ) , and most recently played shows for protesters at both the Democratic and Republican National Conventions .
The band has rediscovered creative and political confidence that fits these tumultuous times perfectly .
This fall has also seen the group 's two most politically outspoken members release material from their own projects .
Guitarist Tom Morello has released a second album under his acoustic alter ego , the Nightwatchman , and De la Rocha has released One Day as a Lion , his collaboration with former Mars Volta drummer John Theodore .
If music tells us something about the time we live in , then Rage 's ability to find roots today signifies a shift that this country has n't seen in a long time .
Rage Against the Machine ( Penner )
There 'll Be No Shelter Here
When asked why Rage was reuniting in early 2007 , Morello responded , " Is it a coincidence that in the seven years that Rage Against The Machine has been away that the country has slid into right - wing purgatory ?
I think not . "
It would be easy to paint this as a statement of supreme arrogance -- as if the political future of a country was tied to the actions of one single rock band .
But recent polls suggest the U.S. populace has tilted leftward in a big way .
Two - thirds of Americans believe that the government should provide universal health care for all its citizens .
The war in Iraq is opposed by almost 60 percent of those polled , who think U.S. troops should leave as soon as possible .
And with the specter of global recession looming , 62 percent of Americans blame the government 's failure to regulate the banks and mortgage companies and are unhappy that taxpayers have to foot the bill .
This is a far cry from the state of the country in October 2000 when Rage called it quits .
The knee - jerk nationalism and dollar - store flag - waving that came in the wake of 9/11 generated a climate largely intolerant of criticism .
These were hard years for anyone of radical or even progressive political stance .
Rage Against the Machine 's
Web site was shut down by the FBI for a few days and every song in their catalog was banned by Clear Channel in the wake of 9/11 the attacks .
Since the midterm elections in 2006 , though , Americans ' anger and dissatisfaction with the Bush administration 's mismanagement has grown .
And the Democrats ' inability to do anything about Iraq coupled with the continuing plummet in Republican credibility has sent growing numbers of young people toward radical ideas and activism .
These shifting political winds made it clear that is was only a matter of time before Rage would be swept into the maelstrom again .
Out of the Wilderness
It appears that nobody felt the sting of Rage 's disintegration more than Zack de la Rocha .
While the other three members embarked on the successful but notably apolitical Audioslave , De la Rocha all but faded into the background .
He made only a few occasional public appearances at union rallies or benefits and released a song here , a song there .
He made a solo album that was never released .
A few guest appearances were all that the talented lyricist could seem to muster .
De la Rocha discussed these wilderness years with Ann Powers in a recent Los Angeles Times interview
When I left Rage ... first off , I was very heartbroken , and secondly , I became obsessed with completely reinventing my wheel .
In an unhealthy way , to a degree .
I kind of forgot that old way of allowing yourself to just be a conduit . "
With One Day as a Lion , the first thing one notices is how un -Rage it sounds .
John Theodore 's drumming is a free - flowing opposite to Rage drummer Brad Wilk 's hard hip - hop - influenced beats .
( De la Rocha describes Theodore as a mixture of John Bonham and Elvin Jones . )
The fuzzed - out keyboards , played by the De la Rocha , have a three - chord simplicity to them that is more punk than anything else .
The lyrics , though , are trademark De la Rocha .
On the title track , he draws a connection between poor kids in LA and the people of Iraq :
We comin ' like peoples army
For the people who can't eat
Who work with no sleep
For the child with no shoes on their feet ...
Tear mics till my voice get raspy
Faced flame for five centuries
And if L.A. were Baghdad we'd be Iraqi !
The EP displays how De la Rocha himself has been emboldened by the shifting political climate .
He described the impetus behind the EP 's opener , " Wild International , " to Powers :
The name speaks about a generation of people , a kind of development that I feel .
It 's an intuition about people who are n't going to be so concerned about elections to get what they need .
And whose politics are n't going to revolve around a bourgeois morality .
Their interests are going to be focused on food and housing and justice and revenge .
Brave words ?
Undoubtedly .
And words that could easily be dismissed as radical jargon .
But it 's plain that De la Rocha does n't take them lightly .
The Black Robin Hood
Tom Morello has n't exactly been out of the spotlight like De la Rocha has .
Audioslave sold five million albums and toured internationally .
His political opinions found lower - profile outlets , like his internet radio show Axis of Justice , with System of a Down 's Serj Tankian .
Morello would n't inject politics into his music again until 2003 .
The guitarist put aside his amps and effects pedals in favor of a cheap secondhand acoustic and developed a style of agit - folk in the vein of Joe Hill , Woody Guthrie , Phil Ochs and Joan Baez .
Dubbing himself the Nightwatchman , he released One Man Revolution in April 2007 , five days before Rage 's reunion show at Coachella .
Morello has brought an impressive amount of outspoken bravado to the project .
" The Nightwatchman is the Black Robin Hood of the 21st century , " he declared to MTV , " a reaction against illicit wars , against first strikes , torture , secret prisons , spying illegally on American citizens ... and it 's a reaction against a few corporations that grow rich [ off ] this illicit war while people beg for food in the city streets . "
While One Man Revolution featured very little apart from guitar , the occasional harmonica , and Morello 's deep baritone voice , the follow - up , The Fabled City , incorporates percussion , organ , piano , steel guitar and violins .
It 's a much more raucous album , a ramshackle call to arms for those battered by the past seven years .
Morello 's lyrics evoke Dylan 's finger - pointin ' songs and Tom Joad - era Springsteen , weaving stories of outcasts stuck between fallen movements and the uprisings of the future .
He likens the generals of Guantánamo to " The King of Hell , " prays for the flood waters of Katrina to drown the president , and channels the spirit of the true believer in " Whatever it Takes " :
Flood waters raise the ramparts
I 'll meet you now wherever you are
I 'm here until the frontline breaks
Whatever it takes
The Microphone Explodes
If there was any doubt that the reunited Rage would be as committed as in their previous incarnation , it was put to rest at recent rallies .
As thousands marched in the streets demanding an end to war , inequality and poverty , Rage were among a diverse array of musicians and artists who performed to show their solidarity .
Not mere entertainment , these bands were seeking encourage and galvanize the protesters .
In Denver , at the Tent State Music Festival to End the War , they performed for more than 10,000 people .
Halfway through their set , Rage brought onstage members of Iraq Veterans Against the War , who after the show led a march of thousands to the convention center to demand a meeting with Barack Obama .
In a recent interview , IVAW member Phil Aliff stressed the importance of having a group like Rage allied with them :
The Rage Against the Machine concert is a good example of how to use political music strategically .
From the beginning , when the performers started talking about GI resistance , there was n't much of a response , but by the end , people were fired up and ready to go .
At the Republican Convention , protests were characterized by almost constant clashes with police .
Activists , journalists , even regular passersby were sometimes subject to the heavy - handed tactics of the St. Paul Police Department .
Rage 's music seemed to complement the chaos on the streets , as well as the unity that the protests showed in the face of riot gear and tear gas .
When police shut down the Ripple Effect festival after Anti-Flag 's set , Rage Against the Machine , who were expected to play , went up sans instruments , and De la Rocha addressed the crowd :
The reality is we 're just four musicians from Los Angeles who have used our voices and our talent and our musicianship and our words to stand up against these unjust policies .
And why the fuck are these cops so afraid of us ?
Are they afraid of us ?
Nah , they 're not afraid of four musicians .
They 're afraid of you ! "
From there , Morello and De la Rocha launched into an a cappella - - yes , a cappella -- version of " Bulls on Parade . "
With armed cops waiting to pounce , the two used a megaphone to perform , with Morello half - singing - half - beatboxing the song 's iconic " wow-wow - chika - wow - wow . "
De la Rocha 's speech during the Republican National Convention ( the band performed in Minneapolis during the convention ) speaks to the power that a social movement has on artists and musicians .
Not only are they back , but they have thrown themselves onto the frontline of protest and activism .
Where this volatile mixture of anger , hope and glimpses of protest goes is anyone 's guess .
In a country whose youth are quickly shifting to the left , to say Rage Against the Machine will find an audience is an understatement .
They may find something much more powerful : a movement .

Last year I wrote about how to profile your Rails application , which is a lot harder then it seems .
Its not so much the profiling itself – its easy enough to create one - off results .
Instead , its coming up with a reproducible process that lets you measure performance changes over time .
Some things that do n’t work over the long term :
Insert profiling code into your application code
Use unit tests for profiling
Use functional tests for profiling
Use integration tests for profiling
Modify standard rails environments ( test , development , production for profiling )
So the latest version of ruby - prof introduces a new approach to profiling your Ruby or Rails code that is heavily based on the excellent work Jeremy has done on the request profiler included in newer versions of Rails .
The basic idea is to extend Ruby ’s TestUnit library so that individual test cases are profiled by including a new RubyProf : : Test module .
When you include this module , ruby - prof will run each test once as a warm up and then ten more times to gather profiling data ( using another new feature of the 0.7.0 release , the ability to pause and resume a profiling run ) .
Profile data is then output for each test .
Let ’s look at an example :
class ExampleTest < Test :: Unit :: TestCase include RubyProf :: Test def test_stuff puts " Test method " end end
The line include RubyProf : : Test turns the test case into a profiling test case .
The same approach could be used for hooking into other testing frameworks – all patches are of course welcome !
Using a Profile Environment for Rails
Now lets talk about profiling Rails .
There are two main issues that make it harder then it seems .
First , to get any useful data you need to profile a Rails app using the production environment settings in conjunction with a test database .
Using the development environment does n’t work because the time it takes Rails to reload classes on each request drowns out any useful information .
Second , how should profile tests be written and where should they go ?
The solution I ’ve adopted is to use functional like - tests that use a PROFILE environment , and place them in a directory called test / profile .
Let ’s look at another example :
require File.dirname(__FILE__ ) + '/../profile_test_helper ' class MyControllerTest < Test :: Unit :: TestCase include RubyProf :: Test fixtures : my_fixture def setup @controller = MyController.new @request = ActionController:: TestRequest.new @response = ActionController :: TestResponse.new end def test_get get ( : index ) end end
The only difference between a functional test and a profile test are the inclusion of the RubyProf : : Test module and loading profile_test_helper.rb.
profile_test_helper is unfortunately needed because the standard test_helper.rb file Rails uses loads the TEST environment .
Hopefully future versions of Rails will fix this by allowing greater flexibility in specifying a test environment .
So to get started with profiling your Rails application :
Copy profile_test_helper.rb from the ruby - prof distribution to your rails test directory Modify profile_test_helper.rb as needed to set ruby - prof ’s output directory Create a profile.rb file in the environments directory Update your databases .
yml file to include a profile database ( just map it to your test database )
Create a new directory test / profile Start writing profiling tests that look similar to the above example
And now you ’ll have reproducible profiling tests cases .
So what ’s missing ?
A way of keeping track of how your applications performance changes over time .
A quick hack is to use source control to keep profile tests results around .
A more sophisticated solution would be to use ruby - prof ’s API to dump profile results into a database and then put a nice web front end onto it .
Any takers ?
When David W. Keith , a physicist and energy expert at the University of Calgary in Alberta , gives lectures these days on geoengineering , he likes to point out how old the idea is .
People have been talking about deliberately altering climate to counter global warming , he says , for as long as they have been worrying about global warming itself .
As early as 1965 , when Al Gore was a freshman in college , a panel of distinguished environmental scientists warned President Lyndon B. Johnson that carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) emissions from fossil fuels might cause “ marked changes in climate ” that “ could be deleterious . ”
Yet the scientists did not so much as mention the possibility of reducing emissions .
Instead they considered one idea : “ spreading very small reflective particles ” over about five million square miles of ocean , so as to bounce about 1 percent more sunlight back to space — “ a wacky geoengineering solution , ” Keith says , “ that does n’t even work . ”

Racy period drama ' The Tudors ' brings “ shame ” on the BBC with its “ ignorance ” of the facts , one of Britain ’s best - known historians has claimed .
David Starkey , who specialises in Henry VIII and the Tudors , told an audience at Cheltenham Literature Festival the TV series was “ terrible history ” and that most of the costume “ was Elizabethan ” .
Answering a question on what he thought of the film ' A Man For All Seasons ' ( about Henry VIII ’s lord chancellor Sir Thomas More ) , Starkey said : “ It ’s terrible history but at least it has a point .
“ ' The Tudors ' is terrible history with no point .
It ’s wrong for no purpose .
I ’ve got no problem with getting history wrong for a purpose – Shakespeare often got things wrong for a reason .
“ But it ’s the randomised , arrogance of ignorance of ' The Tudors ' .
Shame on the BBC for producing it .
But saying that , my front cover is cribbed directly from it ! ”
He added : “ Most of the costume is Elizabethan . ”
Earlier in the presentation , about his second book on the much - married monarch , Starkey said Henry VIII was identical to Tony Blair in the way the older man was completely different from the younger .
He said : “ There was a wonderful exchange in the early days between Tony Blair and William Hague .
The selected year was 1987 .
“ Hague went through a list where Blair had changed his mind ( since then ) , on things like public ownership and unilateral disarmament , and found Blair losing his temper with this deplorable catalogue .
“ He said ’ Come on , do you believe everything you believed in in 1987 ?’.
“ Hague , with characteristic brilliance , much good it did him , replied ’ Do you believe anything you believed in 1987 ?’.
“ He ( Henry VIII ) is Blair .
He flips , he somersaults .
You ’ll find scarcely anything that young Henry believed that old Henry believed .
“ The young Henry would have burned the old Henry .
What was acceptable and what was unacceptable was completely reversed over the course of 20 years . ”
Assisted suicide is illegal in many countries Swiss charity Dignitas has gained a worldwide reputation for helping people wth chronic diseases to end their lives .
Since it was founded in 1998 , it has helped hundreds of people from across Europe to commit suicide .
This includes more than 110 people from the UK , the first of who was Reg Crew , in January 2003 .
The organisation was founded by Swiss lawyer , Ludwig Minelli , who runs it as a non-profit organisation with the motto : " Live with dignity , die with dignity " .
WHAT THE LAW SAYS Assisting a suicide carries a maximum sentence of 14 years imprisonment in England and Wales None of the UK cases handled by Dignitas has so far involved any criminal charges , but many have resulted in police investigations Several European countries have no crime of assisting a suicide : Switzerland , Netherlands , Belgium , France , Germany , Sweden and Finland
It takes advantage of Switzerland 's liberal laws on assisted suicide , which suggest that a person can only be prosecuted if they are acting out of self - interest .
The law on suicide actually states : " Whoever lures someone into suicide or provides assistance to commit suicide out of a self - interested motivation will , on completion of the suicide , be punished with up to five years ' imprisonment " .
Dignitas interprets this to mean that anyone who assists suicide altruistically cannot be punished .
Its specialist staff all work as volunteers to ensure there can be no conflict of interest .
They engage in detailed discussion about whether the patient 's determination to die falls within the legal boundaries , and whether it is indeed the declared will of the patient .
Dignitas also provides a text for patients , which states their wish for assisted suicide in terms which cannot be misconstrued and which allows them to carry out their wishes even in the face of opposition , if necessary .
Once the decision has been made , the patient travels to Zurich where he or she is taken to a Dignitas flat .
The patient is given an anti-sickness drug 30 minutes before the lethal dose of barbiturate .
Controversy OPINIONS ON SUICIDE LAWS
It is ... absurd that on an issue so crucial attitudes are increasingly determined by a private clinic in Switzerland .
The Times ' leader article
This law is designed to protect the weak and the vulnerable from unscrupulous family members .
The Telegraph 's leader article A camera is set up to record the patient take the drug themselves - firm evidence that it was not administered by clinic staff .
The barbiturate is a colourless solution , bitter tasting , and comes in a portion like a small glass of sherry .
The dose is three times the normal lethal amount required , based on the patient 's weight .
The patient drinks it and then may take a sip of orange juice .
Within five minutes they lapse into a coma , and the heart stops soon afterwards , apparently leading to a peaceful and painless death .
The police are then called , a coroner comes , they question the witnesses and look at the video .
In his first broadcast interview for five years , Mr Minelli told the BBC earlier this year that he was motivated by helping people .
Please turn on JavaScript .

" I say suicide is a marvellous possibility given to a human being ... to escape a from situation which is unbearable . "
But the group 's activities have stirred up controversy .
Swiss politicians have voiced concerns about the organisation 's interpretation of the law .
Despite this , Dignitas has insisted it is right and has even called for the law to be clarified for the healthy partners of dying people .
Dignitas has also been criticised for accepting people who are not necessarily terminally ill .
It helped 23 - year - old Daniel James commit suicide last year after he was paralysed while playing rugby .
The handling of such cases has prompted resignations by staff at the clinic .
UK mental health charity Sane said Dignitas was offering a " seductive but dangerous solution to the feelings of anguish and hopelessness experienced by some people with mental illness " .

Microsoft recently applied for and received Patent # 7,415,666 .
Microsoft has just patented the functions of two keys that are on every keyboard that is manufactured on this planet – Page Up & Page Down .
Seriously .
This patent was originally filed in March 4 , 2005 and was awarded August 19 , 2008 .
This clearly shows how broken and dysfunctional the patent system really is .
Maybe someone should quickly run and apply for a patent on Backspace – It is without doubt one of the most widely used keys on any keyboard !
Or maybe Ford should patent the steering wheel or gas pedal ?
Maybe I could patent the process of typing a Blog !
Here is a excerpt from the actual patent Microsoft was recently awarded :
Method and system for navigating paginated content in page - based increments A method and system in a document viewer for scrolling a substantially exact increment in a document , such as one page , regardless of whether the zoom is such that some , all or one page is currently being viewed .
In one implementation , pressing a Page Down or Page Up keyboard key / button allows a user to begin at any starting vertical location within a page , and navigate to that same location on the next or previous page .
For example , if a user is viewing a page starting in a viewing area from the middle of that page and ending at the bottom , a Page Down command will cause the next page to be shown in the viewing area starting at the middle of the next page and ending at the bottom of the next page .
Similar behavior occurs when there is more than one column of pages being displayed in a row .
Maybe it is because the patent offices are over worked , or maybe the internal processes they utilizes just need some serious revamping .
None the less , the situation is broken and needs to be addressed .
How about Patent # 5,443,036 - a method for exercising a cat with a laser pointer .
Or Patent # 6,960,975 - a space vehicle propelled by the pressure of inflationary vacuum state , which clearly defies the currently known laws of physics .
And the GOP Takes Their Voter - Suppression Efforts to an Unprecedented New Level ...
Brad Friedman Byon
10/25/2008 , 4:29 pm PT
Robert Greenwald 's Brave New Films has put together this short film about what 's really at the heart of the GOP 's ACORN " voter fraud " scam ( appx. 5 mins ) ...
Our own special coverage page of the GOP's ACORN " Voter Fraud " Scam is here ...
The film above quickly notes the GOP 's nearly identical efforts to swiftboat ACORN in 2000 and 2004 , we should point out that today , those same folks are not only doing it again in 2008 , they are now sending out private investigators to intimidate voters in NM .
And more incredibly , taking the White House politicization of the U.S. DoJ to an unprecedented new level , George W. Bush himself has now asked the DoJ to " investigate " the OH GOP 's allegations of some 200,000 voters after the case was recently rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court .
Further , while the piece above is not bad , it looks like they forgot to include John McCain 's own statement to ACORN , when he was their keynote speaker at a 2006 rally , and told the assembled volunteers they were " what makes America special . "
That short video follows below as a reminder ...
We 've all heard talk of the efficiency of the free market .
You know , as the idea goes , companies will only do what customer - citizens want them to do , because if they do n't , customers will sanction the companies by not buying from them .
There are all sorts of reasons why this does n't work , of course , including the fact that companies lie to customers and hide information from them so that buying decisions do n't actually reflect the truth about the companies .
But then there is the failure of the market to take account of what are called " externalities . "
An externality is a cost of a product or service that is not included in its price .
For example , the price of coal from a strip - mine does not include the health - care costs of all those who drink water tainted by the mine or the costs of destroyed natural beauty or the costs of compromised ecological systems or the costs in carbon emissions produced by burning the coal .
If the market was truly " efficient , " and the price did contain those " externalized " costs , coal may not be so cheap and people may not choose to buy it .
So this is a market failure .
In the case of coal , the market is not " efficient " at all .
But there is another sort of externality , I realized today , a " positive " externality .
I was talking to a friend over lunch about how deadeningly unsatisfying it must be to work in a plastic razor factory .
Imagine knowing that you were working to make things that your employer has deliberately designed to be thrown away .
You know , like your livelihood did not depend on people valuing and treasuring what you made , but on them thinking that what you spent your life producing was absolute trash .
Because the plastic razor industry only survives if people throw away their old razors and buy new ones .
I said to my friend at lunch , what if those same razor factory workers spent their hours producing some sort of gadget that , for example , helped bring fresh drinking water to the billion people on the planet who do n't have access to it .
All things being equal -- pay , employment conditions , working hours -- would n't the factory workers be happier because they would know they were doing something that really helped ?
And my friend said , " Yes , but how do you incentivize that ?
How do you make the market reflect that sort of meaning and purpose in jobs ? "
In other words , meaning and purpose and the feeling that your work is worthwhile is another " externality " - - a beneficial one -- that the market fails to take account of .
Economic indicators do n't tell us whether people love their work and feel they 're doing good in the world .
In fact , the main economic indicator , GDP , goes up if more people get cancer because it means doctors and hospitals are getting more money .
So what I 'm trying to say here is , how crazy is it that we run our culture based on " economic indicators " at all ?
How crazy is it that we do n't do what we know to be best -- economic indicators be damned ?
We know that blowing the top off a mountain to get coal and that burning the coal to cause global warming is not good for anyone .
We know that putting people to work helping people in the developing world get fresh drinking water is better than making throwaway razors .
Do we really need " free market signals " to tell us that ?
Why do we need to include externalities in prices before we do what we should ?
We can't we just accept that economics are not the be all and end all and just do what is right ?
BEIJING -- China unveiled an economic stimulus program it billed as totaling $ 586 billion , aiming to bolster domestic demand and help avert a global recession .
Though the two - year package appeared to include some previously announced measures , its size was clearly designed to revive the fading confidence of Chinese businesses and consumers , and impress foreign governments .
Asian shares rallied sharply early Monday on the Chinese announcement , with benchmark stock indexes in Tokyo , Hong Kong and Shanghai all jumping close to ...
When it comes to computers , you want it all : the portability of a laptop , the extensibility of a desktop , as well as the sleekness of Mac OS X and the wide selection of software for Windows .
After virtualizing and dual - booting Windows on my MacBook Pro for well over a year , I 'm done — done with slow virtual machines and " your hard drive is low on space " messages , done with having to switch gears to move from one OS to another .
There 's software and hardware I 'm invested in that simply works better on a PC over a Mac ( and vice versa ) and I want it all at my fingertips every day .
When you want to move between the two operating systems fluidly and get the full benefit of both a laptop and a desktop , a few techniques can marry your Mac notebook and PC desktop to live and work in harmony .
Here 's my current setup .

Share a Single Keyboard and Mouse Between Two Computers with Synergy
Advertisement
Adam 's already run down how to control multiple computers using the Synergy KVM software , which is a fabulous way to save space on your physical desktop by only using one keyboard and mouse for your notebook and desktop .
With Synergy you can also share your clipboard between machines , and seamlessly move your pointer from one screen to the other .
One update to that article : The SynergyKM download for Mac is now here ( the original host is MIA ) .
In the Mac notebook / PC desktop scenario , you also only need one computer monitor , because your laptop screen serves as the second monitor .
Share Your Speakers Between Computers
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
Once you 're committed to having two computers up and running , you 've got to decide which gets your speaker hookup , right ?
Not necessarily .
With a $ 5 audio splitter and a male to female stero cable , you can hear the sound from both your Mac and PC out of the same speakers .
I 've got the splitter plugging into my Mac 's audio out jack , and my speakers plugged into one input , with the stereo cable plugged into the other — and into my PC 's sound card .
Set Up a Fast IP - Over-FireWire Network Connection
Advertisement
Since you 're going to be sharing your mouse and keyboard — as well as your data — over the network between your computers , you want the fastest connection possible .
If your Mac and PC both have FireWire ports and you 're running Windows XP , you can set up a fast , one - wire IP over FireWire network between them .
This is totally optional , of course , because most likely both machines are on the same local network .
But IP over FireWire will offer a much more stable , wired , and speedy connection for working with files on the other computer than a wireless connection .
Decide Where Your Data Lives — Then Map Your Drives
Advertisement
The tricky part about running two machines at once is figuring out where your data should live ( unless you have a NAS or central server , but that 's beyond the scope of this setup , which is simply one tower and one notebook ) .
Much of this has to do with how much hard drive space you have where , and what files you want to be able to take with you when you go .
The big space hoggers for me are my music collection and my photo collection .
My music I want to take with me when I travel , so that stays on the Mac notebook .
My photo archive can stay at home , under my desk , so that 's going on my PC tower 's hard drive .
( I also greatly prefer Picasa for photo management than anything I 've seen on OS X. )
It should go without saying that both machines should have automated local and remote backups going on .
( I 'm using Time Machine on the Mac , SyncBack on Windows , and Mozy Home on both ) .
Once you 've figured out what data lives where , share your drives between computers so you can work with what you 've got from either machine .
Here 's how to access your Mac 's files on your PC , and your Windows files on your Mac .
What 's Better on OS X versus Windows and Vice Versa
One can't make a holy - war - starting , controversial statement like " some software and hardware is better on the PC or Mac " without backing it up .
The following is just my opinion , plus a few software licenses and gadgets I invested money in on either platform .
Your reasons for wanting both Mac and Windows may differ from mine , but here 's what I 'm using on each .
On the Mac : NetNewsWire , Quicken ( purchased a license ) , Quicksilver , Time Machine , GeekTool , and DevonThink ( purchased a license ) are all superior pieces of software to their Windows counterparts , as far as I 'm concerned .
My Fujitsu ScanSnap for Mac and the built - in iSight are also two peripherals I 'll only use with the Mac .
On Windows : I greatly prefer Digsby , Picasa , Chrome , SnagIt ( purchased a license ) , and EditPlus ( purchased a license ) to their counterparts on my Mac .
Preferences aside , there are also scads of Windows - only software you see day in and day out on these pages , including Windows - only portable apps ( like the Firefox 3.1 beta portable version ) that makes having Windows access a must .
On both Mac and Windows : Obviously Synergy is required to share the keyboard and mouse between systems , so it 's installed on each .
I 'm also using the same KeePass database ( stored on the Mac , accessed on the PC ) , and todo . txt file from both systems .
With a notebook / tower setup like this , you can travel and have all your files with you , but still get the horsepower and extensibility you need at your desk .
If your job requires that you use Windows ( like mine ) , but you still want your Mac , this alliance is also a great option .
How do you marry your Mac and PC ?
Any tips for dual - computer users ?

Microsoft CEO
Steve Ballmer has never been shy about voicing his opinions on any given issue .
At an interview conducted during a recent Churchill Club event in California , Ballmer chose to weigh in on Apple and the iPhone , and even gave the company some friendly advice .
According to CNet , Ballmer 's specific " advice " to Apple was to make the company more like Microsoft , a move that would apparently give Apple a fighting chance in the smartphone market .
The iPhone sales numbers have been quite good so far , but in this case , Ballmer is talking about market trends over time .
He 's expecting Apple to do poorly in both the smartphone and notebook markets over the next five years , mostly because the company continues to stand by its rather un-Microsoft - like integration of both proprietary software and proprietary hardware .
Ballmer seems to think that the future of the smartphone lies in providing a phone OS to a wide variety of hardware manufacturers .
He said that only Symbian , Linux , and Windows Mobile are positioned to meet this need .
The core of the argument is essentially that divorcing the hardware and the OS allowed Microsoft to take control of the computer market , and since Microsoft could do no wrong , Apple had better get on the bandwagon fast .
If you 're curious about Ballmer 's full statement , you can find the video of the interview on ZDnet .
Somehow , I doubt that Steve Jobs will be taking Ballmer 's advice any time soon .
Apple has , however , moved to separate mobile OS X and desktop OS X , so such a move might be possible in the future .
Still , it wo n't happen in the next five years , that 's for sure .
The 10 Greatest Floating Heads of All Time Oct. 10 by Dave Rudden
For something that 's probably scientifically impossible , works of fiction sure seem to make the living disembodied head commonplace .
The following ten heads have floated to the top of our hearts .
10 - The Wizard from The Wizard of Oz
While the Wizard 's status as a floating head can be disputed , what with it being a camera trick carried out by a bodied fat dude behind a curtain , the Wizard 's place in movie history can be disputed .
By showing the disparity in fear produced by a floating head and a normal guy , future scribes learned a valuable lesson .
Floating heads are scary .
9- Zordon from Power Rangers
While Zordon may very well be another projected head , a la The Wizard of Oz , his role in aiding groups of teenagers in spandex cannot be denied .
Do you think kids with the ability to pilot giant dinosaur robots would take orders from a floating body ?
I think not .
8- Namakubi from Zombie Nation
Namakubi was just your standard disembodied samurai head living a normal life in 1999 .
When the living meteor Darc Seed plunged to earth and reanimated the population ( and the Statue of Liberty ) as zombies , someone ( not somebody ) had to save the world .
Namakubi took that step from samurai head to superhero to return the world to normalcy in Zombie Nation .
7- Morte from Planescape Torment
As far as comedic - relief floating heads go , you can't beat Morte , who has been designed for maximum laughs .
A normal floating head ?
Good for a few chuckles .
A floating skull ?
Kinda creepy .
A floating skull with eyeballs who expresses desire for almost every woman you encounter in your quest ?
Hilarious .
6- Sun Baby from Teletubbies
The Teletubbies have amazing powers .
They have a secret language that can speak only to children and stoners , as well as televisions in their stomachs that can be used to hypnotize the two groups .
Of course , there has to be some sort of higher power giving the orders .
A sun with the image of a baby 's head is more than crazy enough to be their leader .
5- Andross from Star Fox
Star Fox , an SNES flying game that was one of the first major titles to feature a polygonal world , was rife with impressive visuals making use of the new 3D effects on the 16 - bit system .
While the game featured plenty of large weaponized vehicles and ships , the developers knew only a truly magnificent and boxy enemy could ably conclude Fox 's quest .
Enter Andross , a giant face with the ability to shoot squares out of its mouth .
Future titles provided arms and a body for Andross , but we 'll never forget his original , face - only form .
>4- Frylock from Aqua Teen Hunger Force
As the leader of the Aqua Teen Hunger Force , Frylock is a floating head to be reckoned with .
Some may dispute his status as a floating head , stating that he has french fries for arms .
To that I say , the fries are his hair , stupid .
Hair he can pick up stuff with .
3- Al Gore 's head in a jar from Futurama
Even though Futurama 's featured dozens of important 21st centurions re-animated in glass jars , the most notable of the bunch has to be former presidential election popular vote winner Al Gore .
In the 30th century , the politician finally found a land to lead , serving as the first emperor of the Moon .
He 's still going on about global warming , though .
2- Sinistar from Sinistar
Sinistar truly earns its status as the best evil floating head .
He 's in space , for one , and his diet seems to solely consist of spaceships .
Also , the fact that he can speak , but only via seven terribly rendered sound clips makes him immeasurably scarier than any evil head that can speak perfectly .
1- Jambi from Pee Wee 's Playhouse
Jambi earns his place at the top of this list due to his amazing powers in spite of severely limiting factors .
Being confined to a box without anything but his head , Jambi is able to grant any of Pee Wee Herman 's weird - ass wishes by simply chanting a bunch of gibberish .
Jambi's also able to grab
Pee 's attention ahead of talking chairs , cows , clocks , and Lawrence Fishburne , which shows the true nature of his strength .
For that , he is truly a floating head among floating heads .

Pavements are fast disappearing in the city Hundreds of people in the south Indian city of Madras ( Chennai ) are to walk for the " rights of the pedestrian " .
Organisers say walking is becoming one of the most hazardous and difficult activities in this city of 4.3 m people .
Almost 1,200 people die in road accidents every year and nearly 50 % of them are pedestrians .
Madras has 1.6 m cars and two - wheelers and as their numbers continue to grow , a huge drive has started to widen the existing roads and build new flyovers .
' Walkathon '
" We want to reclaim the spaces which are rightfully ours , which have been taken over for road widening projects , " says Anusha Hariharan , a co-ordinator with the Madras - based group Walking Classes Unite .
The group has organised a " walkathon " from Marina Beach to the Foreshore Estate Open Grounds , a distance of 6.5 kms ( four miles ) , on Sunday afternoon .
" We hope to raise public awareness about the rights of the pedestrians , cyclists and those who use public transport because they have to use the roads , " Ms Hariharan says .
In the absence of pavements , people have to walk on streets Madras is not a modern - day city .
Established in the 17th century by India 's British rulers , it has developed into a major industrial and administrative hub straining under a creaking infrastructure .
The city is the capital of the southern state of Tamil Nadu .
Over the years , the public transport network of Madras has not kept pace with the growth of the city 's population .
So anyone who can afford to has bought private vehicles .
The past decade of rapid economic growth in the country has seen the number of professionals and middle classes multiply .
The easy availability of car loans - admittedly a little harder to come by in these days of credit crunch - has seen more and more vehicles being added to the roads every day .
" Chennai roads and lanes are narrow .
And pavements and footpaths have become a casualty in a bid to accommodate the ever - growing number of cars , " says Ms Hariharan .
This puts pedestrians , cyclists and users of public transport at grave risk .
" Children , the elderly and the disabled face the maximum risk as they are forced to navigate roads without footpaths or pedestrian crossings , " says Venkat , another co-ordinator at Walking Classes Unite .
" Billions of rupees are spent on building new flyovers and road widening projects , but pavements remain ill - maintained and totally neglected .
In many places they are unusable , " he says .
' Frightening '
The group says only 19 % of Chennai 's population uses private cars , but they take up nearly 75 % of the road space , .
The vast majority of people are dependent on public transport , but their share of road use has been steadily shrinking .
Pedestrians say they feel unsafe in Chennai " We want wide and well - maintained footpaths , we want pedestrian crossings , we want dedicated cycle lanes , we want to reclaim spaces which were originally ours , " says Ms Hariharan .
That is music to the ears of Bharti , a computer professional in Chennai .
" It is frightening to be a pedestrian on Chennai 's roads , " she says .
" Pavements should be there for people to walk .
But here , people are not able to cross the road easily , we have to wait for long to cross to the other side . "
Pavements in most areas simply do n't exist , she said .
" T - Nagar is a busy market area , it 's generally very crowded , there is heavy traffic , but there are no pavements .
So you have to walk on the road along side the traffic .
It is scary . "

What are these ?
The following is an excerpt from " What Matters , " the latest book by " Day in the Life " series creator David Elliot Cohen .
For more information , see whatmattersonline.com
Capitol Steel is a major polluter of the Beijing area and a heavy coal user .
For a long time -- the first 15 years that we knew about global warming and did nothing -- there were no pictures .
That was one of the reasons for inaction .
Climate change was still " theoretical , " the word that people in power use to dismiss anything for which pictures do not exist .
It is the reason we do n't see shots of coffins coming back from Iraq ; it 's the reason the only prison abuse we really know about was at Abu Ghraib .
Without pictures , no uproar ; not in a visual age .
But now the pictures have started to come , and they will not cease .
Some show people : airlifted off the roofs of their houses in New Orleans ' Lower Ninth Ward in the mad wake of Katrina , staring at their houses crumbling into the sea on the Alaskan coast , watching their graveyards flood on South Seas islands .
Some show the massive power of nature , made more massive by our injection of chemicals into the atmosphere : walls of flame crashing up Southern California hillsides , enormous waves breaking over Mississippi seawalls .
Some are almost clinical : the bathtub rings around drying reservoirs as evaporation takes its course .
And some have the stately , cold precision of the really big view : the satellite pictures , for instance , that show the steady melt of the sea ice above the Arctic Ocean .
( They are like the before - and - after pictures from some makeover gone horribly wrong , the beautiful world disfigured by some out - of - control plastic surgeon . )
I think that these pictures -- many of them taken by Gary Braasch , who has chronicled this crisis more relentlessly than anyone else with a camera -- will someday be the iconic images of our decade , even more than the shots of the Twin Towers aflame , because they presage the images we will spend this century viewing -- on our screens , and out our windows .
They are the opening shots of a movie that will keep playing , with horrible relentlessness , for all our time on earth .
Hear Braasch describe his photos in an audio slideshow »
It 's possible we 'll have more terrorist attacks -- but it is not possible that they will pose the same threat to our civilization and to our planet as the steady horror now unfolding in what we used to call the natural world .
This is what the earth looks like now .
Some things , of course , do n't show up in pictures .
To really understand what 's going on , you need a split screen .
On one side , there would be Tuvaluans in their sinking shacks , Bangladeshis in their flooding paddy fields , Inuits on their crumbling shores ; on the other side , some Ford , GM and Toyota ads for monster SUVs .
When we say that this is a man-made crisis , we do n't mean all men .
We mean those of us , of both genders , who inhabit the rich world -- Americans make up 4 percent of the population but produce 25 percent of the world 's carbon dioxide .
Even the Chinese , who have begun to burn lots of coal , can't compare -- that country 's emissions matched ours in the past year , but there are four times as many people there .
And we 've been doing it for a hundred years .
This one 's on us .
You would also need a picture that somehow sums up the forces that keep us from doing anything about climate change .
A stack of forty billion one - dollar bills 10,856 miles high might do -- that 's how much profit ExxonMobil made in 2006 , more profit than any other corporation in the history of corporate profits .
It takes but a small fraction of that haul to buy the political juice that keeps Congress from acting responsibly .
But there are other iconic images emerging too , and some of them are much happier .
Take the wind turbine , now the universal symbol for a future of green progress : those huge blades spinnin slowly against the Danish countryside , the German hills , the North Sea coast -- maybe soon against the backdrop of Cape Cod or the ridges of Vermont , if the opposition can be overcome ( opposition rooted at least in part in an old set of iconic images of " unspoilt nature " ) .
The breeze made visible , in a giant white wheel slowly turning from past to future .
And better yet are the pictures that show people rallying to the planet 's defense -- a kind of immune system finally starting to kick in , hopefully before the sickness is too far gone .
I 've been thinking a lot about pictures like that , as I 've made the transition from writer to activist .
In early 2007 , six college kids and I decided to see if we could launch a large - scale protest movement in the United States .
We set up a Web site , stepitup07.org , and started sending out e-mails asking people if they would organize protests 12 weeks hence .
We had no budget and no organization , but we soon found a deep stratum of people across America haunted by global warming and eager to do something about it .
Before many weeks had passed , they had organized 1,400 separate rallies in all 50 states , the biggest day of grassroots environmental protest since the first Earth Day in 1970 .
We thought long and hard about how to make the most effective use of those rallies .
And our answer was : pictures .
We asked every organizer to upload a photo of their rally to our Web site before the big afternoon was out .
And we encouraged them to think in visual terms .
By nightfall , we had a collage of images from across America .
There was an underwater demonstration off KeyWest -- scuba divers hoisting signs in front of a coral reef that , like all its cousins around the world , will be destroyed unless we can bring the heating of the seas under control .
In lower Manhattan there were thousands of people in blue shirts holding hands and forming a " sea of people " to show where the tideline will fall across some of earth 's most expensive real estate once seas start to rise .
On the glaciated peaks of the far West ( which wo n't be glaciated much longer , as Braasch 's pictures here make clear ) , alpinists made multiday ascents and then skied down in formation , webcasting as they went .
There were pictures from church steps and farm fields , California beachfronts and Louisiana levees , young people , old people , people of all kinds .
In fact , one of the very best pictures actually arrived at our Web site weeks early .
It came from the Alpha Phi sorority chapter at the University of Texas at Austin , and it showed 180 sorority women -- with the broad smiles one would expect of Lone Star lasses -- holding a sign with our demand : Step It Up Congress : Cut Carbon 80 % by 2050 .
They attached a note to the bottom : " We wanted to show it was n't just the hippies who cared . "
That was both sweet and insightful .
It 's hippies who start things -- the kind of people who see the change that 's needed a little earlier than the rest , who do n't require the photographic proof in hand to start thinking subversive thoughts .
But it 's sorority chapters and
Chambers of Commerce and evangelical congregations who finish things off , move them into the political mainstream where they can't be ignored .
These are steadier folk , and they rightly ask for some evidence -- evidence that we now can provide to all in great abundance .
Al Gore 's documentary , " An Inconvenient Truth , " provided the first of those images to really make a deep impression , but now they appear every night .
It 's why polling shows that 70 percent of Americans understand the problem and want government to act .
It 's the reason there 's some hope .
But that hope sits uneasily against the scale of the problem .
This is a social issue unlike any other we 've ever faced .
It 's not like the civil rights movement , much as we need a campaign as morally urgent and as passionate as that great uprising .
The civil rights movement knew it would triumph -- it knew it would go through hell , but it knew it would emerge .
As Martin Luther King Jr. said almost every time he spoke , " The arc of the moral universe is long , but it bends toward justice . "
He knew eventually they 'd win .
But we do n't have eventually .
We have only now .
Our greatest climatologist , James Hansen , has given us eight more years to reverse the flow of carbon into the atmosphere , or else soar past the red lines that guard , among other things , the stability of the great ice shelves above Greenland and the West Antarctic .
( If you want to imagine pictures of the future -- well , there 's 25 feet of sea level rise in the ice above Greenland alone .
Twenty - five feet ! )
Can we change that fast ?
It 's not at all clear that we can .
In fact , the one thing that is clear is this : the next few years are a kind of final exam for the human species .
Does that big brain really work or not ?
It gave us the power to build coal - fired power plants and SUVs and thereby destabilize the working of the earth .
But does it give us the power to back away from those sources of power , to build a world that is n't bent on destruction ?
Can we think , and feel , our way out of this , or are we simply doomed to keep acting out the same set of desires for MORE that got us into this fix ?
At some level , the answer depends on our imaginations .
We can and will dream up new technologies -- we already have the windmill and the solar panel and the bicycle , all of which would help immensely .
But we need a picture in our minds of the world to come -- a picture that shows a world more balanced , less careening .
A world of farmers markets and trains , a world where 10 percent do n't live high and 90 percent live low .
A world almost , but not quite , beyond imagining .

Ann Summers , the sex shop chain , has pulled thousands of novelty chocolate products from its shelves and website after tests revealed they were contaminated with the industrial chemical melamine .
The Food Standards Agency issued an alert over chocolate willy spread , a related nipple spread and a novelty pen set , which contains a chocolate - flavoured body pen , all of which were imported from a Chinese manufacturer called Le Bang .
Food safety experts detected levels of melamine were up to 100 times greater than limits set by the European commission .
Milk products contaminated with melamine have been at the centre of a health scare in China , after a number of children died from baby formula laced with the chemical .
European food safety officials have imposed strict checks on food products arriving from China that contain milk products .
Any found to have more than 2.5 milligrams a kilo must be destroyed .
Tests on the Ann Summers products found levels up to 259 milligrams a kilo .
The FSA said the withdrawal was precautionary and the risk was low .
" This is a first .
We 've never had to put out an alert before on willy spread , chocolate - flavoured or otherwise , " it added .
Ann Summers said : " As a responsible retailer we have tested all of our chocolates and even before the FSA alert was issued had taken all relevant steps to remove the chocolate willy spread product that could be affected by this issue . "

It is a weekday afternoon in Moscow 's most luxurious shopping arcade .
In the Dolce & Gabbana store - with its chandeliers , black mirror walls and stainless steel D&G logo - a young man is trying on a leather jacket .
" It 's known as the David Beckham , " a shop assistant explains helpfully .
The jacket , lined with racoon fur , costs a mere € 10,000 ( £ 8,000 ) .
" We 've sold two in the past week , " he adds - proof , it seems , that the global financial crisis has so far not daunted Russian capitalism .

And yet something strange is happening in Russia - the country that invented the word oligarch back in the 1990s to define a new kind of state - connected entrepreneur .
Nobody quite agrees what exactly oligarch means ; these days it has become a loose synonym for Russia 's super - rich .
But in the new post - credit - crisis world everyone can concur on one thing - that Russia 's oligarchs are in trouble .
Over the past five months , according to the financial news agency Bloomberg , Russia 's wealthiest 25 individuals have collectively lost $ 230 bn ( £ 146bn ) .
Tycoons like Oleg Deripaska - Russia 's richest man and friend , we now know , of British politicians - have seen their fortunes vaporised .
On paper , Roman Abramovich , the Chelsea FC owner , has suffered a $ 20.3 bn wipeout .
Alisher Usmanov , the Arsenal shareholder - tycoon has lost $ 11.7bn , Bloomberg estimates .
Analysts say that private jets could soon be going for bargain basement prices , while some super - rich are scrambling to sell off their villas in Sardinia and Surrey .
In Moscow , elite nightclubs have relaxed their strict entry rules - there are n't enough customers .
The capital 's top restaurants , meanwhile , have stopped accepting credit cards .
Not that Russia 's oligarchs are in the mood for entertaining .
Since hosting Peter Mandelson and George Osborne on his yacht in Corfu this August , Deripaska has slithered into a classic Westminster political scandal .
The aluminium magnate 's British - related woes do not stop there : a former business partner , Michael Cherney , is suing him for $ 4bn in the high court .
Rumours suggest he 's even been forced to lay off his servants .
A spokesman said Deripaska does not comment on private matters .
The twilight of the oligarchs is closely linked to the meltdown in Russia 's stock market .
Since May , Russia 's RTS index has lost 71 % of its value .
It is no secret that Deripaska borrowed money from western banks using shares in his companies as collateral .
The share price crashed ; the banks then asked for their cash back .
Deripaska is now in danger of being sucked into a black hole of debt .
Others have money stuck in Iceland .
Is , then , the era of the oligarch now over ?
Not everyone agrees with this thesis .
But it does seem that Russia 's rich are experiencing a moment of historical catharsis .
After a giddy decade characterised by the acquisition of yachts , football teams , villas in Kensington , west London and the South of France , and even submarines , there is a distinct sense that Russia is moving into a different , more chastened , epoch .
" My stocks were worth $ 1bn .
They 're now worth $ 300 m .
OK .
So what ? " says billionaire Alexander Lebedev , sitting on a brown leather sofa in his comfortable three - storey Moscow townhouse .
Lebedev , a Russian businessman and former KGB agent unkindly nicknamed the spy who came in for the gold , is unperturbed by his loss of fortune .
Until recently , he had $ 3.1 bn - and was 39th on Forbes ' list of Russia 's top 100 billionaires .
" It does n't make any difference to my life , " he says .
Lebedev is also a former deputy in the Duma and a member of Russia 's beleaguered intelligentsia .
He says he has survived the crisis that has been aggravated by Russia 's war in Georgia better than many of his peers .
They took generous loans from Russian banks , bought shares , and then took out more loans from western banks against the value of these shares - a pyramidal arrangement that is now collapsing .
Asked how Russia 's oligarchs are bearing up , Lebedev is almost puckishly cheerful .
He says : " They are suffering . "
He adds : " I think material wealth for them is a highly emotional and spiritual thing .
They spend a lot of money on their own personal consumption . "
Lebedev is a patron of the arts and last week met Tom Stoppard , John Malkovich , and Kevin Spacey to discuss a new Chekhov festival in Crimea , Ukraine .
In general , he is scathing of oligarchs as a class - describing them as a bunch of uncultured ignoramuses .
" They do n't read books .
They do n't have time .
They do n't go to exhibitions .
They think the only way to impress anyone is to buy a yacht , " he observes .
Does he think the crisis might make Russia 's elite reconsider their arguably solipsistic lifestyle and values ?
Lebedev thinks not .
" [ Friedrich ]
Nietzsche once said that when something does n't kill you it makes you stronger .
But it is n't applicable in this case , " he says .
Most oligarchs were not very interested in social injustice , he points out .
This spring Forbes magazine estimated that Russia has 110 billionaires - a record .
The top 100 had a combined wealth of $ 522bn - almost four times higher than in 2004 , it said .
( At the same time 18.9 million Russians live below the poverty line , federal statistics suggest . )
According to Lebedev , some members of this exclusive list - known as the golden 100 - are now down to their last $ 100 m , the über - rich equivalent of skid row .
" Worst hit are the property developers , " he says .
But in these troubled times analysts suggest that those more likely to feel the pain are Russia 's second - tier rich - the country 's 150,000 to 200,000 or so millionaires , who have acquired their wealth on the back of Russia 's unprecedented economic growth under eight years of Vladimir Putin .
Tasteless bling - or pafos to give it its Russian name - is likely to be frowned upon in the new , austere post - crisis era , they add .
" One of the legacies of this is that it will be unacceptable for Russians who have money to throw it around in the way they did before this crisis , " suggests Chris Weafer , an analyst with the Moscow - based brokerage UralSib .
" People wo n't have it any more .
Or they will consider it unwise to display it , " Weafer says .
Inevitably , the amount of Russian money ' " loshing around " the west end of London will diminish , he adds .
One Londoner , who sources properties for Russian buyers and did not want to be named , said there had been an exodus by Russian businessmen from London in recent weeks .
" A lot have gone home to fight [ financial ] fires due to the plunge in the Moscow stock market , " he said .
But Elena Norton , who runs the Russian desk for London estate agent , Knight Frank , said there had been more activity from Moscow - based buyers : " I have seen an increase in the market .
Potential buyers all read the newspapers and they know there has been a correction in London house prices and they seem keen to take advantage of that . "
Others think that the big losers will not be London 's flashy sushi bars but Russian 's struggling lower classes .
" If my net worth is $ 10bn and it then falls to $ 1bn it is still probably unlikely that I will have to go out to the bread line tomorrow .
So these oligarchs will still be quite well off .
But that does n't mean Russia will be unaffected .
What we should look at is how all of this will affect the blue - collar or lower - income classes , " says Marshall Goldman , a Russia scholar at Harvard University .
So far it 's not clear what impact the crisis will have on Russia 's love affair with consumer spending .
Last year Muscovites spent $ 5bn on luxury goods - $ 1bn more than New York .
At Tretyakovsky Passage - Moscow 's boutique - lined shopping street - the number of customers appears to have dipped , though not by much .
Outside Gucci , a driver kipped yesterday in a black seven - series Mercedes ; nearby someone had parked their giant Hummer jeep on the pavement .
The Dolce & Gabbana store had just reopened after a refit ; upstairs , near the colourful handbags and £ 400 platforms , a black - suited waiter hovered with champagne glasses .
The store had new VIP rooms for exclusive clients , fashion director Vincent Francis said , adding that he was confident the latest range of " short , sexy " party frocks - costing € 3,000 to € 10,000 each - would fly off the rails before Christmas .
For a few , then , Russia 's wild capitalist party is n't quite over yet .
" I 'm not worried about it .
I have my husband to worry about that , " said Tatyana Nekrasova , 24 , her blonde hair tied into a neat bun , as she emerged from Gucci clutching an 11,000 - rouble shirt .
She admitted , however : " I have a lot of friends who have investments .
They 've lost them .
They 're in a state of shock . "
Next month Moscow hosts its annual Millionaire Fair - a four - day extravaganza of diamond - encrusted mobile phones and other examples of bad taste .
Other items on sale include Gulfstream jets , space - age pianos , and mahogany - panelled yachts , which might appeal to Peter Mandelson .
Yesterday the fair 's organiser Yves Gijrath , a Dutch entrepreneur , said he was optimistic the show , held in a giant exhibition hall outside the capital , would be popular again this year .
Russia was not the first country to suddenly acquire wealth and a newly moneyed elite , he said .
" It 's the same historical situation for any new economy , " he said , pointing to the US in the 1950s , Saudi Arabia in the 1970s and Japan in the 1990s .
The world 's economy was " elastic " and would recover , he predicted , adding : " In its entire history the world has never been as rich as in 2008 .
There 's enough money to go round .
The problem is trust . "
Paradoxically , Russia 's often - surreal ride from communism to capitalism appears to be going full circle .
Under Boris Yeltsin a small , favoured group of businessmen was allowed to acquire the country 's newly privatised assets at auctions for a fraction of their real value .
Last week Putin offered a $ 50 bn state loan to Deripaska , and other cash - strapped oligarchs , struggling to pay back debts to the west .
In effect , the Kremlin is poised to renationalise many of Russia 's strategic industries .
Nobody is in any doubt as to what befalls oligarchs who disobey the Kremlin .
In 2003 Putin arrested Russia 's then richest man , Mikhail Khodorkovsky , and broke up his Yukos oil empire .
Khodorkovsky was convicted of tax evasion ; his real crime was to seek to influence politics and to challenge the president .
The former tycoon is serving eight years in a Siberian jail and was recently placed in solitary for not sewing properly .
Russia 's oligarchs , of course , deny that they are in a financial hole .
Abramovich 's aides insist his $ 20bn losses are fictitious rather than real , since he does n't intend to sell his shares in mining and gold .
Usmanov , a football nut who owns 24 % of Arsenal FC , cast his troubles in a more lyrical vein .
Asked whether he might be tempted to sell Arsenal , he told the Guardian last week : " My love for Arsenal is like that of a man for a woman .
It is not something you can sell . "

Talks between Morgan Stanley and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group are expected to continue late into Sunday night .
The Japanese bank had promised to inject $ 9 billion in exchange for a 21 percent of Morgan Stanley .
Those basic terms remain largely in place , although the structure of the investment is changing to give MUFG a better dividend and lower conversion price .
Both sides have sought reassurances that the Treasury Department will not swoop in and wipe out equity investors
Here 's a basic rundown of the latest reports .
The Treasury is not currently expected to make a direct investment along side MUFG .
It is expected to make suportive noises and provide reassurances that a future government capital injection wo n't wipe out MUFG 's investment .
Under the terms of the deal being worked out tonight , all of the investment from MUFG would be in preferred shares .
Originally , one - third of the deal was for common shares .
The preferred would have a 10 percent annual dividend , the New York Times reports .
The conversion price of the preferred shares bought by MUFG is being renegotiated .
The Wall Street Journal reports that it could come down to the low $ 20s from $ 31 .
George Soros has an op -ed in the Financial Times that Morgan Stanley needs to be rescued by the U.S. government .
The Federal Reserve and the Treasury fear that an additional $ 9 billion investment may not be enough to keep Morgan Stanley afloat , according to a person with knowledge of the matter .
Indeed , the Treasury drew up plans to recapitalize Morgan Stanley late last week .
But it appears as if Morgan Stanley and MUFG have prevailed upon the Treasury to hold off on further investments .

And I have to admit it may have even been a little educational .
I know I learned at least one thing from " Ralph's Potted Meat " -- Ralph is a fucking dick .
Not surprisingly , I 've come up with a little slogan the peeps who handle Potted Meat Marketing can use ( no charge , as always ) : POTTED MEAT FOOD PRODUCT : Made By , For , And With Assholes .

During my regular morning call to McCain headquarters to see what ’s up for the day , an aide told me we would finally see Joe Wurzelbacher – Joe the Plumber – appear with John McCain .
McCain ’s entire closing theme is based on Wurzelbacher ’s curbside encounter with Barack Obama over taxes .
But Joe ’s never been to a McCain rally .
About halfway through McCain ’s first speech in Defiance , Ohio , however , I realized Joe was n’t there .
I called the aide I had spoken with in the morning , who told me that in fact Joe was n’t going to be there after all .
Unfortunately , no one told the candidate .
As I was hanging up the phone , McCain started to yell for Joe , who he thinks is in the crowd .
“ Joe ’s with us today .
Joe , where are you ? ” McCain called the into the crowd , “ Where ’s Joe ?
Is Joe here with us today ?
Joe , I thought you were here today ( pause )
All right , well , you ’re all Joe the plumber , so all of you stand up and say – I thank you . ”
Ooops .
It was an awkward moment .
McCain aides called it a “ miscommunication , ” but once I got on the bus I called Wurzelbacher myself and asked him what really happened .
He told me that he had hoped to come to the morning rally , but that no one from McCain ’s campaign ever called him back to confirm ,
Bigger ooops .
He said he had heard McCain yelled for him and he was n’t there , and Joe was “ not happy about it . ”
It turns out , as soon as camp McCain realized the error , they sent a car for Wurzelbacher and raced him to hook up with McCain ’s bus caravan , which was making its way across Ohio .
Shortly after 2 pm in a sunny , picturesque town square in Sandusky , Ohio , McCain was speaking to a crowd under a Gazebo and called Joe ’s name .
This time , he answered .
He jumped on the stage , and the crowd went wild .
“ All right guys , I did n’t prepare anything .
The only thing I ’ve been saying is just to get out and get informed .
I mean really know what you ’re talking about when you ’re talking about it , ” Wurzelbacher bellowed .
“ Do n’t take everyone ’s opinions .
I came to my own opinions by research .
Get involved in the government .
That way we can hold our politicians accountable and take back out government .
It ’s all ours . ”
The only problem is that McCain started to speak before those of us in the press traveling with him got in ...
and many of my colleagues in TV and print missed the joe moment .
Afterwards
Joe worked the ropeline , shaking hands and signing autographs for voters there to see McCain .
And now Joe is doing something those of use in McCain ’s traveling press corps have n’t been allowed to in months .
He ’s riding the Straight Talk Express …as we followed behind .
By the next stop in Elyrie , Ohio , camp McCain seemed to have finally worked out the kinks .
Joe finally , explicitly endorsed McCain .
" Vote for a real American , " he told the cheering crowd , " John McCain . "

Meeting new people can be hard .
Making new friends can be even harder .
Especially , if you ’ve just moved to a city , or have limited free time to go out and socialize .
In today ’s digital age , however , there are easy and efficient ways of making new friends .
In this article , we ’ll be highlighting the best apps to meet people , so you can stop feeling lonely and start socializing with new ( and potentially lifelong ) friends !
Best Apps to Meet Friends
When you think of social apps , the first thing that comes to mind is most likely Tinder , Hinge , or one of those other dating apps .
But there are actually many apps designed for friend - making and connecting people with similar interests and hobbies .
Here are some of the best friend - making apps for smartphones that you should try out :
MeetUp
If you ’ve just moved to a new city or are in need of a different batch of friends , MeetUp is a great starting place .
What separates this app from other friend apps is that it ’s centered on making group friendship connections rather than individual ones .
MeetUp makes it easy for you to regularly connect with a group of people who have similar interests , such as writer ’s clubs or running clubs .
What ’s better is that meetup is free and easy to use !
All you need to do is download the app , create an account , pick your city , and identify your interests to quickly find relevant meetups in your area .
Atleto
Are you an athlete or someone who enjoys sporting activities ?
If so , you may want to try out Atleto , an app centered on connecting people with athletic interests .
With Atleto , you simply select the sports you ’re interested in , and then request to join any scheduled games or sporting events happening in your area .
In no time , you ’ll be able to go on long runs with new friends , participate in organized sports games , and have athletic friends to regularly spend time with .
Squad
Looking for a new squad or to become better friends with friends of friends or mutual acquaintances ?
Then download Squad !
This app works by allowing users to create friend groups that they can add people to for socializing .
With Squad , you can quickly see what your friend group is up to , and easily send group messages to members at any time .
This is a great way to get quickly introduced to a big pool of potential friends and to leverage existing friendships to build new ones .
Bumble BFF
Bumble no longer only entertains romantic relationships–it ’s now a great place to build new friendships .
The concept of Bumble BFF is n’t too different from typical Bumble .
You swipe right on people you ’d like to go on a friend date with and then chat and schedule friend dates from there .
And who knows , maybe that friend connection will turn into a romantic one !
Chatlines
Not exactly sure what you ’re looking for , whether that be a new friend , casual date , or lifelong partner ?
Chatlines may be a great place to start !
This website provides users with a fun , safe , and convenient way to connect with people over chatlines .
It ’s great for people who may not be looking to meet in person just yet , or who do n’t have the time to do that because of their busy schedule .
Tinder Social
Like Bumble , Tinder has introduced a new experience designed to create friendships .
You swipe right on the people you think you ’d be good friends with , and left on those you do n’t , just like standard Tinder .
What ’s great about Tinder social is you can connect with people of either gender , so you can have a more diverse friend pool .
With this app , you can easily meet new people and quickly plan social outings together .
You can also meet other new and interesting people who are moving to town and looking for friends just like you .
Vina
If you ’re a lady looking to make female friends , Vina is a great app to go ( sorry guys , this app is strictly for women ) .
Vina ’s mission is to build a community of women who can support and inspire one another and empower strong female friendships .
Vina matches you with women who have the same job , hobbies , or interests as you so that you can meet people you ’re more likely to connect with .
Real
One of the biggest criticisms of dating and social apps is that they prioritize physical appearance over everything else .
Real is the exception .
This app has users swipe on personality and interests , not appearance , so users do n’t actually know what the other person looks like until they ’ve matched .
This app also does n’t allow you to set gender or sexuality preference options , as it defeats the purpose of the app , which is to create a community of more openminded individuals .
Real is a great app for people who are over superficial connections and who care more about what the person is like than what they look like .
Meet My Dog
Have a dog ?
Well , that just may be your ticket to making new friends !
Meet My
Dog is an app designed to help people meet other dog - owners .
On your profile , you share details about and photos of you and your dog and check in whenever you ’re visiting a local dog park .
This app makes it easy to schedule group doggy dates and send private messages to people you ’d like to know better .
It ’s also a great way to get insights from other dog owners on things like vet or park advice .
And even if you do n’t make friends , you ’ll have access to cute dog pics , and who does n’t love cute dog pics ?
CLIQ
Did you just move to a new city with a significant other , or do you have another friend who is also looking to make more meaningful connections ?
If so , check out Cliq !
This app asks you to select some topics you ’re interested in and then suggests friend activities and events to check out based on your selection .
This app also has a “ Huddle ” feature , which lets you privately chat with members of your click .
You can also share group photos , videos , and updates , so you can all stay connected .
Final Thoughts on Friend Apps
Making friends can be hard , but it does n’t have to be !
With these apps to meet people , you can and should feel empowered to get out there and meet people with similar interests as you !
If you try out these apps , you ’ll have new friends in no time .
Have you tried out any of these friend apps ?

A Lake county , Indiana , superior court judge yesterday ordered early voting sites in heavily Democratic cities Hammond , Gary and East Chicago to remain open in a decision that could affect the presidential election in the battleground state .
In her decision , Judge Diane Kavadias Schneider dismissed complaints from local Republican officials trying to block the sites on the grounds they violated local election rules and created a risk for voter fraud .
Since local Republicans first sought to close the sites two weeks ago , the case has drawn attention from the presidential campaigns of both John McCain and Barack Obama because Indiana is a swing state .
" This is one of a dozen - plus legal actions that our campaign is paying attention to , " said Ben Porritt , a spokesman for the McCain - Palin campaign .
" Most importantly , the goal of our campaign is to ensure that all eligible voters have an opportunity to vote , and their votes be counted .
We obviously back early polling locations , as long as they are done according to state law .
While we disagree with this decision , we will continue to monitor any further legal action that takes place . "
Yesterday 's ruling was hailed by Democrats because it means more voters in a heavily Democratic region of Indiana have easier access to the polls .
In the past , voters had to go to Crown Point , roughly 24 miles ( 38.6 kilometres ) away from East Chicago , to cast early ballots .
" Early voting has been a great success so far in Lake county .
Thanks to Judge Kavadias Schneider 's ruling today , thousands of Indiana voters had their rights protected and the opportunity granted to take part in early voting , " said Jonathan Swain , the Indiana spokesman for Obama 's campaign .
" No matter which candidate or which party they are voting for , all Hoosiers who are eligible to vote deserve the right to have their voices heard in this critical election . "
Schneider was appointed by the Indiana supreme court to preside over the case brought by John B Curley , chairman of the Lake County Indiana Republican Central Committee , and Jim B Brown , a member of the Lake county board of elections , and others .
The plaintiffs alleged that early voting sites in the three cities should not have been opened because there was no unanimous vote by the Lake county board of elections approving the locations .
Attorneys from the other side said no unanimous vote was needed by the election board because the three locations - one in each city - are in government offices and not " satellite " voting sites .
The election board must give unanimous approval for a satellite voting site .
Closing the sites would disenfranchise poor and minority voters , the same attorneys said .
" The decision is a complete victory for voters , " said Jonathan Weissglass , an attorney who represented some of the groups fighting to keep the sites open .
" People in Gary , Hammond and East Chicago : it 's very difficult for them to get to Crown Point .
There 's not good public transportation .
People do n't have cars or time to make a trip to Crown Point . "
R Lawrence Steele , an attorney representing the plaintiffs , was not available for comment on yesterday .
ST . LOUIS 
There was the feel of a political world turned upside down on Saturday as Senator John McCain found himself defending North Carolina and Virginia , while Senator Barack Obama was greeted by huge crowds in Missouri , which Republicans had also considered safe just months ago .
Mr. McCain has escalated his attacks in recent days , all but accusing Mr. Obama on Saturday of being a socialist and saying his rival ’s tax plan would turn the Internal Revenue Service into “ a giant welfare agency . ”
Mr. McCain , Republican of Arizona , attached the politically charged word “ welfare ” to Mr. Obama for the second successive day .
For his part , Mr. Obama depicted Mr. McCain , who favors extending tax cuts for wealthier Americans , as removed from the reality of the hard times descending on the nation .
Mr. Obama , Democrat of Illinois , gave a striking sign of his electoral muscle when he arrived here and journeyed to the Gateway Arch on the Mississippi River .
He saw 100,000 people spread out before him , a vast turnout in a state that teeters between the Republicans and Democrats .
A security guard for Joan Rivers testified Monday that music producer Phil Spector was ejected from two of the star 's Christmas parties for brandishing a gun and declaring that all women should be shot .
Vincent Tannazzo , a retired New York City police detective who now occasionally works for Rivers , testified that Spector at a party turned toward a woman leaving and said , " I ought to put a bullet in her head right now . "
He also said Spector was " ranting " and that he used an obscenity to describe women .
" He kept saying ( the obscenity ) over and over again , " Tannazzo testified .
" He was out of control .
He was just yelling over and over again . "
Spector is being retried on charges of murdering 40 - year - old actress Lana Clarkson , who died of a gunshot in Spector 's mansion in 2003 .
The jury in Spector 's first trial deadlocked last year on a 10 - 2 vote with the majority favoring conviction on second - degree murder .
Tannazzo testified Spector repeatedly used the word at two holiday parties a year apart and that Spector said , " They all deserve a bullet in their heads . "
He said he did n't know whether Rivers was notified of the incidents but her manager Dorothy Melvin , who was dating Spector , asked Tannazzo to eject Spector from one Christmas party .
Melvin is one of five women set to testify about Spector 's past use of guns and threats to women , some more than 30 years ago .
Her testimony was expected later Monday .
Defense attorney Doron Weinberg attacked Tannazzo's account , saying Tannazzo changed the dates he had given for the incidents when he testified at Spector 's trial last year .
Tannazzo said he could n't remember what years that the parties occurred .
He said he worked for Rivers for seven or eight years and still does occasional work for the TV personality .
For the second time during the retrial , Weinberg called for a mistrial , saying that the prosecution 's focus on incidents in Spector 's past had turned the trial into a character assassination rather than an examination of the facts .
He said Spector should not be judged on five incidents occurring over more than 30 years .
But Superior Court Judge Larry Paul Fidler said he was allowing the women 's testimony " for a very limited purpose , " which he would explain to jurors later .
Do you find it odd that so few economists foresaw the current credit disaster ?
Some did .
The person with the most serious claim for seeing it coming is Dean Baker , the Washington economist .
I saw it coming in general terms .
But there are at least 15,000 professional economists in this country , and you ’re saying only two or three of them foresaw the mortgage crisis ?
Ten or 12 would be closer than two or three .
What does that say about the field of economics , which claims to be a science ?
It ’s an enormous blot on the reputation of the profession .
There are thousands of economists .
Most of them teach .
And most of them teach a theoretical framework that has been shown to be fundamentally useless .
You ’re referring to the Washington - based conservative philosophy that rejects government regulation in favor of free - market worship ?
Reagan ’s economists worshiped the market , but Bush did n’t worship the market .
Bush simply turned over regulatory authority to his friends .
It enabled all the shady operators and card sharks in the system to come to dominate how we finance .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Democrat Barack Obama has opened a 6 - point lead over Republican rival John McCain in the U.S. presidential race , according to a Reuters / C- SPAN / Zogby poll released on Sunday .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
Obama leads McCain by 49 percent to 43 percent among likely U.S. voters in the latest four - day tracking poll , his widest lead since the poll was started on Tuesday .
It was up from a 4 - point lead on Saturday .
The poll has a margin of error of 2.9 percentage points .
Pollster John Zogby said Obama ’s lead was now statistically significant .
“ As we watch each day , it is clear that he has gone from a 2 - point lead to a 3 - point lead on up to 6 points , ” Zogby said .
“ It is certainly trending his way . ”
With just over three weeks to go before the November 4 election , the poll showed Obama gaining traction among independent voters who now back him by a 21 - point margin .
Among women , another crucial group , the Illinois senator held a solid 12 - point lead , while the two candidates were tied among male voters at 45 percent apiece .
Obama has widened his lead as weeks of economic turmoil shook financial markets , causing stock markets to plunge and fueling voter concern over pocketbook issues .
Young voters aged 18 to 29 backed Obama by a 20 - point margin , and he also held a double - digit lead among those who reported they had registered to vote in the past six months .
McCain had a 10 - point lead among white voters , while Obama , who would be the first black U.S. president , won the support of 92 percent of black voters , one of the Democratic Party ’s most loyal constituencies .
Zogby said McCain , a former Navy pilot and Vietnam prisoner of war , appeared to be failing to connect with many voters on the issue of the economy , and a wave of attacks leveled against Obama by the McCain campaign also fell flat .
“ Clearly the negative campaigning is n’t working , ” Zogby said , noting that Obama was winning support among some voters in even the strongest traditional Republican voting blocs .
“ He ’s getting 19 percent support among conservatives and 35 support among born - again or evangelical ( Christian ) voters , which is pretty substantial .
I wonder if the McCain campaign ought to be raising some red flags , ” he said .
The rolling tracking poll surveyed 1,206 likely voters in the presidential election .
In a tracking poll , the most recent day ’s results are added while the oldest day ’s results are dropped in an effort to track changing momentum .
“ There is no possibility to pass it in the Parliament because there are no sessions in this week or next week , ” Abbas al - Bayati , a member of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al - Maliki ’s Dawa Party , said before a meeting of the political leaders from different blocs .
“ So discussions will continue until the end of this month . ”

For the second time in a week , the Iraqi government explicitly criticized the Americans for public comments about the agreement .
Ali al - Dabbagh , the government ’s spokesman , said in a statement that the government was concerned about comments by Adm .
Mike Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , who warned on Tuesday that the Iraqi military was not prepared to defend the country from insurgents and foreign forces on its own .
Mr. Dabbagh ’s reproof came just days after he chided Gen. Ray Odierno for suggesting that Iran had tried to bribe Iraqi officials to vote against the proposed pact .
General Odierno , the commander of United States and allied forces in Iraq , made the suggestion in an interview with The Washington Post .
Mr. Maliki met on Wednesday with representatives of Iraq ’s Christian sects , assuring them that the armed extremists who had been driving Christians from their homes in Mosul , Iraq ’s third largest city , would be punished .
About half the Christian population in Mosul  2,270 families , according to Iraq ’s Ministry of Human Rights  has fled this month in response to escalating threats and killings .
Mr. Maliki also promised that the government would protect the Christians remaining in Mosul and that it would offer Christians a larger role in the security forces that protect their neighborhoods .
His office had earlier pledged cash payments of about $ 860 to every Christian family that returned to Mosul .
Few took up the government on its offer , but an official in Iraq ’s Human Rights Ministry announced Wednesday that the flight of Christians from Mosul had ceased .
In Mosul on Wednesday , a car bomb killed four people and wounded three others .
And near the border with Syria , Iraqi officials reported having found mass graves containing the remains of 34 people , according to The Associated Press .
The bodies were believed to be those of Iraqi Army recruits from Karbala who were killed by gunmen from Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia .
The grave of an elderly woman buried about 12,000 years ago included a plethora of animal remains , adding one piece of evidence she was indeed a shaman who possibly used animal spirits to communicate with the spirit world ( depicted in this artistic reconstruction of the grave ) .
A 12,000 - year - old burial site in Israel contains offerings that include 50 tortoise shells and a human foot , and appears to be one of the earliest known graves of a female shaman .
The remains were discovered in a small cave called Hilazon Tachtit , which functioned as a burial site for at least 28 individuals .
The grave woman , likely a shaman , was separated from the other bodies by a circular wall of stones .
Other grave goodies buried within that wall included tail vertebrae from an extinct type of cattle called an auroch , skulls from two stone martens ( members of the weasel family ) , bony wing parts from a golden eagle , the forearm of a wild boar and a nearly complete pelvis from a leopard .
" What was unusual here was there were so many different parts of different animals that were unusual , that were clearly put there on purpose , " said researcher Natalie Munro , a zooarchaeologist at the University of Connecticut .
Great pains were likely taken long ago to collect the animal remains for the grave , not to mention the long trek that must have been made from the closest domestic site at the time , about 6 miles ( 10 km ) away , say the researchers .
This care along with the animal parts point to the grave belonging to both an important member of the society and possibly a healer called a shaman , the researchers conclude in their research published this week by the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Such healers mediate between the human and spirit worlds , often summoning the help of animal spirits along their quests , according to the researchers .
Life was tough
The woman was about 45 years old when she died and based on measurements of the skull and long bone , she stood at about 4.9 feet ( 1.5 meters ) .
Wearing of her teeth and other aging signs on the bones suggested the woman was relatively old for her time .
And she likely had a limp or dragged her foot , the researchers speculate , due to the fusion of the coccyx and sacrum along with deformations of the pelvis and lower vertebrae .
The human foot lying alongside the body came from an adult individual who was much larger than the women .
" What 's interesting is it 's only the foot , " Munro told LiveScience .
" She has n't been disturbed , but a part of another human body was definitely put into the grave .
It could be related to the fact they were moving body parts around sometimes , but we do n't know why . "
At least 10 large stones had been placed on the head , pelvis and arms of the buried individual , which the researchers suggest helped to protect the body and keep it in a specific position , or possibly to hold the body in its grave .
Scattered around the body and beneath it were tortoise shells .
Before arranging the shells inside the grave during the burial ritual , humans cracked open the tortoise shells along the reptiles ' bellies ( so as not to crack the back part of the shell ) and sucked out the meat , possibly for food .
" So they took the insides out by breaking the belly , but they left the back intact and that was probably meaningful , " Munro said .
Rituals begin
The woman was part of the Natufian culture , a group of hunter - gatherers who lived from 15,000 to about 11,500 years ago in the area that now includes Israel , Jordan , Lebanon and Syria .
The finding is particularly interesting since the Natufians were on the verge of becoming a more sedentary , farming society .
Finding an early shaman grave during this transition makes sense , Munro said .
" With the beginning of agriculture we seem to see an intensified ritual behavior , " Munro said .
" When things change dramatically , people tend to try to reestablish the legitimate order of things by using ritual and religion to deal with change . "
She added , " These people are starting to live in more permanent communities ; they 're in more contact with one another from day to day .
It 's not surprising that we start to see evidence for those ritualized behaviors at this point in time . "
ANCHORAGE , Alaska ( CNN ) -- Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin abused her power as Alaska 's governor and violated state ethics law by trying to get her ex-brother - in - law fired from the state police , a state investigator 's report concluded Friday .
Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin is under investigation for the firing of her public safety commissioner .
" Gov. Palin knowingly permitted a situation to continue where impermissible pressure was placed on several subordinates in order to advance a personal agenda , " the report states .
Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan 's refusal to fire State Trooper Mike Wooten from the state police force was " likely a contributing factor " to Monegan 's July dismissal , but Palin had the authority as governor to fire him , the report by former Anchorage prosecutor Stephen Branchflower states .
The investigator 's report states Palin 's efforts to get Wooten fired broke a state ethics law that bars public officials from pursuing personal interest through official action .
Watch what led to investigation »
The lawyers representing both Sarah and Todd Palin issued a three - page attack on the investigative report , including the contention that Ethics Act violations can only involve financial motives and financial " potential gain , or the avoidance of a potential loss . "
" Here , there is no accusation , no finding and no facts that money or financial gain to the Governor was involved in the decision to replace Monegan , " the lawyers said .
Any abuse of power , they said , was on the part of the Legislative Council members , not the Palins .
" Sen. French and Sen .
Green may have abused their government power by using public money to pursue a personal vendetta against the Governor , and then agreeing to pursue the PSEA attack against an administration that would not cave in to outrageous union demands . "
" Put bluntly , Branchflower completely misapplied the Ethics Act and has instead sought to create a headline to smear the Governor , " the lawyers wrote .
Monegan has said he was fired in July after refusing pressure to sack Wooten , who had gone through an acrimonious divorce and custody battle with Palin 's sister .
View a timeline of the investigation »
Monegan said he was " relieved " by the findings .
" I believed and had the opinion that I was terminated because I did not fire Wooten , " he told CNN .
" Now these findings say that that 's what happened , so I feel relieved . "
Palin and her husband , Todd , have consistently denied wrongdoing , describing Wooten as a " rogue trooper " who had threatened their family -- allegations Branchflower discounted .
" I conclude that such claims of fear were not bona fide and were offered to provide cover for the Palins ' real motivation : to get Trooper Wooten fired for personal family reasons , " Branchflower wrote .
The Branchflower report states Todd Palin used his wife 's office and its resources to press for Wooten 's removal , and the governor " failed to act " to stop it .
But because Todd Palin is not a state employee , the report makes no finding regarding his conduct .
The bipartisan Legislative Council , which commissioned the investigation after Monegan was fired , unanimously adopted the 263 - page public report after a marathon executive session Friday .
About 1,000 more pages of documents compiled during the inquiry will remain confidential because they involve private personnel matters , according to the council 's chairman , state Sen. Kim Elton .
" I believe that these findings may help people come to a conclusion on how they should vote " in the presidential election , Elton said .
McCain - Palin campaign spokeswoman Meg Stapleton said Palin would cooperate with the Personnel Board investigation .
The Palins ' lawyer has said an investigator named by that board wants to question them in late October .
Stapleton called the investigation " a partisan - led inquiry " run by supporters of Democratic presidential candidate Sen.
Barack Obama , but hailed its finding that Monegan 's firing broke no law .
" Gov. Palin was cleared of the allegation of an improper firing , which is what this investigation was approved to look into , " she said .
Stapleton went on to say that the Legislature exceeded its mandate in finding an ethics violation .
" Lacking evidence to support the original Monegan allegation , the Legislative Council seriously overreached , making a tortured argument to find fault without basis in law or fact . "
Rep. John Coghill , a Republican who criticized the handling of the investigation , said it was " well - done professionally . "
He said Palin " bumped right against the edges " of the state 's ethics laws but that he would give " the benefit of the doubt to the governor , though , at this point . "
Palin originally agreed to cooperate with the Legislative Council inquiry , and disclosed in August that her advisers had contacted Department of Public Safety officials nearly two dozen times regarding her ex-brother - in - law .
But once she became Sen .
John McCain 's running mate , her advisers began painting the investigation as a weapon of Democratic partisans .
Ahead of Friday 's hearing , Palin supporters wearing clown costumes and carrying balloons denounced the probe as a " kangaroo court " and a " three - ring circus " led by supporters of Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama .
The state senator managing the probe , Sen . Hollis French , fueled those complaints with a September 2 interview in which he warned the inquiry could yield an " October Surprise " for the GOP .
But Palin 's lawyers already had begun pushing for the state Personnel Board to launch its own investigation , calling it the proper legal venue for the matter .
" The report speaks for itself , " French told CNN Friday night .
CNN 's Tracy Sabo contributed to this report .

Scientists have confirmed what poets have long known : Absence makes the heart grow fonder .
Working with mouse - like rodents called prairie voles , scientists have found that close monogamous relationships alter the chemistry of the brain , fostering the release of a compound that builds loyalty but also plays a role in depression during times of separation .
The scientists found that after four days away from their mates , male voles experienced changes in the emotional center of their brains , causing them to become unresponsive and lethargic .
When given a drug that blocked the changes , however , lonely voles emerged from their funk .
The same chemical is found in human brains , and scientists said the research could provide insight into treating human grief and separation .

“ Whenever you form a pair bond , it changes your neurochemistry , ” said Larry J. Young , a neuroscientist at Emory University in Atlanta and an author of the study .
“ If you lose that partner , it has a dramatic impact on the brain . ”
Experts noted that human relationships are more complex than animal bonds and involve culture , socialization and rational thought .
Thus , there may be little to learn from the depressed voles .
“ When humans grieve they do n’t just give up and sit like lumps , ” George Bonanno , a psychologist at Columbia University ’s Teachers College who studies the process of bereavement .
“ They have purposeful behavior even when they are feeling lousy . ”
Still , Young said the experiment might help explain the longing people feel for partners who are absent or who die .
The study , published Wednesday in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology , might also shed light on why couples remain in relationships that are bad for them , he said .

Prairie voles , which are found in the wild through much of North America , are used to study monogamy because they are among the few animals that pair up like humans .
Although the voles may occasionally stray from the nest , they eventually return to their lifelong partners to help raise litter after litter .
The brain chemical corticotropin - releasing factor , or CRF , has a key role in maintaining those loyal bonds , researchers found .
After separating nine male voles from their partners , Young and colleagues from Emory and the University of Regensburg in Germany tested the animals ’ ability to cope with stress .
When placed in a pool of water , the voles passively floated instead of trying to swim .
In a second test , the animals failed to struggle when suspended by their tails .

The animals displayed “ depressive behaviors , ” Young said .
“ They become more passive , more likely to give up . ”
When researchers killed the voles and looked inside their brains , they found elevated levels of CRF , which is known to have a role in depression .
A control group of 10 male voles that had been separated from a male sibling displayed no depressive behaviors or increases in CRF , researchers said , indicating there was something special about monogamous bonds .
Voles that received a drug that blocked CRF behaved normally when separated from their female mates , according to the study , which was funded by the National Institutes of Health , and other research organizations and foundations .

Several pharmaceutical companies are developing drugs that act on CRF as treatments for depression and anxiety - related disorders .
In some cases , researchers said , the pain of separation can serve a useful purpose .
Young said uneasy feelings that come with separation may keep males close to their nests , where they can protect offspring from predators , for example .
C. Sue Carter , a professor of psychiatry at the University of Illinois at Chicago who works with voles , cautioned against anthropomorphizing the animals , adding there is more than one way to interpret their behavior .
“ What humans call depression might be an adaptive strategy , ” she said .
The passive voles might simply be conserving their energy for more important things , she suggested , such as searching for a new mate .

If you are already bored of playing chess , how about trying these highly entertaining and challenging free and open - source turn - based strategy games that you can easily get and install on Linux :
After recommending those excellent real - time strategy ( RTS ) games for Linux , let 's move on to this other type of strategic gaming referred to as turn - based .
A game is considered turn - based if the game flow is divided into well - defined and visible parts , called turns or rounds .
Turn - based Strategy ( TBS ) games may be less action - packed than RTS , but they are more mentally challenging .
-- A player of a turn - based game is allowed a period of analysis ( sometimes bounded , sometimes unbounded ) before committing to a game action , ensuring a separation between the game flow and the thinking process .
If you are already bored of playing chess , how about trying these highly entertaining and challenging free and open - source turn - based strategy games that you can easily get and install on Linux :
The Battle for Wesnoth
The Battle for Wesnoth , or simply Wesnoth , is based on the Sega Genesis games Master of Monsters and Warsong ( also known as Langrisser ) .
It is played on a hex map , with single - player campaigns as well as multi-player matches .
A central philosophy in the design of the game is the KISS ( Keep It Short and Simple ) principle ; for a new idea to be accepted , it should not complicate gameplay .
The Battle for Wesnoth is set in a fantasy environment , in which players build armies comprised of different units from races such as humans , elves , dwarves , orcs , trolls , and more .
This includes many custom made races , as anyone can customize the game .

Players take the helm of a newly - spaceborne Empire to explore and colonize the stars .
Sometimes thought of as " Civilization in space , " FreeOrion 's design also provides for a tactical combat engine along the lines of Homeworld and the Total War series .
FreeCol
FreeCol is a clone of Sid Meier 's Colonization .
FreeCol is mostly programmed in Java and should thus be platform - independent .
In February 2007 , FreeCol was SourceForge.net 's Project of the Month .
FreeCol starts in the year 1492 .
With a few settlers , the player builds up colonies in the New World , struggling for power with other colonies from rival Europeans .
The player gradually builds up these colonies with help from the European king until no help from Europe is necessary , meaning that the colonies can stand alone without any exterior aid , and declares independence from the King and , if the colonies are able to resist the attacks of the royal expeditionary force , victory is obtained .
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints encouraged its members to work to pass the amendment by volunteering their time and money for the campaign .
Church officials offered no statement on the rally and march Friday night , but have called for civility and respect in the same - sex marriage debate before and after Tuesday ’s vote .
Rally speakers made a similar call on Friday .
“ I do not hate the L.D.S. church , nor any of its members and neither should you , ” said one of the speakers , State Senator Scott D. McCoy , Democrat of Utah , and one of three openly gay Utah legislators .
“ The way to deal with this problem is to love more , not hate . ”
Mr. McCoy ’s district includes the Mormon church headquarters .
He called on the crowd to work with him to channel frustration and anger into activism and conversation that fosters understanding .
“ I will help them understand , ” Mr. McCoy said , “ that civil rights for our community does not come into conflict with the religious rights to worship as your conscience dictates . ”
It 's great news for the impatient gentleman - women say foreplay is overrated
Poor men .
All that time and effort wasted .
A study has shown that foreplay adds little to a woman 's overall enjoyment of sex .
The main event itself is far more important , the researchers found .
Their findings contradict traditional bedroom etiquette , which dictates that men must take it slow .
More than 2,300 women were quizzed about their sex lives for the study .
Questions covered areas such as the division of time between foreplay and intercourse , and how often the women had an orgasm .
Do you stay the course ?
In opposition to the general consensus women take more pleasure from intercourse than foreplay , a new survey has found
Foreplay lasted for an average of 15.4 minutes and intercourse for 16.2 , the Journal of Sexual Medicine reports .
Further scrutiny of the results , collected in the Czech Republic , led the researchers from the University of the West of Scotland and Charles University in Prague to conclude that foreplay contributed little to a woman 's enjoyment of the encounter .
The researchers said : ' In contrast to the assumptions of many sex therapists and educators , more attention should be given to improve quality and duration of intercourse rather than foreplay . '
They added that the figure of 16.2 minutes for intercourse dwarfed the figure of seven minutes found in American studies , suggesting Europeans are better in the bedroom .
Relationship expert Dr Pam Spurr said that women repeatedly stress the importance of foreplay when talking to her .
Dr Spurr said a sensuous touch could only heighten a woman 's enjoyment .
She added : ' Too many women tell me they can't be bothered with sex because they do n't get any foreplay .
' If you have time for it I always recommend foreplay first because of the positive effects .
Women feel desirable as well as more intimate with their partner . '
Another study shows that pomegranate juice increases men's sex drive – suggesting that Greek myths about its aphrodisiac qualities may be true .
Researchers asked 14 couples to perform a series of tasks after drinking pomegranate , orange or cranberry juice .
These included asking the couples to kiss and showing them images of scantily - clad models of the opposite sex .
The team at Mindlabs International , at Sussex University , found the couples kissed more passionately after drinking pomegranate juice , sending their vital signs soaring .
The effect was significantly more noticeable in the men .
And a third study shows that a woman is most likely to have an affair in her early thirties .
That 's when her ' sexual unrestrictedness ' – or sociosexuality – peaks and she is most likely to be unfaithful to their partners .
Scientists at Bradley University in Illinois said the timing reflects an evolved reproductive strategy that maximises the chances of conceiving and bearing a healthy child .

Listen to an exclusive audio interview with the author .
REXBURG , IDAHO
" America 's Family Community . "
That 's the motto of this Mormon college town , displayed on street - side monuments and in tall letters on the movie - theater marquee .
Apparently , it 's a formula for success .
Rexburg thrives on a burst of construction and population growth .
More than 30,000 residents occupy a grid of wide , orderly streets , amid vast potato fields that unfurl toward the majestic Teton Peaks .
Plenty of Rexburg parents , following the Mormon prescription for big families , have six or seven children .
One guy tells me his next - door neighbors have 13 children , and a family on the other side has 16 .
The newly expanded hospital maternity unit is already crowded with new babies .
If Rexburg is any indication , Mormons are taking over the world .
They certainly run this town .
An estimated 97 percent of the locals belong to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints -- making Rexburg possibly the most Mormon of all towns .
The brilliant white - stone 57,000 - square - foot Mormon temple , opened eight months ago , looms on a hilltop , glowing day and night ; intense floodlights make Mormon temples the brightest objects in the Western nights .
The college that sprawls beside the temple -- Brigham Young University - Idaho -- now boasts an annual enrollment of 21,000 students , more than double what it had eight years ago .
Mormon mores -- some written into local laws -- permeate the community .
Rexburg has no real saloon and no supply of hard liquor ; only four restaurants are licensed to serve beer or wine .
There is only one coffee shop , and it keeps up with the meager caffeine demand by brewing each cup individually .
When I cruise town on a pleasant Saturday night in mid-September , the hottest action comes down in a bowling alley : Balls crash down all 16 lanes while the spinning pins and the bowlers ' teeth glow even whiter under the ultraviolet lighting .
But something louder and bigger draws me to Rexburg : the religious culture wars , which heat up every election season .
The prophets who run the Mormon Church -- the church president , his two counselors and a dozen top apostles , based in the headquarters in Salt Lake City , Utah -- encourage all Mormons to be active in politics .
The prophets are said to be relaying the word of God , and while they generally do n't endorse candidates , they take stands on issues such as abortion and homosexuality .
As a result , most Mormons vote very Republican .
In the last presidential election , nearly 92 percent of the votes in Madison County ( Rexburg is the county seat ) went to George W. Bush -- securing Rexburg yet another title : the nation 's most Republican town .
On the most critical issues , the Mormon prophets go all out , urging their followers to conduct targeted campaigns .
That helps explain why , Thursday evenings in the downtown building of a health - products company owned by one of Idaho 's richest Mormons , groups of Rexburg college students and townies get together .
They 're using the company 's call center to make call after call to California voters , trying to persuade them to pass a ballot measure in the November election .
It 's titled Proposition 8 -- the California Marriage Protection Amendment -- and it aims to prevent gay and lesbian people from getting married in that state .
An eight - year battle led to Proposition 8 .
In 2000 , with Mormon encouragement and campaign money , California voters passed a measure banning gay marriage .
It blew up again last May , when the California Supreme Court justices narrowly ruled ( four to three ) that the ban violated the civil rights of gays and lesbians .
The court likened it to the bans many states once had against interracial marriage , all of which were tossed out long ago .
Now , Proposition 8 aims to overrule the California Supreme Court , by amending the state Constitution .
Many religious groups have jumped into the campaign ; the Mormon Church takes the lead .
In June , the church 's top prophets commanded Mormons " to do all you can " to work for Proposition 8 and donate money to the campaign .
Mormon leaders throughout California read the instructions to their congregations , which have more than 750,000 members .
Word spread everywhere in the Mormon realm .
In August , the prophets added pages of elaboration : " The Church has a single , undeviating standard of sexual morality : intimate relations are proper only between a husband and a wife united in bonds of matrimony .
...
Any dilution of the traditional definition of marriage will further erode the already weakened stability of marriages and family generally ... with harmful consequences for society . "
Mormon volunteers , additionally inspired by special TV broadcasts beamed from the headquarters into their churches , go door - to - door in California for Proposition 8 .
In other states , they run phone banks and do whatever they can .
Their effort is strongest in the West , because there are more Mormons in this region than anywhere else .
Chad Reiser , a leader of the BYU - Idaho College Republican Club , says the phone banks are not an official club activity , but " we do try to get as many people involved as possible .
Proposition 8 is a moral issue " related to church doctrine -- " something we believe is important to all people . "
Kim B. Clark , the president of BYU - Idaho and a pillar of Rexburg 's Mormon establishment , receives me in his office on a sunny Tuesday morning .
His windows look out on construction cranes erecting a huge events center that will have a 15,000 - seat auditorium and 10 basketball courts .
He talks of more university projects .
He appears confident and wears a pinstripe charcoal suit and red- pattern necktie , with a well - thumbed 2,000 - page book of scriptures within reach .
He grew up a Western Mormon in Utah and Washington , earned a Ph.D. at Harvard University and ran the Harvard Business School .
He left Harvard three years ago , because the top prophet invited him to shape this college .
It was " like getting a call from Moses , " Clark says .
When I ask Clark about his church 's campaign against gay marriage in California , I note that some people consider it a violation of the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights -- which mandate the separation of church and state .
He strongly disagrees .
Those who would limit his church 's work against homosexuality , he says , " cloak their arguments in other terms ... ( such as ) civil rights ... but their fundamental purpose is to destroy religion in our society . "
He says these battles will occur more and more frequently : " We 're seeing a change in the political environment and interest groups .
...
It takes many different forms .
It 's not directed at any particular religion .
It 's driven by people who are against religion . "
As over - the - top as that sounds , Proposition 8 is a Western showdown with national implications .
Hollywood celebrities , civil - rights groups , dissident Mormons , mega - businesses such as Google , politicians and other interests around the country have also jumped in .
Shortly , the election results on Proposition 8 will create a new landmark signifying how much influence religions can assert on our modern society .
Behind all the fury , I find something unexpected in the Rexburg area .
It seems to me that , despite appearances , the Mormon Church may be losing its grip .
Okay , here ’s some special bonus robo - clothes shopper snark .
Jeff Larson is not only John McCain ’s chief robocaller and Sen. Palin ’s $ 150 k clothes shopper , he ’s also the guy who ’s giving that sweetheart rental deal on his apartment in DC .
Raffaello Follieri Blames Anne Hathaway 's Lifestyle
It is understandable for convicted felonwho is looking at spending 4 years in the the pen for embezzling millions , to place the blame on someone other than himself .
And who better to blame than ex-girlfriend and actressFollieri claims he was merely attempting to keep up with her glamorous lifestyle .
Raffaello's attorney was quoted saying the following about his client :
" Surrounded by movie stars and celebrities and this young man , who neither drinks nor smokes , became intoxicated with it all . "
" The road to Hell is paved with good intentions . "
And he added : Well , we wonder if Follieri is wishing he would have picked a different lawyer .
Most of us would love to live a more glamorous lifestyle but common sense keeps us from stealing LARGE sums of money because of that whole prison thing .
The con man will be sentenced on October 23rd .
They are trying to get a reduced sentence of three years .
Check out the letter that Raffaello 's legal team wrote to the judge on his behalf .

Thanks For Your Vote !
Vincent Bugliosi talks about prosecuting George Bush and his appearance before the House Judiciary Committee .
S&R : You wrote , “ I strongly believe without absolutely knowing that this man has no respect or love for this country . ”
And , “ I do n’t know about you , but if I ever killed just one person , even accidentally , like in a car accident , I ’d never have another perfect day as long as I live . ”
Now many of us think those thoughts .
But we ’re either too afraid , or too politically correct , to put them into words .
What makes you willing and able to say those things ?
VB : I did the same thing with my book , The Betrayal of America . [ about the 2000 Supreme Court decision to end the recounting of presidential votes in Florida ] .
All your legal scholars around the country were saying that the Supreme Court â€ “- the five justices [ who voted to end the recount ] â€ “ - had done something just absolutely terrible .
And that was that they caused people to lose respect for the court .
I said “ What ?
You can steal a presidential election and all that happens is you lose respect ? ”
That ’s like telling Timothy McVeigh , “ Tim , do n’t worry , we ’re not going to hurt you .
We ’re not goanna prosecute you .
But , you know , Tim , we do n’t like you .
You ’re a terrible person . ”
So I wrote [ an article in 2001 titled ] “ None Dare Call It Treason ” for the Nation , in which I said these five were among the biggest criminals in American history .
But I ’m a member of the bar and members of the bar do n’t do that .
Gerry Spence said , “ It ’s just not done . ” I was calling them criminals .
But I sent a copy of the article by registered mail to each justice to make sure they got it .
So I ’ve done this before .
You ’re asking me where I get the courage to do this .
People are always asking me , “ How do you put this stuff in print ? ”
Look , I ’m not a courageous guy — I ’m motivated solely by anger .
To me , the country is going down the tubes .
I want to bring about justice .
I do n’t think about courage .
I would n’t do this , believe me , if I were n’t so incredibly angry .
I do n’t like to see anyone get away with murder , even one murder .
O.J. Simpson got away with two murders and I was so angry I wrote Outrage : The Five Reasons Why O.J. Simpson Got Away with Murder .
People then were saying , “ He was just found not guilty .
How can you accuse him of murder on the cover of a book ? ”
“ Fine , ” I said .
“ Let him sue me for libel .
I ’d love to cross-examine him . ”
He did n’t do anything to me .
S&R : Most who ’ve spent years in the legal system grow jaded and cynical .
Yet you ’ve been able to maintain a sense of outrage and injustice .
VB : I think of these kids coming back in a box and their parents — maybe it ’s the only child they have .
They ’re advised by the Department of Defense not to look in the box because the contents are unviewable .
Sometimes it ’s just limbs coming back , parts of the body .
And this rotten , no good S.O.B. is dancing and having fun and joking .
How dare he ?
I did n’t say “ how dare he ” before the House Judiciary Committee because they told me I could n’t accuse Bush of a crime or any type of dishonorable conduct .
But I ’m saying it to you :
How dare he ?
Quote me on that .
Bush ca n’t be permitted to get away with this .
I use the figure 100,000 Iraqi dead in my book .
But that ’s a very conservative estimate .
The number could be in excess of a million .
I do n’t want him to get away with a million murders .
I worked on it , but I could n’t establish jurisdiction against him for the Iraqi citizens .
But I spent many hours establishing jurisdiction to prosecute him for American soldiers dying .
S&R : You lay out the whole process for any lawyer contemplating this .
First you do this , then you do that .
It does n’t seem that hard .
VB : No question about it .
This can happen .
I think I made an important point when I talked in front of Congress .
If we want to become the great nation we once were , because I do n’t see this as a great nation anymore â€ “ - you can quote me on that — the first step we have to take is to bring those responsible for the war on Iraq to justice .
[ Emphasis added . ]
I think that would enhance our image around the world .
S&R : If we fail to prosecute him , what adverse effects would it have on the country and our image abroad ?
VB : Well , probably not that much because most people are not even thinking about this .
They ’re not thinking Bush should be prosecuted and if he ’s not we ’re a weak country .
The vast majority of Americans do n’t even know this book is out there because I ’ve been blacked out .
I ’ll tell you where it would have an effect though — with subsequent presidents .
People argue : “ Mr. Bugliosi , you ca n’t do this because it would inhibit future presidents . ”
Here ’s my response : “ If there ’s another monstrous individual like Bush who ’s thinking about doing what did , we do want to inhibit him . ”
If you ’re a president who ’s not a criminal , you have nothing to worry about .
Who ’d even bring a murder charge against someone under normal circumstances ?
Where would the evidence be ?
It ’s extremely important we do this to help ensure that it never happens again .
S&R : The public is a little queasy about this sort of thing .
In a sense , we elect a president to make the big decisions about life and death .
War - time killing is on his conscience to spare ours .
VB : I ’ve been on the radio all over the country .
I can tell you that the average American who has n’t read my book thinks that the whole idea of prosecuting a president is crazy .
“ That ’s just absurd , ” they say .
I ask them , “ Have you read the book ? ”
And a hundred percent of the time they say no .
I ’ve yet to hear from someone who ’s read this book who think it ’s crazy .
They may not agree with me but they do n’t think there ’s anything crazy about this book .
But those who have n’t read the book think it ’s preposterous .
I had an attorney general call me on the phone .
He said he heard I had a book out about impeachment .
“ It ’s not about impeachment , ” I said .
“ It ’s about murder . ”
And the first words out of his mouth were , “ Under what law ? ”
Now you have to realize the attorney general is the chief legal officer in the state .
He ’s also the chief law enforcement office in the state .
Under what law ?
Under the law that ’s already on the book in all 50 states .
There ’s no statue that says it excludes certain people , like a president .
But people are not thinking in those terms .
They think that the president is somehow above the law .
So , not prosecuting Bush would certainly have an effect on some people , just not the majority of Americans .
But it could have a tremendous effect on our image around the world and a deterrent effect on subsequent presidents .
And I think it would make the nation feel good about itself actually .
But if it does n’t happen , this is something that very few people pay attention to .

Today we are going to highlight the story of a home in Santa Monica that chronicles 15 years of Los Angeles County housing history .
A home that has experienced two housing bubbles and is still feisty and hungry for another one .
For a city with 91,124 people , you would think given the media coverage that a larger number of the 10,000,000 residents of the county would live in this area .
Clearly , they do not .
Very few cities exemplify the California housing mania quite like Santa Monica .
It had the perfect brew to intoxicate a number of would be real estate moguls and L.A. status fighters .
The trajectory of housing prices in Santa Monica seemed to defy the laws of physics and dared gravity in the face to pull it downward .
Before I detail the home to you , I have gotten a few e-mails regarding my article posted on August 6 detailing the 10 reasons how the California housing market will be in the doldrums until May of 2011 .
Most of the questions concern the massive government intervention and how it will influence the current housing market in California .
Let me quickly sum up the 10 reasons and how all 10 still apply today :
(1) REO and foreclosures still growing
(2) Pay Option ARMs hitting peak recast periods
(3) Living rent - free while the foreclosure process works its way through
(4) FYI – California is in a major recession already
(5) Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury throwing money in the wrong places
(6) Income to price ratios still out of whack
(7) L.A. County has a renting majority
(8) Demographics point toward more demand for affordable housing
(9) Feedback loop from being too dependent on real estate for our economy
( 10 ) Consumer Psychology and why buy today when tomorrow will be cheaper ?
All these 10 reasons still apply .
I have gotten a few e-mails highlighting how notice of defaults and foreclosures have slowed down in the last month .
Much of this trend is due to the recent signing of SB 1137 which requires lenders to contact homeowners multiple times and then waiting 30 days before filing foreclosure notices .
Here is part of the text :
“ Until January 1 , 2013 , and as applied to residential mortgage loans made from January 1 , 2003 , to December 31 , 2007 , inclusive , that are for owner - occupied residences , this bill would , among other things , require a mortgagee , trustee , beneficiary , or authorized agent to wait 30 days after contact is made with the borrower , or 30 days after satisfying due diligence requirements to contact the borrower , as specified , before filing a notice of default . ”
So how does this really help someone with a large oversized mortgage ?
It really does n’t .
It looks good for one or two months of statistics but simply delays the inevitable .
In addition , the bill requires legal owners of the foreclosed properties to maintain the home or face a $ 1,000 per day fine .
Many times if it is a REO , the bank takes the property back .
Do you really think banks have the money to become a major property management company ?
Of course not .
That is why they are going to the bank of Uncle Sam on a daily basis to tap credit lines .
Amazing how those responsible for the bubble still have access to credit .
Although the bill is good intentioned it does very little to address the fundamental core issues of what is going on .
That housing prices are still too high for the current population .
Real Homes of Genius – Santa Monica Edition
This home takes us to the Republic of Santa Monica , as many comrades in the Southland affectionately know it .
Santa Monica was the source of many housing porn rehab shows and almost provided a self - indulgent congratulation celebration on the virtues of using pastel colors on your wall and infusing jet streams into your bathtub to wash away the hard work of defrauding people into unsupportable mortgage products .
Those really leave a dirty stench .
The art of fixing up homes seemed to actually have a workable and successful pattern .
“ If I add a stainless steel mega industrial strength refrigerator and recessed lighting , we can add $ 50,000 ” the housing “ experts ” would tell us .
Of course this was all part of the delusional housing bubble world and many convinced each other that yes , the Kool - Aid was delicious and refreshing .
Please , take a sip from the newly installed fridge .
This 3 bedroom and 2 bath home was built in 1954 .
It is 1,319 square feet and has been on the market for 1 day .
We are told that there is an attached garage if any comrades have a hard time actually looking at the picture .
And once again , if you look closely at the picture we will see the patented garbage can 2.0 photo technology at work :
This would n’t be so shocking until you realize this place has a Zestimate of $ 1,447,000 :
Now really , does this place look like a $ 1.4 million dollar home ?
Seriously .
But when I put on my 2006 customized housing bubble goggles I am quickly able to see the absolute potential here .
What was I thinking !
A touch of new paint , a little bit of landscaping , and next thing you know we have a $ 2 million home .
This is housing economics 2.0 right ?
This home sold many times over 15 years .
Starting in 1993 we will chronicle some headline stories in the L.A.
Times and also place the sale price of the home as well .
Ready for this fantastic journey ?
Let us begin .
Sale in 1993 : 05/27/1993 : $ 290,000
Bottom Line : Housing Market May Be Mending Real Estate : Despite a three - year slump , experts say prices are stabilizing , especially for homes under $ 500,000 .
PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN ; Los Angeles Times ( pre-1997 Fulltext ) ; Aug 22 , 1993 ; pg. 1
A sad Westside story : Home prices have declined up to 50 % since late 1980s
Myers , David W ; Los Angeles Times ; May 28 , 1993 ; D ; pg. 1
Indeed it was a sad Westside story .
This poor home only sold for $ 290,000 after the Southern California housing bubble of the late 1980s popped .
It has now been a few years since peak prices and people are thinking that a bottom is in sight .
Keep in mind that in our current bubble , the Los Angeles housing market did n’t peak until the middle of 2007 .
That is , we are only 1 year from the peak .
But have no fear , after people got burned they got hungry for another bubble and this is when things really got interesting .
Sale in 2001 : 09/18/2001 : $ 417,500 + $ 127,500
After 8 years , this home finds itself being sold at the beginning of the epic California housing bubble .
Little did this seller know that this home was going to be on an amazing journey into Dante ’s version of the housing inferno .
You ’ll love some of the headline articles during this time :
The Nouveau Austerity ;
The post - Sept. 11 mantra may as well be :
If we quit shopping , they win , right ?
Those with money are still spending , just quietly .
SHAWN HUBLER and MIMI AVINS ; Los Angeles Times ; Dec 16 , 2001 ; E.1 ;
THE NATION ; Enron Was Warned of Violations , Auditor Says
RICHARD SIMON ;THOMAS S. MULLIGAN ; Los Angeles Times ; Dec 13 , 2001 ; A.1 ;
You would think given what was going on during this time that people would be more careful with their finances .
Yet this notion that we had a patriotic duty to spend beyond our means or “ they ” will win took hold .
Alan Greenspan lowered rates to ridiculous levels and took us from the tech bubble to the housing bubble without skipping a beat .
Sale 2002 : 09/16/2002 : $ 476,000 +$ 58,500
One year later this home sold for a$ 58,500 profit .
Not bad given that the median household income of those in L.A. is approximately $ 50,000 .
At this rate , why work when you can live off the appreciation of your home ?
Realty companies thinking globally
Mary Umberger ; Los Angeles Times ; Dec 1 , 2002 ; K.11 ;
Bwahahaha !
Oh I bet realty companies were thinking globally .
Now a few years later we are in a global mess .
2001 and 2002 saw the seeds of the bubble take hold and this is when the snowball really started gathering speed and size .
Sale 2004 : 10/28/2004 : $ 696,000 +$ 220,000
Wow .
Now , our 2 - year appreciation gain is nearly the price of the home in 1993 .
We have now made $ 110,000 a year from simply living in our home .
Is n’t life grand ?
Even if life is n’t grand we just made a few .
Now we are making twice the median household income of households in the county .
No bubble here right ?
What were some people saying ?
No Sign of a Housing Bubble , Study Says

Builders Keep Putting Up Housing — but Not Enough

The middle - class housing squeeze ;
The high cost of homes is pricing many residents out of the California market .
Some are staying in rentals , and others are leaving the state .
Allison B. Cohen ; Los Angeles Times ; Mar 7 , 2004 ; K.1 ;
At this point people are drawing lines in the sand .
You either drink the Kool - Aid and believe housing prices are justified or start realizing we are in a bubble .
Take a look at the four headlines above during the year .
One argues there is no housing bubble .
Good job on that call .
One of the articles compares housing to a Las Vegas Casino .
The L.A. Times is a mainstream paper and we still get revisionist pundits trying to say that no one saw this coming today .
This was 2004 .
Just because a bonehead pundit had the lack of foresight does not mean others did not see what was coming down the pipeline .
The next sale is when we hit hyperspace and go into weird cult world and prices simply go completely unhinged from any semblance of reality :
Sale 2006 : 11/22/2006 : $ 1,100,000 +$ 404,000
2 - more years and we are now making $ 202,000 a year by simply sitting in our home and watching the grass grow .
At this rate if we follow this pattern , we will sell the home in 2008 for $ 1,700,000 for a nice $ 600,000 profit .
I like this math .
We ’ll keep selling the same home over and over and each time the price will get hyper inflated .
At this point , we are in another galaxy of logic and rules .
The cult herd mentality is now in full speed and you have a school of new believers that actually think these prices justify some new form of back of the napkin economics .
This is where we get a mix of reality based articles and those who finally fly off the real estate religion cliff :
The Nation ; Housing Speculators Relocate to Hotter Spots ; Some who scored with L.A. - area property take their profits to Las Vegas and Arizona .
Their flight may soften the local market ’s landing .

A loan that ’ll get ugly fast ;
Option mortgages allow payments so low that borrowers go deeper into debt .
Their popularity could pose risks for the housing market .
David Streitfeld ; Los Angeles Times ; Dec 11 , 2006 ; A.1 ;
The first article talks about delusional folks who mistook luck for skill .
These are the folks that made big dough in L.A. and thought they could replicate these same behaviors in Vegas and Arizona .
You can take a wild guess as to how these folks are now doing .
How appropriate that it was Las Vegas too .
Another article talks about the Inland Empire as the “ dream ” of L.A. which of course is nothing more than an utter nightmare now where prices are down 50 to 60 percent with vacant homes on nearly every block .
You have to love the “ starkest ” forecast of a 3.6 % drop in housing prices .
Bwahaha !
If that were only the case .
By this time I was already blogging away about the massive excess in California and the nation .
Housing prices in California are now down 41 + % on a statewide basis .
And we also get someone calling out Option mortgages which of course are going to kick the California housing market in the groin in 2009 through 2011 .
This is the history of an epic housing bubble .
An era has now come to an end .
This Santa Monica home that sold at the peak for $ 1,100,000 .
What is the current price ?
How about $ 709,000 with only 1 day on the market .
Do you think lenders are quickly getting the idea ?
This is as prime as you get in terms of L.A .
We are now going to see practically every area in the Southland take a hit from this bubble bursting .
The fact that credit markets are still in a defensive position will not help the market for many years .
Even in the Republic of Santa Monica , comrades still find that rare foreclosure .
Today we salute you Santa Monica with our Real Home of Genius Award .

The innermost part of the earth .
The outer core extends from 2500 to 3500 miles below the earth 's surface and is liquid metal .
The inner core is the central 500 miles and is solid metal .
Something beneath the surface is changing Earth 's protectivemagnetic field , which may leave satellites and other space assets vulnerable tohigh - energy radiation .
The gradual weakening of the overall magnetic field can takehundreds and even thousands of years .
But smaller , more rapid fluctuationswithin months may leave satellites unprotected and catch scientists off guard , new research finds .
A new model uses satellite data from the past nine years toshow how sudden fluidmotions within the Earth 's core can alter the magnetic envelope around ourplanet .
This represents the first time that researchers have been able todetect such rapid magnetic field changes taking place over just a few months .
" There are these changes in the South Atlantic , an areawhere the magnetic field has the smallest envelope at one third [ of what is ] normal , " said Mioara Mandea , a geophysicist at the GFZ German ResearchCenter for Geosciences in Potsdam , Germany .
Even before the newly detected changes , the South AtlanticAnomaly represented a weak spot in the magnetic field — a dent in Earth 'sprotective bubble .
Bubble bobble
The Earth 's magnetic field extends about 36,000 miles ( 58,000 km ) into space , generated from the spinning effect of theelectrically - conductive core that acts something like a giant electromagnet .
The field creates a tear - dropshaped bubble that has constantly shielded life on Earth against much of the high - energy radiation flowing from the sun .
The last major change in the field took place some 780,000 years ago during a magnetic reversal , although such reversals seem to occurmore often on average .
A flip in the north and south poles typically involves aweakening in the magnetic field , followed by a period of rapid recovery andreorganization of opposite polarity .
Some studies in recent years have suggested the nextreversal might be imminent , but the jury is out on that question .
Measuring interactions between the magnetic field and themolten iron core 1,864 miles ( 3,000 km ) down has proven difficult in the past , but the constant observations of satellites such as CHAMP and Orsted have begunto bring the picture into focus .
Electric storm
Mandea worked with Nils Olsen , a geophysicist at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark , to create a model of the fluid core thatfits with the magnetic field changes detected by the satellites .
However , the rapid weakening of the magnetic field in the South Atlantic Anomaly region could signalfuture troubles for such satellites .
Radiationstorms from the sun could fry electronicequipment on satellites that suddenly lacked the protective cover of arapidly changing magnetic field .
" For satellites , this could be a problem , " Mandeatold SPACE.com .
" If there are magnetic storms and high - energyparticles coming from the sun , the satellites could be affected and theirconnections could be lost . "
The constant radiation bombardment from the sun blows withthe solar wind to Earth , where it flows against and around the magnetic field .
The effect creates the tear - drop shaped magnetosphere bubble , but even thepowerful field cannot keep out all the high - energy particles .
Topsy - turvy history
A large sunspot set off a majorradiation storm in 2006 that temporarily blinded some sun-watchingsatellites .
Astronauts on the International Space Station retreated to aprotected area as a precaution to avoid unnecessary radiation exposure .
The Earth 's overall magnetic field has weakened at least 10 percent over the past 150 years , which could also point to an upcoming fieldreversal .
Mandea and Olsen hope to continue refining their model withupdated observations , and perhaps to eventually help predict future changes inthe Earth 's magnetic field .
The study was detailed in the May online edition of thejournal Nature Geoscience .

If you have a great blog that people will be genuinely interested in , here are three quick and fast ways to get the word out there .
Add your Feed to RSS Aggregators
Public RSS aggregators will take your website ’s feed and republish it in a place where people and bots can find it .
The downside is that there ’s a potential for duplicate content issues – especially since you ’re blog domain is new and unestablished in the eyes of the search engines .
Minimize your feed ’s output :
Adjust Feed settings to show only content excerpts
Only submit to RSS directories that do not use “ nofollow ” on feed links
use “ nofollow ” on feed links
Only submit after your blog has been initially indexed by at least Google
Recommended Feed Aggregators :

STAY AWAY FROM FEEDFURY –
This site is basically a scraper that will take your Feed and claim it as their own by putting nofollow on it .
They have no contact information and there ’s no way to remove a feed once it is submitted to them !
If you submit a new website ’s feed to this shady directory , they will probably end up ranking higher than you for your own content .
Join Social Bookmarking Websites
In theory , social bookmarking websites help get good content noticed because users can vote on what they like in order to send it to the top pages with heavy traffic .
Even better , popular links end up generating a lot of link juice and pagerank .
Here are some great social bookmarking sites that can help you get some backlinks and human eyes on your work :
Digg
Reddit
Propeller
DropJack
Furl.net
Folkd
Users prefer it if you link to actual stories rather than front pages or categories .
To have the best success , you should spend some time reading and getting to know what topics the users of the bookmarking site are most interested in .
Comment on Related Blogs
When you ’re promoting a new website , it does n’t even matter if the blogs you are commenting on are nofollow .
Post with your name and a link , and try to add comments that are useful and interesting .
By posting on related blogs you respect , you ’re also introducing yourself to the webmaster (s ) there and inviting them to see if they ’re interested in your new project .
Do n’t think of other bloggers as competition – you have to start thinking of them as peers and experts in a network that you want to be a part of .
These few steps probably wo n’t put you at the top of the search engine rankings , but they will help you establish a base that makes it harder for other scraper sites to claim credit for your work and it will help some actual humans aware of your new website .
One aspect common to totalitarian regimes is the forced loyalty oath .
Nazi Germany , for example , forced all pastors , civil servants and soldiers to take an oath of loyalty to Adolf Hitler .
In the Soviet Union , in Communist China , and numerous other nations , the state demanded that people swear loyalty to the government as a condition for a jobs , for education , or to receive any service that the state had arrogated for itself .
Typically regimes demand routine public displays of loyalty before everyday events such as sporting events , theater performances , or the beginning of the school or work day .
Why do totalitarian regimes demand that people publicly announce their loyalty and subservience ?
The answer is simple – the totalitarian regime typically does not have the people ’s willing loyalty .
Rather , they must compel the people ’s loyalty .
And , if they ca n’t have the real thing , a fake version is just fine .
The forced loyalty oath is a sign of a unpopular regime , that fears the people because it acts in a manner that not in the people ’s interest .
Is the forced loyalty oath ineffective ?
Are totalitarian regimes fooling themselves , making people say empty words that the people do n’t believe ?
To the contrary , the forced loyalty oath is common because it is very effective , being one of the cruelest attacks on freedom .
The forced loyalty oath attacks the freedom of speech .
With it , the regime seizes control of a person ’s mouth , and compels that mouth to say words that its rightful owner wishes not to say .
The monstrosity of the crime arises from the fact that it is through our words that we construct society .
It is with our words that we build our bonds with our fellow men .
We are social animals , we need to talk to our fellows for our basic sanity .
That is why one of the cruelest punishments that men visit upon each other is solitary confinement .
Seize control of a man ’s words , and you have effectively imprisoned him in his skull .
That is why I feel that the right to speech is second to the right to life .
While most people recognize that that the freedom of speech is the right of every person to say whatever he or she wants to say , they often forget that it also includes the right of every person to not say things that he or she does not want to say .
Forcing a person to say what he does not want to say is as bad as gagging him and silencing him .
We can decry pictures of children standing at attention wearing the red scarf of the Young Pioneers uniforms or the shorts of the Hitler Jugend as adults order them to pledge their undying loyalty to a state that plunders them and enslaves them .
However , the sad fact is that while many Americans who would condemn other nations in a heartbeat for demanding such false displays of loyalty are supporters to a systematic version of it being practiced here at home .
Every day , millions of children living in the U.S. are compelled to utter the following words :
“ I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America , and to the Republic for which it stands : one Nation under God , indivisible , With Liberty and Justice for all . ”
Allegiance is a state of loyalty or devotion .
A declaration of allegiance is not something to be taken lightly .
It is a modern form of a declaration of fealty , the oath that a person took under feudalism that bound him to obey his lord ’s commands , even unto death .
The oath these children are ordered to make is loyalty not to any idea or set of principles , but to a flag , a symbol of the state .
Change three words , and a Cuban child could utter it in devotion to Castro , a North Korean to the government of Kim Il Sung , a Scottish child to the British Queen or a French child to the Republic .
This emptiness did not go unnoticed to the public who demanded that politicians correct the matter .
They did not want to give it any principle that would challenge the legitimacy of the state , so they decided to add a loyalty oath to God to distinguish it .
Of course , God is conveniently very lax in enforcing such oaths and so no practical impediment to the power of the state .
Furthermore , I am told that the champions of adding a religious component to the oath carried the day by arguing that no “ godless communist ” could take the oath , marking them for ostracism .
It is not surprising that public schools make this demand of children .
From their inception in 1642 in the Massachusetts Bay Colony , U.S. government schools have had on main purpose : to indoctrinate children in the religion or mores that the state feels most useful .
Useful skills like reading and writing , critical thinking , knowledge of the arts and sciences are all secondary to the goal of indoctrination .
In the case of Massachusetts , the schools were originally intended to induct the children into the state ’s official version of Protestant Christianity rather than the heresies of their parents .
In modern times , the religion is not some strain of Christianity , but rather the worship of the state .
One can see this in the original version of the pledge , which is short and to the point :
Text Meaning I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America , and to the Republic for which it stands : I will be loyal to the state and obey it ’s commands .
one Nation
The state is the people indivisible People are not allowed to secede or withdraw from the state .
With Liberty and Justice for all .
Standard boilerplate conditions that all states , from Iceland to the People ’s Republic of North Korea , claim to establish for the people under their control .
The details of the pledge are damning .
The person who makes it is claiming not only loyalty to the state , but a loyalty that is devoid of any principles and irrevocable under any conditions .
The change to add “ under God ” does nothing to lessen the totalitarian nature of the pledge other than to make the laughable claim that the state is subservient to God .
The United States was originally founded as a nation of conscience .
We can see this in an odd passage early in the Treaty of Amity , Commerce and Navigation , signed in 1794 .
This was the treaty which reestablished diplomatic relations between Britain and the United States of America .
In it the U.S. government made the following pledge towards British subjects remaining in the former colonies after the British Army evacuated it :
“ All settlers and traders , within the precincts or jurisdiction of the said posts , shall continue to enjoy , unmolested , all their property of every kind , and shall be protected therein .
They shall be at full liberty to remain there , or to remove with all or any part of their effects ; and it shall also be free to them to sell their lands , houses or effects , or to retain the property thereof , at their discretion ; such of them as shall continue to reside within the said boundary lines , shall not be compelled to become citizens of the United States , or to take any oath of allegiance to the Government thereof ; but they shall be at full liberty so to do if they think proper . ”
Every few years , some organization sues a school district because it compels children to state the pledge with the clause “ under God ” .
These suits invariably claim that it violates the clause in the U.S. Constitution forbidding the establishment of a state religion .
Unfortunately , these lawsuits miss the main point .
The human rights violation is not that children are forced to pledge their loyalty to God – t is the fact that the children are forced to make any loyalty oath at all !
The pledge of allegiance is not compatible with a free country .
Written by a socialist who sought to indoctrinate children with the idea that they should be servants of the state , it opposes the very principles underlying the Declaration of Independence .
It is the duty of every patriotic American , whose loyalties are to those principles rather than some flag or body of men , to oppose it .
Let the enemies of freedom distinguish themselves by compelling people to take oaths against their will .
Let us once again embrace freedom and expel the rotten pledge of allegiance from our schools .
Four Vermont dairy farms are producing electricity for the utility , and two more are expected to be online by year ’s end , Mr. Costello said .
The utility hopes to add six more farms by 2010 .
Residents and businesses that get their electricity from the program pay a premium of 4 cents a kilowatt hour above the typical rate of 12.5 cents .
Most of that money goes to the farmers , who must purchase their own equipment , which can run up to $ 2 million per farm .
Most farmers expect to make back their investment in 7 to 10 years .
The brothers who own Green Mountain Dairy , Bill and Brian Rowell , were looking to squeeze more profit from their farm , where they have 1,050 cows and have begun acquiring 600 heifers .
Milk prices had dipped and they wanted another source of income .
They also thought that the huge amount of waste their cows produced could be used for something other than fertilizer .
So they decided to give electricity a try , armed with about $ 750,000 in federal , state and utility company grants .
“ We saw this as an economic and environmental management tool , ” Bill Rowell said .
“ It ’s helped to diversify our farm , ” which was named the 2008 Vermont Dairy Farm of the Year .

SOCOM Confrontation is available ( Though most of us will have to wait until tomorrow ) , and many early reports are saying that the title does NOT include Trophies .
There are some rumors going around that FW 2.50 will enable the Trophies and another that a patch is in the works .
Until then , rest easy all you Trophy Whores out there … you are n’t missing out on anything for now .
When Spore owners were silenced by forum moderation staff for posting one too many SecuROM / DRM complaints on the game 's official message boards , the internet - going masses were worked up into a lather .
" Censorship ! " they cried .
" Business practices to which I do n't agree with ! " they shouted .
A vague warning about your Spore user account being banned in conjunction with your forum account likely did n't help matters , giving the impression that loose talk about copy protection could render your game useless .
More responsible forum moderators tried to clear the air yesterday and EA itself let us know that the warning was completely out of line and , more importantly , totally inaccurate .
" These comments are absolutely not true or in - line with EA 's moderation policy , " an EA spokesperson told Kotaku .
" They were made by an over - zealous community volunteer who does not work for EA . "
" Anyone who looks at the boards will clearly see that DRM and other issues are freely discussed on the Spore forums , alongside other topics about the game , " a statement read .
So have at it , kids .
The finer points of anti-piracy schemes are up for discussion !
Just be careful what you name your Spore creations .

From twelve time zones away , it looks as if the United States is in one of those moments where the capacity to get serious and face big problems is sorely tested .
In the short term , a worldwide financial panic and crisis .
Just beyond that , the real economic and social problems that come when large numbers of people lose their jobs , their businesses , their investments , their homes , and even larger numbers become fearful about what might happen to them .
And then , when we get a minute to think , profound global energy and environmental challenges , security concerns that range from loose nukes to terrorist organizations , plus a couple of ongoing wars and ever - rising medical costs .
Just as starters .
The United States is still incredibly rich , powerful , and productive .
But the current situation is no joke , for America or the world .
In these circumstances , and with a presidential election four weeks away , is it conceivable that candidates will waste time arguing whether one of them has been in the same room with a guy who had been a violent extremist at a time before most of today 's U.S. citizens were even born ?
( William Ayres was a Weatherman in the late 1960s .
Today 's median - aged American was born around 1972 . )
Of course , it 's not only conceivable : it 's the Republican plan for this final push -- " turning the page " on economic concerns and getting to these " character " and " association " questions about Barack Obama .
Walking down the hallway at school , an administrator stopped me in my tracks .
I felt her eyes glare from the top of my head , past my torso and down my legs .
She told me that my shorts were too short and that she did n’t want to see me wearing them ever again .
I felt embarrassed and shaken , and for the rest of the day , I wondered if her impression of me had changed simply because of the shorts I was wearing .

MONDAY , SEPTEMBER 15 , 2008 HOWIE JUMPS THE SHARK : Weve read lots of nonsense down through the years .
Today , though , the life - form masquerading as Howard Kurtz really takes the cake .
The highlighted claim must be one of the most ridiculous statements ever put into print by a major newspaper .
Ignore the odd sentence structure : KURTZ ( 9/15/08 ) :
No national candidate in modern history , not even Hillary Clinton , has ever been lambasted and lionized in quite the way Palin is [ sic ] .
Why , for instance , do so many journalists feel compelled to mention her looks ?
Why are her family choices at the center of a noisy , cable - driven debate ?
Why are some Republicans convinced that the media apply a different standard to conservative women and journalists just as convinced that legitimate reporting is being written off as sexist snobbery ?
In a word , that highlighted statement is simply deranged unless were hiding behind the word candidate .
As weve long noted , by the summer of 1999 , two cable news  networks were staging long programs about the vast number of murders the deeply vile Hillary Clinton had staged along with her deeply vile husband .
( Yes , that s righther murders ! )
In real time , Kurtz mentioned one of those programs , in passing but he didnt say a word about the programs astonishing content .
His statement today is simply deranged .
Having married a Republican hit - woman consultant , Kurtz has at last lost his mind .
By the way , a note about looks :  Earth to Kurtz : Journalists have always mentioned candidates looks .
Jack Kennedys looks have been discussed for the past forty - eight years .
Lyndon Johnsons looks were also discussed , unfavorably .
In 2004 and again last year , John Edwards  looks were often mentioned .
Democratic governor Jennifer Granholm ( Michigan ) cant run for national office , being Canadian - born .
But she was named Miss San Carlos ( California ) in 1977 , twelve years after we left the area ; she then had a very brief Hollywood career before going to Harvard Law School , where she became an elitist .
If Granholm were on the Democratic ticket , her looks would be constantly cited , as is now the case in profiles of the Michigan governor .
Has Kurtz been off the planet all these years ?
Is he from a different part of the multiverse ?
Earth to Howie :
What follows is a public discussion of looks  which you chose to ignore .
It occurred in August 1999 , on Special Report , as Brit Hume and a group of simpering boys looked at a photo of Hillary Clinton from the 1970s .
A few days earlier , Bill Clinton had described the way he fell in love with his wife while the two were in law school .
Hume posted his chronologically irrelevant photo , and his simpering boys began laughing : HUME ( 8/23/99 ) :
The picture he paints of Mrs. Clinton is of a sort of a femme fatale .
Now [ posting the picture ] that s about what she looked like then .
[ GROUP LAUGHTER ]
And one one cant help but wonder about this .
[ GROUP LAUGHTER ]
Apparently , the photo didnt evoke Pamela Anderson , so Humes all - boy panel enjoyed a good laugh .
After speculating about how the Clintons were getting along in their marriage , they returned to that decades - old photo : JUAN WILLIAMS :
The problem , Tod , is that nobody can believe , one , that she was this beautiful woman in college , anyone whos seen the pictures .
And , two , who can believe that she didnt know that this guy was a skirt - chaser all along ?
JEFFREY BIRNBAUM : Well , I should point out , about the love - in - college part , that love is blind .
But also 
[ GROUP LAUGHTER ]
HUME :
Well , he never said she was beautiful .
He said she was compelling looking .
And that she may well have been .
[ GROUP CHUCKLING ]
Hume thus gained another round of appreciative laughter from his panel .
By the way , since these boys were so concerned with the past , let s recall Juan Williams  past glory , as described by Kurtz himself , in the Post : KURTZ ( 11/2/91 ) : Washington Post Magazine reporter Juan Williams said yesterday that the newspaper has disciplined him for what he called " wrong " and " inappropriate " verbal conduct toward women staffers and he apologized to his colleagues .
Eight years later , Juan forgot how contrite he once had been , and he enjoyed some more good solid fun .
Back in 1999 , Kurtz said nothing about Humes panel just as he said nothing about the simultaneous discussions of Hillary Clintons murders .
He simply forgot to speak up !
( Al Gore was running for president in this astounding media environmentan environment liberals seldom mention and didnt criticize at the time .
Among many others , Josh and E. J. kept their traps shut , thinking about their careers . )
Today , Howie wants you thinking that no one has been lambasted  like Palin .
In our view , it s time this life - form was dragged off into the woods , where he could get , at public expense , a good solid re-education .
Men in Black had much to teach us about life - forms like Kurtz .
CHARLIE GIBSONS PERFORMANCE FROM NOWHERE :
After watching all his interview sessions with Sarah Palin , Charlie Gibsons final grade took a dive in our grade book .
His strongest segment was the first one , Thursday evenings session on foreign affairs though there too he made some mistakes , some of which cut against Palin ( see below ) .
But Gibsons performance tumbled from there .
In this editorial , the Washington Post said Palin gave an unsettling interview and the paper also complained about a frustrating lack of follow - up questions . 
In our view , Palin did worse than that .
Ditto for Gibson .
[ Note : For transcripts of the full interview sessions , click here .
This transcript seems to be full and unedited , although ABC doesnt quite articulate this claim .
Representations on ABCs web site are routinely unclear . ]
How did Gibson fumble ?
Let us count the ways : Stenographer - gate : Gibson was amazingly weak and uninformative when it came to the Troopergate matter ( page 8 of the ABC transcript ) .
He let Palin discuss the topic at length , but he didnt introduce elementary facts into the discussion .
In August , Palin acknowledged that a half dozen top aides and associates , including her husband , made at least two dozen contacts concerning this matter during her first eighteen months in office , before she fired Walt Mohegan .
This admission contradicted her previous claims , which turned out to be grossly inaccurate .
But Gibsons viewers heard none of that or much of anything at all , except what Palin chose to tell them .
When it came to Troopergate , ABC could have saved Gibsons plane fare .
The network could simply have aired an infomercial in which Palin just said what she pleased .
What , him prepare : The Post was right to criticize Gibsons lack of follow - up questions .
This was one such complaint : WASHINGTON POST ( 9/14/08 ) :
Her efforts to explain some previous statements were lacking in candor ... [ S ] he denied any turnabout on climate change despite having said , in 2007 , " I 'm not an Al Gore , doom - and - gloom environmentalist blaming the changes in our climate on human activity . 
On its face , Palins denial was quite hard to credit .
Yet here was Gibson , letting her apparent lack of candor go completely unchallenged : GIBSON : Color me a cynic , but I hear a little bit of change in your policy there , when you say , yes , now you 're beginning to say it is man-made .
It sounds to me like you 're adapting your position to Sen. McCain's .
PALIN : I think you are a cynic , because show me where I have ever said that there 's absolute proof that nothing that man has ever conducted or engaged in has had any affect , or no affect , on climate change .
Pitiful .
Gibson simply moved on at that point , letting this groaner stand .
Palins denial was typically slippery .
No , she has never said theres absolute proof about the causes of climate change .
But she did offer that standard snark about the views of Stupid Old Gore , and there are one or two other past statements which sound a good deal like it .
Many pundits criticized Tim Russert for playing gotcha with pols past statements .
( We dont think weve ever voiced that generic complaint , though Russert played that card quite hard . )
But in this matter , Gibson failed to present Palins past statements at a time when he clearly should have .
Gibson was either unprepared , or unwilling to challenge a fairly clear misrepresentation by Palin .
The Post also cited Gibsons lack of follow - up on Palins statements about abortion .
They were right about that as well .
In her 2006 gubernatorial debates , and in this interview , Palin has tended to be slick and slippery when questioned about such topics .
Gibson let her slip - slide away , much as the Post describes .
He cant ear you :
The Post complained about Palins disappointingly shallow discussion of earmarks .
But this criticism could have been aimed at Gibson as well : WASHINGTON POST : Even on the domestic issues about which she could have been expected to have more familiarity , Ms. Palin 's responses were disappointingly shallow .
Defending her state 's and her own record on earmarks , Ms. Palin suggested that the problem was not shoveling money toward pet projects but the failure to make this shoveling transparent seemingly not recognizing that this is far different from the more fundamental complaint of her running mate , John McCain .
The " Bridge to Nowhere , " after all , was no secret .
Duh .
But Palin got away with this disappointingly shallow presentation because Gibson failed to note this distinction .
Her presentation wasnt just shallow it was slick and slippery .
Gibson didnt seem to now and / or care .
At times , Gibsons fumbling cut against Palin .
As we noted on Friday , he misrepresented a past statement by Palin about Iraq and in the foreign policy segment , ABC omitted a chunk in which Palin said ,  We will not repeat a Cold War .
We must have good relationship with our allies ( see page 2 ) .
Though this construct was offered repeatedly and thus sounded scripted , it made Palin sound less reflexively hawkish than the material ABC chose to air .
And Gibsons initial question about the Bush Doctrine was plainly designed as a gotcha .
There s nothing automatically wrong with such questions , and we thought that Palins fumbling answers were extremely instructive .
But Gibsons question was somewhat vague ( though not as vague as some have alleged ) , and it was somewhat forced .
For the record ,  the Bush Doctrine just is nt an every - day term .
In the twelve months before Palins interview , the phrase had appeared only seven times in the Washington Postonly five times in serious contexts .
( One of the uses was a throw - away line in a movie review ; one was a throw - away joke in a piece about gardening . )
For our taste , if Gibson wanted to quiz Plain on her foreign policy knowledge , he should have just just said as much , explaining why he was doing so .
But for our money , Gibsons most instructive fumbling came when he tried to challenge Palins hero tale about the Bridge to Nowhere .
Gibson gigantically failed in this matter , helping bring a sense of closure to his cohorts fumbling of this topic .
Palin has introduced herself to the public through this grossly misleading tale ; Gibsons inability to sort this out is emblematic of a multimillionaire press corps that is too fat , too lazy and far too inept to sift through such spin and distortion .
Did Sarah Palin tell the Congress to take their Bridge to Nowhere and shove it ?
Actually , no she did no such thing ; her hero tale is a gross deception .
Tomorrow , well end our discussion of this key hero tale by showing you Charlie Gibson , media giant , as he fumbles , flounders and fails with this ongoing topic .
Eight years ago , people like Gibson were completely unable to debunk a set of lies about Gore .
His performance with Palin helps show why that happened .
Gibsons multimillionaire colleagues tends to be lazy , incompetent , weak .
In a word , Charlie Gibsons unskilled .
Your nations most vital interests are compromised by this vast problem .
Special report :
By dint of their narratives !
BE SURE TO READ EACH THRILLING INSTALLMENT : John McCain is on his way to the White House by dint of his partys well - entrenched narratives .
Well explain this matter all week ; your big pundits simply cant do it .
See THE DAILY HOWLER , 9/13/08 , for a brief and fumbling Part 1 of this important discussion .
PART 2DEFENDING THE FLAG : Grrr! Grrr-snap !
Grrr-snap !
Grrr-owwwwl !
Joe Klein was snarling and snapping last week , tugging hard at his rhinestoned leash .
Klein was recalling the way the vile John McCain apologized after Campaign 2000 apologized for repeatedly lying during the South Carolina primary .
I cant wait till he tries it again , Klein snapped last week .
Grr! Grrrrr-snap !
Grrrr-owwwwl !!
KLEIN ( 9/10/08 ) : Back in 2000 , after John McCain lost his mostly honorable campaign for the Republican presidential nomination , he went about apologizing to journalists including me for his most obvious mis-step : his support for keeping the confederate flag on the state house .
Now he is responsible for one of the sleaziest ads I 've ever seen in presidential politics , so sleazy that I wo n't abet its spread by linking to it , but here 's the McLatchy fact check .
I just can't wait for the moment when John McCain contrite and suddenly honorable again in victory or defeattalks about how things got a little out of control in the passion of the moment .
Talk about putting lipstick on a pig .
Please note : Even today , Klein cant force himself to say to it : John McCain repeatedly lied about that flag during Campaign 2000 .
The best he can do is refer to this as McCains  most obvious mis-step . 
And just for the record , McCain didnt simply apologize to reporters  after it no longer mattered that year .
He paraded down to South Carolina , where he staged a large public spectacle a spectacle which angered Palmetto Republicans , thereby winning him praise from fawning journos all over the mainstream press corps .
( For a recent post on this tired old tale , see THE DAILY HOWLER , 8/8/08 . )
At any rate , Klein was really showing some anger when he offered his leash - snapping post last week .
And as always happens at moments like this , liberal bloggers admiringly linked to him .
Liberal bloggers stood in line to praise Klein for his great , true , heartfelt effort .
Sorry .
Our reaction was vastly different ; it was one of utter contempt .
You see , we could recall the clownish way Klein reacted to McCains apology in real time to the self - glorying apology McCain produced after it no longer mattered .
McCain staged his event in April 2000 : I lied about the flag , he boo - hooed and of course , he alleged he was sorry .
And sure enough : Mainstream journalists stood in line to boo - hoo - hoo along with McCain and to praise his vast moral greatness .
Example :
In a column headlined  Political courage ,  the Boston Globes Joan Vennochi praised McCains great battle for courage before lashing out at Gores troubling character .
It s hard to get much dumber than this .
But a string of big journalists  tried : VENNOCHI ( 4/25/00 ) :
The battle over Elian [ Gonzalez ] dominates the news .
But I am still thinking about John McCain 's battle for courage in today 's political arena .
Maybe they are not unconnected .
Before the weekend rescue mission in Miamiwhile the little Cuban boy was still being paraded around by distant relatives the Arizona senator apologized for betraying what he called the most important principle of his bid for the Republican presidential nomination : saying and doing what you truly believe , regardless of the political consequences .
McCain traveled to South Carolina last week to confess that he did not reveal his true feelings when asked his view of the Confederate battle flag flying over the state house .
At one point during the campaign , McCain said he considered the flag " offensive " and a " symbol of racism and slavery . "
The next day , he reversed himself and called the flag " a symbol of heritage . "
Later , he said : " My forefathers fought under the Confederate flag .
I believe that they believed their service was honorable . "
McCain gave this reason for his conflicting responses : " I feared that if I answered honestly , I could not win in the South Carolina primary .
So I chose to compromise my principles .
I broke my promise to always tell the truth . "
It is fascinating that a man who had the courage to face torture and death as a prisoner of war lacked the courage to face defeat as a political candidate .
McCain endured immense physical and psychological pain in the midst of war .
In the heat of something much less mere political battle he blinked . [...]
As McCain acknowledged last week , " Honesty is easy after the fact , when my own interests are no longer involved . "
Still , he finally said and did what he believed , and that is worth something to those who wanted him to do it when it mattered more politically .
Like many colleagues , Vennochi expressed high regard for the fact that McCain had finally said what he believed .
But how did she know that McCain had done that ?
How did she know that he wasnt playing the issue again , to gain the praise of mainstream reporters ?
She had no way of knowing , of course  but she did know her cohorts most trusted narrative .
Saint John McCain is a man of high character !
To a long string of script - reading scribes , even his lying now proved it !
Vennochis piece about courage was silly .
( For our real - time reaction , click here , then scroll down to 5/19/00 . )
But this silly piece virtually defines the way McCain achieved his reputation for honesty the reputation hes now riding hard on his way to the White House .
It s very hard to turn around a narrative as old and entrenched as this one .
Indeed , McCain is now lying his keister off , gambling that he can survive seven weeks without a new narrative forming in the press corps , or in voters heads .
In short , hes taking advantage of all the times the press corps called him the worsts greatest man .
This reputation is one of the narratives with which McCain is now beating Obama .
Lets be frank :
Over the course of the past dozen years , everything has proven McCains charactereven his blatant lying .
And oh yes :
In the wake of McCains self - glorying apology , no one wailed about his greatness as much as Joe Klein did .
No one constructed more excuses for the great mans previous lying .
Last weeks barking and snapping were AWOL .
Instead , Klein paraded about , playing the fool , inventing a string of elaborate excuses for the fact that the great man had lied .
Some examples : A few weeks after McCains high - profile public apology , Klein went on the cable show Russert .
During the hour , he trashed the character of the deeply vile Goreand he explained to his host why McCain had lied to Palmetto State voters .
 It s really difficult to make the right decisions ,  he said , telling Russert that McCain was one of the most honorable people that either of us have ever covered .
In this exchange , Klein kissed the ass of the bald - faced liar whose lies he now claims to despise : KLEIN ( 5/6/00 ) :
You were talking before about how difficult all the decisions are in the heat of the campaign .
Just think of what McCain did .
McCain is one of the most honorable people that either of us have ever covered , and he went down to South Carolina [ after quitting the race ] and admitted that he had taken a position on the Confederate flag purely for political reasons and and apologized for it .
I think that all these people are faced with those kinds of decisions all the time .
And I do n't even think that we should demand that they make the right one all the time because because politics is the process of getting to the right conclusion through means that are n't always so savory .
RUSSERT : So the end justifies the means ?
KLEIN : Not every time .
I mean , you have to make very careful calculations ...
RUSSERT : So John McCain makes a calculation .
 If I come out in a Republican primary in South Carolina and say , Take the Confederate flag down , I lose the primary and I 'm finished .
I cannot win the Republican nomination .
I can't win the presidency and I can't bring my reform agenda to Washington ; therefore , I 'm going to finesse my position a little bit .
Say something I really do n't believe because , you know , it 's really a small issue compared to the large scheme of things . 
KLEIN : Well , you know , the funny thing about that is that it was really a stupid decision politically , I think .
I think it would have been much smarter for him to condemn the Confederate flag .
He would have gotten publicity all over the rest of the country .
I think part of what happened to McCain is that the campaign ended before a great many Americans even knew that it had begun .
And and if he had taken the courageous position , the word would have gotten out and he would have felt better about himself .
But the the point is that it 's really difficult to make , you know , the right decision under that kind of pressure all the time .
And I might add that it 's not only when the cameras are pointed at you in anger .
When you have all these cameras pointed at you in adulation , it 's hard to think clearly , too .
Boo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo !
In accord with the press corps greatest script , Klein explained away McCains lying .
 When you have all these cameras pointed at you in adulation , it 's hard to think clearly ,  he ass - kissingly said .
But then , Klein paraded all about that spring , making similar presentation on a string of cable programs .
( He was pimping his new novel , The Running Mate , whose noble main character seemed to be patterned on the great Saint McPerfect . )
When he did Crossfire , he explained the origin of his novel .
Boo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo !
John McCain was a great , great saintand Klein was a hapless acolyte : KLEIN ( 5/2/00 ) : I was having a conversation like that with John McCain four years ago at the [ 1996 ]
Republican convention and he told me that being fingered as part of the Keating Five was more difficult for him emotionally in some ways than being a prisoner of war because his honor had been called into question .
And my first thought was ,  Oh , my God .
I mean , this is one of the most honorable people I know . 
And my second thought was ,  Well , that might be a novel . 
Sad .
Before getting conned by Saint McCain about his lying in South Carolina , Klein got conned by Saint McCain about his role in the Keating Five .
Needless to day , McCain had dragged Vietnam into the stew as he slickly gained Kleins sympathy .
Last Saturday , Bob Herbert referred to the profound double standard shaping coverage of this years election .
In some ways , Herbert overstated the matter but profound double standards have long been at play , and it is nt clear that people like Herbert are willing to say what they are .
This looks like a Democratic year , pundits say but they ignore the fact that the GOP is in control of the nations most powerful narratives .
These narratives shape a good deal of the coverage .
Beyond that , they help explain why voters are persuaded by some claims , are skeptical of others .
John McCain is the worlds most honest man !
This has been one of the press corps most treasured narratives over the course of the past dozen years .
Losers like Klein nailed this script into place ; it makes us gag when we see web liberals praise him now for his snapping and growling .
Could our liberal leaders  be any dumber about the actual shape of our politics ?
Could they possibly be more tolerant of the people who created this fix ?
Truly , our movement is led by children .
And the Democratic Party itself has long been a part of this game .
John McCain is the worlds most honest man !
It s only one of the powerful narratives we will examine in this weeks series .
But McCain is on his way to power by dint of these tales .
Indeed : Yesterday , there it was again !
On This Week , weak - minded Jay Carney sat next to his wife and issued a famous old memorized tale .
Moments like this created the narrative McCain will ride to the White House : CARNEY ( 9/14/08 ) :
We re returning to a culture war making it a cultural distinction .
As youve said , this has divided conservatives and liberals , Republicans and Democrats .
What is distinct about this is how un -John McCain - like it is , and 
This is the John McCain who went to South Carolina for no reason except to clear his conscience , to apologize for not taking a stand against the Confederate flag .
It s not the same man who is running that race .
Truly , that s astounding .
Even now , it hasnt crossed this simpletons mind that  the John McCain who went to South Carolina may have been insincere , even then .
In fact , McCain dissembled and lied in various ways in the course of that 2000 race about George Bush , about Candidate Gore .
But so what ?
These simpletons memorized childish tales , and even now , they want to recite them .
Even yesterday , Carney seemed to insist that the real John McCain was / is an honorable man .
In this way , the narratives which drive this campaign have been hammered into place .
This creates a set of profound double standards .
Herbert cant explain this .
We will .
TOMORROW PART 3 : Dems tell liesand Republicans dont .
Kinsley , today and back then .
There are three problems with Bill Maher ’s new movie mocking faith :
It misunderstands religion , misconceives God and gets human nature all wrong .
I have a fantasy of a counter - movie .
I would travel around the world and interview every scientist with a crackpot theory or a quack cure .
I ’d find researchers who were venal , eccentric , foolish or cruel , throwing in a few responsible scientists for credibility .
Call it , say , “ Scientifictious . ”
Of course , that would be no more convincing than “ Religulous . ”
Religion is not univocal ; there are lots of varieties and personalities .
There is no shortage of strange beliefs and practices .
There is ample opportunity for derision .
Think of the movie he could have made about people ’s eating habits .
What Maher seems not to know , or to understand , is that religion is not a fantasy flung upward but an intuition of something far greater than ourselves .
Everyone who lives with open eyes has reason to question .
In the search there will be missteps , even cruelties and division , but also sublimity , kindness , beauty , wonder and faith .
Perhaps
Maher ’s greatest misunderstanding of religion is his central indictment : that religion is responsible for the world ’s violence .
It is not .
Violence is a product of human nature .
Before monotheism , the Assyrians were not kind ; the Romans were bloodthirsty beyond the imagination of religious regimes .
When religion became less potent in people ’s lives after the French Revolution , instead of making the world less violent , it became far more violent : World War I and WWII , communism , Nazism -- all shed blood on an unprecedented scale .
None were religious regimes or religious wars .
Maher ’s dislike of religion is not reasoned , however , but visceral .
He told Mother Jones magazine about the Jews praying on his plane to Israel : “ Even on the plane over , they were , at a certain point , they all stood up in the aisle of the plane davening [ praying ] ... they just looked like crazy people , always bowing their head .
It ’s disconcerting . ”
No doubt had they worn Armani suits and been tapping at a keyboard , Mr. Maher would have found them rational ; but seeking transcendence in coach -- crazy .
If faith is , in part , the summit of our hopes , a guide and an aspiration , then what does Maher ’s creed leave him with ?
Again , as he tells Mother Jones : “ I ’m telling you .
I ’ve got nothing . ”
It should not be hard to understand why someone might choose ancient wisdom over modern nihilism .
It is not heroic to believe we are accidents of chemistry .
Maher ’s view of human nature as essentially animalistic ( he repeatedly wonders why anyone would curb their sexual appetites ) is dispiriting and plain wrong .
Animals we are , but we are much more than animals .
Maher misunderstands
God as a projection of human need .
This is a common atheistic trope -- your belief is based on psychological deficiencies , while mine is reasoned .
In truth , the existence of God is not an antidote to fear but a consequence of wonder .
God does not come about through faulty reasoning but through a worshipful and humble orientation of the soul .
“ Religulous ” repeatedly calls faith irrational .
True , it is not a product of pure reason , but then what is , apart from mathematics ?
Reason does not get us out of bed , or move us to love or kindness .
Religion is supported by reason , however .
The marvel of values , ideas and consciousness -- nonphysical but powerful phenomena -- can reasonably be thought to have an origin in a nonphysical entity : that is , God .
Centuries of people emboldened by , and ennobled by , faith can reasonably be thought to have something more than foolish illusions in their minds and hearts .
Nevertheless , Maher calls religion a “ neurological disorder . ”
In study after study , religion proves to make people not just happier but more likely to give to charity and have stable marriages , to reduce drug and alcohol dependence and improve mental health .
That does not make it true , but it is worthy of thought :
Why should something so “ irrational , ” a mere “ neurological disorder , ” be so helpful to society ?
Many of us suspect -- or yes , believe -- that there is more to the world than we know , that there is a mystery at its heart .
That mystery may evoke some unworthy speculation , attract some charlatans , occasion some cruelties .
Faith is also the spur for everything from the poetry of Psalms to the Cathedral at Chartres to relief missions .
“ Religulous ” is one - dimensional .
Religion is as varied and colorful as God ’s blessed world .
David Wolpe is the rabbi of Sinai Temple in Los Angeles and the author of “ Why Faith Matters . ”
Rather than rely only on the usual educational pamphlet , Dr. Bindeshwar Pathak ( Founder of the
Sulabh Sanitation Movement ) decided to open The Toilet Museum in New Delhi .
What is it all about ?
Here is a brief introduction ( in their own words ) :
" The Museum has a rare collection of facts , pictures and objects detailing the historic evolution of toilets from 2,500 BC to date .
It gives a chronology of developments relating to technology , toilet related social customs , toilet etiquettes , the sanitary conditions and legislative efforts of the times .
It has an extensive display of privies , chamber pots , toilet furniture , bidets and water closets in use from 1145 AD to the modern times .
It also has a rare collection of beautiful poems . "

Setup for a Stolen Election ?
AP Poll " Tightens "
Setup for a Stolen Election ?
AP Poll " Tightens " Race to a Point Michael Collins
" Scoop " Independent News
The Associated press came out with a remarkable poll Thursday .
It claimed that the presidential race had tightened from the consistent leads Obama has shown over the past weeks to become one of those " too close to call " national elections .
Their poll , conducted by German polling firm GfK , showed 44 % for Obama and 43 % for McCain .
How could this be ?
In the Real Clear Politics average of major national polls , Oct 24 , Obama 's average lead is 7.5 % .
The four national polls conducted on the same days as the AP poll show an average 9.2 % Obama lead .
The polls after the AP " tightening " effort shows an 8.7 % Obama lead .
Clearly the AP - GfK poll is an exception or outlier , as those are called .
Yet the AP presents this as news , not opinion .
What is AP Up To ?
AP acknowledges that its poll is different from the other national polls but claims it 's not " alone . "
It is n't .
There is exactly one other poll that agrees with AP out of 16 presented on the Real Clear Politics summary for Oct. 24 .
AP ignores the tentative nature of the poll and presents the story as " news . "
It begins drawing conclusions from the poll at the start of the article with " rumors " from unidentified sources ;
" The poll , which found Obama at 44 percent and McCain at 43 percent , supports what some Republicans and Democrats privately have said in recent days : that the race narrowed after the third debate as GOP - leaning voters drifted home to their party and McCain 's " Joe the plumber " analogy struck a chord . "
AP , Oct. 23 , 2008
Reviewing the internal details and questions of the poll analysis by GfK , there are no questions about Joe the Plumber .
Since this is the opening claim , mentioned again as central to the shift AP is selling us , it 's important to look at how the debate was viewed by the public .
CNN and CBS both did national polls the evening of the debate .
CNN reported that 58 % of those watching the debate thought Obama won , with only 31 % favoring McCain .
CBS polled uncommitted voters who judged Obama the winner over McCain by 53 % to 22 % .
This was the biggest margin for Obama for the series of three counters .
What was going on with the AP sample of voters ?
AP 's Flawed Poll
The Associated Press is no stranger to polling .
It is the lead sponsor for the national exit polls for Presidential and Congressional elections .
Their recent effort in 2006 surveyed over 13,000 individuals and produced detailed demographic results on voters that actually contradict their current effort .
The built in bias of the AP poll is obvious when one reviews the internals .
45 % of the 800 person likely voter sample described themselves as " born again or evangelical " Christians .
The remaining 55 % said no ( AP - GfK p. 24 ) .
AP should have known that it 's 2006 exit poll showed that 36 % of respondents were born again , a much lower percentage than included in their McCain friendly poll of yesterday .
Also , AP should have known the 2006 exit poll the group had a 60 % preference for Republican candidates over Democrats .
The election magic for McCain was complete before the presidential preferences were even sampled .
The over representation of Christians and the born agains in the sample guaranteed a preference for McCain .
But there was more .
A look at the poll shows that 1,101 registered voters were surveyed .
The final poll consisted of 800 " likely voters " taken from that group .
The registered voters divided up with 48 % for Obama and 38 % for McCain .
The reduction of Obama support and increase for McCain indicates that McCain 's voters are highly motivated to turnout while Obama 's are more likely to stay home .
This contradicts the actual evidence available showing major gains in newly registered voters for Obama and huge advantages in primary turnout for Democrats compared Republicans .
It 's small crowds for McCain and record breaking gatherings for Obama around the country , including 35,000 in Leesburg , Virginia on Thursday Oct. 23 .
In polling , the sample determines the outcome of a poll .
If you bias the poll sample toward groups that are well known to support one party , then the poll will reflect that sample selection .
In this case , AP , GfK did just that .
They created a Republican friendly sample which displayed more motivation to vote because it started out Republican friendly .
The AP - GfK " Giveaway "
Within the details of the poll , there 's a major clue that something is very wrong .
The likely voter sample was asked questions that are directly related to attacks and negative campaigning .
Voters are consistent in decrying what they perceive as unfair attacks .
Note how they perceive each candidate 's " attacks " during the campaign :
AP wants us to believe that the same sample that made these responses also showed lower than average support for Obama and higher for McCain even .
A clear majority describe McCain and Palin as " mostly unfair " in their attacks on Obama .
An equally clear majority of the sample say that the Obama and Biden attacks on McCain are " mostly fair . "
Are They Preparing Us for a " Surprise ? "
On a recent Larry King show , the anchors for the major networks were asked for a prediction on the presidential election .
Brian Williams of NBC practically came out of his seat when he encouraged viewers to get up and " run " from anyone who tells you that they know how this election will come out .
The other anchors echoed these sentiments .
This is the very worst type of news commentary .
How could Williams know that a month or so ago ?
Why would the others just bob their heads ?
Are they preparing us for something " special ? "
The analysis of the AP , ABC , CBS , CNN , FOX , NBC " media consortium " final exit poll might provide a clue : Election 2004 : The Urban Legend .
The past is prolog .

John Carmack , creator of the childhood - innocence - purging video games Doom and Quake , has finally lead his team of rocketeers at Armadillo Aerospace to victory in the annual Northrop Grumman Lunar Landing challenge .
In its third year of participation , Armadillo Aerospace has snagged $ 350,000 in prize money for winning Level One of the two - tiered competition held October 24 to 25 at Las Cruces International Airport in New Mexico .
Armadillo 's winning vehicle " Pixel " was able to rise to an altitude of 50 meters and touch down on a landing pad 100 meters away , while staying aloft for at least 90 seconds .
The team then had to refuel and repeat the challenge in reverse within two and a half hours .
The competition is sponsored by NASA 's Centennial Challenges program with a total purse of $ 2 m designed to promote commercial space technology .
Level
Two requires contestants to navigate a larger vehicle designed to stay aloft for twice as long and land on a simulated lunar terrain .
Carmack 's team made an attempt at Level
Two this year , but were stymied by technical problems .
As a result , $ 1.65 m in prize money remains on the table for future competitions .
" It 's great that we won the Level One , " said Carmack .
" We 're going to keep working towards Level Two , which we can hopefully compete for again soon .
We know exactly what we need to nail down and expect to have it solved in the next couple of weeks . "
Although nine teams were registered for the 2008 challenge , only two ended up flying their vehicles this year .
The other competitor , Chicago - based TrueZer0 , was able to reach a height of 50 meters , but was unable to complete the 100 meter translation to the second landing pad .
Armadillo 's entry for 2007 ended on its fourth attempt that year when the vehicle 's engine exploded on ignition .
The previous year , victory was snatched away when the lander 's legs kept breaking off .
The X - Prize Foundation has a highlight video of day one of the competition , including Armadillo 's winning flight
There 's also a clip of the second day 's unsuccessful attempt at Level Two , along with Carmack explaining what went wrong .
Presidential Race Missing on Ballots ; Machines Go Down ; Votes Not Recorded ; Printers Jam
Attorneys Decline to Take Action to Remove Machines From Service , Ensure Paper Ballots for Voters ...
Brad Friedman Byon
11/3/2008 , 7:31 pm PT
Wide - spread voting machine failures have been reported to the Obama / DNC election protection hotline in Nevada since early voting began more than a week ago in the state , The BRAD BLOG has learned .
All voters who vote in person in the crucial battleground state are forced to cast their votes on 100 % unverifiable Sequoia EDGE touch - screen voting machines with the VeriVote " paper trail " printer add - on .
Attorneys monitoring the incident reports coming in to the hotline have taken no action in regard to removing the failed machines from service , despite reports of the presidential race not appearing at all on some ballots ; voters having problems selecting their preferred candidates ; machines not starting up at all ; " paper trail " printers jamming or running out of paper , and ; a number of machines at a number of sites which refuse to work at all .
And this is just during early voting .
A number of those startling reports are posted at the end of this article ...
Democratic Officials Refuse to Impound Machines , Despite Myriad Failures ...
We 've been reporting for weeks about the lack of action being taken by the Obama campaign and the DNC in regard to wide - spread voting machine problems across the country ( e.g. , detailed story on that here , Obama attorney responds here ) .
We 've noted that while Obama / DNC has , this time around at least , compiled a sophisticated " election protection " database in each state , their continuous assertions of " thousands of attorneys on the ground on Election Day if anything goes wrong , " is both too little and too late , as well as being precisely what we heard from Kerry / DNC in 2004 before they failed to take appropriate action with failed machines .
They then quickly conceded the race just hours after polls in Ohio finally closed .
The Obama / DNC response to wide - spread problems with voting machines failing in state after state has been no better than Kerry / DNC's , in that failed machines have been allowed to stay in service , and their attorneys have not fought for paper ballots for voters instead .
In fact , in Pennsylvania , state Democrats have been fighting against paper ballots .
Even after the NAACP successfully sued the state Dems ( who were joined for a time during the case by state Republicans ) to require them to have some emergency paper ballots on hand , it 's become clear that county officials in that crucial battleground state are likely to not have enough paper ballots at polling places for voters in the completely - predictable event of voting machine breakdown .
PA also uses 100 % unverifiable touch - screen systems across most of the state .
We 've urged the Democrats to take action to remove problem machines from service , such as those flipping votes on screens in so many states and even failing to register Oprah 's vote .
We advised them to impound such machines rather than dangerously calling for them to be " recalibrated " in the middle of the election .
They have not done so .
Anywhere .
The following reports from the Obama / DNC " Atlas Voter Protection " database in NV , concerning the state 's faulty , error - prone , hackable , 100 % unverifiable Sequoia touch - screen systems are remarkable .
These are the same machines that Sen. Harry Reid ( D - NV ) recently said voters in his state were " fortunate " to have , during a radio interview in Reno . ( 3 minute MP3 here . )
The senator was convinced that the " Voter - Verifiable Paper Audit Trail " printed by the machine somehow offered protection for voters , even though the paper trails on such systems often fail and are not properly verified for accuracy by a majority of voters .
Moreover , the " paper trails " on these machines can be hacked as well , in such a way that the tampered totals would match the internally tampered numbers , even if officials bothered to count them , which they do n't .
( See UCSB 's video demonstrating how to hack such machines in seconds , in such a way that even a 100 % hand - count would be unlikely to reveal the tampering . )
The machines used in Nevada --- and illegally certified there , see the exposé we published in Mark Crispin Miller 's Loser Take All on that --- are also the same ones that dropped Oprah 's vote when she early voted in Cook County ( Chicago ) , IL , last week .
So read on for just a few of the hundreds of startling reports coming in to the Obama incident report database , including details of machines on which the presidential race is not available at all ( as reported by even a GOP poll monitor , according to the incident report ! ) , voters unable to select Obama , and machines which are failing to start up at all in many locations across the state ... all before Election Day voting has even begun ...
( And see the list at the bottom of this page for steps you can take if you are forced to vote on touch - screen machines and have similar problems with one of them ! )
Selected incident reports from the Barack Obama / DNC " Atlas Voter Protection " database in Nevada ...
Presidential contest does n't appear on ballots : " A GOP poll monitor , Derek , told our poll monitor that he had personally observed on 7 separate occasions the machines fail to show a choice for president .
The GOP monitor saw this at Spanish Springs ( 2 times ) and Northwest Library ( 5 times ) .
Martin Putnam , our poll monitor , received 1 report from a voter about this at Sierra View on 10/18/08 . "
" ONE OF OUR SENIORS REPORTED THAT WHEN VOTING THIS WEEKEND AT ONE OF THE SMITH'S FOOD KING SUPERMARKET , THERE WAS NO BOX TO VOTE FOR BARACK OBAMA ....
AND THE WORKERS COULDN'T CORRECT IT SO SHE DOESN'T KNOW IF HER SELECTIONS WENT THROUGH OR NOT . "
" Voter personally had no problem , but voter next to him at voting machines had complained he wanted to vote for obama , but ' it was n't there ' ; poll worker assisted , and issue was resolved satisfactorily to voter .
Making incident report only in case there 's a problem with machine ; more likely , voter may have somehow accidentally triggered touch screen . "
" Veronika Baumgartner was not able to select a choice for president .
She reviewed her printout and did not see a vote for president .
She cast her ballot without revising it .
It was the second machine from the right . "
Machines broken down .
For example : " One machine down -- Sequoia called .
Team leader told Nancy that machine was down yesterday -- they had it fixed and it worked for 1 / 2 hour today is down again . "
" Only 5 of 10 machines up and running at UNR [ University of Nevada , Reno ] .
Poll workers are trying to fix the problem . "
" All voting machines down due to team leader error .
Estimated delay of 30 minutes to begin voting . "
" There is an electrical problem at the Downtown Reno Libarary .
6 out of 11 machines are down . "
" Three out of 12 machines broke down .
Broke while three voters were voting .
Broken machine numbers # 32965 , #32969 , # 32873 . "
Voter registration ( e- pollbook ) problems at several sites .
For example : " Both check - in laptops have gone off - line ( internet issue ) and no one is being permitted to check - in to vote .
Apparently the line has n't gotten that long yet .
Observer will call back in 5 - 10 min to update the situation . "
Machines behaving oddly : " Machine would n't let voter edit choices . "
" Elizabeth marked her votes on the electronic voting machine at Sun Valleys Library at around 2 pm - on Machine number WC1384 .
She was directed to review the ballot , which she did .
She was then directed to review the ballot on the printout , which she did .
Everything seemed to work correctly UNTIL she touched ' CAST YOUR BALLOT ' .
At that point , instead of casting the ballot the voting machine returned to a page she had seen approximately four screens before that said ' return ' or ' continue ' .
After that she tried to press continue .
The screen went blank and her card was ejected .
Then the screen looked like it was ready for a newvoter .
Elizabeth said her profession has to do with data , so that is why she wrote down the machine number .
Also , she said the machine took so long going between the ' wrong ' screens that it made her wonder if there was some computing going on - and if that was going to cause some inaccuracy in the electronic recording of her vote on the voting machine data cartridge - even though the printout had looked correct .
Elizabeth told the poll worker named Diane H. who remarked that she was aware of the misfunction .
After that , Elizabeth went to another polling place , Scolari 's Food and Drug at 3310 S. McCarron and asked the voting official if they had noticed anything like that .
The official told her something similar had happened at that polling place . "
" Voter - Verifiable Paper Audit Trail " ( VVPAT ) printers failing : " Machine printer broken , not recording votes .
Several voters have voted on machine without being able to verify their paper record . "
" As [ BH ] was voting , experienced machine malfunction -- tape did not advance so she could review her own vote , continued to display votes of previous voter ( who voted for Obama , which Ms. [ H ] did not wish to do ) .
Team leader told her the electronic vote had been recorded on the cassette .
Machine involved was # 34348 . "
" Paper roll shortage at UNR .
They have told the county .
Five machines are down because of lack of paper .
All ran out at the same time .
Paper is on the way .
The line wait is about 30 min .
Only 3 or 4 machines are operating .
I do n't understand why they have n't anticipated this . "
" Machine # 34124 had a jammed paper receipt .
Poll workers unjammed it .
Manny , the assistant team leader for Mobile Team # 7 stated that the machine vote tally at the time was 295 " " Printer 411 on machine 34319 stopped working after first vote so printer was switched to printer 424 . "
" Printer on voting machine # 34241 was replaced at 4:00 pm .
Team leader Carol told our PM that it was jammed .
Vote tally was aprpoximately 560 at the time " " Voting machine had to have printer replaced .
Machine was down 10 minutes . "

Transcript
Jon Stewart :
My guest tonight is a United States Senator representing the great state of Illinois .
He is also the Democratic nominee for president .
Joining us now via satellite from Sunrise , Florida , please welcome back to the program , Senator Barack Obama .
Senator , nice to see you
Barack Obama : Hi , Jon .
Jon Stewart : How are you , sir ?
Hold on one second .
I ’m sorry .
He ’s not actually here .
He ’s on the satellite .
Our audience very excited , sir .
Clearly our show is not a swing show , if you will .
Thank you so much for taking the time .
How are you holding up ?
How are things going ?
Barack Obama :
You know , I ’m doing great .
We are now counting down every single day .
And , you know , the crowds are terrific .
And you know , I think we ’ve got a good shot at this thing .
Jon Stewart :
Where are you right now ?
Barack Obama : I am in Fort Lauderdale , and we are going to have a rally tonight , and actually , we ’re going to go to Orlando .
We have an 11:00 p.m. rally with William Jefferson Clinton which I think is going to be terrific .
Jon Stewart : William Jefferson Clinton and you in Florida .
Now , I know Florida , many of my people go there to retire .
You might want to hold the rally early .
They do n’t like to miss their shows at night or the early - bird special at the diner .
So , whatever you can … .
Barack Obama :
No comment on that , Jon . I ’m trying to win Florida .
Jon Stewart :
What a wise man .
I thought that at this point , you would be doing sort of a four corners offense , playing kind of a delay game , but you really are going at it .
Tell me about this half - hour special that aired earlier tonight .
What is this ?
Barack Obama : Well , this is the Obama infomercial .
I ’ll tell you a quick story .
We ’re buying time on a lot of the stations .
I was describing this to Michelle and my daughters , and Malia who is ten , she said “ Hold up a second .
Are you saying my programs are going to be interrupted ? ” I said no we did n’t buy on Disney .
She was relieved , but for everybody else who wants to watch , they ’re going to have a chance to take a look at not just sort of a pitch for me but really what we try to do is tell a story about what ’s happening in families all across America .
We ’ve got four families that we feature .
All of them have great hopes , but all of them are struggling too .
We want to talk about what the next four years would mean for them .
Jon Stewart :
Will it annoy us ?
Or will we like it ?
Afterwards , will we think , did he just sell me a Shamwow ?
What the hell just happened ?
Or will we feel comforted and , you know … .
Barack Obama : I hope what people will come away with , I hope they ’ll say to themselves you know what ?
This election is really important .
These families that have been featured remind me of either myself or people I that know .
I hope they ’ll have a better sense of exactly what I want to do as president .
That ’s all you can do .
At this stage , everything that needs to be said has probably been heard by a lot of voters .
What you want to do is remind them one more time .
Here ’s what I ’m going to do , not oversell , let people make up their minds .
That ’s how democracy works .
Jon Stewart :
So much of this has been about fear of you .
An elitist , a celebrity , a Muslim terrorist sympathizer .
A Socialist , a Marxist , a witch .
That ’s right .
They ’ve been calling you a witch .
They ’re saying if you do win , is that a mandate for Socialism in this country ?
Has any of this fear stuff , do you think it ’s stuff with the electorate ?
Are you finding that on the trail ?
Barack Obama :
You know , it just has n’t .
I mean , I think , there ’s a certain segment of hard - core Sean Hannity fans that probably would n’t want to go have a beer with me , there ’s no doubt about that .
But I think for the average voter , they ’re saying to themselves , what ’s all this stuff about ?
I ’m trying to figure out whether I can hang on to my house or who is going to help me get a job or what about my health care , my premiums have doubled over the last couple of years .
So I do n’t think that they ’re paying too much attention to this stuff .
And the whole Socialism argument that does n’t fly too well .
The evidence of this seems pretty thin .
I said today that I think they found proof that when I was in kindergarten I shared some toys with my friends .
That ’s clearly a sign that of subversive activity now , I can tell you , Jon , that being on your program I think is further evidence of these tendencies .
Jon Stewart : ( laughing ) .
The polls have you up but then they keep talking about this Bradley Effect this idea that white voters when they go to the polls , they ’ll tell pollsters they ’re going to vote for an African - American but they wo n’t actually do it .
Barack Obama : Yeah , they ’ve been saying that for a while .
We ’re still here .
I do n’t know .
I do n’t think white voters have gotten this memo about the Bradley Effect .
Jon Stewart : are you concerned in some respects , you know , and I do n’t even know how to bring this up .
Obviously your mother is from Kansas .
She ’s a white woman .
Your father , African .
Are you concerned that you may go into the voting booth and ….
Barack Obama : I wo n’t know what to do .
Jon Stewart :
Your white half will all of a sudden decide , “ I ca n’t do this . ”
Barack Obama :
That ’s a problem .
Jon Stewart :
What is it ?
Barack Obama : I said it ’s a problem .
Jon Stewart : ( laughing ) .
Barack Obama : I ’ve been going through therapy to make sure that I vote properly on the 4th .
Jon Stewart : I think that ’s wise .
Are you , you know , you and Senator McCain have run such a tough race .
Is it possible , do you think , in this day and age for you two to be , to like each other afterwards , to be collegial ?
Do you feel like you would offer him a spot in your administration or he would do the same for you ?
I mean , what ’s that relationship like now ?
Barack Obama :
Well , look , there ’s no doubt that it gets tense in the middle of a campaign .
But I ’ve said it before .
I admire Senator McCain ’s service to our country .
He is a genuine war hero .
And , you know , I hope that after the election , however way it turns out , that we can work together because some of the problems we ’re talking about are ones that we ’re not going to be able to solve with one party just trying to dictate a solution to the problems .
You look at something like global warming , that ’s really an “ all hands on deck ” kind of situation .
If we do n’t get everybody on board , conservative hawks who are worried about us buying oil from the Middle East , tree huggers and environmentalists who are worried about , you know , the polar bears , bringing all those folks together and saying everybody ’s got a legitimate point of view .
Let ’s figure out how to solve the problem .
That ’s the kind of attitude we ’re going to need going forward .
Jon Stewart :
With the kind of issues that face the country now … .
( applause ) oh , they ’re applauding .
Very interesting .
They ’re applauding a spirit of cooperation , which I actually find that to be a rather angry bitter group in this audience .
Barack Obama :
Not very funny cooperation .
Jon Stewart : No , that ’s nice .
Is there a sense that you have , you know , two years ago when you began this journey , the country was not necessarily in the shape it ’s in now .
Is there a sense that you do n’t want this ?
( Obama laughs ) you may look at the country and think , you know , when I thought I was going to get this it was a relatively new car .
Now look at it !
Barack Obama :
You know , I actually think this is the time to want to be president .
If you went into public service thinking that you could have an impact , now is the time where you could have an impact .
We tend to be a pretty conservative country .
I do n’t mean conservative politically per se , but conservative in the sense that , you know , things are kind of going along pretty well and we do n’t want to mess with it too much .
And then every once in a while you have these big challenges and big problems .
It gives an opportunity for us to really move in a new direction .
I think this is one of those moments on things like energy and health care and the economy and education where I think people recognize what we ’ve been doing is n’t working .
Jon Stewart : A serious moment .
Barack Obama : I think people will be more open to change .
Jon Stewart : Sir , we definitely appreciate you being on the program tonight .
We know what a long haul it ’s been .
You ’ve certainly run a remarkable and historic race .
I have great admiration for both you and Senator McCain , and I wish you well .
Thank you so much for joining us .
Barack Obama : Great to be with you , Jon .
Thank you .
Jon Stewart : Senator Barack Obama .
We ’ll be right back .

Dear NYCEMF participants ,
We regret to inform you that we have had to cancel the NYCEMF for 2020 .
In New York , people were quarantined at home until recently , and gatherings in public places are still restricted .
As we expected , life did not get back to normal by the scheduled dates of the festival , and life has still not gotten back to normal .
Besides that , New York University , where we were going to hold most of our events , was closed at the time the festival was supposed to happen .
However , we have prepared , as promised , a virtual online version of our festival !
All musical works that we accepted , and for which we obtained permission , are now playable from this Web site .
Some works are hosted on our server , others are links to pieces published online by the composers .
Many of the works are playable in high - resolution video and audio .
The pieces can be played from hyperlinks in our online Program Book , and the pieces also can be played from our Web page for each concert .
We hope to have an even bigger festival in 2021 .
We wish to thank everyone who submitted works this year , and we hope to see you in 2021 !
With every best wish for your health , safety , and musical work ,

Long considered to be malware and a threat to privacy and security , keylogging software has been found on Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 and Google Chrome .
However , these keyloggers were not placed there by hackers — the companies put them there on purpose .
Google and Microsoft added keyloggers to their browsers in an attempt to improve searches for their users .
Keylogging allows the browser to determine common or most likely searches based on the user ’s past usage .
They also store user log-ins and passwords for the user ’s convenience , track activity to help determine the cause of errors , and employers use keyloggers to track employee productivity .
While this is all very useful for the companies doing the tracking , it makes anti-malware protection more complicated , because the malware applications like Kaspersky AntiVirus cannot simply delete all keyloggers as they have up until this point .
Cyber criminals use keylogging to capture and record each keystroke you make to steal personal information like user IDs , passwords and anything else they can use to steal your identity .
However , some companies are now using keylogging for more legitimate purposes .
In order to determine the best course of action regarding keyloggers , Kaspersky Labs , an industry leader in anti-malware protection , is seeking legal counsel .
While they do not want to accuse legitimate companies of wrongdoing , they still want to provide the best and most comprehensive anti-malware protection on the market .
If it were up to Eugene Kaspersky , CEO of the company , users would not stand for these privacy - invading programs to be present on their browsers and request the companies to remove them .
“ That would save us a lot of work , and we already have plenty to do , ” he told Computer Weekly .
Google is already reacting to the public ’s aversion to keylogging by promising to keep the information anonymous , but Microsoft has made no such announcements as of yet .
What it all comes down to is this : is the convenience provided by keylogging worth compromising the security of your computer ?
Computing Thoughts
Decorators I : Introduction to Python Decorators
by Bruce Eckel
October 18 , 2008
Summary
This amazing feature appeared in the language almost apologetically and with concern that it might not be that useful .
Advertisement
I predict that in time it will be seen as one of the more powerful features in the language .
The problem is that all the introductions to decorators that I have seen have been rather confusing , so I will try to rectify that here .
( This series of articles will be incorporated into the open - source book Python 3 Patterns & Idioms ) .
Decorators vs. the Decorator Pattern First , you need to understand that the word " decorator " was used with some trepidation , because there was concern that it would be completely confused with the Decorator pattern from the Design Patterns book .
At one point other terms were considered for the feature , but " decorator " seems to be the one that sticks .
Indeed , you can use Python decorators to implement the Decorator pattern , but that 's an extremely limited use of it .
Python decorators , I think , are best equated to macros .
History of Macros
The macro has a long history , but most people will probably have had experience with C preprocessor macros .
The problems with C macros were ( 1 ) they were in a different language ( not C ) and ( 2 ) the behavior was sometimes bizarre , and often inconsistent with the behavior of the rest of C. Both Java and C# have added annotations , which allow you to do some things to elements of the language .
Both of these have the problems that ( 1 ) to do what you want , you sometimes have to jump through some enormous and untenable hoops , which follows from ( 2 ) these annotation features have their hands tied by the bondage - and - discipline ( or as Martin Fowler gently puts it : " Directing " ) nature of those languages .
In a slightly different vein , many C++ programmers ( myself included ) have noted the generative abilities of C++ templates and have used that feature in a macro - like fashion .
Many other languages have incorporated macros , but without knowing much about it I will go out on a limb and say that Python decorators are similar to Lisp macros in power and possibility .
The Goal of Macros I think it 's safe to say that the goal of macros in a language is to provide a way to modify elements of the language .
That 's what decorators do in Python -- they modify functions , and in the case of class decorators , entire classes .
This is why they usually provide a simpler alternative to metaclasses .
The major failings of most language 's self - modification approaches are that they are too restrictive and that they require a different language ( I 'm going to say that Java annotations with all the hoops you must jump through to produce an interesting annotation comprises a " different language " ) .
Python falls into Fowler 's category of " enabling " languages , so if you want to do modifications , why create a different or restricted language ?
Why not just use Python itself ?
And that 's what Python decorators do .
What Can You Do With Decorators ?
Decorators allow you to inject or modify code in functions or classes .
Sounds a bit like Aspect - Oriented Programming ( AOP ) in Java , does n't it ?
Except that it 's both much simpler and ( as a result ) much more powerful .
For example , suppose you 'd like to do something at the entry and exit points of a function ( such as perform some kind of security , tracing , locking , etc. -- all the standard arguments for AOP ) .
With decorators , it looks like this : @entryExit def func1 ( ) : print " inside func1 ( ) " @entryExit def func2 ( ) : print " inside func2 ( ) "
The @ indicates the application of the decorator .
Function Decorators
A function decorator is applied to a function definition by placing it on the line before that function definition begins .
For example : @myDecorator def aFunction ( ) : print " inside aFunction "
When the compiler passes over this code , aFunction ( ) is compiled and the resulting function object is passed to the myDecorator code , which does something to produce a function - like object that is then substituted for the original a Function ( ) .
What does the myDecorator code look like ?
Well , most introductory examples show this as a function , but I 've found that it 's easier to start understanding decorators by using classes as decoration mechanisms instead of functions .
In addition , it 's more powerful .
The only constraint upon the object returned by the decorator is that it can be used as a function -- which basically means it must be callable .
Thus , any classes we use as decorators must implement __call__ .
What should the decorator do ?
Well , it can do anything but usually you expect the original function code to be used at some point .
This is not required , however : class myDecorator ( object ) : def __init__ ( self , f ) : print " inside myDecorator.__init__ ( ) " f() # Prove that function definition has completed def __call__ ( self ) : print " inside myDecorator.__call__ ( ) " @myDecorator def aFunction ( ) : print " inside aFunction ( ) " print " Finished decorating aFunction ( ) " a Function ( )
When you run this code , you see : inside myDecorator.__init__( ) inside a Function ( ) Finished decorating a Function ( ) inside myDecorator.__call__ ( )
Notice that the constructor for myDecorator is executed at the point of decoration of the function .
Since we can call f( ) inside __init__ ( ) , it shows that the creation of f( ) is complete before the decorator is called .
Note also that the decorator constructor receives the function object being decorated .
Typically , you 'll capture the function object in the constructor and later use it in the __call__ ( ) method ( the fact that decoration and calling are two clear phases when using classes is why I argue that it 's easier and more powerful this way ) .
When aFunction ( ) is called after it has been decorated , we get completely different behavior ; the myDecorator.__call__ ( ) method is called instead of the original code .
That 's because the act of decoration replaces the original function object with the result of the decoration -- in our case , the myDecorator object replaces aFunction .
Indeed , before decorators were added you had to do something much less elegant to achieve the same thing : def foo( ) : pass foo = staticmethod ( foo )
With the addition of the @ decoration operator , you now get the same result by saying : @staticmethod def foo( ) : pass
This is the reason why people argued against decorators , because the @ is just a little syntax sugar meaning " pass a function object through another function and assign the result to the original function . "
The reason I think decorators will have such a big impact is because this little bit of syntax sugar changes the way you think about programming .
Indeed , it brings the idea of " applying code to other code " ( i.e. : macros ) into mainstream thinking by formalizing it as a language construct .
Slightly More Useful
Now let 's go back and implement the first example .
Here , we 'll do the more typical thing and actually use the code in the decorated functions : class entryExit ( object ) : def __init__ ( self , f ) : self .f = f def __call__ ( self ) : print " Entering " , self.f.__name__ self .f( ) print " Exited " , self.f.__name__ @entryExit def func1 ( ) : print " inside func1 ( ) " @entryExit def func2 ( ) : print " inside func2 ( ) " func1 ( ) func2 ()
The output is : Entering func1 inside func1 ( ) Exited func1 Entering func2 inside func2 ( )
Exited func2
You can see that the decorated functions now have the " Entering " and " Exited " trace statements around the call .
The constructor stores the argument , which is the function object .
In the call , we use the __name__ attribute of the function to display that function 's name , then call the function itself .
Using Functions as Decorators
The only constraint on the result of a decorator is that it be callable , so it can properly replace the decorated function .
In the above examples , I 've replaced the original function with an object of a class that has a __call__ ( ) method .
But a function object is also callable , so we can rewrite the previous example using a function instead of a class , like this : def entryExit ( f ) : def new_f ( ) : print " Entering " , f.__name__ f( ) print " Exited " , f.__name__ return new_f @entryExit def func1 ( ) : print " inside func1 ( ) " @entryExit def func2 ( ) : print " inside func2 ( ) " func1 ( ) func2 ( ) print func1.__name__ new_f( ) is defined within the body of entryExit ( ) , so it is created and returned when entryExit ( ) is called .
Note that new_f ( ) is a closure , because it captures the actual value of f .
Once new_f( ) has been defined , it is returned from entryExit ( ) so that the decorator mechanism can assign the result as the decorated function .
The output of the line print func1.
__name__ is new_f , because the new_f function has been substituted for the original function during decoration .
If this is a problem you can change the name of the decorator function before you return it : def entryExit ( f ) : def new_f ( ) : print " Entering " , f.__name__ f( ) print " Exited " , f.__name__ new_f.__name__ = f.__name__ return new_f
The information you can dynamically get about functions , and the modifications you can make to those functions , are quite powerful in Python .
More Examples
Now that you have the basics , you can look at some more examples of decorators here .
Note the number of these examples that use classes rather than functions as decorators .
In this article I have intentionally avoided dealing with the arguments of the decorated function , which I will look at in the next article .

Advertisement Extreme kayakers have been condemned for canoeing down a dam in west Wales .
A photographer captured the latest incident as one canoeist slid 300 ft down the spillway at Llyn Brianne reservoir in Carmarthenshire , near the borders of Ceredigion and Powys .
Welsh Water said the practice was dangerous and such activities were banned at the reservoir .
An onlooker said : " I always stop and look anyway and I saw four people ready to do the spillway .
" There were a lot of people watching at the top car park .
" It looked pretty scary . "
This extreme kayaker was photographed at the weekend at Llyn Brianne
Enlarge Image
Llyn Brianne was completed in 1972 and supplies drinking water to a large part of south Wales .
The reservoir is up to 272 ft ( 83 m ) deep and holds more than 13 billion gallons ( 60 billion litres ) of water .
A statement from Welsh Water , the owner of the site , said it " strictly forbids " water - based activities at the reservoir and would take " appropriate action " against anyone in breach of this restriction .
" Reservoirs can be dangerous for various reasons and those involved in water sports in inappropriate locations , such as at Llyn Brianne , put themselves and others at unnecessary risk , " said a spokesman .
Richard Harvey from the Welsh Canoeing Association said he could not comment on the group involved , the locality or the legality of their activity but he did say he was aware the slipway had been used by kayakers for about 20 years .
" We encourage people to paddle responsibly and in the realm of the law , " he said .
" It 's very important that kayaking is done at no risk to other people or the environment and that a detailed risk assessment is made before taking to the water .
" Enthusiasts also have to be aware of the law and the possible legal restrictions relating to a particular stretch of water .
" If they go too far we do not condone it . "

( CNN ) -- Sen. Barack Obama said Sunday that Sen. John McCain was now " owning up to the fact that he and George Bush actually have a whole lot in common . "
Sen . Barack Obama has an 8 - point lead , according to CNN 's average of national polls .
" Just this morning , Sen. McCain said that , actually , he and President Bush -- ' share a common philosophy . '
That 's right , Colorado .
I guess that was John McCain finally giving us a little straight talk , " Obama said at a rally in Denver , Colorado .
Obama was referring to McCain 's Sunday interview on NBC's " Meet the Press . "
NBC's Tom Brokaw pointed to a review of McCain 's record , which showed he voted with Bush 92 percent of the time .
" So it 's a little hard for the public to separate you from this administration , is n't it ? " Brokaw said .
McCain said there were times he has broken with the Bush administration , but added : " So do we share a common philosophy of the Republican Party ?
Of course . "
" But I 've stood up against my party , not just President Bush , but others ; and I 've got the scars to prove it , " he said .
" Do I respect President Bush ?
Of course I respect him .
But I pointed out we were on the wrong track in a whole lot of ways . "
Obama said Sunday that as the campaigns wind down , voters can expect " the same kind of politics that we 've seen over the last eight years " from McCain .
" It 's a politics that is more about tearing your opponent down than lifting your country up . "
" We 're not going to let George Bush pass the torch to John McCain , " Obama said .
At a rally in Cedar Rapids , Iowa , McCain shot down the notion Obama 's charge that he is " more of the same " and vowed to bring change to Washington .
" I 'm going to give you a little straight talk today ... with your help we 're going to win here and we 're going to bring change to Washington , D.C.
We 're going to bring change , " he said Sunday .
Obama leads McCain by 8 percentage points ( 50 - 42 percent ) , according to CNN 's latest average of national polls .
Despite his sagging poll numbers , McCain said earlier Sunday that he is " very happy with where we are " and very proud of his campaign .
" We 're doing fine , " the Arizona senator told NBC .
" We are very competitive in many of the battleground states . "
McCain brushed off polls that show him trailing Obama , saying those numbers are " all over the map . "
" Those polls have consistently shown me much further behind than we actually are .
It all depends on the voter turnout ... we 're doing fine .
We have closed in the last week . " he said .
State - by - state polling
McCain also spoke out against recent criticism of his running mate , Gov. Sarah Palin .
A new Washington Post / ABC
News poll suggests Americans have an increasingly negative view of the Alaska governor .
According to that poll , 46 percent of respondents have a favorable opinion of Palin , compared with 59 percent at the time of the Republican National Convention .
The poll shows an increase in the number of people who have an unfavorable view of her -- 51 percent compared with 29 percent in early September .
The poll , conducted October 20 - 23 , has a sampling error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points .
McCain said Palin " needs no defense . "
" I do n't defend her .
I praise her , " McCain said .
" She has more executive experience than Sen . [ Joe ] Biden and Sen. Obama together . "
McCain acknowledged he and Palin disagree on some issues , but said it was " because we are both mavericks . "
" But we share the same goal of cleaning up Washington .
We will clean up and reform Washington together , and she has the credentials , and the vision , and the dynamism and the strength to do that , " he said .
Sources told CNN that long - brewing tensions between Palin and key McCain aides have been intensifying .
Several McCain advisers suggested to CNN that they have become increasingly frustrated with what one aide described as Palin " going rogue . "
A Palin associate , however , said the candidate is simply trying to " bust free " of what she believes was a damaging and mismanaged roll - out .
With just nine days left to campaign , the candidates and their running mates are focusing their attention on the battleground states as they try to turn out the vote and woo those who are still undecided .
McCain on Sunday was campaigning in Iowa , where Palin campaigned the day before .
The latest polls show McCain trailing by double digits there .
Palin on Sunday had events scheduled in Florida and North Carolina .
CNN 's latest polls show a tight race in both states .
Biden was in his home state of Delaware on Sunday with no public events scheduled .
CNN 's poll of national polls consists of seven surveys : Newsweek ( October 22 - 23 ) , ABC / Washington Post ( October 21 - 24 ) , Fox / Opinion Dynamics ( October 20 - 21 ) , Reuters / C- SPAN / Zogby ( October 22 - 24 ) , Gallup ( October 22 - 24 ) , Diageo / Hotline ( October 22 - 24 ) , and IBD / TIPP ( October 20 - 24 ) .
It does not have a sampling error .
All About U.S. Presidential Election
Back when I wrote my 10 reasons to learn Ruby article , I mentioned RubyGems in Reason # 1 as one of they key features of the Ruby programming languages .
Indeed , gems make getting Ruby programs as easy as typing gem install < something > from the command line .
When you want to distribute something new in Ruby , there ’s no need to give people download links , zip files or setup programs , just tell them to get the gem .
That ’s perfectly normal , and extremely cool .
Gems are normally stored on RubyForge , so all you have to do is uploading your gem there , and it will be available to the rest of the universe .
It ’s a nice feeling .
I remember when I first uploaded RawLine and then tried gem install rawline just for the hell of it : it downloaded and installed the gem , as expected .
Back in the day , if you wanted to find something written in Ruby , all you had to do is search through RubyForge , and you ’d eventually find it , with a bit of luck .
Can we just have git , please ?
RubyForge had , until recently , one major problem : it only allowed CVS and SVN repositories , and you had to make your choice when creating the project , once and for all .
So when the cool guys at GitHub rolled out their social code hosting web site , most of the créme de la créme of RubyForge flocked there in mass migration : Rails , Merb , RSpec … you name it .
Once the big guys made the switch , a lot jumped on the GitHub bandwagon of course .
Result : we have a lot of projects still on RubyForge , but quite a few ( and important ones ) on GitHub .
Why did people move there ?
Well , at first it was because they wanted a sleek - looking git host , and RubyForge did n’t offer git at the time .
But git is now available on RubyForge , so why do n’t people use it ?
I ’d like to know how many people use git on RubyForge .
Apparently you can have your old SVN repository manually migrated to git , if you ask nicely ( and RubyForge people are very helpful always , anyway ) .
Still , I do n’t think many people use git there , and hardly anyone ( if any ) moved back from GitHub .
What ’s so special about this new “ social code hosting ” site then ?
I guess just a few key features :
Fast and reliable git hosting
The ability to “ watch ” other people ’s repositories and interact with them “ the git way ” , also by forking .
There ’s a whole new and fresh community feeling to it : you can follow people , message them , etc .
The interface is much more neat than RubyForge ’s ( OK , granted , it does n’t take much )
Really cool stats and graphs
A basic , but functional , wiki
… oh , and bug tracking , too !
GitHub has no bug tracking features .
It tracks an awful lot of stuff about your repositories and people working on them , but “ batteries are sold separately ” .
You can get batteries here , for example .
Apparently , GitHub and LightHouse are seamlessly integrated .
So now you can sign up to two cool brand new web applications with neat interfaces instead of sticking with the old - looking RubyForge ( which comes with “ batteries included ” , after all ) .
Personally I ’m very confused now .
Fortunately I do n’t have any extremely cool projects used by thousands of people , so jumping from one source code hosting solution from another is not really an issue for me , but I imagine it would be for others !
Correct ?
So , as far as I know , if you are a Rubyist , here ’s what you can do :
Stick with RubyForge : it ’s not so bad after all .
Embrace GitHub ( and Lighthouse ) : it ’s extremely nice to use .
Some people are not too convinced that this is the best choice though .
Go for something in between , like Assembla , which actually has an impressive list of features and is powered by Rails too , so you ’ll feel at home .
Google Code used to be another common choice , but sadly they do n’t offer git yet .
Do-it - yourself , maybe using something like Gitorius and some open source bug tracking / project management solution .
So … what choice did you make or are you planning to make ?
Moving houses
There ’s one simple issue to consider when moving your code to a new place : what happens to your old place .
If have a relatively popular project , a lot of people may have bookmarked your project page on RubyForge , or the RubyForge subdomain which you may have used as the “ home page ” for your project ( in truth , most of the ones who moved away still use it ) .
You may setup a redirection to the new home page or put a notice saying that the project moved somewhere else and point visitors to GitHub and LightHouse , or to another web site , if you wish .
When Rails moved to GitHub , that was n’t much of a problem as Rails has its own web site .
What may become a problem is your old repository .
In Rails ’ case , they left the old SVN repository available on sourceforge for a while and then removed it altogether .
Other project owners have just abandoned their old repositories , occasionally resulting in someone else deciding to leave a note as their last SVN commit .
These solutions all work ( you eventually drive people to the new home of your project ) , but it ’s not very nice , that ’s all .
What happens if someone comes up with something cooler than GitHub ?
In all honesty , you may end up moving house over and over again .
Do n’t forget the gems !
One thing I liked about RubyForge , as I wrote at the beginning , was that if you uploaded a gem there , it was immediately available to everyone typing gem install < something > .
Luckily , GitHub supports gems , too !
We ’re saved .
The page they put up is utterly awful , but it does the job : you can have your gems hosted on GitHub .
Good !
So surely I can get Rails now , right ?
Yup : gem install rails will get the latest version of Rails for you , straight from GitHub .
Actually , no .
It does n’t seem to work that way : sure you can get the latest rails in that way , but it will actually be downloaded from RubyForge ( go check the downloads , you ’ll see it there ) .
So even if technically you got Rails , you got it from RubyForge .
If you want to get gem from GitHub , you have to add it as gem source first ( that ’s an una tantum operation , luckily ) : gem sources -a http://gems.github.com .
So , yes , you can move to GitHub and you ’ll also get gem support : but please remind the users that they have to add GitHub as gem source .
Or , better , you should always remember to upload your latest gems to GitHub and to RubyForge as well .
The present
To sum up :
If you want , you can stay on RubyForge .
It has git , it has gems , it ’s probably not nearly as prettier than competitors and is not as social , but it works .
You can opt for GitHub + LightHouse , have a slick interface , plenty of features and your project will be scattered in 2 different places + your home page , and you ’ll also have to keep uploading your gems to RubyForge .
At this point , you may even go for something completely different , like Assembla or your own setup , but still upload your gems to RubyForge .
The obvious solutions at this point would be that the folks who craft rubygems ( the gem which makes the gems , to be clear ) add GitHub as default source .
Sure as hell when that happens other people will want that too ( hey , I ’ll have gems . h3rald.com setup by then ! ) .
Is this the future ?
I hope not .
The future ?
You know there ’s a domain called www.rubygems.org?
It ’s where the gem manuals are !
As much as I love documentation , there ’s nothing wrong in moving all those documents and books to something like docs.rubygems.org , right ?
Then they could make RubyGems.org the only official gem server and tell people they should upload their gems there if they want to distribute them efficiently ( after manual approval , if necessary , like there is on RubyForge ) .
In this way :
You would n’t have to upload stuff to RubyForge anymore
You could have the clever folks at GitHub to create a simple script to automate the upload
You ’d have virtually all the gems in one place
You ’d put a good domain name ( currently almost forgotten ) to good use
While they are at it , the clever folks at RubyGems.org could also setup a proper gem directory with a proper search .
I ’m sure there would be plenty of people who could help , too !
It ’s not impossible , right ?
They said that making Rails / Ruby / RSpec documentation more accurate and accessible was impossible , but now there ’s APIdock , correct ?
Personally I ’d like it to be a collaborative effort of the Ruby community ( like ruby - lang.org ) , rather than one private company showing off , but I think everyone will be happy as long as it works .
I ’m sure people will contribute , I would try at least ( after finishing the Italian translation of ruby - lang.org , that is … erhm , well , that ’s another story … ) .
Thoughts ?
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The Senate 's financial rescue plan may have a better chance of passage because it 's padded with pork that may be tasty enough to get reluctant House members to bite .
Lawmakers added billions in tax incentives to the bailout bill to help it pass the House .
Most of the $ 110 billion in additions , such as a tax credit for research and development and an increase in insurance for bank accounts , would have broad economic impact .
The benefits of others , though , may not be so evident to most taxpayers .
For example , the proposal includes an excise tax exemption for a very specific type of arrow used by child archers .
View details of the incentives »
According to Steve Ellis of Taxpayers for Common Sense , a nonpartisan watchdog group , current law places an excise tax of 39 cents on the first sale by the manufacturer , producer or importer of any shaft of a type used to produce certain types of arrows .
Watch where 's the pork ? »
" This proposal would exempt from the excise tax any shaft consisting of all natural wood with no laminations or artificial means to enhance the spine of the shaft used in the manufacture of an arrow that measures 5/16 of an inch or less and is unsuited for use with a bow with a peak draw weight of 30 pounds or more , " Ellis wrote .
The estimated cost of the proposal is $ 2 million over 10 years , he wrote .
Follow the progress of the $ 700 billion bailout plan »
Oregon Sens. Ron Wyden , a Democrat , and Gordon Smith , a Republican , were the initial sponsors of the arrow provision .
According to Bloomberg News , the earmark provision would be worth $ 200,000 a year to Rose City Archery in Myrtle Point , Oregon .
A Wyden aide said the Oregon senator did not ask that the provision be added to bailout package , but that does n't fly with Ellis .
" The bottom line is , this is benefiting a very few manufacturers , and I think most Americans who are either concerned about the bailout package or concerned about the economy are going to be wondering why a provision benefiting wooden arrow manufacturers is catching a ride on the package , " Ellis said .
The Taxpayers for Common Sense also reports that the proposal includes such mouthwatering morsels as these :
Creation of a seven - year cost recovery period for construction of a motorsports racetrack :
Track owners currently follow a seven - year depreciation schedule and write each year 's depreciation off their taxes .
The IRS wanted to increase the depreciation timetable to 15 years , which would mean the track owner 's depreciation would be cut in half .
The measure in the keeps the seven - year depreciation schedule for two years and would cost taxpayers $ 100 million .
Income averaging for amounts received in connection with the Exxon Valdez litigation :
The measure would allow the plaintiffs who won damages from Exxon Mobile for the oil spilled by the Exxon Valdez to average the award over three years rather than treating it as income in a single year .
The measure was backed by Alaska Rep. Don Young and would cost taxpayers $ 49 million .
Secure rural schools and community self - determination program :
The program replaces revenue rural communities used to enjoy from the sale of federal forest land .
The measure is sponsored by lawmakers from Oregon and Idaho .
The program would cost taxpayers $ 3.3 billion .
Deduction of state and local sales taxes :
The measure allows citizens who do not pay state income taxes to deduct the amount of sales tax they pay over a year from their federal income tax for two additional years .
States that benefit include Texas , Nevada , Florida , Washington and Wyoming .
The measure would cost taxpayers $ 3.3 billion .
Provisions related to film and television productions :
In order to keep movie production in the U.S. , production companies would be allowed to deduct the cost of producing the films from their taxes .
Rep. Diane Watson , D - California , has been one of the program 's biggest supporters .
The measure would cost taxpayers $ 478 million over 10 years .
Extension and modification of duty suspension on wool products , wool research fund and wool duty refunds :
The measure helps U.S. worsted wool fabric makers and clothing manufacturers .
The bill extends provisions through 2014 or 2015 that were originally sponsored by Reps.
Louise Slaughter , D - New York , and Melissa Bean , D - Illinois , in 2007 .
The measure would cost taxpayers $ 148 million .
Extension of economic development credit for American Samoa :
The measure would extend for two years provisions meant to help economic development in the U.S. territory of American Samoa .
The measure would cost taxpayers $ 33 million .
Transportation fringe benefit to bicycle commuters :
The measure would allow employers to provide benefits to employees who commute to work via bicycle , such as help purchasing and maintaining a bicycle .
The measure would cost taxpayers $ 10 million .
CNN's Scott J. Anderson , Brian Todd and Jim Kavanagh contributed to this report .

As designers and developers , we solve problems for a living .
Yet , these problems are often quite tricky and complex , and the context of these problems requires us to be creative and flexible in our workflows .
With responsive design , we are prompted to create scalable design systems that work well in unpredictable environments .
To do that , we need to be pragmatic and find solutions that work well within given constraints .
That ’s why we created this book : to find techniques that have actually worked in real - life projects with real - world challenges .
Responsive Designer 's Workflow — by Daniel Mall +
Responsive workflow
Element collage
Style tiles
Tools
Deliverables
Performance budget
Interface inventory
Sketching
Planning
Manifestos
Hypothesis
Atomic design
Designing in the browser
Photoshop
In practice , responsive projects usually require more time , more skills , more testing and hence more flexibility in budgets .
Addings changes late delays projects immensely , and process involving designers , developers and clients is usually tiring to say the least .
In this chapter , Daniel shares insights into his responsive design workflow from projects such as TechCrunch , Entertainment Weekly and Radio Liberty , with techniques and strategies that help him get things done well , within budget and on time ( most of the time ) , while achieving the highest level of fidelity in shortest amount of time .
Responsive Design Patterns & Components — by Vitaly Friedman +
Design patterns
Navigation
Smart front - end techniques
Priority + pattern
Improved off - canvas
Lazy loading
Autocomplete
Filters
Responsive PDF
Portrait / landscape mode
Sliders
Country selector
Responsive iconography
So , how do we deal with complex tables when building responsive websites ?
What about advanced interface components ?

What about the behaviour of web forms , navigation , mega - drop down menus , filters ?
Can we utilize vertical media queries and portrait / landscape orientation change ?
In this chapter , Vitaly will provide an overview of clever practical techniques for improving UX of responsive sites , with innovative approaches to designing “ responsive modules ” such as mega - drop downs , tables , calendars , accordions , maps , sliders , responsive PDF and responsive iconography — and a dash of anti-patterns to avoid as well .
Structured Content for RWD — by Eileen Webb +
Structured content
Content consistency
Content models
Structural audit
Editorial content
Content types
Content relationships
Data - driven gaps
Feature - driven gaps
Authors and editors
CMS
Content maintenance Content created by one department is never updated by the next .
Services get renamed in the navigation , but are still referenced by the old name in the body text .
Important information is buried in the murky depths of flowery prose .
Sounds familiar ?
Many issues in responsive projects are n’t related to technology , but to content : it ’s either ill - formatted or priorities get lost across screen resolutions .
Let ’s fix it .
In this chapter , Eileen shows how structured content can help refocus on what matters , and how we as designers can use the structure intelligently to provide users with information that they need , when they need it .

Building Responsive Components With Flexbox — by Zoe M. Gillenwater +
Syntax variants •
Flex container • Orientation • Wrapping • Sizing boxes • Flex property • Forms with Flexbox • Advanced alignment • Magical margins • Reordering boxes • Order property • Flexbox as progressive enhancement
We can use Flexbox for a while now .
In fact , Flexbox solves a lot of CSS shortcomings and makes building responsive layouts much easier than with floats or positioning .
It gives you more control over the things you care about in a responsive layout ( such as order , alignment , and proportional sizes of your boxes ) and lets the browser figure out the rest ; the math-y stuff that computers are good at , like the exact dimensions that are needed on the boxes to perfectly fill the available space .
Zoe shares insights from her work at Booking.com , showing practical Flexbox - based techniques which make responsive sites much easier to build and maintain — even without media queries .
Web Fonts Performance — by Bram Stein +
Font formats • Font loading • Font- rendering • FOIT and FOUT • Font Loading API • Fallback fonts • Inlining fonts • Simulating swapping • Promises • Asynchronous loading and caching • Prioritized loading By default , web fonts block rendering , hiding content from the user .
The only way to make content accessible as soon as possible is by treating web fonts as a progressive enhancement .
This does n’t mean web font performance is not an issue .
You still need to load web fonts as quickly as possible so that users experience your site exactly how you designed and built it .
Let ’s fix this .
In this chapter , Bram shares insights that he has learned from working at Typekit , covering web fonts and formats , font loading and font rendering , CSS Font Loading API , fallback fonts , caching , compression , inlining , subsetting and font loading strategies .
Using Responsive Images , Today — by Yoav Weiss +
CSS pixel and DPR
Retina displays
Fixed - width images
Variable - width images
Srcset and sizes
Art direction
< picture > element
Separation of concerns
Image format fallback
Accessibility
Background images
Image optimization
WebP and JPEG-XR
Compressive images
Deployment
Common pitfalls
So you want to serve different images to different screens .
Perhaps a Retina image ( only ) to Retina screens , or an art - directed image to small screens , or a portrait image for portrait orientation , or perhaps . webp to browsers supporting the format — without performance hits .
Since images are the heaviest assets on the web , dealing with them intelligently is both our responsibility and opportunity for more dynamic layouts .
That ’s what native responsive images are for .
In this chapter , Yoav discusses the different responsive images use cases and how we can use the native solution today to create performant responsive websites .
We will also look at ways to make these solutions easier to deploy and maintain in real projects , with Picturefill and CMS plugins for Drupal and WordPress .
The Dark Side Of Responsive HTML Email — by Fabio Carneiro +
Email landscape
CSS in email
Market share
Navigation and CTA buttons
Foundational markup
Reset and client - specific CSS
Fluid containers
Pattern - based development
Layout techniques
Microsoft Outlook
Windows Live Mail
Apple Mail
Mozilla Thunderbird
Outlook.com
Yahoo !
Mail
AOL
iOS Mail
Gmail Explaining responsive HTML email is always an uphill battle , because just about every single designer and developer hates it .
But there ’s a lot of great , forward - looking innovation going on in the email design world .
In fact , melding of responsive design techniques is absolutely possible .
In this chapter , Fabio , the technical email maestro from Mailchimp , explores what you can achieve with media queries in responsive HTML email to ensure that your emails look just fine on major email clients across different devices , and looks even better in clients that do not support media queries ( such as Gmail ) .
Testing , Maintaining And Debugging RWD — by Tom Maslen +
“ Cutting the mustard ” • Predictable
simple CSS • Naming conventions • BEM and class names • Sass organization • Debugging media queries • Lazy loading • Content - out media queries • Separation of concerns • Exploratory testing • Functional testing • Visual regression testing • Automated testing • Dealing with false positives • Common dependencies • Troubleshooting bugs on mobile
We talk a lot about designing and building responsive websites , but not so much about maintaining and testing them .
Speaking from his experience at BBC , Tom has built up a way of working that minimizes the pain points that responsive web design has .
The chapter shows how you can build future - friendly CSS that will scale up to support large responsive websites ; get you to take testing seriously , but not overcomplicate your workflow ; and finally , how to sanely prioritize and debug common problems ( layout , images , complex UI components like tables ) in all kinds of devices and browsers .
Creativity Over Predictability — by Andrew Clarke +
Advertising
User experience design
Creative hijinks
Allergic to research
Process and predictability
Building blocks of creativity
Intoxicated by process
Platform for creativity
Creative brief
Line between control and chaos
Buying creativity
copywriting
Creative teams
Creative direction
Our responsive designs lack soul .
You can think of many websites that are well presented , easy to use , triumphs of UX and technically competent , but few that might be remembered for years to come .
Why do you think this is ?
Why are so few websites memorable ?
Could the design processes we ’ve come to rely on , particularly in relation to responsive design , have hindered our creativity ?
Our modern web design magazines are full of advice about process , techniques and tools , but little about creativity , about humanity , or about ideas .
In this chapter , Andrew takes a closer look at how we can combine creativity with predictable design systems to create unpredictable , dynamic and memorable responsive websites — with a framework and a mindset that will challenge you to think differently about crafting websites today .
Beyond Responsive : Optimizing For Offline — by John Allsopp +
navigator.onLine
Online and offline events
HTML5 Application Cache
Cache manifest
Fallbacks
AppCache gotchas
Web Storage
localStorage
Service Workers
What if we told you that as a user , you do n’t have to be online to use the web , and a website or a web application would respond to this accordingly ?
Think Offline First : “ We ca n’t keep building apps with the desktop mindset of permanent , fast connectivity , where a temporary disconnection or slow service is regarded as a problem and communicated as an error . ”
John and Matt cover main technologies and practices that you ’ll need to use to make your apps work as well offline , as they do online .
We ’ll discuss how to detect if we are online or not , HTML5 Application Cache , WebStorage and offline events , but most importantly Service Workers and how we can use them today to not only make content available offline , but also significantly improve performance and create snappy , fast experiences in ( almost ) no time .
Efficient Responsive Process With Clients — by Ben Callahan +
Collaboration
Estimates
Spiraling
“ One - deliverable ” workflow
Efficiency
Content priority guide
Style comparisons
Testing the aggregate
Content prototype
Wireframes
Style prototypes
Pattern libraries
Happy teams Design deliverable is one thing , an efficient collaboration between teams and stakeholders is a different beast entirely .
This chapter provides strategies for keeping this collaboration sane and focused .
You ’ll learn how to build a good and efficient team , how to establish good pricing / time estimates for responsive projects , how to establish priorities with content priority guides and how to shift away from linear handoffs with multidisciplinary teams .
A detailed chapter on getting things done , with clients , the proper way .

As election day nears , new stories of voter suppression and improper voter purges continue to come to light .
The polls that pundits tend to focus on may not mean much , as huge numbers of voters will likely be unable to vote on November 4 .
States have purged some 13 million voters from the voter rolls since 2004 , Joe Rothstein reports for U.S. Politics Today .
According to Rothstein , 17 percent of registered voters in the vital swing state of Colorado have been dropped from the rolls , and 10 percent of voters have been dropped in Missouri .
CNN reports that 50,000 people have had their voter registrations “ flagged , ” calling the viability of their votes into question , and “ 4,500 of those people are having their citizenship questioned and the burden is on them to prove eligibility to vote . ”
Even if people manage to get on the voter rolls , some states may not be ready for the massive influx of voters on election day .
The Virginia NAACP recently sued Virginia Governor Tim Kaine , a Democrat , claiming that the state has failed to prepare for all the voters , the Associated Press reports .
The complaint points out that many polling stations were overwhelmed in the February primaries , with some precincts resorting to makeshift ballots that were later thrown out .
The NAACP believes November 4th could be even worse , warning that current preparation could “ result in a meltdown on Election Day . ”
North Carolina residents who do n’t have their votes counted likely will be in good company .
More than 1.6 million votes were n’t counted in 2004 , according to Robert F. Kenney and Greg Palast writing for Rolling Stone , and the tactics used to suppress those votes could get worse this year .
Kennedy and Palast outline six ways that people are going to try and steal votes , including obstructing of voter registration drives , illegitimate voter purges , and challenging and rejecting provisional and “ spoiled ” ballots .
The groundwork for this voter suppression has been laid by GOP operatives over the past few election cycles , Andrew Gumble writes for the Nation .
Barack Obama ’s commanding lead in the polls wo n’t make the illegal and undemocratic efforts to steal people ’s votes go away , it just makes them more desperate .
- Advertisement -
The best way to stop the election from being stolen is to make the election into a blowout , Robert Lovato writes for New America Media .
That way , manipulated and stolen votes wo n’t matter as much .
If that does n’t work , Lovato floats the idea of a general strike , protests , office - takeovers , and other non-violent protest demonstrations .

Eyewitness captures video , police falsely say taser intended for compliance
Steve Watson
Infowars.net
Wednesday , Nov 26 , 2008
Wisconsin Police were caught on camera tasing a 54 year old woman and confining her to a wheel chair after she sat in the wrong seat at a football game in Madison .
Margaret Hiebing , a veteran Badger season ticket holder , was ejected from the Camp Randall stadium during the Oct. 11 game against Penn State after she was found sitting in the wrong seat , reports WKOW 27 News .
Hiebing had taken a different seat because someone else had occupied her usual place at the packed game .
When police approached Mrs Hiebing she explained the situation and refused to leave .
Onlookers began to berate the cops after one of them reportedly threatened Hiebing with pepper spray .
One witness filmed the altercation on a cell phone , evidence which would later dispel initial police claims that Hiebing was causing an obstruction by sitting in the aisle .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Police then forced Hiebing face down on the ground and tased her on the back of the leg .
Hiebing was then placed in a wheel chair and ejected as she was unable to walk out of the stadium .
Watch a WKOW report on the incident at INFOWARS.NET
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Former Wisconsin Department of Justice Training and Standards Director Dennis Hanson described the tasing as ” the next step to force compliance ” and told 27 News the use of a taser is an accepted intermediate option when the subject of police commands is not cooperating .
This is simply not true .
The weapon is designed to be used as a last resort before lethal force when a suspect becomes violent and the officer feels their own safety is under threat .
The police are now trained that “ pain compliance , ” a euphemism for torture , is acceptable in apprehending anyone even if that person poses no physical danger .
This case once again highlights the fact that police are using the Taser to get non-violent suspects to simply do what they are told , rather than for their intended purpose as the very last line of defense before the handgun .
Taser has been the subject of much controversy and outrage all over the world .
Last year the UN ’s Committee Against Torture issued a statement on the TaserX26 , which read : “ The use of TaserX26 weapons , provoking extreme pain , constituted a form of torture , and that in certain cases it could also cause death , as shown by several reliable studies and by certain cases that had happened after practical use . ”
Doctors in the U.S. and Canada have spoken out against the devices and have accused Taser International of corporate intimidation .
Meanwhile , the UK government wants to arm London police with 10,000 tasers , a plan that police have said they will boycott because of the potential the devices have to cause fear and damage public confidence .
WKOW 27 news reports that over two dozen witnesses have signed a petition stating that the police conduct in Margaret Hiebing ’s case was not appropriate .
While stadium video of the altercation also exists , police are keeping it under wraps and have said the incident is still under review .

JERUSALEM ( CNN ) --
The northern Israeli town of Acre was quiet on Sunday after four days of Arab - Jewish rioting , sparked in part by unsubstantiated rumors .
Four days of violence have gripped the northern Israeli town of Acre .
While the violence has subsided , there are still worries that the rioting could reignite at any moment .
Acre is one of a handful of inter-ethnic towns in Israel , consisting of 70 percent Jewish Israelis and about 30 percent Arab Israelis .
Rioting broke out Wednesday night after an Arab motorist entered a Jewish neighborhood on Yom Kippur , the holiest day in the Jewish religion .
Jewish residents confronted the driver and a fistfight broke out , according to Israeli police spokesman Mickey Rosenfeld .
A rumor spread among Acre's Arab residents that the driver had been killed and that prompted calls from some local mosques to avenge his reported death , Rosenfeld said .
Hundreds of Arab youths rioted in Acre 's Jewish neighborhood causing extensive damage to cars and shops in the area .
Israeli police forcefully dispersed the crowds using tear gas and stun grenades , Rosenfeld said .
As soon as the Yom Kippur fast ended , about 200 Jewish residents began to riot in Acre 's Arab neighborhood .
Police used force to disperse the rioters arresting some of them , Rosenfeld said .
Leaders on both sides called on the residents to restore calm , however those calls went unheeded and riots broke out again on Friday .
Two apartments belonging to Arab residents were torched by the Jewish rioters .
Police separated the rioters throughout Saturday , however the rioting erupted again that night .
Rosenfeld said that police forces have been deployed throughout the town in large numbers to try and stop further rioting .
So far , 54 of the rioters have been arrested .
We run youth and children programs geared at helping them unleash their potential .
We got to know about Hidden Brains via Internet .
​​ They were professional and gave timely feedback .
They adhered to their timelines and it was not only at the proposal stage but at all stages of the project .

A Chance to Grow
Shanti Sewa Griha - Nepal
Shanti Sewa Griha is a self - sufficient society for leprosy victims and other social outcasts .
Nepal is one of the few countries in the world where people still get leprosy .
Effective treatments exist .
But fear of the disease runs so deep that victims are often shunned even after they 've been cured .
Most end up as beggars around the country 's temples - though even here they are often ostracised by other beggars .
Shanti Sewa Griha - meaning " Peace , Help and Home " in Nepali - was set up to help the beggars around one of the biggest temples in the capital Kathmandu .
" We started with 13 leprosy affected people back in 1992 , " remembers Krishna Gurung , one of Shanti 's founders .
" Now we have altogether over a thousand people . "
As well as medical care , Shanti also offers employment through tailoring , handicrafts and organic gardening .
Even the most severely disabled are given some useful role .
" It 's about finding the talents that are hidden in them , " says Krishna .
" We have a badly maimed person but he can hold one device - he is making all the staircases , and he 's doing a beautiful job . "
Shanti Sewa Griha has recently opened a new site outside the city .
Building on the self - sufficient , village - like ethos of the original centre , the new site incorporates workshops , a school and a free health clinic .
Google 's Project 10^100 ( " Project 10 to the 100th " ) calls for ideas to change the world , in the hope of helping as many people as possible .
How ?
Fill out the submission form , outlining your idea .
You can supplement your proposal with a 30 - second video .
In January , Google will post a selection of one hundred ideas and ask the public to choose twenty semi-finalists .
After that , an advisory board will select up to five final ideas .
Google committing $ 10 million to implement these projects , with the goal to help as many people as possible .
The submission can be on topics like community , environment , health , education , or anything else .
While I scan the Internet regularly for innovative ideas in the area of development and aid , this is the first time I came across Project 10^100 ( found it thanks to WorldChanging ) .
So I almost missed the occasion : the deadline for submission on Oct 20th , so if you want to change the world , you have two days left .
Only some of the sheep in the field were totally blue
The unusual appearance of a flock of sheep spotted in a North Tyneside field was the result of fights between rival males , a farmer has said .
The animals , in Dudley , near Cramlington , had been let out early to produce lambs for the spring market .
Rams were marked with a blue dye which gets transferred to a ewe during intercourse so the farmer can tell which female could be pregnant .
But the males fought amongst themselves and covered each other with dye .
The farmer , who did not want to be named , said : " They get a bit bored before they get let out and start fighting with each other .
" That 's how they start covering each other in blue dye , while the ewes just get a bit of blue on their backs .
" If you look closely , the all - blue ones are the daddies . "
The protection needs against gems are always there and when we are dealing with certain unknown circumstances we need to know that we are not going to get into trouble just because we are not sure about the best things .
Within all types of medical setups in Australia and the areas where medical help is provided or where medical staff works , there is a greater chance of getting contaminated air breathed in .
There are many things that medical staff members must be handling at once .
Like for some people giving first aid to people having contagious issues is necessary and wearing face masks as well as the use of nitrile gloves becomes necessary .
We can say that the main reason behind the use of protective masks and gloves is that we need to be sure about keeping the germs away .
If we touch such places directly or treat people having such issues which can be transferred easily then we may become carriers of those germs and that leads to more troubles .
The use of masks likekn95 masks not only keep general issues away but also help in most of the contagious issues that are unstoppable if you are not well - prepared to combat the issues effectively .
The use of masks and gloves make it easier to work in environments where we might not have any other chance to get through the situation without getting affected .
In this manner when we buy masks we always sure to find out the purpose behind because there are many situations where they work out as better protective measures when people have to be exposed to the conditions that are not safe of have health risks with them .
Disposable masks and gloves can be thrown away easily and that is why they are used for the sake of keeping things under control and make sure that these protective options are disposed properly and will not be a part of harm to the environmental and other people around .

FIVE TRADING DAYS FIVE TRADING DAYS
Dow Jones industrial average , five days Panic gave way to pleasure Tuesday on Wall Street , but even the powerful 11 % gain in stock prices could n't quiet concern that this — like all recent rallies — could quickly flame out .
Adding to a month of nearly daily triple - digit moves , the Dow Jones industrial average surged 889 points , or 11 % , to 9065 in its second - largest point gain and sixth - biggest percentage gain ever .
The gains restored $ 1 trillion in stock value , taking some of the sting out of the $ 6.6 trillion that 's been erased from stock portfolios this year , according to the DJ Wilshire 5000 .
It was the first time the Dow has closed above 9000 in a week , and it came after two straight sessions in which stocks closed at new bear - market lows .
" It 's about time , " says Joseph Saluzzi , trader at Themis Trading .
" It 's impressive stocks have rallied . "
Impressive , maybe , but analysts cautioned that this could turn out to be the sixth in a string of failed one - day rallies in less than a month that lured buyers in only to shred more wealth .
" You throw money in , and then say , ' Whoa .
What happened ? ' " says Robert Maltbie of Singular Research .
For instance , the Dow rose a record 936 points on Oct. 13 and on Oct. 24 was back at a new bear - market low .
As often is the case with rallies in bear markets , stocks rose Tuesday in the face of bad news .
Consumer confidence hit all - time lows in October , the Conference Board said .
And home prices are down 17 % over the past 12 months , according to the S&P / Case - Shiller housing index .
CONFIDENCE : Plunges in October to record low Stocks pushed higher anyway on signs of easing in the credit markets and optimism the Federal Reserve will cut short - term interest rates today to 1 % from 1.5 % .
But traders said the biggest catalyst may have been fear of being left behind .
" People on the sidelines are drawn into the rally thinking this is the bottom and they do n't want to miss the train , " says Russ Koesterich of Barclays Global .
The recent stomach - churning volatility has forced selling by hedge funds and mutual funds .
Now , though , stocks are reasonably priced by historical standards even if doomsday is factored in , Maltbie says .
Investors are paying $ 9.30 for every $ 1 Standard & Poor 's companies are expected to earn next year , says Thomson Reuters .
That 's close to the $ 7 for every $ 1 of earnings investors paid at the bottom of the 1973 - 74 bear market .
There 's still more than a healthy dose of caution , though , as investors recall being burned all year as rallies quickly fell to waves of selling .
Investors itching to keep what 's left of their portfolios are selling into rallies , says Bill Gibson of Nollenberger Capital Partners .
That 's partly why the Dow and S&P have n't had two back - to - back up days in a month .
How markets react to the Fed 's move today will be critical , Gibson says .
If markets sell off into a rate cut , that does n't bode well for the bottom to hold .
And that 's why investors should remain wary , Maltbie says .
" You do n't want to get too excited .
It looks good .
But it 's a bear - market rally , " he says .
Still , Tuesday 's surge could make investors fearful of missing a surprise upside move , says Bill Stone , chief investment strategist at PNC Wealth Management .
" What you need people to do is get afraid not to buy , instead of just being afraid , " he says .

Soy Based Ink Printing : The New Wave of Commercial Printing
In this country , commercial printing products are all around us .
We have newspapers delivered daily , our mail is jammed with glossy brochures and catalogs , and billboards line our city streets .
Like baseball and apple pie , it ’s a part of our culture .
But what many people might not know is that the traditional commercial printing process is very taxing on the environment .
It uses tons of paper , energy , and — perhaps worst of all — the ink and solvents used in printing presses produce large amounts of volatile organic compounds , also known as VOC ’s , which are pollutants that can contaminate air , soil and groundwater .
Luckily , many in the printing industry have sought and developed greener , earth friendly solutions to the pollution problem .
One of the biggest advances has been the introduction of soy based inks into the commercial printing process .
Besides giving off high levels of VOC ’s , traditional inks used for printing are petroleum - based .
Soy based ink products , however , are derived from a mixture of soybean oil , pigments , resin and waxes .
The VOC levels are greatly reduced , and because the oil comes from soybeans grown in the United States , using soy based ink boosts our economy while decreasing the need for a foreign product such as petroleum .
Also , because soybean oil is clearer than petroleum distillates , less pigment is needed to produce the same effect , reducing the overall cost of the ink .
The recycling process is also helped by soy based inks because it can be removed more easily during de-inking than petroleum based products .
Although the environmental and economical benefits of soy based ink printing are reason enough to use them , there are aesthetic benefits as well : soy based inks actually produce brighter , richer colors than traditional inks , which is why they are used in over 90 % of US daily newspapers .
So while it ’s true that traditional commercial printing has been harsh on the environment , the good news is that greener alternatives are making their way into the industry , with soy based ink printing leading the pack .

Originally announced a year ago , Mozilla has released the ninth ( first official ) development milestone of Fennec , the mobile device edition of Firefox .
Current development is oriented and based on Nokia Internet Tablet platform ( powered by Linux - based Maemo ) , and this first release is available for this platform only .
A Windows Mobile version is also in the works and should be available in future development releases .
As you can see from the screenshot below it pretty much resembles Firefox but with an even deeper UI simplification .
The navigation bar for example is hidden until you pan the current page to the left .
Then you get the usual back , forward and star button ( tags included ) and access to Fennec preferences .
Pan to the right and you get your currently opened tab thumbnails with a close button on each and another one to add another tab .
Preferences are kept to a bare minimum , but a searchable download manager is provided , along with the add- ons manager that looks just like Firefox ’s including integration with Mozilla Add-ons , and pages for plugins , themes and extensions .
Security has n’t been neglected and the site button which tells what level of encryption and authentication the current site offers is displayed when you press it .
There is no way of telling from the primary UI though .
The awesome bar has also made its way to mobile and looks in your history and bookmarks tags , titles and addresses , for matches to your keywords .
One thing I definitely want in Firefox ( and have been trying to mock up for a while ) is the option of having several search engines ( a search bar ) accessible from the location bar , as you can see in the last line .
It is not keyboard accessible so far as I want it but at least the options are there .
The mobile team has made Fennec builds for Windows , Linux and Mac OS X available for everyone to try and Â get the most feedback possible .
For a more vivid taste of Fennec , check this demo video made by Fennec user experience team member , Madhava Enros .
Fennec Alpha Walkthrough from Madhava Enros on Vimeo .
It still lacks bookmark folders , plugins support ( sorry , no YouTube ) , and have some performance and UI redrawing issues , but that is expected from an alpha and as Mozilla ’s Jay Sullivan points out : “ Our focus so far has been on the user experience .
Â
Weâ€™re drawing inspiration from new ideas designed to make navigation easier and maximize the amount of the screen dedicated to Web content .
Â
We look forward to your feedback and will make lots more improvements to the user experience . ”

Nanotechnology will not fulfil it s potential without patent reforms Life - saving scientific research is being stifled by a " broken " patent system , according to a new report .
" Blocking patents " are delaying advances in cancer medicine and food crops , says the Canada - based Innovation Partnership , a non-profit consultancy .
The full benefits of synthetic biology and nanotechnology will not be realised without urgent reforms to encourage sharing of information , they say .
Their findings will be reported next week to UK policymakers and NGOs .
The report is compiled by the Innovation Partnership 's International Expert Group on Biotechnology , Innovation and Intellectual Property .
It cites examples of medical advances which have been delayed from reaching people in need - in both the developed and developing world .
These include HIV / Aids drugs and cancer screening tests .
In pharmacy , we no longer see much discovery - we see firms playing safe and holding onto their turf
Pat Mooney , ETC Group
The authors offer guidelines for a transition from " Old IP " to " New IP " , in which companies , researchers and governments recognise that sharing information is mutually beneficial .
" If we are to turn the atoms of publicly funded discovery into molecules of innovation ... we have to make sure research avenues stay open , " said the report 's lead author , Professor Richard Gold .
" That does n't mean there will be no patents .
It simply means that patents do n't become a barrier to early stage research .
" We do not want to end up in the same situation with nanotechnology that we are in with genetics . "
Fortress IP
The traditional view is that strong patent protection stimulates innovation , reassuring companies that it is safe to invest in research without fear of being stung by rivals .
Under this " old " model of intellectual property ( IP ) , biotech firms raced to file a " fortress " of patents around newly discovered genes , closing off avenues of research for their competitors .
But this strategy is ultimately counter - productive for both industry and consumers , argues the report , not least because it deters grass roots research in universities .
Work on the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes that can cause breast cancer has been held up by legal disputes over patents held on the genes by Myriad Genetics , a biotech firm based in Utah , US .
Meanwhile , patients in European countries were denied access to the cancer screening kits , because national health services were unwilling to meet the cost .
The Myriad case is " an anatomy of old IP gone wrong " , said Dr Gold , Professor of Intellectual Property Law at McGill University in Montreal .
" Myriad is not the exception - it is the rule .
Others are following and will continue to follow , unless we drastically change things . "
To facilitate sharing of information , he believes companies should be encouraged to form " patent pools " , allowing them to cross-license their technologies without losing out on royalties .
An example is the pool established by the international partnership Unitaid to provide HIV patients in developing countries with access to affordable anti-retroviral drugs .
Partnerships Governments should develop public - private partnerships to conduct early stage research , and seek other ways to encourage innovation - via tax credits , for instance .
Meanwhile , patent offices must standardise their information gathering and do more to help firms in developing countries gain access to accurate patent information , the report recommends .
Reform now would ensure that society feels the full benefit of new fields such as synthetic biology , a discipline that could lead to cells with novel genomes which perform useful functions , such as making biofuels or absorbing greenhouse gases .
Dr Craig Venter , the man who led the private sector effort to sequence the human genome , has already raised eyebrows by applying to patent the method he plans to use to create a " synthetic organism " .
Fears that these patents may be too broad have been raised by the ETC Group , which campaigns for the reform of biotech patenting .
" The patenting system is not functioning .
It is more of a barrier than an incentive , " said Pat Mooney , the organisation 's executive director .
" In pharmacy , we no longer see much discovery - we see firms playing safe and holding onto their turf .
" Meanwhile , in nanotechnology , we have seen some dangerously broad patents , which cut off whole areas of research .
" Patent offices must get up to speed with new areas of science , so they know exactly how much they are giving away . "

What are these ?
By George Will - November 18 , 2008
WASHINGTON -- " Nothing , " said a General Motors spokesman last week , " has changed relative to the GM board 's support for the GM management team during this historically difficult economic period for the U.S. auto industry . "
Nothing ?
Not even the evaporation of almost all shareholder value ?
GM 's statement comes as the mendicant company is threatening to collapse and make a mess unless Washington , which has already voted $ 25 billion for GM , Ford and Chrysler , provides up to $ 50 billion more -- the last subsidy until the next one .
The statement uses the 11 words after " team " to suggest that the company 's parlous condition has been caused by events since mid-September .
That is as ludicrous as the mantra that GM is " too big to fail . "
It has failed ; the question is what to do about that .
The answer ?
Do nothing that will delay bankrupt companies from filing for bankruptcy protection , so that improvident labor contracts can be unraveled , allowing the companies to try to devise plausible business models .
Instead , advocates of a " rescue " propose extending to Detroit the government 's business model for the nation -- redistributing wealth from the successful to the failed , an implausible formula for prosperity .
Some opponents of bankruptcy say : GM must not be allowed to fail before it perfects batteries for its electric - powered Volt , which supposedly is a key to the company 's resurrection .
This vehicle was concocted to serve GM 's prolonged attempt to ingratiate itself with the few hundred environmentally obsessed automotive engineers in Congress .
They have already voted tax credits of up to $ 7,500 for purchasers of such cars -- bribes that reveal doubts about consumer enthusiasm for them at a price that would reflect cost .
Congress could help the Detroit Three by allowing them , when meeting CAFE ( corporate average fuel economy ) standards imposed by Congress , to count fuel - efficient cars they import from their overseas factories .
Congressional Democrats oppose that because those imports are not made by members of the United Auto Workers .
Those Democrats , their rhetoric notwithstanding , really care most about the union .
" Saving the planet " comes second and last comes the health of the auto companies .
Some opponents of bankruptcy stress that it might terminate health care coverage enjoyed by UAW retirees who are too young for Medicare .
Think about that .
If people want to retire before 65 , or 35 for that matter , that is their business .
But there is no public interest in protecting the luxury of retirement in the prime of life just because in palmy days a private contract between a union and a corporation established it as an entitlement for all seasons .
In his new book , " The Great Inflation and Its Aftermath , " Newsweek and Washington Post columnist Robert Samuelson recalls that in 1950 , when GM signed a five - year contract with the UAW , Fortune magazine celebrated this as the " Treaty of Detroit . "
Under " pattern bargaining , " Ford and Chrysler struck similar bargains , thereby eliminating competition in labor costs .
In 1950 , the Big Three 's share of America 's domestic auto market was about 95 percent , Japan 's and Germany 's war - smashed economies were feeble , and the VW Beetle was a barely discernible harbinger of a huge threat .
The Big Three and the UAW probably did not doubt the immortality of their oligopoly .
Six decades later , a " rescue " without bankruptcy will make those four entities wards of government .
Doing so would make the five entities ( including Washington ) collaborators in unfair competition with America 's thriving automobile industry that employs 113,000 Americans making vehicles containing many American - made components , but with foreign , mostly Japanese , nameplates .
As Detroit continues to shrink , many American jobs " lost " will be regained in this industry , and its American suppliers , as Americans continue to buy cars .
( Disclosure : Mrs. Will , who drives a GM product , is a public relations consultant for the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association . )
The Economist reports that as recently as 2005 , Americans bought more cars than did China , India , Russia and Brazil , combined .
This year those four will buy more than Americans buy , but that is , potentially , good news for Detroit .
In America 's saturated market , there is almost one car for every person of driving age ; in China there are three for every 100 , and fewer than that in India .
The Economist reports that in the next 40 years , the world 's automobile fleet will surge from 700 million to 3 billion .
After being restructured through bankruptcy , the Detroit Two , or One , might flourish .
Let 's find out .
The ruinous alternative is to squander , in a doomed attempt to " save jobs , " more scores of billions of scarce capital that will then be unavailable for job - creating investments in rising industries .
LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- A British couple who married in a lavish Second Life wedding ceremony are to divorce after one of them had an alleged " affair " in the online world .
Second Life users can interact and form relationships with other players ' avatars .
Amy Taylor , 28 , said she had caught husband David Pollard , 40 , having sex with an animated woman .
The couple , who met in an Internet chatroom in 2003 , are now separated .
" I went mad -- I was so hurt .
I just could n't believe what he'd done , " Taylor told the Western Morning News .
" It may have started online , but it existed entirely in the real world and it hurts just as much now it is over . "
Second Life allows users to create alter egos known as " avatars " and interact with other players , forming relationships , holding down jobs and trading products and services for a virtual currency convertible into real life dollars .

Taylor said she had caught Pollard 's avatar having sex with a virtual prostitute : " I looked at the computer screen and could see his character having sex with a female character .
It 's cheating as far as I 'm concerned . "

Bugfixes
The Amarok team , in a brief pause from the frantic coding marathon towards the final release , is very pleased to bring you Nujalik , Beta 2 of Amarok 2.0 .
This release comes with a substantial changelog since Beta 1 and almost all parts of Amarok have received attention .
Many bugs and crashes have been fixed and a few new features have snuck in as well .
As Amarok 2.0 gets closer to release , we have seen a significant increase in number of contributors providing patches and filing bug reports .
This has catapulted the development pace into never before seen rates !
Help us make Amarok 2.0 even better by testing , reporting bugs or contributing patches .
Also , please do n't forget to support Amarok during Roktober 2008
The most significant change in this release is the switch from SQLite to MySQL - embedded as the database backend .
MySQL - embedded allows us to leverage the performance increase of a MySQL configuration , whilst alleviating non trivial configuration that comes with a standalone server .
Furthermore , this will allow us to expose using a standalone MySQL server in the future , if so desired , though this is not possible yet .
Most noticeably , you will see much improved performance of collection scanning and searching , especially with very large music collections .
Since there are technical intricacies involved with building MySQL correctly , we strongly recommend using an official distribution package as we are working with packagers to ensure a minimum of problems .
For information on building and running Amarok on MySQL - embedded , please visit , edit and help update our wiki page

Having found the LittleBigPlanet marriage proposal so endearing , I decided to seek out some other inventive and geeky proposals .
After all , geeks are great at looking outside the box .
So here are a few proven geeky ways to say , “ Will you marry me ? ”
1. … with a LOLcat .
This past Valentine ’s Day , a marriage proposal appeared on icanhascheezeburger , with a cat plaintively asking for the lady ’s “ hand in marridj . ”
( Bonus : She replied using a LOLcat of her own . )
2. … in Bejeweled .
Earlier this year , a Jersey City man spent a month reprogramming Bejeweled so that when his girlfriend reached a high score , it would reward her with , “ Marry me ! ”
They are planning a Bejeweled - themed wedding , and PopCap has donated copies of the game for their guests .
3. … on Google Street View .
A few months ago , a software engineer held up a sign that read “ Proposal 2.0 : Marry me Leslie ! ” as a Google Street View car drove past his Silicon Valley office .
He then set up a website encouraging people to tell his girlfriend about it .
4. … with an iPod .
In 2004 , a Norwegian man proposed via an engraving on the back of a 20 GB iPod .
And the next year , someone did it with a nano .
5. … in a crossword puzzle .
The clue for 111 across in a 2007 Boston Globe crossword puzzle was “ a generic proposal . ”
The answer –“ will you marry me ? ” –was intended for a specific woman , whose boyfriend had appealed to romantic side of the crossword puzzle ’s writer .
6. … in Halo .
Last year , a Halo 3 player used the game ’s Forge map editor to write out “ Will You Marry Me ? ” in the terrain for his girlfriend to see .
7. …using Reddit .
Earlier this year , a young woman proposed to her “ classic nerd ” of a boyfriend with a reddit posting .
( Apparently he clicked the up arrow … )
8. … in a comic .
Penny Arcade fans may remember that back in 1999 , Mike Krahulik proposed to his girlfriend on the popular web comic .
9. … on Slashdot .
In 2004 , a man proposed in the “ most potentially embarassing way possible , ” a posting to Slashdot .
It only took the girlfriend fifteen minutes to reply !
10 . …over Twitter .
Just last week , a couple of “ tweethearts ” ( ha ! ) decided to get hitched over Twitter .
Apparently this geeky proposal style is getting to be a real trend !
So , can any of you geeky romantics beat these ?
I know that I ’m hoping for a proposal someday that will land on the front page of Digg …
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - A significant number of U.S. veterans back from wars in Iraq and Afghanistan begin abusing alcohol after returning , perhaps to cope with traumatic memories of combat , military researchers said on Tuesday .
Younger servicemen and women , those who were previously heavy drinkers , and call - ups from the National Guard and Reserves were the most likely to increase their drinking and to develop alcohol - related problems , according to the study .
“ Increased alcohol outcomes among Reserve / Guard personnel deployed with combat exposures is concerning in light of increased reliance ( on these ) forces ” by the Pentagon , the report said .
“ Active - duty Marines were also found to be at increased odds of continuing to binge drink after deployment , as well as to experience new - onset alcohol - related problems , ” wrote Isabel Jacobs and colleagues at the Naval Health Research Center in San Diego , California .
Men were considered heavy drinkers if they consumed more than 14 alcoholic drinks per week , women seven drinks ; binge drinking referred to downing five or more drinks in a day or occasion , four for women ; and alcohol problems constituted drunkenness or hangovers that interfered with work or other responsibilities .
Reasons for the increased rates of alcohol abuse among Guard and Reserve members may be that they receive less training and support services than other arms of the military , they must transition from civilian life to a war zone , and their units are less cohesive , the report said .
The researchers surveyed 48,400 service members before ( between 2001 and 2003 ) and after likely deployment ( 2004 to 2006 ) to identify heavy drinkers , binge drinkers , or those with alcohol - related problems .
Of those interviewed , 5,500 experienced combat and they were interviewed about a year after their return .
Combat veterans were 31 percent more likely to have begun binge drinking than those not exposed to combat .
Six percent of returning combat veterans started a new habit of heavy weekly drinking and 5 percent developed a drinking - related problem .
New cases of alcohol abuse also arose among those who had not been deployed or did not see combat , but the rate of new cases was lower compared with returning combat veterans .
Women also had different drinking habits than men .
“ Women were significantly more likely to start drinking heavily but less likely to start binge drinking or have alcohol - related problems compared with men , which may be due to women turning to drinking as a coping mechanism , whereas men may have a higher propensity for risk - taking behaviors , ” the researchers wrote in the Journal of the American Medical Association .
The findings were consistent with a recent study of soldiers returning from Iraq that found 12 percent of active - duty personnel had alcohol problems , and 15 percent of Reserve and National Guard members did .
The researchers said they hoped to direct intervention efforts at younger soldiers and other groups prone to alcohol abuse .
They also pointed to the need to treat post - traumatic stress suffered by returning veterans who may try to drown their memories in drink .
( This news release was issued by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Sacramento )
The following statement was released today by Bishop William Weigand , head of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Sacramento and former Bishop of Salt Lake City , in response to attacks on ( The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints ) for supporting California ’s Proposition 8 , defending the traditional definition of marriage :
“ Catholics stand in solidarity with our Mormon brothers and sisters in support of traditional marriage — the union of one man and one woman — that has been the major building block of Western Civilization for millennia .
“ The ProtectMarriage coalition , which led the successful campaign to pass Proposition 8 , was an historic alliance of people from every faith and ethnicity .
LDS were included — but so were Catholics and Jews , Evangelicals and Orthodox , African - Americans and Latinos , Asians and Anglos .
" Bigoted attacks on Mormons for the part they played in our coalition are shameful and ignore the reality that Mormon voters were only a small part of the groundswell that supported Proposition 8 .
“ As the former bishop of the Diocese of Salt Lake City , I can attest to the fact that followers of the Mormon faith are a good and generous people with a long history of commitment to family and giving to community causes .
“ I personally decry the bigotry recently exhibited towards the members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints — coming from the opponents of Proposition 8 , who ironically , have called those of us supporting traditional marriage intolerant .
“ I call upon the supporters of same - sex marriage to live by their own words — and to refrain from discrimination against religion and to exercise tolerance for those who differ from them .
I call upon them to accept the will of the people of California in the passage of Proposition 8 . ”

Australia is now the cheapest place in the world to buy an iPod , thanks to the Australian dollar 's sharp decline , a new study shows .
And it 's not just good news for music lovers , with CommSec saying the currency 's decline will boost Australia 's trade competitiveness and help insulate the nation from the global economic downturn .
The CommSec iPod index shows that Australia is the cheapest place among 62 countries to buy an Apple iPod 8 GB nano music player .
It ranked as the 14th cheapest in July .
How far was Dick Cheney ( right ) willing to go to get his war in Iraq ?
Former House Majority Leader Dick Armey , quoted in Washington Post reporter Barton Gellman ’s new book , says the vice president hoodwinked him during a one - on - one meeting in the Capitol .
Armey claims he was wavering on the Iraq war , until Cheney fed him a bunch of bunk about suitcase nukes and the like .
“ Did Dick Cheney … purposely tell me things he knew to be untrue ? … I seriously feel that may be the case . …
Had I known or believed then what I believe now , I would have publicly opposed [ the war ] resolution right to the bitter end . ”
That ’s Armey , in a quote from the book as reported by The Washington Post , perhaps doing a bit of legacy polishing .
One might ask the distinguished gentleman from Texas why he did n’t bother to request any intelligence during his private cherry - picking session .
Alaska GOP 's Last - Ditch Palin Defense
Only days before the scheduled release of an investigative report on whether Sarah Palin abused her power as Alaska ’s governor in the “ Troopergate ” case , six pro-Palin lawmakers have lodged an emergency appeal asking the state Supreme Court to shut down the inquiry .

Printer friendly The Alaska Supreme Court agreed to hear oral arguments in the appeal on Wednesday and rule by Thursday , the day before the report is set to be released .
The appeal followed an Oct. 2 ruling by a Superior Court judge rejecting the Republican effort to block the report ’s release .
The six GOP lawmakers claim that the legislative inquiry into Palin ’s firing of state Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan in July – after he refused to fire her estranged ex- brother - in - law , a state trooper – has become tainted by partisan politics .
In their Oct. 3 appeal to the state ’s Supreme Court , the pro-Palin lawmakers argued that Alaska citizens “ will suffer irreparable harm if the investigation at issue continues and if the resulting investigative report issues as planned on Oct. 10 , 2008 . "
The appeal seeks to reverse a ruling by Superior Court Judge Peter Michalski , who allowed the inquiry to continue .
In an 11 - page opinion , Michalski said , " it is legitimately within the scope of the legislature 's investigatory power to inquire into the circumstances surrounding the termination ( of ) a public officer the legislature had previously confirmed . "
The probe centers on whether Palin , her husband Todd , and several of her senior aides pressured Public Safety Commissioner Monegan to fire Mike Wooten , a state trooper who was engaged in an ugly divorce and child custody dispute with Gov. Palin 's sister .
In July , Monegan claimed that he was fired because he refused to fire Wooten .
Palin cited other reasons , such as a budgetary dispute , and the governor initially welcomed the legislative inquiry , which was approved unanimously by the Republican - dominated Legislative Council .
However , after Palin was tapped as the Republican vice presidential nominee in late August , she and her allies reversed themselves and began resisting the inquiry , including a refusal by Todd Palin and several senior Palin aides to testify under legislative subpoena .
Emergency Appeal
In the emergency appeal to stop the Oct. 10 report , Republican legislators Wes Keller , Mike Kelly , Bob Lynn , Carl Gatto , Fred Dyson and Tom Wagoner called the inquiry “ an unconstitutional and unlawful legislative investigation . ”
The six lawmakers labeled the anticipated report by independent investigator Steven Branchflower an “ October Surprise ” intended to influence the outcome of the presidential election .
In opposing the appeal , Peter Maassen , the attorney representing Alaska ’s Legislative Council , said the investigation is nearly complete and that the six GOP lawmakers would not “ shut down the investigation ” but rather would only “ suppress ” the findings .
He wrote : “ The prospect that this Court would suppress a report , the contents of which at this point are wholly unknown , solely on the unsupported assertions of the plaintiff legislators that it might possibly say something hurtful about somebody — the most likely ‘ somebody ’ ... being the Governor , who presumably can fight her own legal battles — is utterly far - fetched . ”
In an earlier court filing , Maassen said Sen .
John McCain ’s presidential campaign tried to derail the inquiry because its findings could “ cause serious damage to the Republican ticket . ”
The “ McCain campaign and its supporters , having apparently convinced themselves that the facts would cause serious damage to the Republican ticket if publicly known before the national election , are now moving on many fronts — including this one — to slow and stop Mr. Branchflower ’s fact - finding inquiry and to prevent his issuance of the report authorized by the Legislative Council , ” said Maassen ’s court filing .
Judge Michalski also threw out a lawsuit filed by Palin ’s Attorney General Talis Colberg seeking to invalidate more than a dozen subpoenas seeking testimony from senior Palin aides .
Michalski rejected Colberg ’s argument that Alaska ’s Senate Judiciary Committee does not have subpoena authority .
On Sunday , Colberg said he wo n’t challenge the judge ’s ruling .
In a statement , he said seven state employees who were subpoenaed by Branchflower will make arrangements to testify before the independent counsel is scheduled to release his report to the legislature on Friday .
" Despite my initial concerns about the subpoenas , we respect the court 's decision to defer to the Legislature , " Colberg said .

Ever since Freelance Hellraiser got the Internet ’s nutz in a twist with 2001 ’s “ A Stroke of Genius ” — a seamless mash - up of the Strokes ’ “ Hard to Explain ” and Christina Aguilera ’s “ Genie in a Bottle ” — the ultimate , 21st Century tribute to the It rock band of the year has been an endless barrage of ( mostly ) unauthorized mash - ups , remixes , covers , and alternate versions .
And without a doubt , this year ’s chosen mashees are Spin ’s November cover boychiks MGMT .
Here ’s an incomplete , but still seemingly endless ( 25 or so ) round - up , in order of my personal preference :
“ All My Children ” ( MGMT vs. LCD Soundsystem ) , Immuzikation
Immuzikation , a.ka .
Athens , Georgia ’s Alfredo P. Lapuz , Jr. , is the mash - up man of the moment , and this extended massaging of LCD ’s “ All My Friends ” ( basically a mash - up of Steve Reich and New Order , anyway ) with MGMT ’s “ Kids ” is a fascinating mix of aging hipster regret and childlike hipster nostalgia .

“ One More Time to Pretend ” ( MGMT vs. Daft Punk ) , Immuzikation
Perhaps this mash was inevitable , but Immuzikation just nails it , allowing MGMT ’s “ Time to Pretend ” to bubble out of Daft Punk ’s disco fanfare “ One More Time ” like it ’d always been there waiting to emerge .
And the Doors outro is pure comedy genius .

We believe that everyone should be able to understand how the financial crisis came about , what it means for all of us , and what our options are for getting out of it .
Unfortunately , the vast majority of all writing about the crisis – including this blog – assumes some familiarity with the world of mortgage - backed securities , collateralized debt obligations , credit default swaps , and so on .
You ’ve probably heard dozens of journalists use these terms without explaining what they mean .
If you ’re confused , this page is for you .
Over time , we will be adding more explanations and more links to external sources , so check back for updates .
( Some of the explanations on this page are simplified and not 100 % accurate ; their goal is to explain the key concepts to a general audience . )

Securitization , CDOs , and banking capital
( I wrote this in August , in another context , for people without a financial background to explain what was going on .
Note that it does not describe what has happened since August , which is that we have a liquidity crisis / crisis of confidence as well . )
Even general news accounts presuppose an understanding of terms like “ securitization , ” “ CDO , ” and writedown . ”
So I thought I would provide my own translation .
Historically local banks took deposits from savings account customers and lent money to homebuyers .
They paid 1 % for the savings accounts and collected 6 % on the mortgages , and the spread ( 5 percentage points in this case ) was more than enough to compensate for any homebuyers who could n’t pay their mortgages .
( The numbers are illustrative only . )
Then , as any explanation of the subprime crisis says , banks started reselling and securitizing mortgages .
But what does it mean to resell ( let alone securitize ) a mortgage ?
To understand this , you have to look at it from the bank ’s point of view .
To them , a mortgage is a product .
This product gives them a monthly stream of payments – about $ 1,000 per month for a 30 - year , fixed - rate mortgage on a loan amount of $ 150,000 ( numbers are very approximate ) , but that stream is not guaranteed ; the homebuyer might not be able to pay ( in which case they might have to renegotiate or foreclose , both of which are costly ) , or might pay the whole thing early .
The price they pay for this product ( this stream of payments ) is just the loan amount ; from their perspective , they are “ buying ” the stream of payments by paying you the loan amount .
The lower the interest rate you get , the higher the price they are paying for your payments .
If Bank A resells your mortgage to Bank B , Bank B buys your payment stream from Bank A in exchange for a lump sum of money .
Under stable market conditions , the lump sum that B gives A will be about the same as the lump sum you received from A ( in which case A only makes money from various fees ) .
You can also think of this as Bank B loaning you the money for your house , with Bank A acting as an intermediary .
Now , in practice , Bank B ( or C , or D , … ) is often an investment bank .
And Bank B often securitizes your mortgage .
This means they take your mortgage and combine it with many ( thousands of ) similar mortgages .
If the mortgages are similar according to certain objective criteria – creditworthiness of borrowers , loan - to - value ratios , etc. – they can be treated as homogeneous .
( Something similar happened with corn in the 19th century ; certain standards were established for different grades of corn , and from that point bushels of corn from different farms did n’t have to be separately shipped and inspected by buyers , but could be poured together into huge vats . )
Now you have a pool of , say , 10,000 mortgages , with about $ 10 million in payments coming in from borrowers every month .
That pool as a whole has a price – the amount someone would pay to get all of those payment streams of that riskiness .
In a securitization , the investment bank divides the pool up into many small slices – say 1,000 in this case .
Each slice can be bought and sold separately , and each slice entitles the buyer to 1/1,000th of the payments streaming into that pool .
The price of these slices is based on current assumptions about the riskiness of those payments – the riskier those payments are perceived to be , the lower the price anyone will pay for a slice of them .
The problem is that at the time those mortgages were securitized , the buyers assumed that housing prices could only go up , and therefore the payments were not very risky ; when housing prices began to fall , many more borrowers became delinquent than had been expected .
As a result , if you own a slice of that pool , you still own 1/1,000th of the payments coming in , but your expectations of how many payments will come in are much lower than they were when you bought the slice .
( A collaterized debt obligation is a securitization where the slices are not created equal .
Some slices are entitled to the first payments that come in each month , and hence are the safest ; some slices only get the last payments that come in each month , so when people start defaulting , those are the slides that lose money first . )
This brings us to writedowns and , eventually , to the subject of banking capital .
Let ’s say you are an investment bank and you paid $ 1 million for a slice of a securities offering ( a pool ) .
You put that on your books as an asset ( in the world of finance , a stream of payments coming to you is an asset ) valued at $ 1 million .
However , a year later , that slice is only worth $ 200,000 ( you know this because other people selling similar slices of similar pools are only getting 20 cents on the dollar ) .
You generally have to mark your holding to market ( account for its current market value ) , which means now that asset is valued at $ 200,000 on your balance sheet .
This is an $ 800,000 writedown , and it counts as a loss on your income ( profit and loss ) statement .
And that is what has been going on over the last year , to the tune of over $ 100 billion at publicly traded banks alone .
The next problem is that , over the last two decades , most of our banks have become giant proprietary trading rooms , meaning that they buy and sell securities for profit .
Let ’s say you start a bank with $ 10 million of your own money .
That ’s your “ capital . ”
You go out and borrow $ 90 million from other people , typically by selling bonds , which are promises to pay back the money at some interest rate .
Then you take the $ 100 million and buy some stuff ( like slices of mortgage pools ) , which pays you a higher interest rate than you are paying on your bonds .
Suddenly you are making money hand over fist .
But then let ’s say that housing prices start falling , securitized subprime mortgages start plummeting in value , and your $ 100 million in assets are now only worth $ 80 million .
Since the value of your debt ( $ 90 million ) has n’t changed , you are technically insolvent at this point , because your losses exceed your capital ; put another way , the money coming in from your slices of mortgage pools is n’t enough to pay your bondholders .
According to some observers , this is where Fannie and Freddie were until they were bailed out by the U.S. government ; by certain accounting rules , they had negative capital .
Stock market vs. credit market
There is a discussion in my 10/6/08 post that may be helpful .
Crises of confidence and bank runs
The discussion above describes how a bank can become technically insolvent – that is , their assets become worth less than their liabilities .
However , since the Lehman bankruptcy on September 15 , the crisis has moved into a new phase .
In this phase , financial institutions are facing liquidity runs , or bank runs , whether or not they are solvent .
How can this happen ?
To understand this , first you have to understand the time dimension of assets and liabilities .
A 30 - year mortgage , for a bank , is a long - term asset .
They will get a mortgage payment every month for 30 years and , most importantly , they ca n’t call in the loan before then ; that is , they ca n’t demand that the homeowner pay it back .
Bank assets have different maturities , or durations , but a lot of them are medium and long term .
On the other side , banks have liabilities with different maturities .
For example , deposits ( savings accounts ) can be withdrawn at any time , so their maturity is essentially instant .
Banks also issue bonds : in exchange for some money up front , the bank typically has to pay the bondholder ( lender ) a fixed monthly payment for some period of time , and then pay back the face value at the end of that period .
Banks also engage in many more exotic forms of financing , such as repo agreements , where the bank sells a security to a counterparty for $ 99 and promises to buy it back for $ 100 some time later .
The general point , though , is that banks tend to borrow short and lend long .
In the classic case , the bank takes money from depositors and loans it out as mortgages .
The bank may start out with $ 10 in capital and $ 90 in deposits .
Then it may lend $ 80 as mortgages , leaving it $ 20 in cash .
This means it has a leverage ratio ( assets to capital ) of 10 , since it has $ 100 in assets ( $ 80 in mortgages plus $ 20 in cash ) and $ 10 in capital .
It also has $ 20 in cash for $ 90 in deposits , which is a high reserve ratio .
But do you see the problem ?
If every depositor tries to withdraw his money at the same time , the bank ca n’t call in its mortgages , and there wo n’t be enough cash for everyone .
Now why would this happen , since it is unlikely that everyone will need his cash at the same time ?
It happens if each depositor starts worrying that his or money might not be safe , and that every other depositor will try to withdraw money , then everyone tries to withdraw his money at the same time .
In ordinary times , bank runs do n’t happen .
First , the FDIC insures all deposit accounts up to $ 100,000 per account holder , precisely to prevent this kind of panic .
However , in a real bank many of the liabilities are not deposit accounts and hence are not insured .
Second , banks can ordinarily borrow money “ against ” their assets ; that is , a bank with $ 100 in good mortgages can borrow almost $ 100 from another bank – or , under certain conditions , from the Federal Reserve – by pledging those mortgages as collateral .
If the bank ’s assets are securities – mortgage - backed securities or CDOs , for example – they can also be used to raise short - term money .
These are no ordinary times , however .
The fundamental problem is that all players in the financial system have realized that a bank that is solvent ( assets > liabilities ) can still be subject to a bank run .
Once that happens , Bank A does n’t want to lend money to Bank B for two reasons : first , Bank A wants to hold onto its cash in case it becomes the target of a bank run ; and second , Bank A is afraid that Bank B could be the target of a bank run , and hence is afraid that if it lends to Bank B it wo n’t get its money back .
Like all such panics , of course , this becomes self - fulfilling : because banks do n’t want to lend , banks ca n’t get short - term credit , which makes them vulnerable .
This hits home when a bank has to “ roll over ” its short - term liabilities .
Remember , banks borrow short and lend long .
So periodically – almost continuously , in fact – banks have to pay off and replace their short - term liabilities ( or just agree with the lender to extend the loan another 30 or 90 days ) .
And even though depositors are insured , all the other liabilities are not insured .
The bank run happens when none of the short - term lenders want to extend their loans , and no one else is willing to offer a short - term loan .
In short , this is what has been going on during the last few weeks .
The key characteristic of such a crisis is that banks can be hit by bank runs – and go bankrupt – even if their assets are worth more than their liabilities .
The Fed has vastly expanded the amount of money it is willing to lend to banks and the range of collateral it is willing to take in an effort to provide the short - term funding banks need to fend off bank runs .
In the longer term , though , the Fed is a relatively small player combined to the entire market for short - term credit , and the problem will not go away completely until that market is working properly again .
Credit Default Swaps
I ’ve had a couple of requests for an explanation of credit default swaps .
I ’m not sure I can improve on the discussion in the second This American Life episode in our Radio shows section , but I ’ll give it a shot .
A credit default swap ( CDS ) is a form of insurance on a bond or a bond - like security .
A bond is an instrument by which companies raise money .
A company , say GE , issues a bond with a face value of $ 100 and a coupon of , say , 6 % .
This means that if you hold the bond , they will send you $ 6 per year ( 6 % of $ 100 ) until the bond matures ( say in 10 years ) ; at they point , they will pay you $ 100 ( the face value ) .
To buy that bond , you pay them about $ 100 .
If you pay exactly $ 100 , the yield is 6 % ( $ 6 divided by $ 100 ) .
If you pay less , the yield is more than 6 % .
How much the bond actually sells for depends on how risky you think GE is ( the chances that they will go bankrupt and wo n’t pay you ) and on what interest rates you can get for other , similarly - risky bonds in the market .
Bond - like securities , like CDOs , are similar in these basic respects .
When you buy a bond , you are taking on two types of risk : ( a ) interest rate risk and ( b ) default risk .
Interest rate risk is the risk that interest rates in general will go up .
If interest rates go up , the value of your bond goes down ( bonds are traded in the secondary market ) , because you are still only getting $ 6 per year .
Default risk is the risk that the bond issuer goes bankrupt and does n’t pay you back .
A CDS is called a “ swap ” because you are swapping the default risk – but not the interest rate risk – to another party , the insurer .
The bond holder pays an insurance premium – typically quoted in basis points , or one - hundredths of a percentage point , per year – to the insurer .
In exchange , the insurer promises to pay off the bond if the issuer goes bankrupt and fails to pay it off .
At the time the CDS goes into effect , the expected value of the premium payments ( a small amount every year ) should exactly equal the expected value of the insurance payments ( a large amount , but only if the issuer defaults ) .
This sounds pretty simple , right ?
So how did CDS become a dirty word ?
There are two main wrinkles to be aware of .
First , in order to buy a CDS ( I call the bondholder in the above example the “ buyer , ” and the insurer the “ seller ” ) , you do n’t actually have to own the bond in question .
These are over - the - counter derivative contracts , which means they are individually negotiated between buyers and sellers .
As a result , CDS became the tool of choice for betting on the likelihood of a company going bankrupt .
If you thought the chances of company A going bankrupt were higher than everyone else thought they were , you would buy a CDS on company A .
Three months later , when everyone else realized company A was in trouble , the market prices for CDS would have gone up , and you could either sell your CDS to someone else at the higher price , or you could sell a new CDS at the higher price .
( In the latter case , you still have your original contract , and you write a new contract with a new buyer . )
As a result , there are a lot of CDS out there ; estimates are generally around $ 60 trillion , which means the total face value of the bonds insured is $ 60 trillion .
Second , CDS are not regulated , and in fact there was a measure inserted into an appropriations bill in December 2000 that blocked any agency from regulating them .
Traditional insurance , by contrast , is highly regulated .
Insurers have to maintain specific capital levels based on the amount of insurance they have sold ; certain percentages of their assets have to be investments of specified quality levels ; and , for personal insurance and workers ’ compensation at least , private insurance companies are generally backed up by state guarantee funds , which charge a percentage of all insurance premiums and , in exchange , pay off claims for bankrupt insurers .
The CDS market had none of that , so a bank could sell as many CDS as it wanted and invest the money in anything it wanted .
So , 2008 rolled around , and bonds started going bad .
There were CDS not just for traditional corporate debt , but also for mortgage - backed securities , CDOs , and secondary CDOs .
During the boom , when everyone was optimistic , CDS for these exotic products were cheap ; when they started failing , the price of CDS shot up , and anyone who had sold these swaps was looking at losses on them .
So CDS were one way that losses on subprime mortgages triggered writedowns at other financial institutions .
This only got worse as banks , such as Bear Stearns and Lehman , started failing , and people who had sold CDS on their debt faced even larger losses .
So the most basic problem with CDS is that the insurers selling them ( and many of the companies selling them were not insurance companies ) sold them at excessively low prices , and now they are facing major losses .
Second , you have the risk that the insurance companies wo n’t be able to pay .
If a financial institution – say , AIG – sold a lot of CDS based on the debt of a particular company – say , Lehman – there is a risk that it wo n’t be able to honor all of those swap contracts .
In that case , their counterparties – other banks – may be looking at losses they thought they were insured against .
If Bank B bought a CDS from Bank C on the debt of Company X , and Company X defaults , Bank B thinks it has a payment coming to it from Bank C ; but if Bank C does n’t have the cash , Bank B wo n’t get its payment .
Even worse , let ’s say Bank B bought a CDS from Bank C , and then sold a different one to Bank A. Bank B thinks it is perfectly hedged , and Bank A thinks it has a payment coming .
But if Bank C ca n’t pay out , Bank B may not be able to pay Bank A – and these chains can go on and on and on .
So CDS are one of the things that create uncertainty in the banking sector ; a bank may look healthy , but it may be counting on CDS payouts from other banks that you ca n’t see , so you ca n’t be sure it ’s healthy , so you wo n’t lend to it .
The cumulative effect of CDS is to spread risk , which sounds good , but to spread risk in unpredictable and invisible ways .
One of the major reasons why the government refused to let AIG fail – one day after letting Lehman fail – was that AIG was a large net seller of CDS , and if it had defaulted on those swaps no one could predict what the implications would be for the rest of the financial sector .
At this point in the financial crisis , it would be a mistake to blame the whole thing on CDS , but they have had the effect of amplifying and spreading uncertainty in ways that have reduced confidence in the financial sector .
Bank recapitalization
If you read the section on securitization above , you know a little bit about what a bank balance sheet looks like .
There are assets ( things you have that are worth money and that you theoretically could sell for cash ) and liabilities ( money you owe other people ) , and hopefully your assets are more than your liabilities .
The difference is your “ stockholder ’s equity . ”
So your assets equal your liabilities plus your equity .
Think about it this way : in order to buy assets ( or loan money , which creates assets ) , a bank needs to get cash from somewhere .
It has two ways of raising cash .
First , it can borrow money and promise to pay it back : those are liabilities .
Second , it can sell ownership shares in itself .
If you buy those shares , the bank does not say it will give you your money back ; it says that you are entitled to some percentage of the bank as a whole .
This is what it means to own stock in a company .
If times are good , the assets grow in value while the liabilities stay constant , so stockholder ’s equity goes up .
Roughly speaking , this means that if the bank sold all its assets and paid off all its liabilities , there would be more money left for the stockholders than they put in .
Of course , if times are bad , stockholder ’s equity goes down .
If it goes down too far , assets are not much more than liabilities , and the bank risks becoming insolvent .
In this case , raising more money through loans ( liabilities ) does not really help , because it just increases the leverage ratio .
( If I have $ 100 in assets and I owe $ 99 , then borrowing $ 10 just means I have $ 110 in assets and I owe $ 109 . )
Instead , banks need to increase their stockholder ’s equity by selling more shares in themselves .
This is a recapitalization .
To simplify things a little , this means that they sell more ownership shares in themselves in exchange for cash ; that cash makes stockholder ’s capital go up , and the bank has more cash , yet it does n’t have more debts .
The downside is that the current shareholders have been diluted .
If a bank has $ 5 billion in stockholder ’s equity and it raises $ 5 billion by selling shares , the old shareholders now only own half of the bank , which may make them unhappy .
The above is a simple example .
In practice , new capital is usually added in the form of preferred shares , which are somewhere between ordinary ( common ) stock and debt , but closer to stock .
Preferred shares often pay a dividend , like a bond , meaning that the new investor gets a fixed amount of money each year ; preferred shares also often are convertible to common stock under some terms , meaning that the investor can trade them in for common stock ( if the common stock increases in value , you would want to do this ) .
But if the bank goes bankrupt , preferred shareholders get their money back only after the bondholders , so preferred stock is a good deal more risky ( for the investor ) than bonds .
Conversely , if a bank raises money by selling preferred stock , lenders will consider the bank safer ( because it has more cash ) and will be more likely to lend to it .
In all the recapitalizations you are seeing these days , whether the investor is Warren Buffett , Mitsubishi UFJ , the UK government , or the US government , you will see some version of this structure .
Where did all the money go ?
This is a fairly common question .
If banks are taking losses by writing down hundreds of billions of dollars , is someone else gaining hundreds of billions of dollars ?
Or is money just vanishing ?
Planet Money took a stab at this with Satyajit Das , but I thought I could help clarify it with a simple example .
Let ’s say the economy has just three people : Developer Danny , Homebuyer Harry , and Banker Bonnie .
At time zero , Developer Danny has $ 200,000 , Homebuyer Harry has $ 40,000 , and Banker Bonnie has $ 360,000 , so there is a total of $ 600,000 in the world .
Developer Danny sees that the housing market is hot , so he spends his $ 200,000 buying land and building a house that has a market price of $ 400,000 .
He then sells the house to Homebuyer Harry .
Harry makes a 10 % down payment of $ 40,000 and borrows $ 360,000 from Banker Bonnie .
Now , in time one , Danny has $ 400,000 in his pocket , up from $ 200,000 .
He has that $ 200,000 profit because he has created that much value – he took stuff that was only worth $ 200,000 and he made it worth $ 400,000 .
Good for him .
Harry has a $ 400,000 house and a $ 360,000 mortgage , so his net worth is $ 40,000 ; Bonnie has a $ 360,000 mortgage asset .
There are $ 800,000 in the world now , thanks to Danny .
Danny has $ 400,000 he can use to build more houses or buy expensive sports cars ;
Harry can get a home equity loan to renovate his kitchen , because he has positive equity ; and Bonnie can get more loans against her $ 360,000 asset .
Then , in time two , housing prices crash , so the house is only worth $ 300,000 .
Let ’s say Harry had an Option ARM mortgage and he can’t make his payments , so Bonnie forecloses on him .
Now Harry has nothing ; Bonnie has a house that is only worth $ 300,000 ; and Danny still has $ 400,000 .
There are only $ 700,000 in the world .
Harry ca n’t spend money , because he does n’t have any ; even after Bonnie resells the house , she does n’t have as much lending capacity as she used to .
( Even if Harry did make his payments , Bonnie ’s mortgage would still be worth $ 360,000 to her , but Harry would have negative equity for a long time , so there would still only be $ 700,000 in the world . )
What happened ?
The fact that housing prices went up meant that there was more money .
( Imagine the house already existed , and someone bought it for $ 200,000 and later sold it for $ 400,000 . )
But there was n’t actually more stuff – as the price goes up or down , a house is still a house .
As prices come down , there is less money to go around .
What makes it particularly painful is the phenomenon of leverage .
Because people , and banks , are able to borrow considerably more than their net worth , falls in asset prices are magnified .
This can create a vicious cycle .
For a highly leveraged financial institution , losses in one asset category can force you to raise cash by selling other assets , causing their prices to go down .
For a homeowner , if you had n’t borrowed money , the fall in the value of your home would n’t necessarily affect your consumption .
But if your consumption is based on your ability to borrow , then a small fall in your house ’s value can cause a large drop in your discretionary income .
There are many variations of my little example – for example , imagine that Bonnie sold half of the mortgage to Hedge Fund Helen ; or imagine that Danny invested his money in Hedge Fund Helen , so he gets hurt , too – but I think this demonstrates the basic principle .

Accusations come on the heels of Republican John McCain 's fraud attacks against community organisation Acorn
This article is more than 11 years old
This article is more than 11 years old
While John McCain has attacked the liberal US community group Acorn for alleged voter registration fraud , the Republican party continues to employ operatives facing fraud accusations including one who faces criminal perjury charges .
Democrats are accusing McCain of hypocrisy after the weekend arrest of Mark Jacoby , a California Republican operative .
Jacoby has been accused of voter registration fraud after registering himself to vote at two homes where he did not live .
The arrest comes after McCain and running mate Sarah Palin attempted to tie Barack Obama 's campaign to Acorn , playing up a federal investigation of the group 's voter registration tactics in several states .
" Over the past few weeks we 've heard John McCain denounce voter fraud on the campaign trail while the [ Republican party ] hurls false attacks , so the question is : where is the outrage now ? "
Democratic spokesman Karen Finney asked yesterday .
Jacoby is the second Republican operative revealed this week to possess a questionable record on voter registration .
Nathan Sproul – who has been investigated by Congress for allegedly destroying voter registration forms and intimidating voters – got paid $ 175,000 by the McCain camp this year .
" The Republicans [ and ] the McCain campaign have been hammering away for weeks with the same old Washington politics , " Democratic party lawyer Joe Sandler said in a statement .
" In fact , none of the charges that they 've been talking about have actually panned out . "
Democrats called on McCain to cut his ties to both voter - registration operatives , citing frequent Republican attacks on Acorn .
Obama represented Acorn as an attorney years before beginning his political career , and the group has endorsed him this year , but his camp has denied any link to Acorn 's voter - registration activities .
The California Republican party told a local newspaper yesterday that their contract with Jacoby ended this week , after the state 's voter registration period expired .
No announcement has been made about the renewal of the contract .
However , not everyone agreed with the findings .
Igor Aleksander , emeritus professor of neural systems engineering at Imperial College London , said : " It may be that by using the internet you stimulate different parts of the brain .
However , it would be difficult to show this could not be achieved through other situations . "
A 12 - year - old Iranian boy suffering from brain cancer is scheduled to arrive in Israel on Friday for emergency surgery .
The boy , who already underwent surgery in Tehran , was later admitted to a Turkish hospital , but his Ankara physicians soon discovered their facility lacked the technological and medical expertise needed to properly treat him .
Medical Assistance 17 Georgians wounded in Caucasus war to be treated in Israel Meital Yasur - Beit Or Israel 's humanitarian aid to war - ridden Georgia continues , as it flies seriously injured men , women in for medical treatment in leading hospitals 17 Georgians wounded in Caucasus war to be treated in Israel
The Turkish doctors suggested the family seek medical assistance in Israel , and so they did , through Israeli liaison Jacob Levin .
" I contacted and met with Dr. Feldman and Prof. Shapira from ( the Chaim Sheba Medical Center at ) Tel Hashomer , and after they looked over the case file they agreed to treat the boy if we could secure his arrival to Israel , " Levin told Yedioth Ahronoth .
" Once I had their consent , I contacted all the relevant government bureaus , so we would be given permission to fly him in , " he added .
The complex feat required a personal ex-gratia authorization from Interior Minister Meir Sheetrit , since the boy is Iranian and citizens of an enemy state are banned from entering Israel .
Sheetrit granted the request and forwarded it for the immediate review of the Shin Bet , ordering expedited proceeding be taken due to the boy 's grave medical condition .
The Shin Bet granted the request , saying the boy and his parents could stay in Israel – for two weeks at this point .
" We are the light upon the nations , and when a child 's life is at stake religion and origin play no part , " said Minister Sheetrit .
" If we can help , we are more than willing to do so . "

After months of campaigning , hours of election speeches and debates , and hundreds of opinion polls tracking the ebb and flow of the 2008 US presidential election , the time of reckoning is near .
Keep this guide to US election night to hand to check what will be happening when and what to look out for .
Remember each state has a certain number of electors in the electoral college that elects the president , so the winner is the one who wins enough states to stack up 270 electors ' votes .
We give the times the polls close in various states ( some straddle more than one time zone ) but if there is heavy turnout and / or problems with the voting equipment , some precincts may stay open longer .
KEY BATTLEGROUND STATES
Too close to call : Colorado , Virginia , North Carolina , Indiana , Montana , Missouri , North Dakota , Georgia , Arizona Swing states now and in 2004 : Michigan , Pennsylvania , Ohio , Florida
Experts ' predictions Q&A : Electoral college
In some cases , projected results will emerge immediately after voting ends but in other cases , depending on how tight the race is , they may not emerge for several hours ( or in the case of 2000 , several weeks ) .
So here goes : 2300 GMT ( 1800 EST ) :
The first polls close , but election night really gets going in another hour .
2400 GMT ( 1900 EST ) : Polls close in Georgia , Kentucky , South Carolina , Vermont but the ones to watch are Indiana and Virginia .
Both have gone Republican since 1964 , so if either of them go for Barack Obama , it could spell a miserable night for John McCain .
But if Senator McCain secures both , he is still in with a chance .
0030 GMT ( 1930 EST ) : Get set for drama here .
Polls close in the key battleground state of Ohio - it is finely balanced and we might have a long wait before we know which way it has gone .
In 2004 , the result was not called for several hours .
North Carolina has been fiercely targeted by the Obama campaign , which has flooded the state with money and volunteers .
Democratic success here could suggest Senator Obama is on a roll but a McCain triumph will signal late movement towards the Republican .
West Virginia should be called on the hour - a Republican win .
0100 GMT ( 2000 EST ) :
The night really speeds up now .
Polls close in 15 states and the District of Columbia .
Which way most of them will go seems pretty clear and the results should come quickly .
But watch out for these : • Missouri - the classic bellwether state .
It has backed the winner in every presidential race since 1904 , except President Eisenhower in 1956 , and the polls suggest a very tight contest .
• Florida -its 27 electoral college votes have been bitterly fought over - it's that important and a state Mr McCain simply must win .
• Pennsylvania - it has voted Democratic in the last five elections but has become another of the key battlegrounds .
Mr McCain really has to capture this Democratic " blue " state - the view is if he cannot win here , he almost certainly will not win the election .
• New Hampshire - Mr McCain is hoping to win here and he is in with a chance .
The state only has four electoral college votes but if the race is tight , they could be crucial .
Also closing here are Mr Obama 's home state of Illinois and Delaware - home state of his running mate Joe Biden .
( Note for election buffs : Maine - and Nebraska which closes in an hour - can split their electoral college vote count - the rest use the winner - takes - all method . )
0130 GMT ( 2030 EST ) : Polls close in Arkansas and it is safely Republican .
So if you need a quick breather , then now is your chance as in 30 minutes things could get really interesting .
0200 GMT ( 2100 EST ) : Another big bunch of states closes now and it is the earliest either candidate can realistically reach the magic 270 .
So depending on how things stand , it will be all over bar the shouting or the election night just got a lot longer .
Mr Obama has been targeting Colorado and New Mexico - which both went Republican in 2004 .
He really needs to win these if he has n't picked up any Republican " red " states by now .
Mr McCain needs to win the blue states of Michigan , Minnesota and Wisconsin if he is losing red states and has not secured Pennsylvania .
Polls also close in Mr McCain 's home state of Arizona .
ELECTION DAY ON THE BBC
Live text updates through the day and night , with input from BBC correspondents around the US Results as they come in , on a live updating map from midnight GMT Streaming video of the BBC election night programme in Washington Analysis from BBC North America editor Justin Webb in Washington , and Gavin Hewitt and Matthew Price at the candidates '
HQs 0300 GMT ( 2200 EST ) : Last of the real battleground states close now .
Mr Obama is expected to win in Iowa so if he does n't that will be a real upset .
Watch out for Nevada - the state has an uncanny knack of backing the eventual winner .
The Obama campaign has put a lot of money and workers here , so we will see if that paid off .
Montana until recently was not seen as a possible Democratic win but now it is .
0400 GMT ( 2300 EST ) : States closing here should be safe for their respective parties - Idaho ( four votes ) for Mr McCain , while California , Hawaii , Oregon and Washington are set to give Mr Obama 77 electoral votes .
So if the Democratic candidate has already won states like Virginia , North Carolina , Ohio , Indiana , or Florida , then he has it in the bag .
0600 GMT ( 0100 EST ) :
All polls have closed in Alaska and it would be a huge surprise if it did not stay Republican , given that the state 's governor , Sarah Palin , is on the ticket .
6 November 2012 : Election night rolls again .

Biomass energy and biomass fuel are becoming more and more viable options for a sustainable future .
But Biomass is a lot more fascinating than most people realize , with fuel sources ranging from chicken excrement to human fat and even stranger substances you might never have guessed .
The many , many different possibilities for biomass materials makes it one of the most fascinating forms of alternative energy – especially when you consider these unusual methods of biomass production :
Chicken Poop
Chicken manure , like cow byproducts , emits methane and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and is a growing environmental concern in the Netherlands .
Instead of exporting the problem as they ’ve done in the past , at least 440,000 tons of chicken poop will produce biomass energy in a new production plant .
Garbage
Scheduled to be in operation by the end of 2009 , America ’s first garbage to ethanol plant will be located in Los Angeles County , California .
These plants could offer a more sustainable option for alternative fuel while eliminating several tons of waste from landfills .
Human Fat
Earthrace is an eco-friendly boat operated on 100 % biomass fuel and proves that it is possible to produce biofuel from human fat , obtained by liposuction .
Read more on human fat and biomass energy .
Farm Waste
While wood and farm waste are not unusual materials for biomass fuel , Show Me Energy ’s biomass wood pellets and cooperative community energy projects are intriguing .
Local farmers provide ( and profit from ) the biomass plant ’s materials and then use the pellets to heat their homes and barns .
These locally produced biomass pellets are also being tested as a viable solution for generating clean energy .
Hazardous Materials
Otherwise difficult to dispose of hazardous waste , including medical , industrial , and chemical garbage , will become materials for a new energy plant planned in Indiana .
A combination of gasification and waste - heat - to - energy processes is proposed to convert the hazardous materials into energy .
Algae
The potential of algae as an alternative fuel option has been experimented with throughout history but is now receiving more attention as oil prices continue to soar .
Nearly half of an algae plant ’s total weight is oil , meaning an acre of this abundant pond scum could produce about 20,000 times the amount of oil for biofuel than a soybean crop produces !
Wheat Stubble
While some of the waste left behind after harvesting is important to maintain the soil , a large portion of it is simply wasted .
This stubble has the potential to be a truly sustainable biomass option – it does n’t require the introduction of a new species , will not detract from the food supply , and does n’t create any disruptions in the current environment like most biomass crops .
Slaughterhouse Waste
While many people are reducing or eliminating their meat consumption , the human race still consumes a lot of meat .
Slaughterhouses and farms that prepare these foods have quite an impact on the environment .
The Cows to Kilowatts initiative in Nigeria plans to eliminate the pollution slaughterhouses create while producing a clean and affordable fuel option .
Human Waste
The methane gases emited by human waste will soon turn on the lights in San Antonio , TX .
Plans for the first commercial US processing plant of this type are already underway and should harvest methane from about 90 % of the city ’s sewage .
The presidential candidates have been under a microscope for the last year , but today , the focus on Sen. Barack Obama 's face reached the nanoscale .
Sculpted using nanolithography by University of Michigan mechanical engineer , John Hart , each Obama face is composed of 150 million carbon nanotubes and measures half a millimeter across .
" We can make pretty much any 2 - D pattern by this technique , " Hart said .
But in honor of the election , Hart 's lab applied their technique to the now - ubiquitous image of Obama 's face created by Shepherd Ferry .
The only overtly political text that accompanies the images on nanobama.com is the tagline , " vote for science . "
When he and the rest of the nation do n't have election fever , the focus of Hart 's more serious research is finding ways to use nanomaterials to build useful electronics .
" The nanotubes themselves are perhaps the strongest molecule known to man , and also have fantastic electrical and thermal properties , " Hart said .
" However , effective methods of organizing large numbers of nanotubes are needed to realize many unique commercial applications . "
Hart has created a flickr set with 20 more images of Obama 's face for your liberal , nanoartistic pleasure .

South Australia is one of the states in Australia , which is located at the southern central part of the country .
The state is home to one of the aridest parts in Australia and in the entire continent .
Travel to South Australia will consist of visiting its capital city of Adelaide .
However , there are plenty of other things to do and sights to see outside of Adelaide .
In fact , 75 % of its 1.7 million population resides in the capital city of Adelaide .
The economy of South Australia is pretty diverse .
The largest employing industry is health care and social assistance .
However , retail trade is also a large contributor to the state ’s economy .
Other top economic sources include manufacturing , automotive , defense technology , pharmaceuticals , and electronic systems .
The state export is also earning billions of Australian dollars annually for the state .
When you travel to South Australia , you will quickly come to realize the unique idiosyncrasy that makes it stand out from the other Australian states .
As mentioned earlier , it is mostly filled with arid lands .
The state also consists of low mountain ranges and one of the most notable of them is the Mount Lofty - Flinders Ranges system .
Another notable attraction that visitors to South Australia look forward to is the wine region .
There are plenty of them to choose from and all are within close proximity to Adelaide , which makes them quite accessible .
The most notable wine regions in South Australia are those in McLaren Vale , Coonawarra , Adelaide Hills , and Clare Valley .
The average climate in South Australia is that of a Mediterranean climate , especially in the southern part .
The average temperature is 29 - degree Celsius ( in January ) and 15 - degree Celsius ( typically in July ) .
Facts You Did n’t Know About South Australia
• Adelaide , the capital of South Australia , is the first in the world to abolish sexual and racial discrimination .
It is also the first city in the world to abolish capital punishment and give land rights to the Aboriginal natives in Australia .
• South Australia has earned the nickname the “ Festival State ” in Australia .
The reason for this is that there are numerous festivals held in the state throughout the year such as the Adelaide Festival , Cabaret Festival , Feast Festival , and the Adelaide Film Festival .
Indeed , it is the hub for art and culture that brings in tourists to travel to South Australia .
• DID YOU KNOW that half of Australia ’s wine is produced in South Australia ?
There are over 18 wine regions in South Australia and all are within an hour - drive from the capital city of Adelaide .
These wine regions are one of the top places to visit for those who travel to South Australia .
• Aside from wines and festivals , South Australia is also a city known for its churches .
There are several churches found all over the state and they range across various architectural designs .
The oldest of these churches is the Holy Trinity Anglican Church that was built in 1838 .
• Adelaide is known as the 20 - minute city .
It is arguably very accessible and you can get from point A to point B within 20 minutes or less , thus the nickname .
• South Australia is the country ’s opal capital .
The town of Coober Pedy , in particular , is the largest opal - producing area in the world , not just Australia .
This area also sees one of the largest collections of underground houses and accommodations .
• South Australia is also the driest state in all of Australia .
The lowest point in Australia can be found in South Australia ’s Lake Eyre National Park .

Did Mars once have a thick atmosphere ?
Could the climate on the Red Planet have supported water and possibly life in the past ?
These are the questions NASA hopes to answer in great detail with the newest orbiter mission to Mars .
Called the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN ( MAVEN ) spacecraft , the $ 485 million mission is scheduled for launch in late 2013 .
MAVEN is part of the Mars Scout Program , which is designed to send a series of small , low - cost , principal investigator - led missions to the Red Planet .
The Phoenix Mars Lander was the first spacecraft selected in this program .
“ This mission will provide the first direct measurements ever taken to address key scientific questions about Mars ’ evolution , ” said Doug McCuistion , director of the Mars Exploration Program at NASA Headquarters in Washington .
Evidence from orbit and the planet ’s surface points to a once denser atmosphere on Mars that supported the presence of liquid water on the surface .
As part of a dramatic climate change , most of the Martian atmosphere was lost .
MAVEN will make definitive scientific measurements of present - day atmospheric loss that will offer clues about the planet ’s history .
“ The loss of Mars ’ atmosphere has been an ongoing mystery , ” McCuistion said .
“ MAVEN will help us solve it . ”
The science team will be led from the University of Colorado at Boulder , and its Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics .
The principal investigator for the mission is Bruce Jakosky from UC Boulder .
“ We are absolutely thrilled about this announcement , ” said Jakosky .
“ We have an outstanding mission that will obtain fundamental science results for Mars .
We have a great team and we are ready to go . ”
Lockheed Martin of Littleton , Colo. , will build the spacecraft based on designs from NASA ’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and 2001 Mars Odyssey missions .
MAVEN was evaluated to have the best science value and lowest implementation risk from 20 mission investigation proposals submitted in response to a NASA Announcement of Opportunity in August 2006 .
After arriving at Mars in the fall of 2014 , MAVEN will use its propulsion system to enter an elliptical orbit ranging 90 to 3,870 miles above the planet .
The spacecraft ’s eight science instruments will take measurements during a full Earth year , which is roughly equivalent to half of a Martian year .
MAVEN ’s instrument suites include a remote sensing package that will determine global characteristics of the upper atmosphere , and the spacecraft will dip to an altitude of 80 miles above the planet .
A particles and fields payload contains six instruments that will characterize the solar wind , upper atmosphere and the ionosphere â€ “ a layer of charged particles very high in the Martian atmosphere .
The third instrument suite , a Neutral Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer will measure the composition and isotopes of neutral and charged forms of gases in the Martian atmosphere
During and after its primary science mission , the spacecraft may be used to provide communications relay support for robotic missions on the Martian surface .

Slumping Jason Varitek hit a tiebreaking home run in the sixth inning as Boston evened the ALCS at 3 - all .
No late drama needed by the Red Sox this time -- they rallied from seven runs down with only seven outs left to win Game 5 .
Now Jon Lester starts Game 7 for the Red Sox on Sunday night against Matt Garza in a rematch of Game 3 , won by the Rays 9 - 1 at Fenway Park .
Last year , the Red Sox trailed Cleveland 3 - 1 before winning three in a row , then sweeping Colorado for their second Series title in four seasons .
" It 's great to get to Game 7 , to battle like this , " said Kevin Youkilis , who homered and drove in two runs .
" We went out there and played like it was our last game .
It was awesome . "
The pennant winner hosts the World Series opener Wednesday night against the well - rested Philadelphia Phillies , who won the NL pennant over the Los Angeles Dodgers in five games .
" It 's all about how we react to the moment , and it's a seventh game , " Rays manager Joe Maddon said .
" It 's a great learning experience .
For us to win that game would be something special for us , also .
So it 's not about looking into the past .
It 's about looking into the future right now . "
Red Sox ace Josh Beckett , who struggled in his first two starts of the playoffs , allowed two runs and four hits in five innings despite reduced velocity , and Hideki Okajima , Justin Masterson and Jonathan Papelbon combined for hitless relief .
" It 's probably pretty appropriate .
We come down to the last game , and whoever plays better gets to move on , " Red Sox manager Terry Francona said .
B.J. Upton tied an AL record with his seventh home run of the postseason .
After Boston went ahead 2 - 1 , Tampa Bay tied it on Jason Bartlett 's fifth - inning homer .
But the Rays did n't get another hit , and the Red Sox improved to 9 - 0 in ALCS elimination games under manager Terry Francona .
Varitek , the Red Sox captain , had been 0 - for - 14 in the series before his homer in the sixth finished Shields , who allowed four runs and nine hits in 5 2/3 innings .
" He wears a ' C ' on that jersey for a lot of different reasons , but none more important than how much respect everybody in that clubhouse , including players , coaches , upper management , has for him , " Beckett said .
The Red Sox , trying to become the first repeat champions since the 1998 - 00 Yankees , were jubilant .
" We 'll take runs any way we can get it , " Francona said .
" But the way it happened , and as hard as he 's worked , it meant a lot to everybody . "
David Ortiz added an RBI single off J.P. Howell to pad the lead .
Boston bounced back from a 3 - 1 ALCS deficit in 1986 against the Angels , then in 2004 became the first major league team to win a postseason series when trailing 3 - 0 , beating the Yankees for the pennant before sweeping St. Louis in the World Series .
Then came last year 's comeback .
It was a strange night in different ways .
The first 20 minutes of the game were n't shown on television because TBS had an equipment failure .
And plate umpire Derryl Cousins left with a bruised collarbone after three innings , causing a 15 - minute delay .
Cousins was struck by a foul ball hit by Varitek in the second , but remained in the game until the delay .
He was replaced by crew chief Tim McClelland , who had been working first base .
" The delay did n't really bug me that much .
I had just come out , " Beckett said .
" I think James Shields probably had the worst end of that deal . "
Upton , who only hit nine homers in 531 regular - season at - bats , homered in the first inning off Beckett , driving the ball off one of the catwalks at Tropicana Field .
He tied Troy Glaus ( 2002 ) with his seventh homer in a single postseason , one behind record - holders Barry Bonds ( 2002 ) and Carlos Beltran ( 2004 ) .
Right after that , the television broadcast began .
Youkilis led off the second inning with his drive into the left center - field seats off Shield , then gave the Red Sox a 2 - 1 lead in the third when he grounded out after Dustin Pedroia walked and raced to third on Ortiz 's double down the right - field line .
Bartlett 's homer tied it in the fifth .
Okajima pitched two scoreless innings , and Masterson got out of a potential tight situation in the eighth .
He hit Bartlett with a pitch leading off and went to a 2 - 0 count on Akinori Iwamura when pitching coach John Farrell visited the mound .
Papelbon struck out Iwamura , got two straight outs , and then Papelbon pitched a 1 - 2 - 3 ninth , extending his major league - record career postseason scoreless streak to 25 innings over 16 appearances .
" The important thing is we found a way to win this game , " Varitek said .
" It was a big win for us . "
Game notes
Youkilis has hit safely in 12 of 13 career ALCS games .
...
Upton has seven homers in 42 postseason at - bats after hitting nine in 531 at - bats during the regular season .
...
Bartlett hit one homer during the regular season .
...
Papelbon earned his third save of this postseason .
Another Monday ( sigh ) .

Analysis Home Secretary Jacqui Smith is n't known in these pages for the clarity of her pronouncements on technology .
And yesterday , as she confirmed the government 's plan to proceed with the Interception Modernisation Programme ( IMP ) , she limited herself to the spin of building a universal communications surveillance apparatus .
The details of the accompanying Communications Data Bill will be opened to consultation in the new year , she said , with the aim of achieving consensus with " interested parties " .
Smith was keen to emphasise the content of every phone , internet and mobile communication will not be harvested , but the details of who contacts whom , when and where .
That distinction is likely be the cornerstone of attempts to sell IMP to MPs and a public wearied by the erosion of civil liberties and major government data losses .
Says who ?
Smith was clear that she wo n't take " no " for an answer .
" All this is a reflection of the technological and behavioural changes that the growth of the internet brings .
Once again , that is not a Government policy which is somehow optional .
It is a reality to which Government needs to respond , " she said .
The follow - up propaganda push has already begun today .
In The Times an unnamed source , clearly with a strong desire to see IMP built , spoonfed a dubious and old story about the threat posed by Skype and other VoIP applications to counter - terror operations .
The hungry Thunderer hacks swallowed the security services ' line that " internet phone calls are crippling fight against terrorism " .
No quotation marks in that headline , no opposing view in the story : it 's being crippled people - fact .
Then with impeccable deadpan delivery , we 're told in the penultimate paragraph that " The Times has learnt that police chiefs are to begin a discreet lobbying exercise in favour of the new powers " .
No , really ?
Such media glove - puppetry will intensify in the coming months .
People with knowledge of IMP developments in Whitehall and industry told The Register over summer that Jacqui and the security services do not speak for the whole of the government on the project .
One memorably said the intelligence services ' suggestion that IMP would seek to standardise all UK communications data and record details of every chat session had been described as " science fiction " by ISPs .
The Cabinet Office and Treasury are also known to have major reservations .
But why ?
The reasons why GCHQ and others have been able to persuade ministers that spending £ 12bn - the budget figure being floated in government - is a good idea despite fierce opposition IMP has and will face demand better illumination .
The project is best explained as two simultaneously parallel and intertwining strands which will allow snoopers to very quickly see who their targets communicate with , and - with a warrant - what they are saying :
The überdatabase A massive central silo for collecting , processing and cross reference details of emails sent , websites visited , calls made , mobile phone cell locations and more .
Probably administered at " the doughnut " , GCHQ 's iconic Cheltenham spy station .
This data wo n't be intercepted , but ISPs and telcos will provide it in real time from their own back end systems .
The " black boxes "
This network of wiretaps will put the " interception " into " Interception Modernisation Programme " , using the information in the central comunications data silo to target suspects ' traffic .
It 'll be hugely expensive to ensure the complete coverage spy chiefs want , but the plan is that any internet protocol ( IP ) communication will be available for interception .
It means calls , texts , gaming , chat and web browsing will all be laid bare to analysts .
Arrangements have long been in place with major telecoms and internet providers to access a lot of this type of data on a case - by - case basis .
It 's proved valuable as an investigative tool and as evidence in countless crimes ; 95 per cent of serious crimes since 2004 , the Home Secretary said yesterday .
It 's known that major communications firms have people on staff who are effectively employed by the intelligence services , ready to grab any data required .
The creators of the previously mentioned , versatile CD / DVD burning tool CDBurnerXP have posted a guide in their forums to using the program to create a live - booting Windows XP ( or 2000 / 2003 ) disc .
It 's a multi-step process that involves a lot of settings to tweak , but at the end you should have a Windows desktop that loads straight from the boot .
If you 're going to roll your own live - boot XP , you might want to get familiar with trimming it down to the bare essentials for faster loads , or slipstreaming your installation to avoid Windows Update nags that will , frankly , never go away .
I have n't given it a thorough test yet , but online forum users seem to give it the thumbs up .
Let us know your experience with live - booting XP in the comments .

In bug https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=460374
the reporter complained about how difficult it is to override bad cert errors in FF3 .
She complained because she was getting bad cert errors on EVERY https site she visited .
ALL the https sites she visited were apparently presenting self - signed certs .
The example for which she provided evidence was www.paypal.com.
By the time she filed the bug , she had already overridden the bad cert errors for all the major https sites that she visited with any frequency , including facebook , myspace , hotmail , her college 's network servers , and more .
In hacker speak , she was * owned * .
( Please discuss this here , not in that bug . )
Despite all the additional obstacles that FF3 put in her way , and all the warnings about " legitimate sites will never ask you to do this " , she persisted in overriding every error , and thus giving away most of her valuable passwords to her attacker .
None of this had triggered any suspicion in the victim .
She was merely upset that the browser made it so difficult for her to get to the sites she wanted to visit .
She was complaining about the browser .
FF3 had utterly failed to convey to her any understanding that she was under attack .
The mere fact that the browser provided a way to override the error was enough to convince her that the errors were not serious .
I submit that the user received no real protection whatsoever from FF3 in this case .
KCM would not have helped .
If anything , it would have reduced the pain of overriding those errors to the point where the victim would never have cried for help , and never would have learned of the attack to which she was a victim .
The question is : how can FF3 +
* effectively * protect users like her from MITM attackers better than FF3 has already done ?
Is removal of the ability to override bad certs the ONLY effective protection for such users ?
The evolution of that UI is under discussion in bug https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=431826

" Michael de Mare 's , Confessions of a Recovering Preppie , has been sitting on my desk a long time , for good reason .
They say you can't always judge a book by it's cover but in this case , the unintentionally embarrassing front is perfect .
Confessions is a painfully ordinary collection of college stories .
Michael seems to have a different definition for the word preppie than the good people at Webster or I do .
Even though the author specializes in cryptography , he seems unable to decipher any social situation , himself or the code to writing a book worth reading .
Click below to see how confusing it gets .
Confessions of a Recovering Preppie author Michael de Mare pages 304 publisher BookSurge Publishing rating 0/10 reviewer Samzenpus ISBN 1419663275 summary Stuff happens in college but not to the author An anonymous reader writes
Michael de Mare is to literature what Jeffery Dahmer is to fine dining .
At least someone finally stopped Dahmer .
To complain about any one part of this Titanic failure is like complaining that you do n't like the tilt of your room , as the ship sinks beneath the waves .
The back of the book promises , " In this compelling book , he lays bare the instructive stories of romantic adventures , intense studies , fascinating friend - ships , highly ambitious goals , and the wit and wisdom that can only come from the mind of those who are capable of fathoming the black arts of advanced cryptography and computer science . "
What we get is a book that has no theme to speak of .
It reads like a logbook more than a novel .
I have managed to group Confessions into three parts .
Each part consists of the few common ideas that reappear many times in the book .
It also includes the scant instances when Michael has an idea or something noteworthy happens .
The first part lets us in on a few basic facts about Michael and his day to day activities .
He hates rap .
Indian students cheat .
Walking makes Michael 's legs hurt .
He is scared of his stoner suite mate .
CS students are the smartest students on campus .
Michael is the smartest among them .
He likes Chicken Parmesan , Bill O'Reilly , and shopping at Walmart .
In this section Michael becomes aware that his friend likes to drink at parties until he is drunk .
He informs us that this is called binge drinking and worries that it might affect his friend 's grades .
( His friend 's grades are slightly better than his in the end . )
Then he discovers that college kids pirate music .
One of my favorite parts of the book can be found here .
Michael tells a story about his second cousin who tried to get him seriously hurt on two separate occasions .
The first time , Michael was tricked into riding an unbroken horse .
The second , was an incident which involved milking an extremely unfriendly cow .
This story allows the reader to understand that the feelings of dread and the overwhelming desire to make Michael de Mare stop are a perfectly normal reaction .
It is a feeling that is shared by his family and most likely , anyone who talks to him .
Just when you are wondering what purpose the 300 pages of Confessions serve , the author takes a trip to Montreal .
When a customs official is making her way through the train , asking if anyone has anything to declare , we find out the FBI is following Michael .
Two FBI agents tell the official loudly that they have guns and that they are following Michael because he works for the NSA .
At no point prior was the NSA mentioned and it is never addressed again .
I re-read this part several times to make sure that it was n't a dream sequence or a jump to future events .
At this point , I was sure that this book was the best way Michael had of telling his friends and family that he was or planned on being , a spy .
Part two follows a common pattern .
Michael hates rap .
Indian students cheat .
Walking makes Michael 's legs hurt .
He is scared of his stoner suite mate .
CS students are the smartest students on campus .
Michael is the smartest among them .
He likes Chicken Parmesan , Bill O'Reilly , and shopping at Walmart .
He learns that men , in particular , college - aged men , are easily manipulated by pretty girls .
He does n't see his stoner suite mate for a couple days so he reports him missing .
( The stoner was visiting home . )
This section contains what is easily my favorite part of the book .
It also demonstrates how hard it is to read Confessions .
Here , Michael is talking to a girl he may have some interest in but is so uncomfortable around , that you 're not quite sure .
" Hi Shawna !
How are you doing ? "
" My circumstances are not good . "
" Your circumstances ? "
" Yes .
They are not good . "
Now I was concerned about Shawna 's circumstances .
They were , as Shawna had pointed out , not good .
I did n't know which circumstances she was referring to , but I was sure that they were circumstances that she considered important .
For this reason I hoped Shawna 's circumstances would improve . "
Then it dawned on me .
Michael de Mare specializes in cryptography .
This whole thing is an elaborate code !
The de Mare code !
If I could crack this book I could find out where the descendants of Jesus live and who the Illuminati would allow to win the Super Bowl next year .
Unfortunately the best anagram of Michael de Mare I could come up with was , A charm I 'd eel me .
So I tried writing down every other word , then every third .
I cut the pages into strips and wrapped them around sticks of different widths .
I made a baking soda solution and brushed it over the pages .
Finally I exposed it to a UV lamp and then heat from a light bulb .
Nothing I did seemed to reveal a new story that someone might want to read , so I continued with the last 100 pages .
The end of the book provides the usual .
Mike hates rap music .
Indian students cheat .
Walking makes Michael 's legs hurt .
He is scared of his stoner suite mate .
CS students are the smartest students on campus .
Michael is the smartest among them .
He likes Chicken Parmesan , Bill O'Reilly , and shopping at Walmart .
Michael does n't see his binge drinking friend for a few days and somehow resists the urge to report him missing to the police .
He explains how the world would have broke out into World War III if George Bush had n't been elected president .
He defends his thesis , graduates and is accepted into a PHD program .
The book then ends as quickly and as uninterestingly as it started .
I entertained the notion that this was actually a Walmart viral marketing campaign for a few moments .
" Walmart , we got everything Michael de Mare needs and most things that normal people need too . "
Probably not the message the suits in marketing would want to send .
Now I 'm convinced that Confessions of a Recovering Preppie is actually part of Michael 's work at the NSA .
This book is part of an " enhanced interrogation " program .
Right now a man in a nicely pressed suit and sunglasses is reading Mr. de Mare 's device of unusual punishment , for the second time , to a prisoner who begs to just be water - boarded like usual .
Confessions of a Recovering Preppie is not the bottom of the barrel it is in a hole five feet below the barrel .
The Federal Reserve Board said Wednesday that it would provide up to $ 37.8 billion to the embattled insurer the American International Group to help it deal with a rapidly dwindling supply of cash .
The additional assistance is on top of $ 85 billion in a bridge loan that the Federal Reserve extended to A.I.G. in September , but it will take a different form .
A spokesman for A.I.G. , Nicholas Ashooh , said the new assistance was intended to keep the company from having to draw down the Fed loan so quickly .
The Fed threw A.I.G. the $ 85 billion lifeline shortly after the collapse of Lehman Brothers , when the financial markets were reeling and there were doubts the system could weather the demise of another big financial services company .
At the time , the Fed ’s loan was the most radical intervention ever by the central bank in a company ’s affairs .
Even as A.I.G. now works through a major overhaul , the rest of the insurance industry is still struggling with the continuing turmoil in the financial markets .
Shares of MetLife , the nation ’s largest life insurer , fell 27 percent on Wednesday to close at $ 27 a share after the company said its third - quarter earnings would be down significantly from a year ago and that it had to raise new capital .
Thousands of Christians have taken shelter in refugee camps A mob has attacked a police station in Kandhamal district in the eastern state of Orissa , killing a policeman and taking several others hostage .
The attack took place in Gochhapada , some 30 km ( 20 miles ) from the district headquarters Phulbani , late on Monday .
The attack appears to be in retaliation for police opening fire on Saturday on Hindu protesters .
At least four people died and a dozen were injured .
Orissa has seen anti-Christian violence for several weeks now .
At least 20 people - most of them Christians - were killed after a Hindu religious leader was shot dead .
Meanwhile , fresh violence has also been reported from the coastal city of Mangalore in the southern state of Karnataka , where a Hindu group called for a shutdown on Tuesday .
Police have detained 173 people in the city in connection with three days of clashes triggered by attacks on churches over the weekend .
Taken hostage
In Orissa , a mob of about 500 people attacked the police station in Gochhapada and then set fire to it , senior police official RP Koche told the BBC .
" A policeman was killed in the firing while some other policemen are missing , " he said .
Mr Koche said an unconfirmed number of policemen are believed to have been taken hostage by the mob .
Orissa has seen rising tension between Christians and Hindus Reinforcements have been sent to the area but their arrival was delayed as the approach road to the village was blocked with huge logs put up by the protesters .
Although officials are not saying who could be behind the attack , it is being seen as retaliation for police opening fire on Saturday in the village of Kurtamgarh , where a Hindu mob went on the rampage burning houses and prayer halls .
When security forces tried to disperse the crowd , somebody from the crowd shot and injured a policeman , the police said .
Police say they were forced to open fire .
Trouble began last month after Swami Laxmanananda Saraswati was shot along with four others in an attack in Kandhamal district .
Although a senior Maoist rebel leader claimed responsibility for the killing , Hindu groups blamed Christians for the death .
Subsequently , Hindu mobs went on a rampage , attacking and vandalising churches and Christian institutions .
' Disgrace ' Thousands of Christians fled their homes to take shelter in refugee camps .
Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh described the violence in Orissa as a " national disgrace " .
Meanwhile , in the southern state of Karnataka , four buses were damaged and two people were stabbed in fresh violence on Tuesday .
In two places , police used batons to disperse mobs supporting the strike called by Hindu hard - line group Sri Rama Sena .
At least 16 churches were ransacked and clergymen were attacked in Karnataka by alleged activists of the radical Hindu group Bajrang Dal over the weekend .
Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa has said police will deal sternly with those groups disrupting peace in the region .
Hindu groups have long accused Christian priests of bribing poor tribes and low - caste Hindus to change their faith .
Christians say lower - caste Hindus convert willingly to escape the Hindu caste system .

After the wife of a Malaysian Muslin failed to find her husband a new younger wife , the man assaulted her and said he would shoot her .
Mohamad Haris Daud , who works as a local police chief in Kuantan , which is the state capital of Pahang , the biggest state in Malaysia , said that the 57 - year - old man forced his wife , aged 60 , to persuade a woman in her 30s to be his second wife , NEWS.com .au reports .
The police officer said that when the frightened wife found the woman , she discovered that she was already married .
" After she told her husband that the woman was married , he ran amok and started beating her and threatened to cut her with a machete ' ' , Malay - language " Utusan Malaysia " newspaper quoted local police chief as saying .
After the man 's wife was unsuccessful with finding consent from another woman , he said he would kill her with a shotgun .
It is worth mentioning that Chief Mohamad is also a security guard and member of civil volunteer corps RELA .
The latter specializes on illegal immigrants .
In Malaysia , Muslim men have the right to have up to five wives .
However , activists and women 's groups highly criticize polygamy , saying that it is cruel and that polygamy has deviated from its initial purpose in Islam , i.e. to defend widows and orphans .
Sixty percent of Malaysians ( from a population of 27 million people ) are Muslims , and Islam is the country 's official religion .
It is illegal for a non-Muslim to have more than one wife .
Currently Malaysian police is investigating the case , having the angry husband detained .

After receiving endless flak for their silly tiered Vista Compatibility scheme , Microsoft has decided to issue a single " Windows 7 Capable " sticker for hardware that works with the new OS .
That means no more " Windows Home Basic " , " Windows Ready " , " Certified for Windows " and " Windows Ready When You Are , Asshole " labels slapped on every piece of hardware in the computer aisle at Best Buy .
During the same conference in which this was announced , Microsoft demonstrated Windows 7 on a modestly spec'd Eee netbook , so it looks like Windows 7 compatibility might be taken for granted with most new PCs .
Microsoft did tell the Register that there would be different stickers for touchscreen and media center devices .
While the touchscreen sticker will be a convenient indicator that a device is touch - capable , what will media center sticker mean ?
That a computer has an HDMI output ?
That marketing asked for it ?
Also , one=three , apparently .

WASHINGTON , Oct. 18 ( UPI ) -- Former U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell is widely expected Sunday to denounce the personal attacks against Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama .
Powell , a Republican and friend of Republican presidential nominee John McCain , is appearing Sunday morning on NBC's " Meet the Press " program .
His appearance has sparked rumors the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is going to endorse Obama , over his longtime friend McCain .

The Daily Telegraph reported Saturday that Col. Lawrence Wilkerson , Powell 's former chief of staff , said his ex-boss was " upset " by the " vitriol , bile and prejudice " aimed at Obama on the campaign trail .
" We 've talked about this and I know it really bothers him and I 'd expect him to talk about it , " he said .
Wilkerson said Powell would likely make an endorsement now that the third and final presidential debate behind the candidates .
" He likes to make his decisions at the 60 percent point in terms of information and timing .
Most people make a decision too quickly or too late , on the basis of too little information or having waited for all the information they are a day late and a dollar short , " he said .

Battleground Montana
A Republican National Committee consultant confirms that the RNC is buying television ads in Montana , which has n't backed a Democratic presidential nominee since Bill Clinton in 1992 .
The ads go up Wednesday , the consultant to the RNC 's independent arm , Brad Todd , said .
Obama 's campaign has been active in the state , however , and recent public polls have given the Democrat reasons for hope :
Most are in the single digits , and the most recent has Obama ahead .
The state also has real Democratic infrastructure :
The governor and both senators are Democrats .
The RNC 's move reflects a map that 's as broad as the Obama campaign could have dreamed , and that 's forcing the Republicans to spread their limited resources thinner and thinner .
CORRECTION : I initially overstated how long it 's been since Montana went blue .

CHARLOTTE , North Carolina ( Reuters ) -
The grandmother who helped raise Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Barack Obama and whom he had credited with shaping his values has died of cancer , he said in a statement on Monday .
Democratic presidential candidate Senator Barack Obama is seen posing with his maternal grandparents Stanley and Madelyn Dunham in an undated family snapshot released by his presidential campaign , February 4 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Obama For America / Handout
The news came on the day before the presidential election and a little more than a week after Obama interrupted his White House campaign to say goodbye to her in Hawaii .
Madelyn Dunham , 86 , died peacefully at her home in Honolulu .
“ She was the cornerstone of our family , and a woman of extraordinary accomplishment , strength and humility , ” Obama and his sister , Maya Soetoro - Ng , said in a statement .
“ She was the person who encouraged and allowed us to take chances . ”
Dunham helped raise Obama from the age of 10 while his mother was working in Indonesia , and Obama took an emotional 22 - hour trip to visit her on October 23 and 24 .
He said afterward his grandmother had been flooded with cards , flowers and well - wishes from around the country , and he regularly thanked crowds at his campaign rallies for their prayers .
“ Our family wants to thank all of those who sent flowers , cards , well - wishes and prayers during this difficult time , ” the statement said .

“ It brought our grandmother and us great comfort .
Our grandmother was a private woman , and we will respect her wish for a small private ceremony to be held at a later date , ” the statement said .
Dunham had followed Obama ’s presidential bid with great interest , and her death comes one day before U.S. voters will render their verdict in the race between Obama and Republican John McCain .
McCain and his wife , Cindy , issued a statement of condolence .
“ Our thoughts and prayers go out to them as they remember and celebrate the life of someone who had such a profound impact in their lives , ” the McCains said .
Obama affectionately called his grandmother “ Toot ” -- short for “ tutu , ” the Hawaiian word for grandmother .
He spoke of her often on the campaign trail , mentioning that she worked in a bomber assembly plant during World War Two .
Later , she worked as a secretary in a bank and was eventually promoted to vice president .
She helped put Obama through private school in Hawaii and Obama has often credited her with instilling in him the Midwestern pragmatism she acquired as a Kansas native .
Dunham had recently broken her hip but the campaign had refused to comment on reports she was suffering from cancer .
Obama received the news of his grandmother ’s death as he took a final campaign swing through Florida and North Carolina .
Stopping at one of his campaign ’s volunteer offices in Charlotte , Obama seemed more downbeat than usual but he made some calls encouraging voters to get to the polls .
One supporter at the office broke down in tears at her surprise at seeing him there and he gave her a warm hug but did not mention the news about his grandmother .
Can falling oil and gasoline prices be bad news ?
They can be for refiners �and that could come back to bite American drivers just as gas prices are coming back to earth .
Sticker shock ( AP ) Oil prices have fallen so far , so fast that turning crude oil into gasoline is now a money - losing business .
A barrel of refined gasoline is worth $ 2.84 less than a barrel of oil , Reuters reports ; earlier this year , gasoline fetched a hefty premium of more than $ 30 a barrel .

Master Prankster Rob Cockerham and his friends around the country recently added some extra signage to the sheds on display in their local Home Depot parking lots .
Rob explains :
Home Depot , forced to lure customers inside without glitzy display windows , seed the warehouse perimeter with their products .
This is only practical with hard - to - shoplift items , such as bags of steer manure and storage sheds .
Unfortunately , these sun-baked displays are all but abandoned by the sales staff , and must rely on graphics and signage to speak to their potential customers .
Despite an ambitious number of signs , I felt my local home depot was n’t addressing some of the strongest benefits of owning a garden / storage / privacy shed / mini - garage / closet .
I decided to make some new signs and try them out !
With nine eager volunteers poised to help , I sent signs to try out across the country .
The Pentagon ’s all - too - lifelike four - legged robot may be about to get a whole lot bigger , stronger , smarter and tougher to slow down .
Already , the BigDog quadruped machine can carry more than 300 pounds , walk around for nearly 13 miles on flat ground and keep its balance after getting kicked around .
In other words , it ’s a pretty decent prototype for a machine that could help carry soldiers ’ gear when they ’re out on a mission .
Now Darpa wants an upgraded bot that can lug 400 pounds on its back , trot for 20 miles in any terrain , and carry enough gas for an entire day ’s operation .
The agency is calling it a generic " Legged Squad Support System , " or L3 .
But it ’s pretty obvious that the machine Darpa has in mind is " BigDog on steroids , " as one knowledgeable observer puts it .
And unlike the typical Darpa project , this upgrade should n’t be too hard to pull off , our observer says .
But there will definitely be challenges .
Throw in the added carrying capacity and the extra weight of gas , and the L3 is supposed to bulk up to 1250 pounds .
All the extra weight will make it harder for the bot to get up , once it trips .
Darpa also wants the machine to run quietly .
Right now , the BigDog is one loud ol ’ beast .
The machine will have to be able to sprint at a 10 mile - per - hour pace in 120 - degree heat , climb stairs , slosh through water and squat on standby in the rain or snow for most of the day .
The agency is looking for a smarter quadruped , too .
No more joystick controls , Darpa says .
The L3 should be able to follow a soldier around , navigate by GPS waypoints and respond to speech or gesture commands .
Using laser sensors , the current BigDog did follow a human around for a 10 - mile walk .
But the path was basically clear .
The new model will have to pick its way through all kinds of obstacles .

New material with nanodots could improve gas mileage
( Nanowerk News )
With gasoline at high prices , it 's disheartening to know that up to three - quarters of the potential energy you are paying for is wasted .
A good deal of it goes right out the tailpipe instead of powering your car .
Now a Northwestern University - led research team has identified a promising new material that could transform a technology that currently cools and heats car seats -- thermoelectrics -- into one that also efficiently converts waste heat into electricity to help power the car and improve gas mileage .
The researchers discovered that adding two metals , antimony and lead , to the well - known semiconductor lead - telluride , produces a thermoelectric material that is more efficient at high temperatures than existing materials .
The results are published online in the journal Angewandte Chemie ( " Large Enhancements in the Thermoelectric Power Factor of Bulk PbTe at High Temperature by Synergistic Nanostructuring " ) .
" We cannot explain this 100 percent , but it gives us a new mechanism -- and probably new science -- to focus on as we try to raise the efficiency of thermoelectrics , " said Mercouri G. Kanatzidis , Charles E. and Emma H. Morrison Professor of Chemistry in the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences and the paper 's senior author .
Current thermoelectric technology is only used in niche markets , such as solid - state refrigeration and cooling , because the materials are not very efficient .
With new materials and increased efficiency , devices based on thermoelectrics could find widespread use in the automotive industry , solar energy conversion and the conversion of waste heat from nuclear reactors , smokestacks and industrial equipment .
" It 's a big accomplishment to recover some of the heat or energy that would otherwise be lost and convert it into useful energy , " said Kanatzidis .
" That 's what thermoelectrics can do , but we need to make them more efficient to really be practical . "
Thermoelectric materials are only 5 to 6 percent efficient today , but a new generation of materials based on recent discoveries including this one at Northwestern , could produce devices with 11 to 14 percent efficiency , says Kanatzidis .
The long - term goal is to reach 20 percent .
Thermoelectric materials convert heat into electricity by taking advantage of temperature differences .
Electrons move from the hot end of the material to the cold end , creating positive and negative electrodes and an electrical voltage .
A thermoelectric device , for example , could be attached to a car 's tailpipe .
The side of the material in contact with the tailpipe would be the hot side , and the side exposed to the air would be the cold side .
The temperature difference would be enough to generate electricity , which would be returned to the car 's engine for additional torque .
Such devices also could be used in large industrial plants , such as those for power , chemical production and glass making .
Car companies are working on the thermoelectrics problem as part of their strategy to raise the overall gas mileage of vehicles , says Kanatzidis .
They hope to raise mileage by 5 to 10 percent per gallon using thermoelectrics , which would be significant .
A superior thermoelectric material needs to have these properties to work : high electrical conductivity ( to transfer a lot of power ) , low thermal conductivity ( to maintain the temperature difference and prevent equilibrium ) and the ability to generate a large voltage for as small a temperature difference as possible .
A material with all three properties is difficult to find , but Kanatzidis and his team found it -- in an unexpected way .
Four years ago , Kanatzidis and his research group discovered a class of materials based on lead - telluride that doubled the efficiency performance of existing materials .
They were able to lower the thermal conductivity without changing its electrical properties by putting nanodots -- small particles of silver - antimony - telluride between two and 10 nanometers in diameter -- inside the lead - telluride .
For the new work reported in Angewandte Chemie , Kanatzidis and graduate student Joseph Sootsman decided to add two different materials -- the metals lead and alimony , also in the form of nanodots -- to lead - telluride to see if they could lower the thermal conductivity even more .
They were surprised when they saw the results .
" The thermal conductivity was not any lower than our earlier results , but we discovered a net gain in electrical conductivity at high temperatures that we did n't expect , " said Kanatzidis .
" This means we had a net gain in power coming out of the material that we did n't have before .
This was very surprising . "
Interestingly , the researchers also discovered that adding lead or antimony alone to the lead - telluride did not produce an improvement .
Lead and antimony both had to be present in the lead - telluride to produce the electrical conductivity gain .
The electrons scatter less and move faster with the two inclusions than with just one or none .
Al - Jazeera : Palin supporters fear ' blacks will take over ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday October 16 , 2008
Print This Email This Supporters of Sarah Palin attending a rally in St. Clairsville , OH on Sunday were not shy about displaying their racist attitudes and their ignorance about Barack Obama -- along with their very real fears and insecurities -- to al - Jazeera reporter Casey Kauffman .
One white - haired old lady said frankly to Kauffman , " I 'm afraid if he wins , the blacks will take over . "
She then added more shrilly , " He 's not a Christian !
This is a Christian nation !
What is our country going to end up like ? "
Another woman stated , " Obama and his wife , I 'm concerned that they could be anti-white , that he might hide that . "
A third suggested , " I do n't like the fact that he thinks us white people are trash -- because we 're not . "
A young man holding a baby told Kauffman , " He seems like a sheep -- or a wolf in sheep 's clothing -- to be honest with you .
And I believe , Palin , she 's filled with the holy spirit . "
St. Clairsville lies just a dozen miles west of Wheeling , WV , in largely - white southeastern Ohio , which was a Bush stronghold in 2000 and 2004 .
One Daily Kos diarist who commented on the video wrote , " I am originally from a small town 30 miles away from St Clairsville , and seeing this clip reminds me of what it was like to live there .
St Clairsville is actually sort of a metropolis in this rust belt region .
To many farmers , steelworkers , and coal miners who live in the surrounding countryside , it 's known for being ' where the WalMart is . ' "
A few days earlier , a blogger had interviewed audience members at a McCain - Palin rally in Strongsville , OH , in the northern part of the state , and reported that " this is the most strange , ignorant , uninformed , angry , up - to - no - good , and gullible group of people Ive ever seen at a political rally . "
Although ABC News described Palin as having toned down her rhetoric a notch on Sunday , the Kos diarist quoted her as telling the crowd , " We know who the bad guys are , OK ?
We know that in the war , its terrorists , terrorists who hate America and her allies and would seek to destroy us , and the bad guys are those who would support and sympathize with the terrorists . "
Palin 's supporters clearly took those remarks as refering to Obama , with several of them saying to Kauffman , " He 's related to a known terrorist " or " He 's friends with a terrorist of this country " or " He must support terrorists . "
However , not all St. Clairsville residents are Republicans , and another Kos diarist , who reported on a well - received Joe Biden rally in the same town two days later , made it clear that " Ohio and WV Democrats do n't like Sarah Palin at all .
Much of the conversation before the rally was about her .
And you might be surprised to know that a lot of people that you might not think are internet savvy are hip to Palin 's ties to the AIP and are horrified by it . "
The al - Jazeera crew interviewed one St. Clairsville Obama supporter who , they report , has been " shocked at the names he 's been called by his own neighbors . "
" I 've been called the n- word , " this man stated .
" I 've been called a Muslim , I 've been called a un-American . "
He went on to say , " The tension 's getting thicker and thicker .
People like that , it 's starting to scare me .
... I 'm afraid some of these people might try to hurt Obama . "

The decline may be a precursor for high - end properties in Australia 's cities , which have so far resisted the real - estate slumps suffered in the US and U.K. , said Rod Cornish , head of property research at Macquarie Group Ltd .
'' The first thing they try to do is sell their beach house , '' Cornish said .
'' If they can't sell that , then they may have to sell their residence .
That will be an ongoing factor next year . ''
The slide in beach - house prices snaps a 15 - year bull market for the properties as investors and entrepreneurs , made wealthy by 17 years of economic growth and a boom in mining , bought weekend homes .
Compared with the drop in Palm Beach , prices across the nation 's eight state capital cities climbed 2.8 % in the September quarter from a year ago , according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics .
'' Weekender homes are seen as surplus to needs , so people are getting rid of them , '' said King , who has more than 40 properties on his books , double the normal amount , starting at $ 1 million and going up to $ 7 million .
He said he 's never seen so many high - end properties for sale in the area .
Ayliffe 's agent , David Edwards at LJ Hooker Palm Beach , said he 's got about 40 properties on his books awaiting sale , up from 25 to 30 usually .
About five of those are from vendors who need to sell as soon as they can to cover investment losses .
Prices across 20 US cities tumbled 17.4 % in September , the fastest decline on record , the S&P / Case - Shiller home - price index showed on Nov. 25 .
UK house prices had the biggest annual drop since at least 1991 in October , Nationwide Building Society said last month , as the average cost of a home plunged 14.6 % from a year earlier .
' The first thing they try to do is sell their beach house '
Australia 's business confidence has slumped to the lowest level in a generation and margin calls on equity loans jumped to a five - year high in the third quarter as the benchmark S&P / ASX 200 Index tumbled 48 % since its Nov. 1 record last year .
'' High - end household wealth destruction in Australia is far greater than currently believed , '' Charlie Aitken , head of institutional dealing at Southern Cross Equities in Sydney , wrote last month in a note on the ``great beach house sale '' to clients .
'' The vast bulk of lifestyle properties are n't selling and the answer will need to be a slashing of price . ''
John Edwards , chief executive officer at Residex , a property researcher that supplies data to the Reserve Bank of Australia , said he expects beach house prices to fall further in places like Palm Beach and Noosa in Queensland .
'' In a declining stock market , properties that are discretionary and there 's a need to sell , they are going to suffer , '' he said .
'' There are further falls to occur .
You have about a four - month lag to what 's going on in the stock market . ''
Australian shares slumped the most since the October 1987 crash last month and the S&P / ASX 200 has lost another 12 % this month .
Last week it traded at a five - year low .
The decline may be an opportunity for overseas buyers and expatriates working in countries such as Japan because of a slump in the Australian dollar , Edwards said .
Australia 's currency has fallen 40 % against the yen and 33 % against the Hong Kong dollar in the past four months .
Ray White 's King said enquiries from Australian expatriates , particularly in Hong Kong and Singapore , have increased , but few have led to purchases yet .
That has n't halted an increase in the number of late payments on loans for seafront properties .
Beachside suburbs are among the worst - performing in the nation , measured by value of loans in arrears , according to a Nov. 25 report from Fitch Ratings .
Helensvale , an area on the Gold Coast southeast of Brisbane , Queensland , is the nation 's worst , with 7.8 % of loans by value outstanding having missed one or more payments as of Sept. 30 .
Others in the top 10 are Nelson Bay and the riverside suburb of Raymond Terrace , both in New South Wales .
Loading '' Everything got overvalued , '' said Ayliffe , seller of 3 Norma Road in Palm Beach .
'' Our house is only worth what someone will pay for it .
You have to be realistic . ''

In a study I dub “ Are you powerful or not ? ” I ’d be in a third category .
Why ?
Because I felt insulted when instructed to do what researchers asked of students .
At Northwestern and Stanford , no less .
Here ’sTwo professors , Adam Galinsky , Professor of Ethics &Decision Management , Northwestern University and Joe Magee , Joe Magee of the Wagner Graduate School of Public Service at NYU , divided undergrads into two groups .
One group was primed to feel powerful .
They were asked to write about a situation in which they had authority over another individual .
The members of the second group were set up to feel subordinate .
They were asked to write about a situation in which they had little power .
All participants were then asked to act quickly .
Using their dominant hand they were to : , then This is the part I resisted .
( Must be an authority thing . )
They were told that the “ E ” would be washed off after the experiment .
( Further down you ’ll read about what happened when some presumably powerful people at a fancy gathering were asked to do something similar . )
Here ’s what researchers wanted to watch .
There are two ways to draw the “ E ” .
One is to draw the prongs of the letter so that the person drawing it can read it .
The researchers believe people who write it this way are “ self - oriented . ”
Conversely , if you wrote the “ E ” the other way , with the prongs pointing in the opposite direction you must be “ other - oriented . ”
You are helping others to read the “ E ” you scrawled on your forehead .
The researchers discovered that the group primed to feel powerful was “ almost three times as likely as the low - power group to draw an “ E ” that would be illegible to anyone but them .
” Their key research conclusion :
The more power a person has , the less capacity he has to take another person ’s perspective .
In fact , Magee found that as some people secure more power they become “ disinhibited . ”
That may have been what happened to Eliot Spitzer and Bill Clinton , for instance .
I must confess that I was a participant when this study was conducted again later .
Unfortunately , there ’s another sign of my being in a third , perhaps deviant category .
After I was finally persuaded to write that “ E ” the researchers were discomforted to find that no one – not even me - could read my “ writing . ”
One other participant drew a letter that no one could identify .
He ’s a self - described “ extreme introvert .
” Later I learned of two other resisters .
Kristen Wiig and Amy Poehler from “ Saturday Night Live ” were the only ones who refused to participate when this experiment was conducted by a persuasive “ amateur ” , the New Yorker ’s Lauren Collins .
She went to the Time 100 banquet , held at Lincoln Center celebrating “ the most influential people in the world . ”
In the middle of this social gathering they “ just ” had to mark a yellow Post - it and put it on their forehead .
Guess which one of these three wrote the powerful “ E ” : the gossip columnist , Liz Smith ; former Deputy Secretary of Defense and deposed World Bank president , Paul Wolfowitz or chief executive of Goldman Sachs , Lloyd Blankfein ?
Now if you do NOT want to build unity at your conference or other group meeting , try this .
Tout the “ E ” experiment as a team - building exercise .
Afterwards , point out the individuals in the group who appear powerful ( thus less thoughtful of others ) and those who do not .
Then ask them to talk about how they feel abut their label , relative to others .
That ’s a non - Me2We experience .
Who knows ?
Some of us women might feel guilty for being powerful yet not empathetic .
And some men might feel uncomfortable when placed in the less powerful category , even if they are also labeled as thoughtful of others .
Here ’s a more upbeat finding .
Do “ self - centered ” , ruthless people really rise in power ?
Not always .
Social and emotional intelligence can trump ruthless manipulation suggests Washington Post ’s Shankar Vedantam who points to The Power Paradox , research led by Dacher Keltner .
From the moral angle , Steven Pinker seems to agree .
Want to learn more by participating in a study ?
If this kind of research then become a participant in a study that , examines , “ how people view ideas such as altruism , heroism , and other helping behaviors ” led by Dr. Philip Zimbardo .
Simply fill out a survey that takes 15 - 30 minutes to complete .
LONDON : Licensing chiefs in Britain have banned all car registration numbers that resemble words associated with terrorism .
The authorities took this decision after spotting hundreds of potentially offensive plates , including one with the number O54MA that could be read as ' OSAMA ' .
There were also numbers plates like HO57AGE that resembled the word ' HOSTAGE ' , BU58OMB that could be read as ' BUS BOMB ' , MA56ACA appearing like ' MASSACRE ' , and HE58OLA that was quite near to ' HEZBOLLAH ' .
The DVLA has made it clear that anything including JEHAD or HAMAS will also be out .
Their blacklist also contains some numbers that the panel thought could prove to be provocative on religious grounds and spark racial hatred , including one reading MO56LEM that resembled ' MOSLEM ' .
Plates like BOO4ZYY , which may be read as ' BOOZY ' , has also been banned to discourage drink - driving .
" Every number is checked to ensure it does n't cause offence , " British tabloid The Sun quoted a spokesman for the Swansea - based DVLA as saying .
Lib Dem transport spokesman Norman Baker , who obtained the list under Freedom of Information laws , said : " Some combinations would be deeply offensive .
Baker added : " But it 's over the top to ban words about booze and sex .
It 's a bit nanny state . "
I guess everyone has their own reasons to donate blood .

A fearsome warrior engages in battle in the classic , medieval - quest RPG world of Fable II .

" Why do you want to play alone ? "
A friend of mine recently asked me this , during an argument about Fable II .
I 'd recently begun playing the game — a classic , medieval - quest RPG world — and had devoted hours to leveling my character into a fearsome , beloved warrior .
I 'd amassed Ninja Gaiden - esque skillz , learned flesh - singeing lightning spells and won sacks full of bling .
I 'd explored the far ranges of the amazingly detailed land , and the townsmen were bowing and scraping for my favor .
I had four different girlfriends .
But to my friend , this made no sense .
He 's a hard - core online gamer — a member of a long - running World of Warcraft guild — so single - player RPG worlds seem completely baffling to him .
Not to mention antisocial .
In Fable II , you 're the only " live " human around .
Sure , it 's crammed full of " non-player characters " — but they 're all ' bots , spouting fairly crude dialogue lines , with none of the unpredictability and spontaneity of a multiplayer game .
You have no friends with whom to share your feats , to brag to about your awesomeness , to marvel at the beautiful sights .
There are no epic , wargasmic , 50 - person raids that will be spoken of over mead , four generations hence , in a tavern .
So it 's a good question , really .
Why do we want to immerse ourselves in a world that emulates all the tropes of a vibrant world like World of Warcraft — but where we are , essentially , alone ?
I told my friend he was looking at it all wrong .
The reason we single - player fans love world - games like Fable II is precisely because there are no other " real " people around .
Because really , who needs people ?
People suck .
I 'm joking , of course — but only a bit .
The truth is that , in online multiplayer worlds , dealing with the delightfully unpredictable behavior of " real " people can be an absolute chore .
Teammates fail to show up for a raid , or they leave everyone waiting for an hour , or they log out in the middle of battle and leave you gored by a howling mob .
Have you ever actually tried to play Age of Conan ?
It 's like the Stanford Prison Experiment in there , my friend .
Indeed , the dirty secret of online multiplayer worlds like World of Warcaft is that the vast majority of people play solo in them .
As Nicholas Ducheneaut discovered , players who are piloting characters below level 40 spend a stunning 70 percent of their time questing alone .
That means that the vast majority of World of Warcraft players treat their other fellow humans like non-player characters — ' bots they glimpse wandering through the forest , but never talk to .
But I 'm being too negative here .
There is an upbeat side , too .
One benefit of being the only live person in a game is that the illusion of immersion is never broken .
The designers of Fable II have complete control over what everyone in the game does and says , so they can make sure nobody drops any l33t - spe@k or references to Barack Obama .
The world is all medieval , all the time .
More subtly yet , there 's a sort of weird , existential delight in being the only truly sentient human inside a huge world .
The fact that I know I 'm the only person actually alive makes the game seem all the more dreamlike , as if everything — those mountain ranges , those creepy beetles — really is taking place inside my head .
Sure , there 's a co-op mode for Fable II , so you could play with another person if you wanted to .
But I never bothered to try it out , because I preferred the solipsism of a world where I 'm the center .
Indeed , sometimes I wish there were even fewer characters inside Fable II — and even more isolation .
Some of my favorite moments were between battles , when I 'd roam through a desolate stretch of forest at night , looking at the shadows and ancient ruins .
Hell , I just enjoyed the peace and quiet !
I do n't get enough of that in my real life .
That 's why people loved Myst so much back in the day :
The game was completely deserted — not a single other person alive — so you were literally alone for hours with nothing but your meditative thoughts .
Maybe this could eventually become an entire category of entertainment :
You 're dropped into a huge , lush , gorgeous , sprawling world , and all you do is just sort of ... wander around .
We could even give it a name .
Radical singleplayer :
The game of solitude .

Who is this for ?
You ’ve been developing web applications using PHP for a couple months now and are finding it very enjoyable .
Although you feel that you ’re doing quite good , you ’re not sure whether its the end .
Besides , the following questions wonder you often :
Where to go from here
What new things to learn
How to become a Kick - ass PHP Ninja
If that ’s the scenario , then this post if for YOU .
Background
A few days back , I read a number of blog posts where people have highlighted the shortcomings they see in newbie developers .
Some of them have gone further to narrow down the focus on PHP developers only ( as PHP ’s nature sometimes allow developers to avoid standards ) .
They did a great job by listing the shortcomings , but their posts missed clear way forwards ( these can be inferred though ) .
A number of readers also commented on the posts with their insight as well .
So I was thinking how about compiling all these in an easy to follow list ?
Hence this post .
Btw , due to the volume , I ’ve mostly touched the points here and provided few useful resource links for further study .
I do have plan to elaborate a few of them in coming posts , with each point becoming a single post .
Let me know which ones you ’ll prefer most , by entering the poll at the bottom of the post .
Part A : Technical Way Forward
In the first part , let ’s shed some light on how you can move forward with your technical abilities .
1. Start using version control
Version control is like a big UNDO button for your coding .
You can go back to your previous code revisions and can compare / rollback to specific code areas anytime you see necessary .
It will keep track of all your changes and will empower you to track your development changes across your work / team .
Also , in a distributed development team , version control helps prevent overwriting of code by team members and keeps all the members code up to date .
Subversion ( SVN ) is one of the most popular open source version control system .
If you ’re on windows platform , you can try TortoiseSVN , a client for SVN .
2. Write code in OOP way
If you have n’t already , it ’s high time you started writing code in Object Oriented Programming ( OOP ) way .
You may ask why ?
Well , OOP forces you to write code that is maintainable in nature .
If properly followed , OOP code become a lot efficient than procedural code .
Also , it allows you to re-use code across your project and / or multiple projects .
If you ’re not convinced , have a look at these excellent resources for further study .
3 . Adhere to a coding standard
Coding standards allow you to write code in a way which is easily understood by other people .
When you adhere to a coding standard used by may others , you actually convey a message that you ’re serious in writing code that people will be able to “ get ” and maintain .
Keeping abbreviation type variable names , applying multiple indention types , writing meaningless function names etc will work for you in short term , maybe in personal projects .
But when you move to a larger group with a number of developers , you ought to follow a standard so that everybody working with you can get along with your parts .
The following standards are most widely used among PHP developers around the globe :
Although you can define a standard for your team / company , it ’s always better to have close relation with what the industry follows .
In my company , Right Brain Solution Ltd , we follow a slightly modified version of Zend Framework Coding Standards .
You can get that one here .
4. Document your code
Documentation is a virtue of great developers – do n’t get me wrong , I ’m talking about code documentation , not writing user manuals 🙂
Well documented code prevents other team members from reading each line of your code and understand them by heart .
Rather , it tells them exactly what they need to know – purpose of the code , what it requires as input , what it will deliver as output , etc .
If you take a look at the above mentioned coding standards , you ’ll discover that most of them even specified standard for documentation as well , which is phpDocumentor .
It ’s the most used standard for PHP code documentation and is widely recognized .
5 . Use a good framework
Frameworks give you good structure and helps you build web applications in a fast way , with confidence .
Most of today ’s popular PHP frameworks ( Zend Framework , CodeIgniter , CakePHP , Symfony , Kohana etc ) follow the Model - View - Controller ( MVC ) pattern , which itself is a strong advocate of good practice .
Besides structure , frameworks force you to write code in a structured way .
Some of them will also require writing the code in OOP – whose benefit we already discussed above .
And frameworks usually come with a number of helpful libraries and helpers , to make your life easy as a web developer .
Josh sharp discusses this in details here and later posts a follow - up here .
Both are good reads .
6. Re-use code / libraries
One of the most common advice programmers get is : “ Do n’t re-invent the wheel ” .
Well , what ’s the point here ?
It actually means that you should not spend much time on solving a problem that has already been solved , in efficient way , by others .
Rather solving it out yourself , you can “ google ” it and see how others have done it .
It will not only save your valuable time , but also will ensure stable code ( assuming that people usually post things on web after doing a number of testing and user of the codes usually help iron - out any issues , etc ) .
However , keep an eye on your target use / objective .
If there is not enough good solutions that solves your problem , go ahead and solve yourself .
Make it good and give it back to the community so that others facing that problem wo n’t need to spent the time you ’ve spent .
The whole open source model runs on this give - give way , so be a part of it .
7 . Test your code the right way
In order to make confidence out of your code , you ’ll need to test your code the right way .
Although you might be used to testing your application using debug messages and browser refreshes , in a real world scenario these wo n’t work .
You ’ll need to write unit tests which can do automated testing of your code .
The power lies in that you can run these tests almost anytime and can check if anything is broken after each new change .
PHPUnit and SimpleTest are the two most widely used Unit testing suite for PHP .
You should also have a look on Test Driven Development ( TDD ) , which is the way of greatly enhancing your chance of deploying application with least bugs .
Part B : Personal Way Forward
Now , even if you ’ve improved yourself on the above mentioned points , you ’ll still need to work on your personal matters to move forward .
Here goes those points .
8. Be Agile
You need to be an agile developer if you want to move forward in your career .
What does it mean to be agile ?
Agility is more of an attitude than a skill set .
The common characteristics of agile developers are :
They ’re open minded and therefore willing to learn new techniques
They ’re responsible and therefore willing to seek the help of the right person(s ) for the task at hand
They ’re willing to work closely with others , pair programming or working in small teams as appropriate
They ’re willing to work iteratively and incrementally
Further resources : Agile Software Development , The Agile Manifesto .
9 . Keep yourself updated
No matter what , keep yourself updated on whats going on in your field ( in this case PHP ) .
Subscribe to the RSS of great PHP blogs and skim over them on a regular basis .
Dig into the topics that interest you most and see the author ’s point .
Also , keep a habit of trying new technologies every now & then .
It gives you an edge over others and when any discussion goes about it , you can help others understand as well as make your points .
Btw , if you do n’t have a clue where to find good blogs , have a look at here , here and here .
10 . Start community involvement
Remember I told above to give your work back to the community ?
How to do that ?
Start a blog of your own and start writing posts there every now & then .
Yes , I know you ’d say “ Who ’s going to read my blog anyway ? ” , but if you share your experience , someday , somebody will find it useful .
And if you can share things that others have n’t done , you ’ll slowly see visitors coming on your blog increasing way .
Besides blog , try to participate in tech forums and communities .
Help people out in the areas you excel and at the time of your need , other people will be happy to help you out as well .
These communities are also great place to learn about many unusual matters , see how situation changes from person to person , place to place , etc .
You ’ll also be able to make great friends who might come handy later in your life .
Another great way of community involvement is to contributing to open source projects .
Share some of your valuable time for an open source project and it may come handy for a huge number of people .
Your work might solve the problem of somebody like you .
If needed , initiate an open source project yourself and invite others to work on your vision .
11 . Use a good IDE
With due respect to Dreamweaver , step forward and use an IDE made for PHP .
You ’ll notice the difference in a few days when you ’ll see that your productivity has increased in great ways .
These IDEs provide great number of useful features including but not limited to : syntax highlighting , auto completion , code suggestions , code snippets , contextual help , code templates , debugging , profiling , etc .
The following IDEs mostly have the similar feature set and can boost your productivity in great ways :
Personally I use NuSphere PhpED 5.2 and I love it in every way .
They ’ve provided me with a complementary license and I am grateful to them for that .
If you ’re planning to buy it , let me know and I might find you a discount .
12 . Be communicative
In your team / company , try to be as communicative as possible .
It reduces a lot of confusions , makes you close to other devs so that you understand them , portrays you as a good person in front of management and overall , helps you enjoy your work .
When you ’re working together with others , make them feel that you ’re there and ready to give whatever it takes .
Create a personal brand of yourself .
What ’s next ?
Phew !
It ’s quite a good amount of writing in a while 🙂
I ’ve tried to cover most of the items I found to be important .
However , there might be some points I ’ve overlooked so feel free to post them in the comments .
If this helps any one of the developers I intend it for , then I ’ll take that the effort is successful .
Thanks everybody , Happy Eid Mubarak to you !

March 2004
Grand economic theories rarely last more than a few decades .
Some , if they are particularly in tune with technological or political events , may make it to half a century .
Beyond that , little short of military force can keep them in place .
The wild open - market theory that died in 1929 had a run of just over thirty years .
Communism , a complete melding of religious , economic , and global theories , stretched to seventy years in Russia and forty - five years in central Europe , thanks precisely to the intensive use of military and police force .
Keynesianism , if you add its flexible , muscular form during the Depression to its more rigid postwar version , lasted forty - five years .
Our own Globalization , with its technocratic and technological determinism and market idolatry , had thirty years .
And now it , too , is dead .
Of course grand ideologies rarely disappear overnight .
Fashions , whether in clothes or food or economics , tend to peter out .
Thousands of people have done well out of their belief in Globalization , and their professional survival is dependent on our continued shared devotion to the cause .
So is their personal sense of self - worth .
They will be in positions of power for a few more years , and so they will make their case for a few more years .
But the signs of decline are clear , and since 1995 those signs have multiplied , building on one another , turning a confused situation into a collapse .
We have scarcely noticed this collapse , however , because Globalization has been asserted by its believers to be inevitable -- an all - powerful god ; a holy trinity of burgeoning markets , unsleeping technology , and borderless managers .
Opposition or criticism has been treated as little more than romantic paganism .
It was powerless before this surprisingly angry god , who would simply strike down with thunderbolts those who faltered and reward his heroes and champions with golden wreaths , If Globalization has seemed so seductive to societies built upon Greek and Judeo - Christian mythologies , perhaps the reason is this bizarre confusing of salvation , fatalism , and punishment .
Transferred to economics , in however jumbled a manner , these belief systems are almost irresistible to us .
The British and French empires had vaunted and defended their power in similar ways from the late nineteenth century on ; that is , just as they began to collapse .
And as the various nineteenth - century nationalisms declined into ugliness , their supporters increasingly transformed them into a matter of race .
Inevitability is the traditional final justification for flailing ideologies .
Less traditional -- and a sign of inherent weakness -- is the extent to which Globalization was conceived as old - fashioned religiosity .
Perhaps the economists and other believers who launched Globalization were instinctively concerned that people would notice their new theories were oddly similar to the trade theories of the mid-nineteenth century or the unregulated market models that had been discredited in 1929 .
And so treating the intervening forty years as an accidental interval , they began where their predecessors had left off : with religious certainty .
Despite that initial certainty , a growing vagueness now surrounds the original promise of Globalization ; we seem to have lost track of what was repeatedly declared thirty years ago , even ten years ago , to be inevitable :
That the power of the nation - stare was on its way out , to be replaced by that of global markets .
That in the future , economics , not politics or arms , would determine the course of human events .
That freed markets would quickly establish natural international balances , impervious to the old boom - and - bust cycles .
That the growth in international trade , as a result of lowering barriers , would unleash an economic - social tide that would raise all ships , whether of our Western poor or of the developing world in general .
That prosperous markets would turn dictatorships into democracies .
That all of this would discourage irresponsible nationalism , racism , and political violence .
That global economics would produce stability through the creation of ever larger corporations impervious to bankruptcy .
That these transnational corporations would provide a new kind of international leadership , free of local political prejudices .
That the rise of global marketplace leadership and the decline of national politics , with its tendency to deform healthy economic processes , would force the emergence of debt - free governments .
By then wedding our governments to a permanent state of deficit - free public accounting , our societies would thus be stabilized .
In summary , global economic forces , if left unfettered by willful man , would protect us against the errors of local self - pride , while allowing individual self - interest to lead each individual to a better life .
Together , these forces and self - interests would produce prosperity and general happiness .
In a society where Christian dogma had been so dominant until so recently , how could people of goodwill not be attracted by this good news -- by these promises of personal redemption ?
And if you add to all of this a multitude of new , technocratic market methods -- well , then , the cycles of history would be broken , setting us on a permanent , inevitable course .
In the words of a particularly naive believer , history would die .
History was already dead .
Globalization materialized in the 1970s from the sort of geopolitical vacuum or fog that appears whenever a civilization begins to change direction , to grope its way around a corner from one era to another .
In geopolitics , a vacuum is not an option .
It is the period between options ; an opportunity , providing you can recognize it for what it is ; a brief interregnum during which individuals can maximize their influence on the direction of their civilization .
What caused that particular void ?
Perhaps a quarter century of social reform had left the liberal elites exhausted .
The need to manage a multitude of enormous new social programs that had been put in place in a democratic manner -- an ad hoc manner -- made it difficult for political leaders to concentrate on the main line ; that is , to concentrate on a broad sense of the public good .
Instead , governments were caught up in the endless and directionless details of management .
Or perhaps the cause of the vacuum was the resulting reliance of those political elites on technocrats , who understood little of public debate -- in fact , distrusted it -- and so drew the leaders into isolation .
In either case , most Western leaders seemed confused about what to do next .
They had come to the end of a chapter of social progress .
And they could not have been less prepared for a religious counterattack upon their ethical motivations , particularly not one in which the classic Judeo - Christian ideas of the sacred had been converted into economic inevitabilities .
These theoretically new economic ideas were now scarcely recognizable as the simplistic economic arguments of pre-1929 .
The religious fervor had been blended with sparkling waves of new technology and with masses of microeconomic data , all presented as fact .
Relaunched in this way , as three in one , one in three , the old ideas seemed new .
Caught up as the liberal elites were in the instrumental rationality of program management , they responded to this attack with superior , stolid , and unimaginative rejection , instead of speaking out for the public good , they defended administrative structures .
The effect was to make tired and discredited market arguments seem young and agile and modern .
One comic sign of the coming era was the creation , in 1971 in a Swiss mountain village called Davos , of a club for European corporate leaders .
There they could examine civilization through the prism of business .
Soon businessmen were coming from around the world .
Then government leaders and academics flooded in , looking for investors .
Business leaders , politicians , and academics alike seemed to accept without question the core tenet of Davos : that the public good should be treated as a secondary outcome of trade and competition and self - interest .
Davos was just a weather vane , a superficial and self - important version of a royal court , but when the G6 - - now the G8 - - was created in 1975 , its aim mimicked that of Davos : to bring the leaders of the biggest national economies together to examine the world through the prism of economics .
Never before had the great nations so explicitly and single - mindedly organized their core relationship around naked , commercial self - interest , without the positive and negative counterweights of social standards , human rights , political systems , dynasties , formal religions , and , at the negative extreme , supposed racial destinies .
Valery Giscard d'Estaing , the French president who organized the first G6 meeting at his official country residence , Rambouillet , was the very model of the European technocratic economist .
And his approach dominated .
But what actually opened the door to Globalization was the economic collapse of 1973 the depression that never was .
The reigning technocratic obsession with management and control meant that we all had to be reassured .
So we were told that this was just a recession .
Then there was another recession , then another , and on and on , always minimized , always about to be resolved .
The social reformers , who dominated within almost all political parties and governments , denied themselves the right to stand back and deal with the situation as a whole .
They had lost the intellectual breadth and the emotional balance to do this .
And so they gradually lost their right to lead .
As for the new force or ideology that came forward to fill the vacuum , it involved an all - inclusive strategy called Globalization -- an approach that contained the answer to every one of our problems .
It was delightfully seductive .
It contained simple , sweeping solutions and , as with all successful religions , lodged ultimate responsibility in invisible , untouchable hands .
Thus Globalization required no one to take responsibility for anything .
This transcendent vision quickly filled the vacuum .
I first heard the variety of personal passivity produced by this belief system on French national television in a speech by Giscard d'Estaing .
He had been elected as a new - style political leader - - a brilliant economist .
Modern .
Almost postmodern .
He was to lead society via the economy .
But he came in just after the 1973 collapse , which included high inflation and unemployment .
After a year or so of struggling with the collapse , Giscard went on television to tell people that great global , indeed inevitable , forces were at work .
There was therefore little that he could do .
Nation - states were powerless .
This was the beginning of the mania for public declarations of impotence by democratically elected leaders .
Globalization became their excuse for not dealing with difficult issues , for not using their levers of power and large budgets to effect .
They made the forces of inevitability credible .
Globalization had brilliant proponents -- Mrs. Thatcher first among them , and economists like Milton Friedman , but also growing waves of new - style managers and consultants .
These people had a multiplicity of roles .
They briefed public - and private - sector leaders , organized the structures that implement policies , and ran these structures on a day - to - day basis .
And their basic theory was -- is - - that modern methodology is universal .
What 's more , these methods are preferable to the untidy business of democratic argument and personal will , whether that is a matter of personal opinion or personal choice .
In other words , they were engaged in the classic struggle to promote method over opinion ; that is , form over content .
And so , as always happens when form is dominant , a variety of ideal experiments were undertaken .
Around the world , civil services were shrank , public and private sectors deregulated , markets released , taxes cut , public budgets balanced .
Corporations began growing in size by merging and remerging .
This Gigantism was considered necessary for success in a new world market .
Trade grew by an astonishing multiple of twenty .
European economic integration accelerated .
New Zealand , the original social democratic model state , did a complete flip in the mid-eighties and attempted to become the perfect Globalized nation - state .
The economies of Canada and the United States were rapidly integrated after the signing of the Free Trade Agreement in 1988 , to which the integration of the Mexican economy was added with the signing of NAFTA .
Social reformers , for their part , restructured their own arguments until their basic assumptions were the same as those of their opponents .
Social democrats and liberals almost everywhere became Globalists , but of a kinder , gentler sort .
Government after government , as if in a fit of moralism , legislated away its right to take on debt or collect new taxes , even though both of these were fundamental governmental powers , central to the construction and maintenance of democracies .
In fact , debt and taxes had played the same fundamental role in the pre-democratic period .
At the same time , the private sector invented myriad new debts and privatized taxes for itself .
Everything from junk bonds to credit cards was treated as an unregulated privatized currency .
And corporations used the old default mechanism more than ever to clear their own decks whenever it was handy to do so .
The sin of public debt was then broadened by attributing it to public utilities .
Running well or not , they had to be privatized and deregulated into a global marketplace to cleanse them of public - sector inefficiencies .
This led in turn to the large utility - style private businesses , such as airlines , being freed of regulatory restraints to satisfy a moral version of individualism that promised , for example , the right to travel , cheaper fares , greater choice , more destinations .
From the early 1970s to late in the century , multiple binding international economic treaties were put in place , while almost no counterbalancing binding treaties were negotiated for work conditions , taxation , the environment , or legal obligations .
For 250 years the painful job of building the modern nation - state had depended on a continual rebalancing of binding rules for both the public good and self - interest .
Now this balance was tipped violently one way by simply shifting much of our economic power out into the global marketplace .
With economic power denationalized and transnationals using the new unregulated debt and currency systems to accumulate a financial worth greater than that of most nation - states , the next logical step was to think of those transnationals as new nations unto themselves -- virtual nations , freed of the limitations of geography and citizens , freed of local obligations , empowered with the mobility of money and goods .
Better in every way .
This quarter - century rise of Globalization peaked in 1995 when the old system of international trade agreements known collectively as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , or GATT - was reconceived as a new powerful body , the World Trade Organization .
It was the last triumph .
There was nothing remarkable about the creation of the WTO .
It was just a centralized body to deal with commercial trade issues -- not a bad thing in and of itself .
The important point was the context .
The reconceptualization of civilization through the prism of economics had reached a critical barrier .
Beyond that barrier any international exchange that involved a commercial element would be treated as fundamentally commercial .
Culture would be seen as a mere matter of industrial regulation ; food , as a secondary outcome of agricultural industries .
What particularly caught public attention around the world was the idea that national health and food rules would be treated not as the expression of a people concerned about what sorts of things it put in its collective stomach but rather as mere protectionism -- unless backed by the hardest of hard scientific evidence .
That sort of evidence was usually decades in coming .
The precautionary principle and the citizen 's opinion were thus to be thrown aside in favor of an absolutist theory of commercial exchange .
This determinist approach toward agriculture as an industry rather than as a food source -- toward the implications of everything from fertilizers , herbicides , and insecticides to genetics , hormones , antibiotics , labeling , and sourcing -- became the flash point for a far broader concern among citizens .
This was the context in which a growing percentage of people judged the handling of key issues as different as mad cow disease , the availability of pharmaceuticals in the developing world , and global warming .
They were beginning to feel that what was presented as an argument of Globalism versus protectionism was often just a confused opposition of personal choice and abstract corporate interests .
So Globalization , put forward as a metaphor for choice , was organizing itself around not consumers but corporate structures , structures that sought profits by limiting personal choice .
Soon people began to notice other contradictions in the Global orthodoxy .
How could the same ideology promise a planetary growth in democracy and yet a decline in the power of the nation - state ?
Democracy exists only inside countries .
Weaken the nation - state and you weaken democracy .
Why did an unprecedented increase in money supply translate into a dearth of money for public services ?
And why did this growth in new monies enrich mainly those who already had money ?
Why did it lead to a growth in the rich - versus - poor dichotomy and a squeezing of the middle class ?
Why did many privatizations of public utilities neither improve services nor lower costs for consumers but instead guarantee revenues to the new owners while leading to a collapse in infrastructure investment ?
People noticed that the financial value of the great breakthroughs in female employment had somehow been inflated away .
Abruptly , a middle - class family required two incomes .
They noticed that in a mere twenty - five years CEO salaries in the United States had gone from 39 times the pay of an average worker to more than 1,000 times .
Elsewhere the numbers were similar .
And the savings from the cutbacks in civil servants was more than offset by the cost of new lobbyists and consultants .
There were three particularly obvious signs that Globalization would not deliver on its promises .
First , the leadership of a movement devoted to " real competition " was made up largely of tenured professors , consultants , and technocrats -- that is , private - sector bureaucrats -- managing large joint - stock companies .
Most of the changes they sought were aimed at reducing competition .
Second , the idea of transnationals as new virtual nation - states missed the obvious .
Natural resources are fixed in place , inside nation - states .
And consumers live on real land in real places .
These are called countries .
The managers and professors who waxed enthusiastic about the new virtual corporate nations were themselves resident citizens and consumers in old - fashioned nation - states .
It would be only a matter of time before elected leaders noticed that their governments were far stronger than the large corporations .
Finally , the new approach to debt -- public versus private , First World versus Third World - - revealed a fatal confusion .
Those who preached Globalization could n't tell the difference between ethics and morality .
Ethics is the measurement of the public good .
Morality is the weapon of religious and social righteousness .
Political and economic ideologies often decline into religious - style morality toward the end .
But Globalization had shoved ethics to the side from the very beginning and insisted upon a curious sort of moral righteousness that included maximum trade , unrestrained self - interest , and governments alone respecting their debts .
These notions were curiously paired with something often called family values , as well as an Old Testament view of good and evil .
It somehow followed that if countries were in financial trouble , they were moral transgressors .
They had to discipline themselves .
Wear hair shirts .
Embrace denial and fasting .
This was the crucifixion theory of economics : you had to be killed economically and socially in order to be reborn clean and healthy .
For a quarter century , under the severe hand of the International Monetary Fund , this moralizing and emotionally charged approach has been applied to the developing world with absolutely no success .
Oddly enough , it had been presented as a form of cool , detached utilitarianism .
Those who applied the theory seemed to fail the basic philosophical test of functioning intelligence and ethics -- the ability to imagine the Other .
They simply insisted , as developing - world debts continued to rise on a roller coaster of instability , that those people must learn to act in a more predictable manner .
Which brings to mind rather aged priests insisting that young men should take cold showers and exercise more .
By the turn of the century , it had become clear that nationalism and the nation - states were stronger than they had been when Globalization began .
Indeed , this was apparent as early as 1991 , when the Yugoslavian army tried to stop Slovenia and Croatia from leaving their federation .
The ensuing massacre was a test for almost every international organization .
All of them failed .
As if in a black comedy , international elites chattered away about how global economic forces made nation - states irrelevant , while thousands of real people were being murdered and cleansed to facilitate the creation of yet more nation - states .
The resulting horror shocked the Europeans into the realization that their economic and administrative Union was helpless in a political - military disaster .
Eventually Washington brokered the Dayton Peace Accords .
But Dayton accepted the model of the local nationalist war criminals .
Jews in Bosnia do n't exist as citizens unless they pretend to belong to one of the three official races .
Neither do people of mixed blood .
Dayton is all about racially based nations -- the most appalling aspect of nationalism , but nationalism nonetheless .
And so Globalization 's triumph , with the creation of the WTO in 1995 , was paired with its humiliation at the Dayton signing in the same year .
In a depressing game of leapfrog , the Yugoslavian settlement competed with a genocide in Rwanda , where half a million to a million people were murdered .
This is a remarkable statistic .
In a global world of economic and social measurement , we are bombarded daily by apparently exact statistics measuring growth , efficiency , production , reproduction , sales , currency fluctuations , comparative levels of obesity and orgasms , divorce , salaries , and incomes .
Yet we do n't know , or do n't care to know , whether it was a million or half a million Rwandans who were massacred .
And the genocide was facilitated by Paris and Washington , using old - fashioned nation - state powers at the U.N. Security Council to block a serious international intervention .
The Rwanda catastrophe then morphed into the Congo catastrophe , involving 4.7 million deaths between 1998 and 2003 .
Or was it 3 million ?
Or 5.5 ?
The point is that the inevitability of global economic leadership has been irrelevant through all these crises .
While the true believers speak of Globalization , we are in fact in the middle of an accelerated political meltdown marked by astonishing levels of nationalist violence .
Observant national leaders could n't help but notice that the theories of Globalization were failing them .
The most public of these failures was the breakdown of international lending and debt mechanisms .
For a short period it looked as if the IMF 's punishing approach might actually work .
For a dozen years most Latin American governments tried to follow the instructions laid down by the IMF , Western governments , and the private banks .
They endured crucifixion economics , and in many cases this eventually produced apparently solid growth , even if the parallel result was a greater rich / poor divide .
But in each case the recovery was followed , a few years later , by an even greater collapse .
It turned out that such prolonged austerity had weakened , not strengthened , the social - economic fabric .
So after all of the liberalizations , privatizations , and inflation - stabilization programs , growth in Latin America in the late nineties was a little over half what it had been before the reforms .
True believers will tell you that it could have worked , if only there had been less nepotism , weaker unions , or less corruption .
But real economic policies in the real world do n't require perfect conditions .
Perfect conditions do n't exist in the real world .
Western growth over two centuries has come in spite of our own shifting flaws .
Peru and Bolivia are on a precipice .
Argentina is picking itself up yet again , while its educated youth emigrate en masse .
Now , like Brazil , it is going to try something it believes more suitable to its circumstances .
Only Chile seems solid , and that is because , since the departure of Pinochet , it has carefully designed its own solutions .
In other words , Latin America no longer believes in Globalization .
Neither does Africa .
Nor does a good part of Asia .
Globalization is no longer global .
Indeed , most Western finance ministers have been quietly working for some time on partial deregulation of the markets .
Why quietly ?
To avoid the ferocity of the true believers .
In 1998 the governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia , 1 . J. Macfarlane , began calling for deregulation .
" More people are asking whether the international financial system as it has operated for most of the nineties is basically unstable .
By now , I think the majority of observers have come to the conclusion that it is , and that some changes have to be made . "
In the same year a combination of street demonstrators and distrustful ministers of finance from around the developed world killed the Multilateral Agreement on Investment negotiations , which had been aimed at a further Globalization of finance and investment .
They rejected the idea of yet more business - oriented binding treaties , with no binding political or social counterweights .
At almost the same time , Malaysia responded to an economic meltdown in Asia by refusing to follow the Global rules .
The government pulled its currency off the market , made it nonconvertible , pegged it just low enough to favor exports , blocked the export of foreign capital , and raised tariffs .
These measures were met by an explosion of Western moral fervor .
Malaysia could not do this .
Their economy would not survive .
The leading international emerging - markets index expelled them .
Then everyone averted their eyes from the inevitable collapse .
In 1999 , a short year later , that same index sheepishly readmitted Malaysia .
Smarter merchant bankers began to praise the possible long - term investment advantages of pegging certain currencies in certain conditions .
By then the World Bank , under new leadership , had begun to soften its monolithic Global view , even if the IMF has been extremely slow to accept reality and follow .
Late in the year the WTO was humiliated in Seattle by unprecedented demonstrations .
By the end of the century it was not only national leaders who were beginning to take a more nuanced view of Globalization 's capitalist credentials .
A growing number of people , including the brighter business leaders , were focusing on where deregulation had worked and where it had n't .
The airline industry , for example , had been growing since World War II .
The calls for deregulation in the mid-seventies came from a successful , profitable growth sector , which continued to grow until September 11 , 2001 .
Even then , the drop was only 5.7 percent , which , given sixty years of solid growth , should not have been a catastrophe .
Yet it was .
In any case , those corporations that had called for deregulation a quarter century before had pretty well all gone bankrupt , one by one over the intervening years .
The whole industry is now dependent on cut -rate airlines .
So a sector that provides essential services is being run on dubious margins and institutional instability .
Why ?
Because of devotion to a simplistic , monolithic model of Global market forces .
But a large airplane is not a telephone or running shoes .
Planes that cost $ 100 million have to be paid for with $ 100 plane tickers - - a daunting business model .
The secret to the industry 's pre-1973 success was its stability -- produced by carefully maintained , long - term public regulations .
As for the romance of Gigantism -- of corporate size as a criterion for industrial success -- it was beginning to look pretty silly .
Endless mergers had led to high levels of unserviceable debt and bankruptcy .
It was as if size had replaced thought .
As if it were a male thing .
It was all beginning to resemble the seventeenth - and eighteenth - century speculation markets -- the South Sea Bubble , John Law and the French regency , the Dutch tulip - bulb frenzy .
The larger the corporations grew , the slower and more directionless they became -- enormous management structures frightened of serious investment and risk .
They resembled out - of - control bureaucracies .
Yet the whole argument in favor of Globalization had been the apparently desperate need to wrench power from the bureaucracies and place it firmly in the hands of real owners capable of taking real risks .
More perhaps than the genocides , the disorder in the streets , or the debt crises , it was those simple recurring images of corporate ineptitude , combined with an absence of self - criticism , that first made clear the decline of Globalization .
How then could any of us seriously believe that our redemption lay in the reconceptualization of civilization so that we could all view it through the prism of business and economics ?
The larger the corporations became , the more deregulation released them to be themselves , the faster they slipped out of sync with their civilization and even with their customers and shareholders .
Of course most people in business were working away as best they could , more or less as they always had , whatever the ideology in place .
The people who stumbled badly seemed to be the insistent stars of the new - world methodology .
And so , in full public view , the value of the fabled merger of AOL and TimeWarner slipped rapidly from $ 284 billion to $ 61 billion .
And GE's Jack Welch , a model new leader , began stumbling toward every last penny on the floor like a greedy little boy .
Arthur Andersen demonstrated that accountants can act as badly as anyone else .
Hollinger , whose newspapers on four continents had trumpeted Globalization , fell under multiple financial and legal investigations , as did Parmalat , the great Italian success story .
And so on .
Ideology , like theater , is dependent on the willing suspension of disbelief .
At the core of every ideology lies the worship of a bright new future , with only failure in the immediate past .
But once the suspension goes , willingness converts into suspicion -- the suspicion of the betrayed .
Our brilliant leaders abruptly appear naive , even ridiculous .
And so , in the late nineties , our disbelief came back , and with it our memory .
The years between 1945 and 1973 no longer seemed such a failure .
In fact , it had been one of the most successful eras in history for both social reform and economic growth .
It was something to build on , to reform ; not something to dismiss .
The first clear hint of the end of the reigning ideology came with Malaysia 's successful rejection of the Globalization model .
We , in our fervor , saw their crisis as one of economics , and therefore subject to the rules of inevitability .
The Malaysians saw it as a national political crisis with economic implications .
And so they acted politically and nationally , and were proved right .
Abruptly it seemed possible that nation - states were not dying .
And that economic certainty was naive .
Then , in late 1999 , came the general election in New Zealand .
Fifteen years earlier this small country had become the model for Globalization .
Now , overnight , its electors voted to change direction , endorsing a strong interventionist government devoted to a mix of national social policies , enforceable economic regulations , and a stable private sector .
Why ?
Its national industries had been sold off , its economy was in decline , and its standard of living had been stagnant for all fifteen years of its Globalization experiment .
Its youth were emigrating at alarming rates .
This , the citizens now said , was not inevitable .
If a small country could flex its muscles , well , then , the nation - state was truly alive .
Then came the explosions of 2001 in New York , Washington , and Pennsylvania .
In the following days , the world economy began plummeting into a depression .
Corporate leaders hunkered down to their businesses , forgot about world leadership , and , with a classic desire to reduce risk , slashed their investment programs , thus accelerating society 's economic plunge .
As for the political leaders , ministers of finance , chairs of reserve and national banks -- the constituted elites of the nation - states -- they rolled into action .
They traveled and talked , printed money , and spent vast amounts of it .
And they managed to stabilize the situation .
In other words , there was a brutal , highly public , and existential reversal of roles .
The governments of the nation - states took back their full power both to act and to lead .
The CEOs retreated back into their historic reactive role .
Once belief is gone , the churches begin to empty .
You could see this accelerating disbelief in bankruptcy court in December 2001 , when , as if in the last scene of an old - fashioned bedroom farce , the " inevitability " of Global corporate leadership came face to face with Enron , filing for government protection from its private debts .
You saw it again in the opening session of the frivolous court of Davos .
This was where , thirty - three years before , the theology of Globalization had been first put forward , all based on the assumption that civilization must be approached through a single , monolithic economic prism .
Yet here they were on their opening day in January 2003 feting Mahathir Mohamad , the prime minister of Malaysia , for his country 's economic success .
It was clear to everyone that this success had come from political leadership at the nation - state level and that it was based on the rejection of Globalist economics .
A few days later , Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva , the new president of Brazil , arrived in the Swiss village to lay out an independent , straightforward version of responsible nation - state populism .
What all of this meant became perfectly clear when Secretary of State Colin Powell arrived to speak for the country that had achieved more national power than any other in history .
Insofar as a possible war with Iraq was concerned , he declared , " we will act even if others are not prepared to join us . "
So the United States would act unilaterally -- that is , nationally .
Thus , in a single week , inside the emotional and mythological home of Globalization , three very different pivotal governments turned their backs on Globalization and acted as if the nation - state were the central international reality .
The war that followed in Iraq quite intentionally put an effective end to the half - century - old Western alliance produced by the Second World War .
Washington had chosen in January 2003 not to take the time to put together the traditional Western battlefield coalition .
The effect was to free a cast of nations to rethink their relationships .
This was as true for the old NATO players as it was for the smaller , newly free , central European states , which were able to flex their nation - state muscles by joining in .
Some of them had never had such an opportunity .
For others it was the first time since the 1930s .
Throughout the world , nations began moving about like semi - free agents .
Organizations such as NATO are still solid .
There is no desire to storm out .
But everyone is checking around to see if What there are other ways they might like to act .
And with whom .
What this might mean remains painfully unclear .
Here we are , rushing around one of those sharp corners with no idea of where we are going .
Perhaps back to the worst of old - style negative nationalism .
Or perhaps on toward a more complex and interesting form of positive nationalism , based on the public good .
What is certain is that nationalism of the best and the worst sort has made a remarkable , unexpected recovery .
We do n't yet know whether it will become the new dominant ideology .
What we do know is that there has been a return across Europe of nineteenth - century - style negative nationalism .
Although usually the product of fear , it reappeared in countries that had nothing to fear : Jorg Haider in Austria speaking out against immigrants , while echoing race and monolithic national myths .
Italy governed by three nationalists , one of them the leader of Mussolini 's old party .
Related phenomena in Belgium , Denmark , France , Holland , Norway , Switzerland .
A sudden revival of sectarian nationalism in Northern Ireland .
The defeat of a compromise in Corsica .
Everywhere these nationalists are now in coalition governments or are leading oppositions .
Many mainstream parties have trimmed their sails to capture some of this nationalist vote .
Non-European immigrants , who rarely account for more than 5 percent of a country 's population , have become the focus for a sense of political and social impotence , produced in part by a quarter century of continental and Global inevitabilities .
Today 's growing fear of Muslims is paralleled by a return of anti-Semitism .
The last Australian election was won by provoking a fear of immigrants .
The new president of the Czech Republic is thought to be an old - fashioned nationalist , as is the governor of Tokyo .
Because the United States is so powerful , people say its actions are all about empire .
But empires are mere extensions of nationalism .
They are not a phenomenon of either Globalization or internationalism .
At the same time , positive forms of nationalism have surged forward , with countries like South Africa and Brazil taking on the pharmaceutical transnationals over the availability of drugs to fight epidemics such as AIDS .
And these countries have been winning .
A reasonable number of noneconomic and internationally binding treaties based on the primacy of ethics and the public good have begun to take form : the Ottawa treaty against land mines , the International Criminal Court , the Kyoto accord against global warming .
They represent the beginnings of an attempt at an international balance in which the prism of civilization is neither naive market economics nor national selfishness .
The return of the idea of national power has also meant the return of the idea of choice -- choice for citizens and choice for countries .
But with choice comes uncertainty , which provokes fear .
The moment we entered the post - Globalization vacuum , you could feel that fear begin to rise .
And curiously enough , the greater a nation 's power , the more intense the fear becomes .
Perhaps power produces an expectation of certainty .
Perhaps smaller countries find a certain freedom in uncertainty -- the freedom to choose without being bullied .
Necessity , Pitt the Younger said , is the excuse of every tyranny .
For most smaller countries , Globalization has felt like an inevitability and , so , like a tyranny .
History will eventually give all of these contradictory signals a shape .
But history is neither for nor against .
It just is .
And there is no such thing as a prolonged vacuum in geopolitics .
It is always filled .
This is what happens every few decades .
The world turns , shifts , takes a new tack , or retries an old one .
Civilization rushes around one of those blind corners filled with uncertainties .
Then , abruptly , the opportunities present themselves to those who move with skill and commitment .

An individual who suffers from cluster headaches thinks he may have finally found a treatment that works : psychedelic mushrooms .
The man , who goes by the name Flash , found no relief at the doctor 's office , read that in the 1960s LSD had been tested to relieve migraines .
So he decided to eat some psilocybin mushrooms .
From The Independent :
He was thrilled to find that the " shadows " evaporated – and stayed away .
He began taking a light , sub - hallucinogenic dose of 12 to 20 mushrooms approximately once every three months , and found that he remained symptom - free for nearly a year .
" I started to tell people about it , " he says , " but they thought I was mad … "
A handful of CH sufferers thought there was truth in Flash 's unorthodox solution .
One man , Bob Wold , decided to start clusterbusters.com , a website devoted to campaigning for research and disseminating information about how to safely use hallucinogenics …
Anecdotal reports of the clusterheads ' use of hallucinogens attracted the interest of John Halpern of Harvard Medical School in Massachusetts .
Spurred on by the suicide of a colleague who suffered from CH , Halpern and colleague Andrew Sewell interviewed 53 people who had self - medicated with the hallucinogen therapy .
The survey results suggested that there was something to Flash 's idea after all .
The pair published their results in the respected journal Neurology , and Halpern has now submitted a protocol for a Phase - I clinical trial to the university 's Institutional Review Board .
Da staunten die Beamten in Stralsund nicht schlecht :
Als sie einen polizeibekannten 44 - Jährigen , der vor einer Gartenanlage lag , zum Pusten antreten ließen , zeigte das Testgerät 7,67 Promille an - ein Wert , der normalerweise tödlich ist .
Mit einem rekordverdächtigen Alkoholwert von 7,67 Promille ist ein Mann am Mittwochabend in Stralsund aufgelesen worden .
Der 44 - Jährige von der Insel Rügen habe noch in das Testgerät pusten können und sei dann zur Ausnüchterung in ein Krankenhaus gebracht worden , teilte ein Sprecher der Stralsunder Polizeidirektion am Donnerstag mit .
Der wegen seines Alkoholkonsums polizeibekannte Mann lag in hilflosem , aber nicht akut lebensbedrohlichem Zustand vor einer Gartenanlage .
Erstaunt waren die Beamten , als sie das Testgerät ablasen .
" Ein solcher Wert ist mir in meinen 28 Berufsjahren noch nicht vorgekommen " , sagte der Sprecher .
Messfehler oder einen Defekt am Testgerät schließt die Polizei aus .
Nach Einschätzung eines Rechtsmediziners der Universität Greifswald handelt es sich bei dem Wert von 7,67 Promille um ein " exemplarisches Einzelereignis " .
Wenn ein Mensch über Jahre die Erfahrung gemacht habe , hohe Alkoholmengen zu verarbeiten , sei es möglich , diese hoch toxische Konzentration zu erreichen und " auch einmal " zu überleben , sagte der Rechtsmediziner Klaus - Peter Philipp .
Diese Alkoholkonzentrationen seien aber grundsätzlich lebensgefährlich .
Hirnzellen würden geschädigt , Koma und Lähmung des Atemzentrums im Hirn drohten .
Der Mann aus Poseritz auf Rügen hat möglicherweise einen unrühmlichen Spitzenwert für Deutschland erreicht .
Im Jahr 2004 wurde in Karlsruhe ein Alkoholiker mit einem Blutalkoholwert von 7,04 Promille aufgelesen .
Im Jahr 2006 zogen litauische Beamte allerdings einen Autofahrer mit einem Atemalkoholwert von 8,4 Promille aus dem Verkehr .
Rechtsmediziner Philipp wies auf Differenzen zwischen Blut - und Atemalkoholwerte hin .
Gerade bei höherer Alkoholkonzentration klafften die beiden Messwerte zunehmend auseinander , erklärte er. Der Blutalkoholwert könne deshalb bis zu einem Promille unter oder über dem Atemalkoholwert liegen .
Bei dem Mann in Stralsund hat die Polizei keinen Blutalkoholtest vorgenommen .

DOVER , Delaware ( CNN ) --
It was a very public goodbye for Joe Biden on Friday as the Delaware senator addressed the deployment ceremony of his son's National Guard unit as they prepare to leave for a tour of duty in Iraq .
Democratic vice presidential candidate Joe Biden addresses the deployment ceremony Friday .
Following Thursday night 's debate with Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin in St. Louis , Missouri , Biden flew back to Delaware to spend the day with his 39 - year - old son before his deployment to Iraq .
Beau Biden -- a captain in the National Guard and Delaware 's attorney general -- will be a trial counselor in the 261st Signal Brigade , a unit that specializes in providing communications for the military in Iraq .
" I 've come here many times before as a Delawarean , as a United States senator , " he told a crowd in Dover .
" But today I come , as you prepare to deploy , as a father -- a father who had some sage advice from his son this morning : ' Dad , keep it short , we 're in formation . ' "
" My heart is full of love and pride .
...
You are the best demonstration of both our nation 's greatness and ... our people 's goodness , " he added .
Watch more of Biden 's comments »
Biden joined the rest of Delaware 's congressional delegation and the state 's Gov. Ruth Ann Minner in speaking to the 110 members of the unit .
" Let me simply say , thank you , thank you for answering the call of your country .
...
So stay strong , stand together , serve honorably ... may
God bless you and may he protect you , " Biden added , later saluting the crowd .
Do n't Miss Election Center 2008
Beau Biden does n't ship out right away .
Instead , he heads to Fort Bliss , Texas , this weekend , where his National Guard unit completes assigned tasks and receives additional training specific to the conditions in Iraq .
Then , in six to eight weeks , they ship out to Iraq .
Despite increased interest and security because Biden is now a vice presidential nominee , the public affairs officer for the unit had insisted the ceremony would be no different , and not political .
Lt. Col. Len Grattieri said Wednesday that the last time Biden -- who has often spoken at deployment ceremonies -- addressed a departing unit was 18 months ago , and that he usually roots his remarks in foreign policy , offering his perspective on the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Grattieri could n't say where Beau Biden will be based , but his role will be that of a prosecutor enforcing the Uniform Code of Military Justice .
He added that positions are n't clearly defined , and the unit will do whatever the Army needs it to .
In the past week , Biden had been trying to balance debate prep with family time .
On Tuesday afternoon , he took a break and went out to lunch with Beau , Beau 's wife , Hallie , and the couple 's young daughter .
Aides say it 's been a tough week for Biden , with Beau 's departure weighing on him .
Biden said in an interview Tuesday that he is proud of his son , but wishes he were n't going .
Palin , along with Biden , brought up their respective sons ' deployment to Iraq during the debate .
Palin's son Track , 19 , an infantry soldier , was deployed to Iraq with his Army unit September 11 .
Palin spoke at her eldest son's deployment ceremony in Alaska , which honored the 4,000 Alaska - based troops to be deployed from Fort Wainwright to Iraq in the coming weeks .
Track Palin , who was standing in formation among members of the 1st Stryker Brigade 's 25th Infantry Division at Fort Wainwright , went unmentioned by the governor in her brief remarks .
Palin had agreed to speak at the deployment ceremony several months ago , before she was tapped as Sen.
John McCain 's running mate .
Though the speech was n't a political event -- media credentials were issued by the military base -- that did n't stop dozens of national reporters and photographers from descending on the military base in Fairbanks , home to nearly 12,000 soldiers and their families .
" As you depart today , " Palin told the infantrymen , " do n't mind us -- your parents , your friends , your family -- if we allow for a few tears , or if we hold you just a little close once more before you 're gone .
Because were going to miss you .
We can't help it .
We are going to miss you . "
Palin said victory in Iraq is " within sight . "
" You and others like you will be there to see the mission through , " she said .
" You will be there to win .
You will see victory .
Track Palin signed up to join the Army on September 11 , 2007 .
During his 12 - month deployment , his unit will protect reconstruction teams that are rebuilding the country , said Maj .
Chris Hyde , the public affairs officer for the brigade .
Hyde , who called Track Palin " a low - profile individual , " said he had not heard any security concerns about having the son of a prominent political figure in the brigade .
" The decision to put him in that role was made before Gov. Palin was picked by McCain , " he said .
" If anything comes down from headquarters , we will comply , but I would n't even want to speculate .
I would n't say yes or no .
That 's just my opinion .
We will do well with Track Palin whether he 's there or he 's not . "
CNN 's Peter Hamby , Ed Hornick and Alexander Marquardt contributed to this report .

Babe .
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) -- Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson fired his bazooka again , but the target remains elusive .
Paulson has proposed using $ 700 billion of taxpayer funds to relieve struggling financial firms of distressed mortgage assets .
He did so , he said Friday , as part of a " comprehensive approach to relieving the stresses on our financial institutions and markets . "
He then spent the weekend and Monday on a non -stop sales call to TV studios and Capitol Hill offices .
But a selloff in the dollar and U.S. stocks shows that the stresses remain , if perhaps in different form .
Investors spent Monday taking the two big pluses on the U.S. economic landscape in recent months - the recovery of the dollar and the collapse of commodity prices - and turning them back into minuses .
The dollar dropped the most in its history against the euro , and oil prices surged as much as 22 % .
Early Tuesday , crude prices retreated sharply , falling below the $ 108 - a - barrel mark .
The flight from U.S. assets reflects fears that the tab for the financial system bailout is n't about to be closed out any time soon .
Paulson 's plan for Wall Street creates an opening for congressional Democrats to demand a similarly costly plan for Main Street , says Benn Steil , director of international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations .
Meanwhile , it 's far from certain that the Paulson proposal - or the Main Street alternative - will do anything to stabilize tumbling values in the housing or asset markets .
" I 'm extremely worried about this plan , " said Steil .
" This looks like something cobbled together in a panic . "
Steil knows a thing or two about plans to clear the market for troubled mortgage assets , having presented one himself last December in the pages of the Financial Times .
Steil and co-author Mark Fisch sketched out a proposal in which a new government entity , modeled after the Resolution Trust Corp. used in the savings and loan bailout of the 1980s , would evaluate mortgage - backed securities and classify those presented for sale in one of five tiers .
The government would offer to pay 70 cents on the dollar for Tier A assets , 60 cents for Tier B , and so on down to 30 cents for Tier E .
The goal of this setup , Steil says , is to put a floor under asset values - an event that should bolster the credibility of financial companies ' balance sheets .
Setting a floor on the value of these assets could also entice the deep - pocketed opportunists who have largely kept to the sidelines - namely hedge funds and private equity funds - to enter the market , perhaps in some cases outbidding the government for the assets and thus limiting taxpayers ' exposure .
Steil points to investments such as Citadel 's purchase of troubled securities from E*Trade ( ETFC ) last November as an example of the types of deals that might take place given greater transparency on asset values .
A similar but more recent deal had Merrill Lynch ( MER , Fortune 500 ) selling a huge portfolio of troubled debt to Lone Star Funds for less than a quarter on the dollar .
Where 's the transparency ?
By contrast , Paulson 's plan threatens to turn $ 700 billion of taxpayer dollars loose on the marketplace , in an apparent bid to prop values up .
But while details of the plan remain scarce , skeptics of the setup note an absence of the transparency that Paulson himself has been such an outspoken advocate of , and the fear that in the absence of private bidders for mortgage assets , the government 's balance sheet will end up stuffed with junk .
" These are very toxic assets , whose valuations are extraordinarily uncertain at best , " said Steil .
" I can't see this not having an impact on the dollar . "
Indeed , the dollar made its worst - ever daily showing against the euro Monday , slumping to $ 1.48 to the euro from $ 1.38 just two weeks ago .
And the dollar could fall further once the fears of a financial system unwinding finally pass , whenever that happens .
The greenback managed to crawl higher early Tuesday , up $ 1.47 versus the euro .
" Once the liquidity crisis subsides , the market is likely to focus on tallying up the bill to the U.S. taxpayer , " wrote Merrill Lynch economist Alex Patelis .
" We remain concerned with the repercussions that this crisis will have on financial flows into the United States against the context of a still large current account deficit . "
Policymakers vs. burst bubble
The mortgage bailout is the latest episode in a long - running drama pitting Paulson and other policymakers against the unwinding of the credit bubble that inflated earlier this decade .
In one memorable scene in July , Paulson - trying to justify his request for the authority to use taxpayer funds to backstop the mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac - advised Congress that " if you have a bazooka in your pocket and people know it , you probably wo n't have to use it . "
Two months later , alas , the debt markets were in disarray again , prompting Paulson to drop the military imagery and take the companies into government conservatorship .
It will be days or weeks before the mortgage legislation wends its way through Congress , meaning that a final verdict on the project is still a ways off .
In the meantime , Steil believes there is one surefire bull market : in lobbying Congress over the final shape of the bailout legislation .
" The amount to be spent in lobbying will be huge , " he said .
" It 's difficult to see where this all ends . "
Island Pilot Hybrid Luxury Yacht Unveiled
October 29th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Earlier today , Island Pilot LLC unveiled the first ever hybrid yacht .
The 40 ft Island Pilot DSe Hybrid 12 m combines solar , electric , and diesel power .
The Hybrid can travel at 6 knots running only on solar power and 13 knots with the addition of diesel .
Of course , the yacht does n’t come cheap — plan on shelling out $ 600,000 if you want one .
Island Pilot emphasizes that the hybrid technology does n’t take away from the yacht ’s luxury amenities , which include a Garmin HD radar , Tecnautic “ Fly by Wire ” controls and gyro autopilot , 4 zones of air conditioning , hi-tech refrigeration with ice maker , and a 26 ″ HDTV .
But why would anyone think the addition of solar power to a yacht would somehow detract from its luxuriousness ?
Perhaps this is one of the problems with alternative energy — some people have an inherent mistrust of anything unfamiliar .
Hopefully the increasing accessibility of solar , wind , and geothermal will alleviate these concerns .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The Federal Reserve cut a key short - term interest rate by a half - percentage point Wednesday and issued a gloomy outlook for the economy due to continued worries about the ongoing crisis in the financial and credit markets .
The rate cut put the central bank 's federal funds rate at 1 % .
That matched the lowest level for this overnight bank lending rate ever -- the last time it was at 1 % was from June 2003 to June 2004 .
Investors had been expecting a half - point cut and some were betting that the Fed would even cut rates by three - quarters of a point to 0.75 % .
Major U.S. stock indexes , which had been higher ahead of the Fed 's decision , fell after the announcement and finished mostly lower following a wild afternoon of trading .
The fed funds rate is used to set rates for a wide variety of consumer loans , including home equity lines and credit cards , as well as for many business loans .
The lower the rate , the more the Fed hopes to spur economic activity .
The Fed said in a statement that it was concerned about the drop - off in consumer and business spending due disruptions in the credit markets and warned that the economic slowdown is likely to get worse .
" The intensification of financial market turmoil is likely to exert additional restraint on spending , partly by further reducing the ability of households and businesses to obtain credit , " the central bank said in its statement .
Economists generally agreed this is the Fed 's most grim assessment of the economy since the Fed started issuing statements with interest rate decisions in 1995 .
" They go through a litany of all these problems , " said Gus Faucher , director of macroeconomics , Moody's Economy.com .
He added that he thinks this statement is the Fed 's way of indicating that the U.S. is already in a recession and that the economy will remain weak well into 2009 .
This is the ninth time that the central bank has lowered rates since September 2007 in an effort to deal with the problems in the U.S. economy and credit markets .
The decision to lower rates was unanimous .
The Fed also lowered its discount rate by a half - percentage point to 1.25 % .
That is the rate at which it lends directly to banks and Wall Street firms .
In its statement , the Fed also appeared to concede that the rate cuts and a number of other actions it has taken to pump hundreds of billions of dollars into the credit markets would not lead to an immediate return of economic growth .
The Fed projected improved credit markets and a return of moderate growth " over time . "
And it warned that " downside risks to growth remain . "
Will Fed go below 1 % ?
The Fed 's grim view of the economy is expected to be reinforced Thursday morning when the Commerce Department issues its first reading on gross domestic product , the broadest measure of the nation 's economic activity , for the third quarter .
Economists surveyed by Briefing.com forecast that GDP declined by 0.5 % annually after jumping 2.8 % in the second quarter .
If the GDP number is negative , it would be only the fifth quarter in more than 17 years that has happened .
Faucher said he believes that the risk of further weakening in the economy , coupled by the unanimous vote , is a signal that the Fed is not done lowering rates yet .
He 's predicting another half - point cut , to 0.5 % , at its next scheduled meeting on December 16 .
Kurt Karl , chief economist at Swiss Re , is also looking for another half - point cut by the end of the year .
" In aggressively cutting rates , the Fed is signaling its willingness to do what it takes to stabilize financial markets , " he said .
But other economists expressed fears that the Fed has already left itself with limited ability to respond to future problems by taking rates this low .
" Now they 're running low on ammunition , " said Rich Yamarone , director of economic research at Argus Research .
" They look like Barney Fife with one bullet left .
That 's not too encouraging . "
Other economists agreed , saying they believe Fed policymakers would prefer to not cut rates below 1 % .
" I do n't think there 's anything to prohibit them from going under 1 % , but there also is probably not a great deal of urgency on their part to bring rates lower , " said Keith Hembre , chief economist First American Funds .
One economist questioned whether rate cuts really can make much difference since the current credit crunch is limiting the availability of funding .
The problem is n't that loans are expensive .
Banks are simply unwilling to lend .
" The latest Fed move is not going to hasten the economic recovery by a single day or accelerate the cleansing of bank balance sheets , " said Bernard Baumohl , executive director of The Economic Outlook Group .
" What is needed more than anything else at this stage is simply patience . "
The Fed 's previous cut was an emergency half - point reduction on Oct.
8 . Six other central banks around the globe also lowered rates that day in a coordinated move .
The European Central Bank and the Bank of England are scheduled to meet next on Nov. 6 .
Those central banks have significantly higher benchmark rates , with the ECB now at 3.75 % and the Bank of England at 4.5 % .
While rate cuts are traditionally the key tool the Fed uses to stimulate the U.S. economy , it has had to take other steps to address the current credit crisis .
The Fed has loaned hundreds of billions of dollars to banks through a new lending facility and is starting to loan money directly to major businesses by purchasing commercial paper , which is what some banks and businesses use as their primary method to fund day to day operations .

Does the McCain camp have enough left to win the election ?
How McCain could pull this one off
Can John McCain possibly win this thing ?
Can he actually win in November ?
The outlook is bleak :
The polls are ugly , the Electoral College map is grim , the economy is getting worse , and McCain ’s choice of Sarah Palin may have energized the Republican base , but it has appalled and frightened many outside it .
Advertisement
Still , McCain ’s campaign has come back from the dead more than once .
He survived his early support for immigration reform , he not only survived but has prospered from his support for the Iraq war surge , and he rebuilt a primary campaign that was in a state of near collapse to win the Republican nomination .
But can McCain do it again ?
Can he come back ?
And if so , how ?
What does he have to do between now and Election Day , and what does he have to do in Tuesday ’s second presidential debate in Nashville ?
In a column in mid-September , I assembled a panel of Democratic experts and asked them if Barack Obama could manage to lose .
( General conclusion : Yes , but he probably wo n’t . )
Today , I have assembled a panel of Republican experts and asked them if McCain can manage to win .
Ken Duberstein was Ronald Reagan ’s chief of staff from 1988 to 1989 and was deputy undersecretary of labor for Gerald Ford .
Duberstein is very well - connected within the Republican Party .
“ I think it is uphill for McCain , but a victory is doable , ” Duberstein said .
“ He needs , obviously , to raise questions about Obama , but he also needs to reassure the American people — and not simply the base — that he has a plan to get us out of this economic mess and restore America ’s stature throughout the world .
“ He needs to spell out not why he is a maverick but what he will do to lead :
What are the specifics ?
What is the strategy ?
He needs three yards and a cloud of dust , and not a Hail Mary strategy .
He needs to do what John McCain does best , which is explain to the people where John McCain wants to take the country .
“ There are a hundred lifetimes yet ahead in this campaign , starting with the debate Tuesday night .
This is an election about big issues and big ideas , and this is not the time to play small ball .
We are well past this stage .
To many Americans , earmarks are a facial blemish .
He has to talk about spending , not just earmarks , not just about a bridge to nowhere and about bears ’
DNA .
“ How is McCain going to oversee our financial institutions ?
How is he going to get unemployment down and jobs created ?
How is he going to find success in Iraq and progress in Afghanistan ?
How is he going to deal with big issues like nuclear proliferation ?
On Tuesday night , he has to demonstrate a broad vision , a big vision , and not just stuff that happens inside the Beltway . ”
Greg Mueller was a senior adviser to Pat Buchanan and Steve Forbes in their presidential campaigns and is an expert on conservative politics .
“ McCain can definitely win the race , ” Mueller said .
“ McCain needs to change the discussion back to a referendum on Obama .
He needs to define Obama ’s agenda as dangerous to America .
“ It is dangerous to the economy .
Obama is calling for higher taxes , historical spending and a huge increase in regulation that will hamper American business .
Contrast that with McCain ’s message of lower taxes and freezing spending .
On foreign policy and national security , Obama is a risky bet in a hostile world .
“ McCain needs to keep banging those themes over and over again , so on Election Day voters think Obama is just not ready for this .
The McCain campaign needs to feed the doubt people have about Barack Obama .
There is a lot of doubt out there .
I do n’t care what the polls say .
“ The Supreme Court issue can be extremely powerful for McCain .
Obama is basically for using the court for social engineering .
This is key for Reagan Democrats in key swing states .
Catholics respond very well to the Supreme Court issue .
McCain and Palin have got to get on that .
“ I think during the Tuesday night debate , McCain can do two things :
One , McCain ca n’t be afraid to go right at Obama , define his economic policies as dangerous to our economy .
Two , he has to talk about the Supreme Court .
Obama will be the ultimate judicial activist advocate as president , using the courts for social engineering projects .
Once the American people focus , McCain can win on this issue .
It is an issue that attracts independent voters and Catholic Democrats .
“ Every election goes in peaks and valleys in the polls .
I am increasingly looking at the ground game .
Hollywood stars are out there registering voters .
The underlying problem of McCain ’s campaign is grass - roots action and activity .
My fear there is that Obama is ahead in that . ”
Whit Ayres is a pollster and consultant who worked on Lamar Alexander ’s 1996 presidential campaign and in numerous Senate and gubernatorial races .
He is an expert on Southern politics .
“ Anybody who is talking about a race being over a month out has not been participating in very many campaigns , ” Ayres said .
“ Of course McCain can win it .
Of course he can .
“ He needs to broaden the discussion to dimensions that voters consistently see as relevant to their presidential choice .
Voters vote on issues , particularly on the economy , but they also vote on character , leadership , values and ideology .
And quite rightly so .
A president for the next four years will be dealing with a whole host of issues beyond the economy , and how he deals with those issues is very relevant to the discussion .
“ The Obama - Biden ticket is the most liberal ticket the Democrats have offered America since George McGovern in 1972 .
Barack Obama is far more liberal than most Americans .
Moreover , a politician ’s associations are a window into his values .
If John McCain liked to hang around with the Ku Klux Klan , and if his church had given a lifetime achievement award to racist David Duke , all of us would consider those legitimate areas of inquiry .
“ Debates can make a difference .
They are not traditionally game - changers , but they can be very important events in the reframing of choices .
The debates are an opportunity for McCain to reframe the choice in broader terms than just the economy : the Supreme Court , leadership , national security , values , ideology , culture .
“ On leadership , values , culture and ideology , John McCain is far closer to most Americans than Barack Obama .
“ The $ 64,000 question in this election is whether the number of new registrants — younger people and African - Americans — is greater , the same or less than blue - collar whites and white seniors who are not going to vote for Barack Obama .
And we are not going to know the answer to that until Nov. 4 . ”

“ Sexpert ! ” I cry from the rearmost seat of our work shuttle .
“ Sexpert ! Sexpert !
Read the Sexpert out loud ! ”
My Bengali-American colleague obliges .
Answers from the Sexpert , one Dr. Mahinder Watsa , crack him up just as much as me .
“ Dear Sexpert , ” my colleague intones earnestly , “ What is ‘ G - Spot ’ ?
Where is it located ?
How can it be identified ?
What role does it play in sex and pregnancy ?
Please guide me . ”
“ The G - spot , ” he continues in a more serious voice , “ is a small annular area , located behind the urethral opening on the anterior surface of the vagina .
It is said to be a secondary erogenous ( primary bring the clitoris ) area which helps a woman reach orgasm . ”
He pauses .
We ’re waiting for the kicker .
“ It does n’t play any part in pregnancy .
It ’s best not to bother about it . ”
With that last sentence hanging in the air , the whole shuttle cracks up .
As we speed through the shabby - chic neighborhoods of Mahim , Dadar , and Worli , toward our office in the center of Mumbai , another day of stamping papers and deciphering broken English does n’t seem quite so grim .
* * *
Living in Mumbai , a self - proclaimed “ Maximum City ” with 14 million inhabitants and just as many motorcycles , scooters , cars , and ox -carts , it ’s important to keep yourself sane .
Some of my expat friends make a weekly ritual of luxury hotel brunches — rotating in a precise order between the Marriott , the Hyatt , the Taj , and the Oberoi .
Two of my colleagues — 30 - something men— took up horseback riding at the Mahalaxmi racetrack .
My boss works on his Scotch collection .
As for me , my saving grace is reading the Mumbai Mirror ’s daily “ Ask the Sexpert ” column .
More than obscenely cheap generic pharmaceuticals or thrice - weekly maid visits at the tune of $ 1.50 / hour , it ’s the column that makes living here worthwhile .
“ I recently shared a rickshaw with a lady who tried to arouse me .
I understood her plan and decided to stay away .
But my elbow happened to touch her breasts .
Will it cause AIDS ? ” There ’s something about the questions posed to “ Sexpert ” Dr. Mahinder Watsa :
They ’re a mix of extreme naïveté , standard and not - so - standard fetishes , and many pregnancy scares .
The doctor ’s responses are practical and terse to the point of catatonic .
G - spots ?
Who needs them ?
Unlike Dan Savage , of “ Savage Love , ” this sex columnist does n’t select his questions for shock value .
Rather , he seems to publish whatever he gets , and , as a result , you get a pretty accurate look into the sex lives of Indians — Indians who seem mostly concerned with broken hymens , frequency of masturbation , early ejaculation , and penises shaped like “ crooked banana[s ] . ”
Editors everywhere shudder when a writer says India is a land of contrasts and contradictions , but , dammit , it ’s true !
There really are legless , homeless beggars sleeping on the street in front of the Rolls Royce dealership .
And Indians do have bipolar attitudes toward sex .
On the one hand , India is seriously erotic , the hot and humid home to X - rated temple carvings , the Kama Sutra , and Bollywood soaking - wet - sari scenes .
Modern - day India , though , is also culturally conservative ( code for no sex before marriage , after marriage , outside of marriage , with members of the same sex , and certainly not involving freaky porn or rubber suits ) .
Of course , that does n’t mean Indians are n’t doing all of those things .
It just means it ’s not the ideal .
And so steps in the Sexpert , here to reconcile these apparent contradictions , three to four questions per day .
* * *
I am a 24 - year - old Army cadet .
When I am alone with my girlfriend , I often get excited and get an erection .
I do not want to have sex with her before marriage .
My friend suggests I take anti-sex tablets .
Which ones should I take ?
You are doing exactly what nature wants you to do when you are sexually excited .
Please do not take any medicines .
You can be firm not to have intercourse and can stop at petting .
Your thinking is correct .
Far from anti-sex himself , the Sexpert seems reconciled to the fact that 50 percent or so of his correspondents are unmarried .
While sex is ideally saved for marriage , there is an alternative magic number : 21 .
Sex before that is “ incorrect behavior [ that ] will affect your future . ”
Odd behavior seems to transcend age : Cross - dressing husbands get a pass — after all , “ Women are wearing pants these days , so why stop him ? ” — as do people who like to bring vegetables ( “ smooth and washed thoroughly ” ) into bed .
Anal sex , however , is completely off - limits .
An expert not only on sex but on dodging the question , Dr. Watsa “ cannot advise you on anal sex since it is illegal in India . ”
It seems to me that the crux of his column is the contrast between unwarranted concern and lack of concern when warranted .
An ad for emergency contraception pills on the back of my in - flight magazine declares , “ When your lust of love does n’t allow anything to come in between …
Do n’t compromise with your feelings & excitement because they do n’t wait for anything …
Why should you ?
Live that moment up to the max . ”
So a pill that ’s meant in the U.S. to counteract broken condoms and bad decision - making is something else in India entirely , STDs be damned .
And that ’s “ STDs be damned ” in a country where the HIV infection rate stands at 2.4 million people and rising .
On the other hand , there ’s still good , old - fashioned , early - 1990s - style paranoia .
Correspondents write in sharing their fears of catching diseases from toilet seats , shared drinking glasses , and French kisses .
One particularly concerned fellow wrote in to say , “ I recently shared a rickshaw with a lady who tried to arouse me .
I understood her plan and decided to stay away .
But my elbow happened to touch her breasts .
Will it cause AIDS ? ”
The Sexpert wo n’t take the bait : “ Congratulations on not being enticed .
There is absolutely no way you could have caught an infection of any kind , including AIDS .
Looking forward to your rational thinking in the future . ”
The paranoia extends to conception , as does the laissez - faire attitude .
A teenager writes in with an account of how he ejaculated on his girlfriend ’s foot .
“ Later , she washed her foot ensuring the semen does n’t touch her vagina .
However , I am very scared .
Can she get pregnant ?
If yes , what ’s the procedure to solve the problem ? ”
Have no fear , the doctor reassures the teen , while “ ejaculation near or around the vagina has at times resulted in a pregnancy … fortunately the foot does not have the power of the vagina ! ”
Fortunately , indeed !
Another correspondent has “ heard sperms swim rapidly , ” and so writes in : “ Recently , I had a nightfall [ i.e. , nocturnal emission —ed . ] which smeared my undergarments and I washed them .
However , my pants smelled of semen as well and I was wearing the same unwashed pants later when my cousin - sister slipped and fell on my lap .
Are there chances of her getting pregnant ? ”
To the Sexpert ’s credit , the answer is a firm no .
On the other hand , non-married couples also write in to ask if sex twice a day , for five months , without a condom , might possibly be a bad idea .
And the Sexpert ’s own faith in the rhythm method can only rival that of the Pope and a select few pontiffs .
The one topic the Sexpert steers well clear of is homosexuality , which is still very much illegal under Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code , prohibiting sexual acts “ against the order of nature . ”
The law is a holdover from British rule , and while the U.K. has gone on to embrace gayness in all forms , India is a little less open .
There have been some recent chinks in the armor — a gay pride march a few months ago in New Delhi and other major cities , a gay Gujarati prince , some female cops shacking up without shame in Madhya Pradesh — but there ’s still a long way to go .
And reassuring a panicked call center employee who has “ heard from many people that if I sit and work in front of a computer , I ’ll become a homosexual , ” that “ looking at the screen of the computer can in no way turn you into a homosexual , ” is about as far as the Sexpert will go .
“ Ejaculation near or around the vagina has at times resulted in a pregnancy .
Fortunately the foot does not have the power of the vagina !
” It will be interesting to see how long the Sexpert can hold out , bridging India ’s sexual ideal to the reality of being a modern - day teenager on the subcontinent .
Sex in India is changing .
The very same Mumbai Mirror that runs the Sexpert ’s column has featured over the past year articles about the custody of a Japanese baby born to an Indian surrogate mother , an Indian couple ’s national fight to get a late - term abortion , and the mysterious — or not so mysterious — skewed sex ratios in rural Rajasthan .
One billion people do n’t come out of nowhere .
As long as Indians are procreating , Dr. Watsa will have a steady source of questions for his column .
And I ’ll have the perfect reading for my 10 a.m. chai break ; something funny , important , and down - to - earth to keep me sane in a city with $ 1 billion single - family homes , 25 - cent rickshaw rides , quadrilingual newspapers , the occasional religious riot , and mutton biryani that ca n’t be beat .

Here some examples :
After arriving on Capitol Hill nearly 24 hours after his announcement , McCain huddled with three of his closest political allies : fellow senators Lindsey Graham , Joe Lieberman and Jon Kyl .
Later that day at a White House meeting convened by Bush and also attended by Congressional leaders of both parties as well as both candidates , McCain said almost nothing , even when House Republicans declared that they were not yet willing to sign onto the administration ’s $ 700 billion proposal .
Despite the fact that the deal maker had produced no deal , McCain announced the next day that his campaign would resume  “ optimistic that there has been significant progress towards a bipartisan agreement , ” as a campaign statement put it  and traveled to Mississippi that Friday afternoon to debate Obama .
On Sunday morning , Schmidt went on “ Meet the Press ” to insist that his boss ’s foray had been crucial in bringing “ all of the parties to the table , ” with the result that “ there appears to be a framework completed . ”
The next day  Monday , Sept. 29 , the day by which Schmidt had earlier warned the crisis “ has to be solved ”  the House Republicans played the key role in defeating the bailout legislation .
Scene by scene , McCain failed to deliver the performance that had been promised .
Of course , this was no mere movie .
America was in crisis .
Perhaps with the Bush theory in mind , Steve Schmidt had advised McCain to “ go in all the way ” on the financial crisis so as to reveal his candidate ’s true character .
But given a chance to show what kind of president he might be , McCain came off more like a stymied bystander than a leader who could make a difference .
Judging by the polls , the McCain campaign has yet to recover .
In reporting on the campaign ’s vicissitudes , I spoke with a half - dozen of McCain ’s senior - most advisers  most of them more than once and some of them repeatedly  over a period that began in early August .
I spoke as well to several other midlevel advisers and to a number of former senior aides .
Virtually all of these individuals had spoken with me for previous articles concerning McCain .
Their insights and recollections enabled me to piece together conversations and events .
My repeated requests to interview McCain and his running mate , Sarah Palin , were denied , and with only a couple of exceptions those who spoke to me did so with the stipulation that most or all of their comments not be attributed to them .
Despite their leeriness of being quoted , McCain ’s senior advisers remained palpably confident of victory  at least until very recently .
By October , the succession of backfiring narratives would compel some to reappraise not only McCain ’s chances but also the decisions made by Schmidt , who only a short time ago was hailed as the savior who brought discipline and unrepentant toughness to a listing campaign .
“ For better or for worse , our campaign has been fought from tactic to tactic , ” one senior adviser glumly acknowledged to me in early October , just after Schmidt received authorization from McCain to unleash a new wave of ads attacking Obama ’s character .
“ So this is the new tactic . ”
NARRATIVE 1 :
The Heroic Fighter vs. the Quitters
Steve Schmidt is 38 , bald and brawny , with a nasal , deadpan voice and a relentless stare .
He is also a devoted husband and father of two young children , introspective and boyishly vulnerable for someone of such imposing stature .
On mornings , he can be seen standing outside the McCain campaign headquarters in Arlington , Va. , smoking a cigarette while he scowls at his BlackBerry .
After campaign events in the evening , he often hangs out at a hotel bar drinking beer with fellow campaign workers and members of the media .
Whenever possible , he flies back to California to spend the weekend with his family .
He is not a hothead and tends to hesitate for several beats before offering a well - tailored , often wry answer to a question .
Though commonly described in the press as a Karl Rove protégé , Schmidt was a Republican operative for a dozen years before he ever worked for Rove .
When Bush returned to the White House , Schmidt was not among those from the 2004 re-election effort who were rewarded with plum jobs , despite his well - regarded work overseeing the campaign ’s rapid - response unit .
After spending the first half of 2005 heading up the press office for Vice President Dick Cheney , Schmidt was sent to Baghdad to improve the administration ’s anemic communications strategy in Iraq .
He also orchestrated the Senate confirmation hearings of the Supreme Court nominees John Roberts and Samuel Alito and their presentation to the outside world .
Along the way , Schmidt never really developed the personal relationship with Bush that would have enabled him to advance in accordance with his talents .
In early 2006 , when an opportunity came to jump ship , Schmidt took it , departing the Bush administration to spearhead the successful re-election campaign of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in California .
He still lives outside Sacramento , far from Washington .
Though Schmidt often brandishes his geographical remove from the Beltway and his lack of interest in another White House job as proof of his equanimity , you get the sense that a McCain victory would bring him no small measure of personal vindication .
For a man who seems to relish Rove - like alley fighting , Schmidt is not an ideologue and claims he harbors no ambition of delivering the Republican Party to a state of lasting supremacy .
He also displays great nuance in office politics .
Until Schmidt consolidated his power this summer , McCain , it ’s fair to say , was not a big believer in organization .
The important decisions were all made by him , with various confidants of ambiguous portfolio orbiting around him and often colliding with one another ( and often staying in the picture well after their departure  as was the case of Mike Murphy , a strategist from the 2000 campaign , who remained close enough to McCain that rumors of his return persisted until fairly recently ) .
A year earlier , in the summer of 2007 , the McCain campaign all but collapsed under the weight of financial woes , vicious infighting and the conservative base ’s fury over his moderate stance on immigration .
Among the senior staff members who walked out were McCain ’s longtime political guru John Weaver and several alumni of the well - oiled 2004 Bush campaign .
Schmidt  who until that point was not particularly influential  decided to stick around , even without pay .
He began to earn McCain ’s trust while also befriending the senator ’s two closest advisers , who happened not to care for each other .

Bernadette Geller
Get arrested for civil disobedience 7th of August 2008
Get arrested for civil disobedience
I met Bernadette Geller , a former nun who has been arrested more than twenty times for civil disobedience in Baltimore train station .
Her neice had introduced us and she was happy to spend a few hours with me talking about some of the most remarkable turns in her life .
Below is a transcript of some of the conversation we had .
After a year of delay by my family ( they thought that number one I was too young and number two I was such a hell raiser that they were sure that the convent would throw me out )
I entered the convent when I was nineteen .
When you ’re training to be a nun they just use you to do the housework , so , we were doing the washing or the vacuuming or whatever , but I ’d already have young people responding to me in my little grey habit .
I ’d think “ Oh my God , this is so good .
I ’m God ’s instrument now . ”
I ’d get all caught up in this “ It ’s so wonderful that I had this calling . ”
I just loved that thought of being an American missionary .
I did n’t want to do foreign stuff but this community of nuns did parish social work and were always forming lay apostle groups .
My first mission as a nun was as a teacher .
I taught school in Phoenix City , Alabama .
Reverend mother came for a visit and told me that she thought I would be good working with families .
So that ’s when she assigned me to Catholic Charities in the diocese of Greensburg in Western Pennsylvania .
And I was there for three years , and then I was moved to the diocese of Trenton which had me in Red Bank , New Jersey .
And I was there for three years .
By then I was getting more awakened to the need for professionally trained social workers .
I was becoming more critical of the fact that the superiors in the house did n’t have Masters .
They were making decisions about adoptive homes and where babies went .
One of the families that I served were so happy to tell me they named their adopted baby after me , but I could see that the child was severely retarded and they did n’t seem to know that or have any information about that .
So I started to question it , challenge it , feel I had to advocate on behalf of the couple .
The nun who did the placement was telling me I was n’t to say anything and I just thought that that was too unfair to them .
So I called the couple and said “ I want you take that child to a paediatrician immediately and have her tested , and I think that if they were n’t honest with you you need to think about returning her . ”
And that then of course started a level of trouble that had my superior report me to the mother house .
Tough times .
I remember the reverend mother saying to me “ Fr Judge ( who was the founder of our order ) , would be very proud of you , but we ca n’t have you rocking the boat . ”
I began to try and organise the nuns and I started to have meetings to try and see if the other social workers , sisters , had the same concerns and I guess some of them also reported that .
So the next thing I know is that I was on punishment mission to Philadelphia .
It ’s a big huge agency there , Catholic Charities .
We had a visitation from the same reverend mother that had shipped me there .
I said to her , “ Hey I ca n’t go on anymore without my degree , I need to get my masters ” , and she said to me , “ Well sister if I let you go for your masters will you promise to be humble ” .
And I said to her , “ You could send me to plumbing school and I ca n’t guarantee you that ” .
I had heard that the Penn School of social work had the “ Functional Approach ” that was a very different experience .
So I said I wanted that , and they said “ we ’ve never let a nun go ” and so I said “ Whatever you need to do , let ’s do it ” .
So they had to write to the vicar for religious , I had to be interviewed that I ’d still be good and holy and whatever , and I got to go to the Penn School of social work .
After I finished school and I was just kind of coming to grips with what my degree meant and what the whole place of racism meant , they ended up making me the chair of a task force on institutional racism .
So we started to do some very radical things about institutional racism .
On my own then I joined a group called Resist and I think I was really on a big roll , I did the Poor People ’s March .
I look back at my 1970 calendar and my God , I was at the Black Panthers , I was with the Resist group , I was all over , plus I was in Catholic Peace Fellowship and then we formed a social action group .
I mean I was in everything .
I was supervising staff , very nice young people , and I got them to do a questionnaire on institutional racism .
They were starting to learn to question .
I was doing draft sit-ins .
I ’d been to the communities council to say “ We ’ve got to live more poorly .
We ’re not living poorly enough .
We ’re not doing enough about the racism in the church ” and they ’re all saying to me , “ Oh well , you know , you know , yes we believe these things but .. ” .
All of it conspired to have the diocese decide that they needed to get rid of me .
I did n’t really know it , but I could tell things were not , you know .
I was n’t sleeping at night , and I realised I was getting into a clinical depression .
I ’m living with forty women , everybody kind of knows I ’m going to be let go and nobody has said it to me .
Finally one said , “ Reverend mother ’s been down here talking to the bishop , they ’re going to move you .
You ’re going to be put out of here ” .
So , I went up and I said “ I ’m hearing that I ’m being sent , and I cannot , this is my holy place , I cannot leave Philadelphia ” , and she said “ Well what can I tell you ?
They want you out ” .
I said “ They need n’t tell me they need me out .
You do n’t have to support them . ”
Then the Monsignor called me into his office and said “ Catholic Charities will do very well without Sister Bernadette Cronin ” , and I remember thinking , he could n’t even say “ you ” .
So , my peace friends all wanted to march around the building and protest , but believe me , I was on Valium barely keeping my head up , you know after 16 years in religious community .
So I was fired in July of 70 , but the reverend mother said that if I could find a job , I could stay in the convent .
With the help of a couple of friends , I got to write a resume and go for job interviews .
I was hired by the Children ’s Hospital .
I would leave the convent in the morning and go to work and no depression , happy , really glad , loved the place , come back home at night , feel down .
I had a cross that said , “ Even Unto Death ” on the back because that ’s the words of your vows “ I take them even unto death ” and one day I looked at it and said , “ I guess God there ’s more than one kind of death and I do n’t think this is where I need to be anymore . ”
I wrote my letter and I still remember the opening , “ I wish to be a minister of the word with optional celibacy and since you do n’t offer that to the men of your church I ’m sure you wo n’t offer it to the women of your church . ”
I remember the superior saying to me , “ Well you know what , you never bought the structures of religious life Sister ” , and I said to her , “ See how little you knew , I bought them lock , stock and barrel .
I believe we are supposed to live the Gospel and you know it just did n’t feel like it happened here . ”
So , I left the convent .
I started getting arrested for civil disobedience when I turned fifty .
It was like “ Hey , if I do n’t stand up and get counted now , by putting my body on the line , when will I ? ” .
In 1976 my soon - to - be - husband ( Bernadette married Laur Geller a Jewish Journalist in 1979 ) and I came upon the Brandywine Peace Community , when they were just forming and we ’ve stayed with them .
They ’re the ones that I do my actions with .
Civil disobedience on Martin Luther King Juniors day , Good Friday , and Hiroshima day .
Those are the days that we walk on the property of Lockheed Martin at King of Prussia and say “ Stop making nuclear arms ” , and they arrest us every time and just process us for walking on property .
They try to fine us and I say that I do n’t care if they put me in jail or not I ’m not going to pay the fine , and sometimes in that local place they just give you community service to do .
It was the Brandywine Peace Community that also formed the Iraq Pledge to Resistance , and I signed on that .
So I was one of 107 that got arrested at the Federal Building in Philadelphia the day the Iraq war started .
Subsequently , I did end up seven days in a federal detention centre .
And I made the most of that , you know it was like , “ Make believe it ’s Cape May ” .
You ’ve got to stand up and do what you do , and be faithful to it , and it was amazing to me that it was so easy to do that .
I was with good folks and our spirit was great .
I think I came to really understand that we were the freest in there ; out here we are all captives of the systems that oppress us .
The first time I got arrested in 72 when I was with my Laur , and they arrested me and they put me in jail it was like I could n’t take it and I had to knock on the jail and say “ get Laurence Geller and pay my fine ” .
So I now know I ’m braver and stronger and I have less to lose .
I stayed in social work , working mainly for the City of Philadelphia until I retired in the October of 2000 and after essentially forty plus years in the field .
I just noticed that I ’m a good goodbyer .
That ’s to say I could leave religious life and not look back and I could leave social work and not look back and what I have taken to now is teaching in an adult ed programme .
Now I say , “ I teach , I exercise and I get arrested ” .
You know that ’s kind of like what my life ’s come down to .
I do n’t have work to worry about .
I do n’t have other people that I have to worry about their health all the time , like my own children or grand children .
I love that my free time now allows me a lot more prayer time .
I find the more that I try to be centered in prayer the more I feel called to contribute to the healing of humanity .
I need a strong faith - base from which to do my actions .
I do it from a biblical basis , the bible says “ serve the poor ” over forty times .
It does n’t talk about abortion , or it does n’t talk about homosexuality , it talks about serving the poor .
So my sense is that every action I do is my effort to move to make the world a more equal place .
Laur and I , every other week , stand on a corner in Philadelphia with our sign that says “ Get out of Iraq ! ” and before that we called ourselves Jews for Justice , and I ’m fifty percent of Jews for Justice , where we said “ Get out of occupied Palestine ” because we feel strongly about that whole issue .
We ’re a couple that prays every day together , that our lives continue to contribute to the healing of humanity and we know that that includes that we be joyful people that we be happy people .
We do n’t pray in order to protest , we protest in order to pray .
I want the luxury of prayer and play and drink and laughter for everybody and somehow the world has not been evenly distributed and we need to keep working to having that happen .
About ten years ago my therapist helped me see that I really was not basically an activist , I was really a contemplative , so now I ’m back to daily mass and that ’s been a lot of years , enough for my husband to say , “ Jeez why do n’t you become a nun ? ” , and I say “ Oh well that was n’t helping me be holy Laur , you ’re helping me be holy , you ’re better at that . ”
Shao Yung Yeh , a 22 - year - old Taiwanese design student at Cheng Kung University created the aptly named single - seat Insecta Concept ( yes , you heard that right — an InsectaCon cept — nice Transformers reference , eh ? ) after being inspired by a grasshopper .
With leg - like suspension arms that can raise and lower depending upon traffic and road conditions , the Insecta is Shao 's interpretation of a personal - mobility city car .
The concept is theoretically powered by a motor at each wheel while the battery pack sits in the car 's abdomen and is able to adjust the car 's center of gravity , ostensibly by moving fore and aft .
We hope it also controls the car 's air conditioning , as the Insecta reminds us of nothing more than a greenhouse on four wheels .

Demand Labeling of Gene - Altered Food !
by : Consumers Union
recipient : U.S. Food and Drug Administration
Goats that produce spider silk in their milk .
Pigs with mouse DNA to improve their digestion .
These animals are n't freaks of nature – they 're created by man through genetic engineering .
The jury is still out on the safety of these animals for human consumption , as the appropriate studies have yet to be conducted .
And the ethics of such changes have not even been considered .
But the Food and Drug Administration wants to let the meat and milk from these animals to be sold to you without your knowledge !
Sign our petition to the FDA demanding the agency label genetically engineered food .
We should know what we 're buying and eating – and have the right to say " no " to gene - altered food .
read petition letter ▾
For example , goats have been engineered with spider genes to produce spider silk in their milk .
And pigs have been engineered with mouse and bacterial DNA to improve the way they metabolize their feed .
These animals are obviously different than their counterparts that have not had their genes altered .
Not only should the milk and meat from these animals be studied to determine if they are safe , they should be labeled so we know exactly what we are buying .
FDA requires the label on a soup can indicate the ham , chicken and different vegetables it contains .
Food must be labeled if it is frozen , pasteurized or comes from concentrate .
Likewise , even if it is safe , meat or milk from genetically engineered animals also should have to carry a label .
These are facts that I want to know .
I urge you to revise your Draft Guidance for Industry on Regulation of Genetically Engineered Animals to require labeling of food products from all genetically engineered animals .
I am deeply concerned that the Food and Drug Administration has issued Draft Guidance that will allow meat and milk from genetically engineered animals into the food supply without any way for me to know whether I 'm buying or eating such food .
Genetically engineered animals can pose health risks , which is why the FDA is proposing to conduct a full safety assessment for milk and meat from these animals .
If these foods need to be assessed for their safety , why would the FDA allow them to be sold without labels identifying them as such ?

The McCain campaign likes to have an enemy to fight ( and blame things on ) , and the latest bogeyman is ACORN ( Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now ) .
First they attacked ACORN for alleged voter registration fraud .
A Republican National Committee spokesman called ACORN a “ quasi- criminal group ” .
They even compared ACORN to the KKK .
But the nastiest attack was a TV ad that blamed ACORN for the mortgage crisis .
So what makes this all ironic ( and pretty funny ) is that in 2006 , McCain himself was best friends with ACORN .
Rather than trying to defend itself against the attacks , ACORN released a photo of McCain giving the keynote speech at at an ACORN - sponsored rally in Florida , telling the participants that they “ are what makes America special . ”
Watch it yourself ( at 1:53 ) :
ACORN ’s chief organizer released a statement saying :
It has deeply saddened us to see Senator McCain abandon his historic support for ACORN and our efforts to support the goals of low - income Americans .
Maybe it is out of desperation that Senator McCain has forgotten that he was for ACORN before he was against ACORN ; he was for immigration reform before he was against immigration reform ; and he was a maverick before he became erratic .
We were thrilled to partner with him to help reform the outdated immigration laws in this country , and were pleased to work closely with him on this issue .
So in attacking ACORN , all McCain as succeeded in doing is bringing attention to his former position on immigration reform , which is none too popular with the conservative base .
McCain himself said he opposed his own immigration reform bill — once he started running for president and decided he needed those conservative votes .
McCain ’s erratic and shifting positions have managed to anger both liberals and conservatives .

The Sufi Tradition
Interview with Idries Shah - by Elizabeth Hall
EH : Idries Shah , you are the West 's leading exponent of Sufism , that rich religious tradition growing out of the Middle East .
Why , at a time when new cults are springing up , do you refuse to be a guru ?
You could easily become one .
IS : There are a lot of reasons .
But if we are talking about the teacher who has disciples , it 's because I feel no need for an admiring audience to tell me how wonderful I am or to do what I say .
I believe that the guru needs his disciples .
If he had a sufficient outlet for his desire to be a big shot or his feeling of holiness or his wish to have others dependent on him , he would n't be a guru .
I got all that out of my system very early and , consistent with Sufi tradition , I believe that those who do n't want to teach are the ones who can and should .
The West still has a vocation hang - up and has not yet discovered this .
Here , the only recognized achiever is an obsessive .
In the East we believe that a person who can't help doing a thing is n't necessarily the best one to do it .
A compulsive cookie baker may bake very bad cookies .
EH : Are you saying that a person who feels that he must engage in a certain profession is doing it because of some emotional need ?
IS : I think this is very often the case , and it does n't necessarily produce the best professional .
Show an ordinary person an obsessive and he will believe you have shown him a dedicated and wonderful person - provided he share his beliefs .
If he does n't , of course , he regards the one obsessed as evil .
Sufism regards this as a facile and untrue posture .
And if there is one consistency in the Sufi tradition , it is that man must be in the world but not of the world .
There is no role for a priest - king or guru .
EH : Then you have a negative opinion of all gurus .
IS : Not of all .
Their followers need the guru as much as the guru needs his followers .
I just do n't regard it as a religious operation .
I take a guru to be a sort of psychotherapist .
At the very best , he keeps people quiet and polarized around him and gives some sort of meaning to their lives .
EH : Librium might do the same thing .
IS : Yes , but that 's no reason to be against it .
Why should n't there be room for what we might call " neighborhood psychotherapy " - the community looking after its own ?
However , why it should be called a spiritual activity rather baffles me .
EH : One can't help getting the feeling that not all gurus are trying to serve their fellowman .
IS : Some are frankly phonies , and they do n't try to hide it from me .
They think that I am one , too , so when we meet they begin the most disturbing conversations .
They want to know how I get money , how I control people , and so on .
EH : They want to swap secrets .
IS : That 's going a little too far .
But they feel safety in numbers .
They actually feel there is something wrong with what they are doing , and they feel better if they talk to somebody else who is doing it .
I always tell them that I think it would be much better if they gave up the guru role in their own minds and realize that they are providing a perfectly good social service .
EH : How do they take to that advice ?
IS : Sometimes they laugh and sometimes they cry .
The general impression is that one of us is wrong .
Because I do n't make the same kind of noises that they do , they seem to believe that either I am a lunatic or that I am starting some new kind of con .
Perhaps I have found a new racket .
EH : I am surprised that these gurus tell you all their secrets as freely as they do .
IS : I must tell you that I have not renounced the Eastern technique of pretending to be interested in what another person is saying , even pretending to be on his side .
Therefore , I am able to draw out gurus and get them to commit themselves to an extent that a Westerner , because of his conscience , could not do .
The Westerner would not allow certain things to go unchallenged and would not trick , as it were , another person .
So he does n't find out the truth .
Look here , it 's time that somebody took the lid off the guru racket .
Since I have nothing to lose , it might as well be me .
With many of these gurus it comes down to an " us and them " sort of thing between the East and the West .
Gurus from India used to stop by on their way to California and their attitude was generally , let 's take the Westerners to the cleaners ; they colonized us , now we will get money out of them .
I heard this sort of thing even from people who had impeccable spiritual reputations back home in India .
EH : It is an understandable human reaction to centuries of Western exploitation .
IS : It 's understandable , but I deny that it 's a spiritual activity .
What I want to say is , " Brother , you are in the revenge business , and that 's a different kind of business from me . "
There are always groups that are willing to negotiate with me and want to use my name .
On one occasion a chap in a black shirt and white tie told me , " You take Britain , but do n't touch the United States , because that 's ours . "
I had a terrible vision of Al Capone .
The difference was that the guru 's disciples kissed his feet .
SEE WHAT I MEAN ?
Nasrudin was throwing handfuls of crumbs around his house .
" What are you doing ? " someone asked him .
" Keeping the tigers away . "
" But there are no tigers in these parts . "
" That 's right .
Effective , is n't it ?
EH : Gurus keep proliferating in the United States , always with massive followings .
A 15 - year - old Perfect Master can fill the Astrodome .
IS : Getting the masses is the easy part .
A guru can attract a crowd of a million in India , but few in a crowd take him seriously .
You see , India has had gurus for thousands of years , so they are generally sophisticated about them ; they take in the attitude with their mothers ' milk .
This culture just has n't been inoculated against the guru .
Let 's turn it around .
If I were fresh off a plane from India and told you that I was going to Detroit to become a wonderful automobile millionaire , you would smile at me .
You know perfectly well the obstacles , the taxes , the ulcers that I face .
Well , the Indian is in the same position with the automobile industry as the American with the guru .
I 'm not impressed by naive American reactions to gurus ; if you can show me a guru who can pull off that racket in the East , then I will be surprised .
EH : Before we go any farther , we 'd better get down to basics and ask the obvious question .
What is Sufism ?
IS : The most obvious question of all is for us the most difficult question .
But I 'll try to answer .
Sufism is experience of life through a method of dealing with life and human relations .
This method is based on an understanding of man , which places at one 's disposal the means to organize one 's relationships and one 's learning systems .
So instead of saying that Sufism is a body of thought in which you believe certain things and do n't believe other things , we say that the Sufi experience has to be provoked in a person .
Once provoked , it becomes his own property , rather as a person masters an art .
EH : So ideally , for four million readers , you would have four million different explanations .
IS : In fact , it would n't work out like that .
We progress by means of Nashr , an Arabic word than means scatter technique .
For example , I 've published quite a number of miscellaneous books , articles , tapes and so on , which scatter many forms of this Sufi material .
These 2,000 different stories cover many different tendencies in many people , and they are able to attach themselves to some aspect of it .
EH : I noticed as I read that the same point would be made over and over again in a different way in a different story .
In all my reading , I think the story that made the most profound impression on me was " The Water of Paradise . "
Afterward , I found the same point in other stories , but had I not read " The Water of Paradise " first , I might not have picked it up .
IS : That is the way the process tends to work .
Suppose we get a group of 20 people past the stage where they no longer expect us to give them miracles and stimulation and attention .
We sit them down in a room and give them 20 or 30 stories , asking them to tell us what they see in the stories , what they like , and what the do n't like .
The stories first operate as a sorting out process .
They sort out both the very clever people who need psychotherapy and who have come only to put you down , and the people who have come to worship .
If a pot can multiply : One day Nasrudin lent his cooking pots to a neighbor , who was giving a feast .
The neighbor returned them , together with one extra one - a very tiny pot .
" What is this ? " asked Nasrudin .
" According to law , I have given you the offspring of your property which was born when the pots were in my care , " said the joker .
Shortly afterwards Nasrudin borrowed his neighbor 's pots , but did not return them .
The man came round to get them back .
" Alas ! " said Nasrudin , " they are dead .
We have established , have we not , that pots are mortal ? "
IS : In responsible Sufi circles , no one attempts to handle either the sneerers or the worshippers , and they are very politely detached from the others .
EH : They are not fertile ground ?
IS : They have something else to do first .
And what they need is offered abundantly elsewhere .
I know her best : People ran to tell the Mulla that his mother - in - law had fallen into the river .
" She will be swept out to sea , for the torrent is very fast here , " they cried .
Without a moment 's hesitation Nasrudin dived into the river and started to swim upstream .
" No ! " they cried , " DOWNSTREAM !
That is the only way a person can be carried away from here . "
" Listen ! " panted the Mulla , " I know my wife 's mother .
If everyone else is swept downstream , the place to look for HER is upstream . "
IS : There 's no reason for them to bother us .
Next we begin to work with people who are left .
In order to do this , we must cool it .
We must not have any spooky atmosphere , any strange robes or gongs or intonations .
The new students generally react to the stories either as they think you would like them to react or as their background tells them they should react .
Once they realize that no prizes are being given for correct answers , they begin to see that their previous conditioning determines the way they are seeing the material in the stories .
So , the second use of the stories is to provide a protected situation in which people can realize the extent of the conditionings in their ordinary lives .
The third use comes later , rather like when you get the oil to the surface of a well after you burn of the gases .
After we have burnt off the conditioning , we start getting completely new interpretations and reactions to stories .
At last , as the student becomes less emotional , we can begin to deal with the real person , not the artifact that society has made him .
EH : Is this a very long process ?
IS : You can't predict it at all .
With some people it is an instant process ; with others , it takes weeks or months .
Still others get fed up and quit because , like good children of the consumer society , they crave something to consume and we 're not giving it to them .
EH : You say that conditioning gets in the way of responses to Sufi material .
But everyone is conditioned from birth , so how does one ever escape from his conditioning ?
IS : We can't live in the world without being conditioned .
Even the control of one 's bladder is conditioned .
It is absurd to talk , as some do , of deconditioned or nonconditioned people .
But it is possible to see why conditioning has taken place and why a person 's beliefs become oversimplified .
Nobody is trying to abolish conditioning , merely to describe it , to make it possible to change it , and also to see where it needs to operate , and where it does not .
Some sort of secondary personality , which we call the " commanding self " takes over man when his mentation is not correctly balanced .
This self , which he takes for his real one , is in fact a mixture of emotional impulses and various pieces of conditioning .
As a consequence of Sufi experience , people - instead of seeing things through a filter of conditioning plus emotional reactions , a filter which constantly discards certain stimuli - can see things through some part of themselves that can only be described as not conditioned .
EH : Are you saying that when one comes to an awareness that he is conditioned , that he can operate aside from it ?
He can say , " Why do I believe this ?
Well , perhaps it is because ... "
IS : Exactly .
Then he is halfway toward being liberated from his conditioning - or at least toward keeping it under control .
People who say that we must smash conditioning are themselves oversimplifying things .
EH : A number of years ago an American psychologist carried out an interesting experiment .
He had a device that supplied two images , one to each eye .
One image was a baseball player , the other was a matador .
He had a group of American and Mexican schoolteachers look thru this device .
Most of the Americans saw a baseball player and most of the Mexicans saw the matador .
From what you have said , I gather that Sufism might enable an American to see the matador and a Mexican to see the baseball player .
IS : That is what many of the Sufi stories try to do .
As a reader , you tend to identify with one of the people in the story .
When he behaves unexpectedly , it gives you a bit of a jolt and forces you to see him with different eyes .
EH : When one reads about Sufism , one comes upon conflicting explanations .
Some people say that Sufism is pantheistic ; others that it is related to theosophy .
Certainly there are strains in Sufism that you can find in any of the major world religions .
IS : There are many ways to talk about the religious aspects of Sufism .
I 'll just choose one and see where it leads .
The Sufis themselves say that their religion has no history , because it is not culture bound .
Although Sufism has been productive in Islam , according to Sufi tradition and scripture , Sufis existed in pre-Islamic times .
The Sufis say that all religion is evolution , otherwise it would n't survive .
They also say that all religion is capable of development up to the same point .
In historical times , Sufis have worked with all recognized religions : Christianity , Judaism , Islam , Vedanta , Buddhism and so on .
Sufis are in religion but not of it .
Early to rise : " Nasrudin , my son , get up early in the mornings . "
" Why father ? "
" It is a good habit .
Why , once I rose at dawn and went for a walk .
I found on the road a sack of gold . "
" How did you know it was not lost the previous night ? "
" That is not the point .
In any case , it had not been there the night before .
I noticed that . "
" Then it is n't lucky for everyone to get up early .
The man who lost the gold must have been up earlier than you . "
EH : What is the Sufi attitude toward mysticism and the ecstatic experience ?
IS : Sufis are extraordinarily cautious about this .
They do n't allow a person to do spiritual exercises unless they are convinced that he can undergo such exercises without harm and appreciate them without distraction .
Spiritual exercises are allowed only at a certain time and a certain place and with certain people .
When the ecstatic exercises are taken out of context , they become a circus at best and unhinge minds at worst .
EH :
So the ecstatic experience has its place but only at a certain time at a certain stage of development ?
IS : Yes , and with certain training .
The ecstatic experience is certainly not required .
It is merely a way of helping man to realize his potential .
They ( Sufis ) do n't allow a person to do spiritual exercises unless they are convinced that he can undergo such exercises without harm and appreciate them without distraction .
Hall : Many of the great Sufi teachers seem to regard the ecstatic experience as only a way station .
Shah : Oh , yes .
The ecstatic experience is absolutely the lowest from of advanced knowledge .
Western biographers of the saints have made it very difficult for us by assuming that Joan of Arc and Theresa of Avila , who have had such experiences , have reached God .
I am sure that this is only a misunderstanding based on faulty stories and faulty retrieval of information .
Hall : Sufis also seem to take extra-sensory perception as a matter of course and as not very interesting .
Shah :
Not interesting at all .
It is no more than a by - product .
Let me give you a banal analogy .
If I were training to be a runner and went out every day to run , I would get faster and faster and be able to run farther and farther with less fatigue .
Now , I also find that I have a better complexion , my blood supply is better , and my digestion has improved .
These things do n't interest me ; they are only by - products of my running .
I have another objective .
When people I am associated with become overwhelmed by ESP phenomena , I always insist that they stop it , because their objective is elsewhere .
Hall :
They are supposed to be developing their potential ; not attempting to read minds or move objects around .
Do you think that researchers will one day explain the physical basis of ESP or do you think it will always elude them ?
Shah :
If I say it will elude the scientists , it will annoy the people who are able to get enormous grants for research into ESP .
But I think , yes , a great deal more can be discovered providing the scientists are prepared to be good scientists .
And by that I mean that they are prepared to structure their experiments successively in accordance with their discoveries .
They must be ready to follow and not hew doggedly to their original working hypothesis .
And they will certainly have to give up their concept of the observer being outside of the experiment , which has been their dearest pet for many years .
And another thing , as we find constantly in metaphysics , people who are likely to be able to understand and develop capacities for ESP are more likely to be found among people who are not interested in the subject .
Hall :
Is that because disinterest is necessary to approach the subject properly ?
Shah : Something like that .
Being disinterested , you can approach ESP more coolly and calmly .
The Sufis say : " You will be able to exercise these supernatural powers when you can put out your hand and get a wild dove to land on it . "
But the other reason why the people who are fascinated by ESP or metaphysics or magic are the last who should study it is that they are interested in it for the wrong reasons .
It may be compensation .
They are not equipped to study ESP .
They are equipped for something else : fear , greed , hate , or love of humanity .
Hall :
Often they have a desperate wish to prove that ESP is either true or false .
Shah :
Yes that 's what I call heroism .
But it 's not professionalism and that 's what the job calls for .
Hall :
You 've also written a couple of books on magic : Oriental Magic and The Secret Lore of Magic , an investigation of Western magic .
Today there 's an upsurge of interest in astrology and witchcraft and magic .
You must have speculated somewhat about magic in those books .
Shah : Very little .
The main purpose of my books on magic was to make this material available to the general reader .
For too long people believed that there were secret books , hidden places , and amazing things .
They held onto this information as something to frighten themselves with .
So the first purpose was information .
This is the magic of East and West .
That 's all .
There is no more .
The second purpose of those books was to show that there do seem to be forces , some of which are either rationalized by this magic or may be developed from it , which do not come within customary physics or within the experience of ordinary people .
I think this should be studied , that we should gather the data and analyze the phenomena .
We need to separate the chemistry of magic from the alchemy , as it were .
Hall :
That 's not exactly what the contemporary devotees of witchcraft and magic are up to .
Shah : No .
My work has no relevance to the current interest whatever .
Oh , it makes my books sell , but they were written for cool - headed people and there are n't many of those around .
Hall :
Most of the people who get interested in magic seem to be enthusiasts .
Shah :
Yes , it 's just as with ESP .
There 's no reason why they should n't be enthusiasts , but having encouraged them - which I could n't help - I must now avoid them .
They would only be disappointed in what I have to say .
You know , Rumi said that people counterfeit gold because there is such a thing as real gold , and I think that 's the situation we are in with Sufi studies at the moment .
It is much easier to write a book on Sufism than it is to study it .
It is much easier to start a group and tell people what to do than it is to learn first .
The problem is that the spurious , the unreal , the untrue is so much easier to find that it is in danger of becoming the norm .
Until recently , for example , if you did n't use drugs in spiritual pursuits , you were not considered genuine .
If you said , " look , drugs are irrelevant to spiritual matters , " you were considered a square .
Their attitude is not at all a search for truth .
Hall :
Many people seem to use drugs as an attempt to get instant enlightenment .
Shah : People want to be healed or cured or saved , but they want it now .
It 's astonishing .
When people come here to see me , they want to get something , and if I can't give them higher consciousness , they will take my bedspreads or my ashtrays or whatever else they can pick up around the house .
Hall :
They want something to carry away .
Shah :
They are thinking in terms of lose property , almost physical .
They are savages in the best sense of the word .
They are not what they think they are at all .
I am invited to believe that they take bedspreads and ashtrays by accident .
But it never works the other way ; they never leave their wallets behind by mistake .
One thing I learned from my father very early :
Do n't take any notice of what people say , just watch what they do .
Hall :
Let 's get back to your main work .
What is the best way of introducing the Sufi way of thinking to the West ?
Shah : I am sure that the best way is not to start a cult , but to introduce a body of literary material that should interest people enough to establish the Sufi phenomenon as viable .
We do n't plan to form an organization with somebody at the top and others at the bottom collecting money or wearing funny clothes or converting people to Sufism .
We view Sufism not as an ideology that molds people to the right way of belief or action , but as an art or science that can exert a beneficial influence on individuals or societies , in accordance with the needs of those individuals and societies .
Hall : Does Western society need this infusion of Sufi thought ?
Shah :
It needs it for the same reason that any society needs it , because it gives one something one cannot get elsewhere .
For example , Sufi thought makes a person more efficient .
A watchmaker becomes a better watchmaker .
A housewife becomes a better housewife .
When somebody said as much in California last year , 120 hippies got up and left the hall .
They did n't wait to hear that they were n't going to be forced to be more efficient .
Hall :
But there must be more than efficiency to it .
Shah : Of course .
I would n't try to sell Sufism purely as a means to efficiency , even though it does make one more effective in all sorts of ways .
I think Sufism is important because it enables one to detach from life and see it as near to its reality as one can possibly get .
Sufi experience tends to produce the kind of person who is calm , not because he can't get excited , but because he knows that getting excited about an event or problem is not going to have any lasting effect .
Hall :
Would you say that it might give a person an outlook on the problems of this time similar to the outlook he might presently have on the problems of the 16th century ?
Shah : Very much so .
And such an outlook takes the heat out of almost every contention .
Instead of becoming the classical Oriental philosopher who says , " All reality is imagination .
Why should I care about the world , " you begin to see alternative ways of acting .
For example , some of the finest people in this country spend a great deal of their time jumping up and down waving banners that condemn the various dirty beasts of the world .
Such behavior makes the dirty beasts delighted at the thought that they are so important and the jumpers are so impotent .
If the Trafalgar square jumpers had an objective view of their behavior , they would abandon it .
First , they would see that they are only giving aid and comfort to the enemy , and second , they would be able to see how to do something about the dirty beasts - and if it were necessary to do anything about them .
Hall :
In other words , Sufism might help us solve some of the enormous social , political and environmental problems that face us .
Shah : People talk about Sufism as if it were the acquisition of powers .
Sufi metaphysics has even got a magical reputation .
The truth is that Sufi study and development give one capacities that one did not have before .
One would not kill merely because killing is bad .
Instead , one would know that killing is unnecessary and , in addition , what one would have to do in order to make humanity happier and able to realize better objectives .
That 's what knowledge is for .
Hall :
When I read your books , the message came through very clearly that you are not interested in rational , sequential thought - in what Bob Ornstein calls left - hemisphere activity .
Shah :
To say that I 'm not interested in sequential thinking is not to say that I can live without it .
I have it up to a certain point , and I expect the people I meet to be able to use it .
We need information in order to approach a problem , but we also need to be able to see the thing whole .
Hall :
When you speak of seeing the thing whole , you 're talking about intuitive thought , where you do n't reason the problem out but know the answer without knowing how you got it .
Shah : Yes .
You know the answer and can verify that it is an answer .
That is the difference between romantic imagining and something that belongs to this world .
Hall : Ornstein , who seems to have been profoundly influenced by Sufi thought , has suggested that most people today tend to rely on logical , rational , linear thought and that we tend to use very little of the intuitive , nonlinear thought of the brain 's right hemisphere .
Would you say that Sufism can teach one to tap right - hemisphere thought ?
Shah :
Yes , I would .
Sufism has never been overimpressed by the products of left - hemisphere activity , although it 's often used them .
For instance , Sufis have written virtually all the great poetry of Persia , and while the inspiration for a poem may come from the right hemisphere , one must use the left hemisphere to put the poem down in the proper form .
I think that the behavior and products of Sufism are among the few things we have that encourage a holistic view of things .
I do n't want to discuss Sufism in Ornsteinian terms , however , because I 'm not qualified to do so .
I can only say that insofar as there is any advantage in these two hemispheres acting alternately or complementing one another , then Sufi material undoubtedly is among the very little available material that can help this process along .
Hall :
Why are the traditional Western methods of study inappropriate for the study of Sufism ?
Shah :
They are inappropriate only up to a point .
Both the Western and Middle Eastern methods of study come from the common heritage of the Middle Ages , when one was regarded as wise if he had a better memory than someone else .
But some of the teaching methods that Sufis use seem rather odd to the Westerner .
If I were to say to you that my favorite method of teaching is to bore the audience to death , you would be shocked .
But I have just results of some tests , which show that English schoolchildren , when shown a group of films , remembered only the ones that bored them .
Now this is consistent with our experience , but it is not consistent with Western beliefs .
Another favorite Sufi teaching method is to be rude to people , sometimes shouting them down or shooing them away , a technique that is not customary in cultivated circles .
By experience we know that by giving a certain kind of shock to a person , we can - for a short period - increase his perception .
Until recently I would n't have dared speak about this , but I now have a clipping indicating that when a person endures a shock he produces
Theta rhythms .
Some people have associated these brain rhythms with various forms of ESP .
No connection has been made yet , but I think we may be beginning to understand it .
Hall : Recent studies of memory indicate that unless adrenalin is present , no learning takes place , and shock causes adrenalin to flow .
We also know from experience that when you find yourself in a situation of grave danger , you tend to notice some very small detail with great clarity .
Shah : Exactly .
Concentration comes in on a strange level and in an unaccustomed way .
But using this knowledge has traditionally given Sufi teachers a reputation for having bad manners .
The most polite thing they can say about us is that we are irascible and out of control .
Some people say that a spiritual teacher should have no emotions or be totally balanced .
We say that a spiritual teacher must be a person who can be totally balanced , not one who can not help but be balanced .
Hall : People in the United States seem to be looking for leaders , whether spiritual or political , and they keep complaining because there are no leaders to follow .
Shah : People are always looking for leaders ; that does not mean that this is the time for a leader .
The problems that a leader would be able to resolve have not been identified .
Nor does the clamor mean that those who cry out are suitable followers .
Most of the people who demand a leader seem to have some baby 's idea of what a leader should do .
The idea that a leader will walk in and we will all recognize him and follow him and everybody will be happy strikes me as a strangely immature atavism .
Most of these people , I believe , want not a leader but excitement .
I doubt that those who cry the loudest would obey a leader if there was one .
Talk is cheap , and a lot of the talk comes from millions of old washerwomen .
Hall :
If so , the washerwomen are spread throughout the culture .
Shah :
They 're not called washerwomen , but if we test them , they react like washerwomen .
For example , if you are selling books and you send a professor of philosophy something written in philosophical language , he will throw it away .
But if you send him a spiel written for a washerwoman , he will buy the book .
At heart he is a washerwomen .
Intellectuals do n't understand this , but business people do because their profits depend upon it .
You can learn much more about human nature on Madison Avenue than you will from experts on human nature , because on Madison Avenue on stands or falls by the sales .
Professors in their ivory towers can say anything because there 's no penalty attached .
Go to where there is a penalty attached and there you will find wisdom .
Hall :
That 's a tough statement .
You sound as if you are down on all academics .
Shah :
Well , in the past few years I have given quite a few seminars and lectures at universities , and I have become terrified by the low level of ability .
It is as if people just are n't trying .
They do n't read the books in their fields , do n't know the workings of them , use inadequate approaches to a subject , ask ridiculous questions that a moment 's thought would have enabled them to answer .
If these are the cream , what is the milk like ?
Hall :
Are you talking about undergraduates , graduate students , or professors ?
Shah :
The whole lot .
Recently I 've been appalled at the low levels of articles in learned journals and literary weeklies .
The punctuation gone to hell , full of non-sequiturs , an obvious lack of background knowledge , and so on .
I went to a newspaper and looked up the equivalent articles from the 1930's .
A great change has taken place .
Forty years ago there were two kinds of articles : very , very good and terribly bad .
There seemed nothing in - between .
Now everything is slapdash and mediocre .
Why are so many famous persons in hallowed institutions now so mediocre ?
Hall : Critics like Dwight Macdonald have said for years that as education becomes widespread and people become semiliterate , the culture at the top is inevitably pulled down .
But you 're not really hostile to all academics , are you ?
Shah :
No , some of my best friends are academics .
Hall :
That is no way to get out of it .
Shah :
Of course , I 'm not hostile to all academics .
There are some great thinkers .
But I do not believe that it is necessary for us to have 80 % blithering idiots in order to get 20 % marvelous academics .
This ratio depresses me .
I think that the good people are unbelievably noble in denying that the rest of them are such hopeless idiots .
Privately they agree with you , but they wo n't rock the boat .
For the sake of humanity , somebody has got to rock the boat .
Hall :
For the sake of humanity , what would you like to see happen ?
Shah :
What I really want , in case anybody is listening , is for the products of the last 50 years of psychological research to be studied by the public , by everybody , so that the findings become part of their way of thinking .
At the moment , people have adopted only a few .
They talk glibly about making Freudian slips and they have accepted the idea of inferiority complexes .
But they have this great body of psychological information and refuse to use it .
There is a Sufi story about a man who went into a shop and asked the shopkeeper , " Do you have leather ? "
" Yes , " said the shopkeeper .
" Nails ? "
" Yes . "
" Thread ? "
" Yes . "
" Needle ? "
" Yes "
" Then why do n't you make yourself a pair of boots ? "
That story is intended to pinpoint this failure to use available knowledge .
People in this civilization are starving in the middle of plenty .
This is a civilization that is going down , not because it has n't got the knowledge that would save it , but because nobody will use the knowledge .
Have you heard of the Alaska Permanent Fund ?
In speaking with friends and family , I ’ve been surprised how many people have not heard of this fund that shares oil revenue dividends with Alaskan residents .
If you live in Alaska for one year , you can expect a check .
Thanks to Sarah Palin , this year ’s check will be increased by $ 1200 .
Each resident receives $ 3,200 ; that ’s $ 22,400 for Palin ’s family of seven .
How did Palin increase the dividend for Alaska residents ?
Alaska is a rich state .
If you live in Alaska , you do n’t pay income or sales tax , and you get money from the Alaska Permanent Fund .
The state itself gets 85 % of its budget from oil companies that lease the Alaska oil fields , and Palin has worked to increase this amount fattening state tax revenue and allowing additional payouts to the Alaska Permanent Fund by taxing Big Oil ’s windfall profits .
Wait a minute … did n’t McCain critize Obama for proposing a federal tax on Big Oil ’s windfall profits .
McCain said such a tax would “ increase our dependence on foreign oil and hinder exactly the same kind of domestic exploration and production we need . ”
It seems we have a contradiction in the Republican party ticket .
Apparently , a tax on Big Oil ’s windfall profits is alright with the Republican party as long as it is state tax and not a federal tax .
As Big Oil pays more money to the state of Alaska , the companies write this amount off of their federal tax obligation : more money goes to Alaska , less to the federal government .
As Robert Scheer of Truthdig asks :
Why is it a good thing for the folks up in Alaska to get a cut of exorbitant oil company profits , but not the rest of us , if we are all part of one nation ?
Did n’t taxpayers from across the U.S. buy the place from the Russians ?
Is n’t it our federally collected tax dollars that have been subsidizing Alaska more lavishly than any other state , both before and after the bonanza of oil ?
Not only does Alaska get a larger portion of Big Oil ’s profits than is shared by the rest of the states via the federal government , it is also one of the top states subsidized by the federal government .
Alaska receives $ 1.84 back in federal money for every $ 1 that Alaskans pay in federal taxes , compared to California ’s 78 cents for every $ 1 .
If it ’s OK for Republicans in Alaska to tax Big Oil ’s windfall profits , why does the Republican party oppose a federal tax ?
Maybe it is time to move to Alaska …
In June , Republicans in Congress defeated a proposed windfall tax on oil companies claiming it would discourage investment in U.S. oil exploration .
Last year , Palin and Alaska ’s Legislature approved a major increase of taxes on Big Oil despite its opposition .
From the Bridge to Nowhere to her stance on global warming , taxing Big Oil ’s windfall profits is just one more contradiction in Sarah Palin ’s record and her current views as the Republican vice presidential candidate .
What will be next ?

n 2004 , I worked with a game publishing client that wanted to update their underlying XML - based workflow to allow writers at science fiction and gaming conventions to write reports into their laptops — even without an Internet connection .
At that time , Firefox was becoming explosively popular , and I had been digging fairly deeply into the browser 's XUL interface to better understand it .
Eventually , I managed to create a fairly sophisticated editor , and in the process learned a great deal about how Firefox worked .
I also discovered that XHTML + JavaScript + CSS was just as powerful , more flexible , and often times better supported than XUL for many applications .
I found too that making add - ons for Firefox is not hard , but development can be tedious , especially as there is no formal development IDE for making them ( Venkman comes closest , but it ’s not very close ) .
So , if you create a component , you have to build the XUL supports and overlays , bind in the JavaScript and CSS ( and any XBL that 's necessary to support things ) , then update one or more configuration files ( which seem to change with every version ) .
Then you have to zip the content up , rename the file , load in the new add - on , reboot the browser , and cross your fingers that you have n't done something that causes the browser to crash .
For larger scale applications , the benefits to create add - ons still apply , but it would be nice to create " quick and dirty " extensions without the rigmarole of binding , zipping , and updating ; especially if the add - on is only to perform a basic task in the system — the analog of a system shell script .
This is the thinking that drove the R&D team at Mozilla to create Ubiquity .
You can think of this add - on as a way to enable a command line for the browser .
For example , I tend to write fairly wordy articles , and as more and more of my content creation has migrated to the web , I find it ’s not always easy to tell how many words I 've written in a block of text .
With Ubiquity , I can select the text and press Ctrl - Space ( this is configurable ) to bring up a command line " shell , " and then type in " word - count " at the prompt .
This displays a reasonably accurate count of the number of words in the selection , just below the prompt line .
If I press return , the command - line goes away , and the word count appears as a pop-up message in the lower - right - hand corner of the screen .
Ubiquity commands are written using JavaScript , and stored internally as local resources .
In addition to the full JavaScript set normally available from the browser , Ubiquity also supports a number of additional functions to make reading or modifying pages easy .
It also provides hooks to catch events such as mouse clicks , key presses , or page loads and unloads .
In this respect , it bears a fairly strong resemblance to Greasemonkey , which runs scripts on documents at load time , but with the advantage that you can use Ubiquity scripts at any time , not just upon load .

GEORGE BUSH UK VISIT ON SUNDAY 15 JUNE 2008
George Bush visits the UK this Sunday 15 June , and not January , as stated at one point in our last newsletter .
The George Bush Not Welcome
Here demonstration assembles in Parliament Square at 5.00 pm
ANTI - GEORGE BUSH POLICE BAN TO BE DEFIED
The police have banned our march from Parliament Square to Downing Street , where Gordon Brown will be entertaining George Bush .
It seems that when George W Bush visits this country traditional rights of assembly and movement are removed from the people .
This would be unacceptable for the visit of any foreign leader , but for this one – a war criminal – it is doubly unacceptable and we will defy the ban .
We are calling on all those who care for our democratic rights to come to Parliament Square at 5.00 pm on Sunday 15 June .
Some of those who signed statements accusing Bush of war crimes will be leading this protest .
Here are the comments of human rights activist Bianca Jagger and actor Roger Lloyd Pack :
“ It is outrageous that George W Bush – a war criminal who has caused so much damage to our world – is to be protected from those who dare raise their voices against his crimes .
The ‘ Green Zone ’ that will be set up around 10 Downing Street next Sunday , preventing the people of Britain from exercising their legitimate democratic right to assmble and march , must be opposed ” – BIANCA JAGGER
“ I feel affronted that George Bush is coming over here , and even more affronted that I ’m not allowed to march in protest .
This is a new thing is n’t it , this banning of peaceful marches ?
What ’s going on ?
I thought we were supposed to be living in a free country .
Is n’t that why they said we went to war with Iraq ? ” – ROGER LLOYD PACK
We are challenging this ban with the Home Office and Metropolitan Police .
Please send messages of complaint to the Home Secretary :

GEORGE BUSH NOT WELCOME HERE

( CNN ) -- A Florida TV anchor became an Internet sensation this week when she pressed Democratic vice presidential candidate Sen. Joe Biden about whether Sen. Barack Obama 's policies were Marxist .
WFTV -TV anchor Barbara West tells Larry King she was doing her job as a reporter when she interviewed Sen.
Joe Biden .
Critics said WFTV - TV anchor Barbara West of Orlando had an agenda and was asking biased questions .
Biden responded , " Is this a joke ? "
CNN 's Larry King on Monday talked with West about the interview on " Larry King Live . "
Larry King :
Your recent grilling of Joe Biden has stirred up a lot of controversy .
Let 's take a look at part of it , and we 'll get your comments .
Watch .
[ Video clip begins ]
Watch as West interviews Biden »
Barbara West :
You may recognize this famous quote .
" From each according to his abilities , to each according to his needs . "
That 's from Karl Marx .
How is Sen.
Obama not being a Marxist if he 's intending to spread the wealth around ?
Sen . Joe Biden :
Are you joking ?
Is this a joke ?
West : No .
Biden :
Or is that a real question ?
West :
That 's a question .
Biden :
He is not spreading the wealth around .
He 's talking about giving the middle class an opportunity to get back the tax breaks they used to have .
I know this has been a pretty mean campaign .
I was on a television station the other day and doing a satellite feed to a major network in Florida .
And the anchor quotes Karl Marx and says in a sense , " Isn't Barack Obama Karl Marx ? "
You know I mean folks , this stuff you 're hearing , this stuff you 're hearing in this campaign , some of it 's pretty ugly .
[ Video clip ends ]
King :
All right , Barbara , what were you getting to , since generally the redistribution of the wealth is a graduated income tax ?
West : Well , Larry , no , I do n't believe that it is just a graduated income tax .
I think a lot of people who are talking to me out on the street are saying they are very , very concerned that this idea of redistributing the wealth means taking it out of somebody 's pocket who is a wage earner and putting it in somebody 's pocket who refuses to work .
And they 're asking about .
That 's what they do n't want .
That is what they want to know , what does this really mean ?
My job as a journalist is to ask those questions and get those answers , and I do n't believe I got answers at all .
King :
Was the implication in the question that Barack Obama is a Marxist ?
West : I was asking him to tell us about how Barack Obama 's redistribution of wealth was different from that quote by Karl Marx , that 's all I wanted to know .
... I 'm not here to debate the issues .
I am not a political pundit .
... I 'm a journalist .
Watch as West defends her questions »
And I -- my job is to ask tough , probing questions of the candidates .
I had a very short time to be able to do that , only about four minutes .
There were issues that I wanted to cover , including the issues about ACORN and the abuses that they 've done with voter registration , particularly here in Florida , and Florida is such a key state .
And also this issue of the redistribution of wealth , as well as Sen .
Biden 's comments about " You mark my words , in six months , Barack Obama will be tested . "
King : I got you .
West :
But it was his caveat afterward that was the issue that I was questioning , and that is it may not be readily apparent as to what , as to whether or not the actions or whatever he does are in fact the appropriate ones .
And so America , stand with him and trust him .
King : I got you .
West : I just wanted answers to those questions .
King : The Orlando Sentinel reports that you are registered as a Republican ; your husband is a Republican strategist .
Is that true ?
West : Let me correct that .
My husband did do consulting for the Republican Party back in the Clinton administration , and he also worked for Sen .
Paul Wellstone , who was a very liberal Democrat at the time , and they were working together to shape the media message as far as the sex slave trade was concerned .
He was sent by the Clinton administration to go to Europe and also South America to consult with local officials who were perceived as friends of America in fighting the war against drugs .

Mind Reading Illusion

curiouser .co.uk is working on a solution to this problem .
Updated : Scott has commented on this article which you can read right here .
Whenever stories sprout up in the media condemning Blu-ray to a fiery fate , Blu-ray sanctioned cheerleader Scott Hettrick over at Hollywood in Hi-Def strikes back with a volley of pro-format numbers .
In his latest blog entry “ Blu-ray Barrage , ” Hettrick emphasizes the big name releases coming to Blu-ray this fall like The Matrix , James Bond films and animated hits Wall - E and Kung Fu Panda .
Even though Hettrick failed to mention Iron Man and The Dark Knight , he makes a valid point .
In terms of quality titles , this fall is the best yet for the format .
Hettrick then shifts into numbers mode to prove Blu-ray is not only selling , but selling well .
“ About 15 million Blu-ray discs have been sold to date , more than half of which ( 8.8 million ) have been sold this year alone , Blu-ray Disc Association chairman of the U.S. Promotion Committee Andy Parsons said during a luncheon presentation at CEDIA last week .
That ’s a 57 % sales increase in only two - thirds the time – 4.5 times as many Blu-ray discs are being sold every month this year as compared to 2007 . ”
Those are impressive numbers by themselves but still paltry when compared to DVD .
Not paltry are the price of Blu-ray Disc players which are still anywhere from 5 to 10 times or more than a standard DVD player .
Hettrick fights this argument with the following .
“ Over the past few weeks , seemingly every manufacturer , including Sony , Panasonic , LG , Philips , and others , has announced new Blu-ray players to be introduced in the coming weeks and months , many priced at $ 400 SRP .
Best Buy and other retailers are selling Blu-ray players as low as $ 350 , with further price cuts expected to result in Blu-ray players for $ 299 or less for the holidays . ”
As we all know Amazon has dropped the price on a Sony Blu-ray Disc player below teh $ 200 barrier already so Scott has the right idea here but not the full beat on the marketplace .
Scott ’s final proclamation is that Playstation 3 is “ the engine driving this train with more than two million PS3s sold in the U.S. this year alone through August , a 92 % increase over 2007 . ”
What Scott does n’t offer are numbers suggesting how many PS3 owners have ever spun a Blu-ray Disc before .
I ’m sure the gaming savvy crowd over at N4G.com would prove 2 million PS3 consoles in homes does n’t translate to 2 million Blu-ray adopters .
We ’re all for Blu-ray adoption here at HDR as it ’s a major component of our entertainment coverage .
At the same time , we ’re getting sick of the one - sided arguments claiming either Blu-ray is kicking ass and taking names or lying on its death bed while being counseled by the grim reaper .
Blu-ray has a lot of challenges ahead to be sure , especially when it comes to hardware and software pricing — a battle it has lost against DVD and digital downloads thus far .
That does n’t mean the format is doomed .
There is room for growth .
Lets see how the third and fourth quarter pan out before jumping to any more erroneous conclusions .

In the year 2025 , a scant 17 years from now , all cars will be electric .
But according to Mitsubishi's entry into the LA Auto Show 's latest design challenge , some will even tear up the Salt Flats , looking like bionic insects with the cruelest of intentions .
Each wheel of the proposed MMR25 Rally Racer gets eight little wheels for omnidirectional movement , and there 's no such thing as windshields in the future , replaced — naturally — by Star Trek tech .
Here 's the rundown , plus the sickest rendering of a non-existent product I have ever seen :
Advertisement
Yes , the MMR25 will have nine motors in each wheel , one to spin the main structure and eight more to control smaller embedded wheels for traction while deftly maneuvering along the highway , maybe even driving sideways .
Special " oblique aerodynamics " mean that the sideways driving wo n't be penalized by wind resistance , either .
There 's no glass :
It 's too damn heavy , and you wo n't need it , what with visual information coming in via a crazy camera array that feeds a 360 - degree panoramic screen that surrounds your " pod . "
It 's plenty power efficient , too , getting 1,000 miles per charge out of lightweight composite - nano - fiber - jiggied lithium - based batteries .
( No word on explodeyness , but presumably that 's solved too . )
We 're gonna go one step further and guess that the electric charge itself will come from just an hour or two under the hot sun , thanks to efficient solar cells .
But ha ha , that would just be ludicrous , right ?

Celebrity Divorces ( Photos )
Surely if you were breathing yesterday you heard thatand husband of almost 8 yearsare filing for divorce .
This should n't come as a surprise since they have been rumored to be splitting for some time now .
Guy and Madge have been raising three children together ; their son 8 year old Rocco , 3 year old adopted son David Banda and Madonna 's daughter with Carlos Leon , 12 year old Lourdes .
All of the separation talk started back in June when Madonna was photographed sitting in the special box seats of New York Yankee player Alex Rodriguez .
From there it all seemed to escalate with a 'he said she said ' battle leading to the demise of A - Rod 's marriage to Cynthia Rodriguez .
When it comes to placing blame , there is always enough to go around .
A - Rod 's father in - law wanted in on the action and ballplayer Jose Canseco put in his two cents worth - pretty much throwing his old pal under the rug .
So while we grieve the collapse of their marriage , let 's take a look at other famous faces that have been down the same road .
Check out the photo gallery below .

Can I vote if I am a Muslim woman covering my face ?
Yes .
You can either reveal your face to a female elections officer , or swear a special oath as to your eligibility to vote .
After that , regular identification rules apply .
What are the regular identification rules ?
You have three options : produce one piece of government issued photo ID , such as a driver 's licence ; produce two pieces of non-photo ID showing your name and address , or ; have an elector registered at the same polling station , with proper ID , vouch for you .
When can I vote ?
In the Eastern Time zone , polling stations are open today from 9:30 a .m. to 9:30 p.m .
What if I 'm working ?
Your employer must ensure that you are free for three consecutive hours while polls are open .

DALLAS ( Reuters ) - If Republican John McCain loses the November 4 election as most polls predict , his party may be in for a rough period of soul searching .
Analysts and some party activists say losing the White House will highlight the pitfalls of relying too heavily on a narrow foundation of conservative Christians whose support has nonetheless become crucial to Republican electoral success .
But some social conservatives say a victory for Democrat Barack Obama , whom they regard as an “ ultra - liberal , ” will energize them for the 2010 congressional “ mid- term ” races and the 2012 White House battle .
The election is still over a week away and a lot can happen between now and then .
McCain has staged huge comebacks before .
But almost every major poll has Obama with a commanding national lead as his campaign benefits from an unfolding financial crisis that has shaken America and knocked conservative red-meat issues like abortion and gay marriage off the political stage .
“ An Obama victory will galvanize social conservatives for 2010 and 2012 and they will look for a standard bearer they can rally around , ” said Richard Land , president of the Southern Baptist Convention ’s Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission , the public policy arm of America ’s largest evangelical group .
Land told Reuters the candidate most likely to “ rally the troops ” under an Obama administration looked to be McCain ’s running mate Sarah Palin .
The Alaska governor has excited the evangelical base but her strident opposition to abortion rights and other hard - core
conservative positions have alienated more moderate voters .
William Donohue , president of the conservative Catholic League which opposes abortion rights , said religious conservatives were bracing for a new phase in the “ culture wars . ”
“ I ’ve been on the phone the last couple of days with some of my friends ... and we ’re getting ready for the biggest culture war battles ever , ” Donohue said .
“ There is nobody in the history of the United States who has run for president who is a more enthusiastic supporter of abortion rights than Obama , ” he said .
President George W. Bush took almost 80 percent of the white evangelical vote and was the favorite of many socially conservative Catholics during the 2004 election .
In fact religious conservatives have played a key role in every Republican victory since Ronald Reagan ’s in 1980 , which some analysts say shows the party cannot win without them .
Evangelicals account for one in four U.S. adults according to some estimates , giving them serious clout in a country where faith and politics often mix .
PITFALLS OF “ PALIN STRATEGY ”
But Bush ’s 2004 win was narrow , won in part on the use of issues like gay marriage to get the faith vote to the polls .
Moderate Republicans say a McCain loss will show the limits of that strategy and demonstrate that the party may not be able to win if it just focuses on pleasing the base without reaching for the center .
“ Focusing on social conservatism alienates moderate and mainstream voters and will consign us to 160 House seats in the South and the mid-west , ” said Patrick Sammon , president of the Log Cabin Republicans , a group of gay Republicans which stresses social tolerance and fiscal conservatism .
“ We need members from across the political spectrum running as Republicans .
( We ) need to build a party based on the future , not the past , ” he said .
That can be a delicate balancing act .
“ Republicans must have the support of evangelicals but they can’t pursue them in too crass a way because when they do they alienate moderates , ” said David Domke , a professor of communication at the University of Washington in Seattle who specializes in the “ faith factor ” in U.S. politics .
Some analysts also note that the evangelical movement itself is hardly monolithic as it broadens its agenda to include the fight against climate change and loses its harder edges on some social issues .
Polls show abortion and gay rights issues further down the list of evangelical priorities though substantial numbers still care deeply about these issues .
“ Their tone will modulate - it will be essential for Republican victory in the years ahead , ” said Michael Lindsay , a political sociologist at Rice University in Houston and an expert on evangelicals and politics .
More than 600 adults have been arrested and 47 children rescued in a three - day roundup in the U.S. targeting people who force children into prostitution .

Child prostitution has taken on a new urgency in recent years with the growth of online networks where pimps advertise the youngsters to clients .
The FBI generally gets involved in child prostitution cases that cross state lines .

" It sadly remains the case even now in 2008 that there remain instances of children in the United States manipulated into prostitution by pimps willing to make a fast buck based on the most vulnerable among us , “ he said .

Stand by for Black Monday : Meltdown as Bush battles to pass mutiny - hit £ 400 bn bail - out
U.S. president George W. Bush continues his fight this weekend to reach an agreement over his proposed £ 400 bn bail - out plan to rescue Wall Street .
As the debate raged on , politicians said they 're making progress and hope to reach an agreement this weekend to protect bankers from the bad loans that threaten to derail the economy and send it into a deep and long depression .
In a sign of movement , House Republicans dispatched their second - ranking leader , Roy Blunt , to join the talks after their objections to an emerging compromise had brought negotiations to a standstill .
Negotiators were pushing for a deal before Asian markets open Monday .
Embattled : President Bush yesterday admitted : ' We have a big problem '
" I 'm convinced that by Sunday we will have an agreement that people can understand on this bill , " said congressman Barney Frank , a key Democrat in eight days of up - and - down talks designed to stave off an economic disaster .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi added that " progress is being made , " although Friday came and went without senior lawmakers from both parties sitting down together .
Talks were to resume Saturday .
Neither she nor Frank divulged details at a late - afternoon news conference in the Capitol , though there was word of a large Democratic concession .
Despite the optimism , President Bush admitted he had a ‘ big problem ’ as he tried to quell a humiliating mutiny in his own Republican Party over his £ 400 billion bailout plan for Wall Street .
With markets around the world plunging back into despair , he pleaded with Congress to ‘ rise to the occasion ’ amid a revolt by Republicans on Capitol Hill who fear the bill is too much for taxpayers to bear .
Amid scenes of high drama , and talk of a ‘ slanging match ’ , Vice President Dick Cheney was called back to Washington to help paper over the cracks in the Republican Party and strong - arm through the legislation .
At the same time , Republican presidential candidate John McCain suddenly changed his mind and took part in a televised debate with Barack Obama after being accused of derailing a bipartisan agreement on the plan just as politicians from both parties thought they had struck a deal .
‘ There are disagreements over aspects of the rescue plan , ’ President Bush conceded , adding that the proposal is ‘ not pretty ’ .
But he insisted : ‘ We ’ve got a big problem and we need a rescue plan .
There is no disagreement that something substantial must be done . ’
His terse statement came as details emerged of the White House meeting which was supposed to seal the bail - out deal but ended in disarray with the two sides further apart than when they started .
Democrats spoke of a verbal brawl in which some Republicans accused the President of trying to sell them socialism .
Mr Bush replied : ‘ If money is n’t loosened up , this sucker could go down . ’
After the meeting , Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson is said to have literally begged Democrats to help keep the threatened deal afloat .
Bending down on one knee in the Roosevelt Room of the White House , the 6ft 5in former American Football star nicknamed the ‘ Hammer ’ begged Democrat leaders : ‘ Please do n’t blow this up . ’
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi jokingly shot back : ‘ I did n’t know you were Catholic . ’
People power : People rally in front of the New York Stock Exchange in the financial district against the proposed government buyout of financial firms
The extraordinary sight of the Republican Party ’s financial lion genuflecting to his Democrat congressional foes underlined just how desperate the Bush administration was to push through its controversial economic rescue package .
But the humiliation was not over for Secretary Paulson .
As he got back to his feet after Thursday ’s ill - fated White House summit , Nancy Pelosi reminded him :
‘ We ’re not the ones trying to blow this up – it ’s the House Republicans . ’
‘ I know , I know , ’ the glum treasury chief reportedly replied .
With elections less than six weeks away and widespread public outrage over the bail - out , some Republicans in Congress have mutinied over what they see as the heavy hand of government interfering in a private - sector problem .
The White House has now set a deadline for the package to be agreed before the financial markets open on Monday .
But if a deal is not signed experts predict the London Stock Exchange could fall by up to 1,000 points when it opens next week if the deal is not signed .
It would be a ' Black Monday ' meltdown similar to the financial crash of 1987 .
Other world markets would also be sure to fall dramatically .
But President Bush ’s press secretary , Dana Perino , was more hopeful .
‘ We feel like we ’re close , but we ’re not quite there yet , ’ she said .
Talks : Leaders , including John McCain , far left , and Barack Obama , far right , meet to solve the turmoil at a White House summit hosted by George Bush , centre
Mr McCain was under particular fire for delaying the agreement .
‘ It is time for presidential politics to leave the negotiating table , ’ said Harry Reid , the Democrat leader in the Senate , who specifically blamed his Republican opponents for derailing the financial rescue .
Negotiators from both parties said they agreed on a basic framework when Republicans threw a spanner in the works by proposing an alternative plan .
Instead of the government buying up the distressed assets , the new plan would have banks pay the Treasury to insure the bad debts .
After the meeting , Democrats complained that Mr McCain derailed negotiations by appearing to show support for the rival proposal .
Barney Frank , chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , called it ‘ an ambush plan . ’
He said the survival of the bailout depended on Republicans ‘ dropping this revolt ’ against the President .
When tempers flared
during the White House meeting , he said he felt like a referee in a Republican ‘ ideological civil war ’ .
‘ This is the President ’s own party .
I do n’t think a President has been repudiated so strongly by the congressional wing of his own party in a long time . ’
Last night , lawmakers were studying the 102 - page proposal based on the consensus outline worked out before the White House fall - out .
As he prepared for last night ’s debate with Mr McCain , Mr Obama tried to put an optimistic light on the chaos , saying he thinks a deal can still be struck .
‘ I think there is real progress being made , ’ he added .
Work on TraceMonkey continues !
TraceMonkey is Mozilla ’s JavaScript JIT based on Franz - Gal trace compilation .
The JIT ships with Firefox 3.1 and can be enabled in the beta via about : config .
This article is about how TraceMonkey was recently changed to handle type changes in JavaScript data flow .
Introduction
The greatest advantage to a trace compiling JIT rather than a method compiling JIT , for dynamic languages , is type specialization .
Observe the following loop :
Select All Code : function f ( c ) { for ( var i = 0 ; i < 500 ; i ++ ) c += 2 ; return c ; }
In a traditional JIT this method would need to be compiled generically enough to use all possible incoming types .
The function could be invoked using either a string , object , number , or anything — and the compiled code must account for that .
Optimizing further requires static analysis .
Type Specialization
TraceMonkey ’s approach is remarkably different .
If a hot path ( loop ) is encountered , the runtime behavior is observed , recorded , and compiled as a “ trace tree . ”
If that loop is run using integers , the trace tree becomes a specialized chunk of assembly using straight integer math .
Because trace compilation only compiles instructions that have been hit ( for example , it may only compile one side to an if path ) , it ’s much easier and faster to type specialize than doing aggressive static analysis .
This approach has worked very well so far .
Except for type instability .
If that loop above were run a second time with c being a string instead , the original tree could not be used as the types are not compatible .
This resulted in a “ tree mismatch , ” and excessive tree mismatches meant destroying the tree to make way for another .
What if you could have multiple type - specialized trees for a given loop ?
Enter multi-trees .
Over the past week or so I have been working on ( and now landed ) my second major TraceMonkey patch — multi-trees .
Multiple Type Specializations per Path
TraceMonkey stores a cache of all trees .
The bytecode location of each hot loop is mapped to a linked list of trees ; the first in each list is called the “ root peer . ”
Each tree records typemaps , which are a simple arrays describing the data type of each slot in the stack .
A tree contains one entry typemap , which is the set of types the stack must have in order to execute the compiled tree .
The simplest case of multiple type specializations is the example above , where a simple loop ’s typemap can alternate on entry .
This is the easiest case to handle .
The linked list is grown for each new combination of types .
f( 3 ) will create the root peer with an integer specialization .
f( 'a ' ) will link in a new tree with a string specialization .
To invoke a tree , the root tree is fetched and the list is traversed until a matching entry typemap is found .
The tree is then executed .
If no matching typemap exists , the list is appended and a new tree using the new typemap is recorded .
This means there are multiple trees recorded for the same loop , and we pick one matching the types on the stack .
Type Instability Inside Loops
The hard cases involve type instability within the same loop .
TraceMonkey relies on being able to close loops , meaning that the loop edge ( tail of the loop ) can jump directly back to the top .
This can only happen if the entry type map is equivalent to the type map at the loop edge .
For example , a number turning into a string ca n’t be closed because the compiled code at the top of the loop expects a double , and we never recorded a path to bridge the conversion back .
There are many reasons this can happen .
Take the following dumb example :
Select All Code : function g ( ) { var q ; for ( var i = 0 ; i < 100 ; i ++ ) q = 2.0 ; return q ; }
The first time we enter this loop , the entry typemap contains Boolean for q since it is undefined .
When the loop reaches its first edge , q has changed to a Number .
Recording starts on the second iteration , so now both the entry and exit typemaps will contain Number .
Now if g( ) is run again we ca n’t run the tree we just recorded , because it expects q to be a Number when it really starts out as Boolean .
To solve this we immediately start recording a new tree .
At the end we encounter a problem : in our tree , q started out as Boolean and now it ’s a Number .
This means the loop cannot be closed because the exit and entry points are not type compatible .
Joining the ends would be incorrect .
To solve this we search for a tree X ( on the same loop ) whose entry types are identical to our ending types .
If X exists we compile a “ loop ” that runs once , then immediately jumps into tree X .
This resolves the type conflict by bridging the type flow to another loop .
Visualization :
Figure 1
Delayed Bridging
What happens if no matching tree exists ?
Take this example :
Select All Code : function f ( var c ) { var q ; for ( var i = 0 ; i < c ; i ++ ) q = 2.0 ; return q ; } f ( 1 ) ; f ( 1 ) ; f ( 20 ) ;
The first call to f puts a counter that says “ record a trace for me next time I ’m reached . ”
The second call to f records a trace with a type instability : q flows from undefined to Number .
Unlike the previous example though , there is no stable tree to complete the bridge .
To solve this , we have the top of each tree ( where the entry typemap is stored ) contain a list of unstable loop edge exit points for that specific tree .
During the third call to f a stable loop will be compiled .
We then use the following algorithm :
1 . For all other peers that have compiled code ,
2 . For all unstable exit points in that peer ,
3 . If any unstable exit point has a typemap matching our entry typemap , bridge the points together and remove the unstable exit from its peer ’s list .
This algorithm is invoked every time a main trace is compiled ( that is , a trace that ’s not tying to extend a branch off a tree ) .
Once it runs in the above example we a diagram very similar to Figure 1 .
The important result of this is that we can bridge many types of instability together .
For example , imagine a scenario where two traces are mutually unstable .
This is easily bridged :
Figure 2
Other crazy situations are handled as well .
For example , stable loops with unstable branch exits , or chaining multiple unstable traces together ( multiple levels of mutual instability ) .
One case I ran into was something like this :
Figure 3
Nested Type Instability
The situation gets hairy with nested trees .
Consider a loop like :
Select All Code : for ( var i = 0 ; i < 100 ; i ++ ) { var q ; for ( var j = 0 ; j < 100 ; j ++ ) { q = 2.0 ; } }
In this example there ’s an inner tree that will quickly type stabilize .
When the outer loop starts recording , the inner loop ’s incoming types will not match the existing root tree .
In this case the outer loop ’s recording is temporarily aborted and the inner loop immediately starts recording again under the assumption that it will record a type stabilizing trace .
In this loop it does , and the two trees are connected together .
The outer loop can then record and directly call into the tree that starts out with unstable types .
This solves all sorts of crazy data flow stability problems .
Previously SunSpider was traced as very type unstable , and loop hoisted variables ( such as the q in that example ) served as tracing poison .
They ’re now handled fine .
Our least favorite test , access - fannkuch , used to have 100,000 and even 200,000 side exits ( exits from the JIT to the interpreter ) .
It now only has 200 and it runs 2.3X faster than the interpreter ( over an old 1.3X ) .
Other cases like crypto-md5 are almost completely covered by tracing .
Thin Loops
Multi - trees go hand in hand with “ thin loops , ” a concept Andreas landed recently .
The idea is that if a loop does n’t close because it ’s too short , we close it anyway and assume the best .
That works really nicely for very thin loops , especially thin nested loops which would prevent the outer from recording .
Unfortunately it does n’t give thin loops time to type stabilize , so many thin loops are thrown out .
For example :
Select All Code : function h ( c , k ) { var q = new String ( '' ) ; for ( var i = 0 ; i < c ; i ++ ) q = k + q ; return q ; } h ( 1 , ' a ' ) ; h ( 1 , ' a ' ) ; h ( 5 , ' a ' ) ;
Multi - trees solves this .
The first call to h tells the JIT to start recording the next time h is called .
When h gets called the second time a thin loop is recorded .
But the types are not stable , and the loop cannot be closed – we get another dangling trace that runs once and exits .
When h gets called a third time it type stabilizes .
A new loop is compiled and the two traces are bridged together .
Note : h is not immediately stable because new String returns a JSVAL_OBJECT in SpiderMonkey , whereas the addition returns a JSVAL_STRING .
Type Speculation
TraceMonkey has a very cool optimization called type speculation .
Floating point values like 30.0 or - 12.0 fit into an integer .
When TraceMonkey starts recording a loop it speculates that such “ promotable ” numbers are integers for the entire loop .
When the loop closes , if the number in that slot changed to a double , the loop ca n’t be closed and the recording is thrown out .
How do you tell it to not perform integer promotion next time that loop is recorded ?
The original solution was an oracle , a simple lossy hash table .
If an integer -> double conflict arose the oracle would be told “ please blacklist stack slot N for bytecode location X , so we do n’t try to promote it to an integer . ”
Since the hash table is lossy this led to false positives as traces filled the JIT cache .
Multitrees rids most uses of the oracle .
If a loop ca n’t be closed because of integer -> double conflicts , a new trace is immediately recorded with the same conflicts demoted to doubles on entry .
This is better than compiling bridged traces ( int - > double and double - > double ) , because the extra time spent compiling has very little gain .
There is one case where the oracle is still important ( global variables aside ) , in that the oracle can help memoize type instability for nested loops .
If the JIT cache is flushed the oracle will still remember which stack slots ca n’t be promoted , and outer loops can be compiled faster .
Thus the oracle only memoizes stack slots when recording inner tree calls .
There is also a case where we build similar traces that are impossible to connect .
For example , two variables going from int ->int in one tree , and double -> double in a peer tree .
If a branch from the first goes from int -> double for one the variables but not the other , the traces cannot be connected without some sort of intermediate conversion logic .
Perhaps with very bushy trees it would make more sense to build such intermediate bridges .
For now we simply throw out the tree that is causing the problems ( the original integer tree ) .
This is safe because integers can always be boxed into doubles , so the second trace is all we need .
Problems
It ’s not perfect .
There ’s potential for code / trace explosion if types are too unstable .
The heuristics for deeply nested trees can get messy too .
If there are many inner trees that are type unstable it can take a long time to build a stable outer tree .
Compared to the original “ single - tree specialization ” TraceMonkey , there are cases that get a little slower ( although still faster than with no JIT ) .
This is because the original algorithm aggressively pegged incompatible values into mismatching trees .
For example , undefined ( Boolean ) was passed as a 0 for integer slots and NaN for double slots .
This was wrong .
For example , ( ( undefined == undefined ) == true ) but ( ( NaN == NaN ) == false ) .
And ( ( undefined == undefined ) == true ) but ( ( undefined == 0 ) == false ) .
Other operators are hurt too .
NaN is a poison value and causes any expression to return false .
So there were cases where the compiled code was simply wrong and produced incorrect results ( but boy was it fast ! ) .
By the time this fault was discovered it was too late .
Removing this aggressive coercion corrected a small percentage of code at the price of greatly reducing performance .
Trees would continually get trashed because they mismatched .
Multitrees solved this , but in some cases it uncovers new paths that do n’t yet trace well .
Conclusion
As TraceMonkey improves , type specialization will bring JIT ’d code closer and closer to C equivalents .
Multiple type specialized trees furthers us toward this goal .
It solves a huge class of correctness bugs and improves performance in many scenarios where nested trees could not be compiled .
5. Psychoenergetics
Mental entrainment , inducing hypnogogic trance , mind control , broadcasting thoughts and feelings , the Ant World , education via EM [ LW ] mental download , the " Feelies , " revolution in spirituality , " enlightenment machine ? "
Scalar churches ?
Psychoenergetics is simply using the scalar interferometers to manipulate and engineer the human psyche .
To me it is the most mind - boggling and frightening aspect of longitudinal wave engineering .
The mind is electromagnetic in nature , and itself of the time - domain .
It is not observable in 3 - space .
There is no thing you can point to that is the mind .
As Bearden says , " The mind is time - like . "
The longitudinal scalar EM waves are also of the time - domain .
By overlaying certain infolded patterns ( oscillations in time ) on the longitudinal waves , a thought or feeling may be made to arise in a person or persons who are in the interference zone ( where the wave beams cross ) .
The person will not notice anything , feeling that this thought or idea is his or her own idea .
The longitudinal wave pattern might be a wave of panic or fear that spontaneously sweeps over you , perhaps inexplicably .
It could even be in the form of a sudden intense patriotism .
It could be explicit words and phrases , which everyone would think they had thought of by themselves .
Or it could be rage and hatred , angry and violent .
On the other hand It could also be a continuous sense of docility and placidity .
This is the brave new world of psychoenergetics and the coming " Mind Wars . "
Scalar Psychoenergetics in its most primitive form simply " entrains " all minds in the target area into a deep hypnogogic trance .
In this state of mind people would be suddenly extremely suggestible , and would likely believe anything they are told , and would obey any orders given .
Talk about winning the hearts and minds of the American People !
Tom Bearden makes me think of Paul Revere , who heroically conveyed important warnings for the sake of the new nation .
But the words of the famous phrase have now strangely and curiously mutated into the once - inconceivable : " One if by land , Two if by mind . "
Indeed one strategy in a Mind War would be to simply take over the minds of the " leaders " of the enemy nation .
The targeted leader would not be aware that anything was amiss , although he might begin to make unexpected changes in policy .
And are , in fact , any of our " leaders " already having secret thoughts that are not their own ?
Who knows ?
Frighteningly , we can no longer be sure .
The new sciences of scalar electromagnetics and psychoenergetics are even now plunging humanity into a sudden science - fiction - like world beyond anything in humanity 's previous imaginings .
" The Russians reached the point in the mid 1990s that they could take over control of a person 's mind , with modified longitudinal EM waves including some time - polarized EM waves , and with a team of specialists ( estimate 25 - 30 per transmitter , and one transmitter and team per controlled person ) . "
Bearden
In a slide Bearden illustrates how a Scalar War would involve a psychoenergetics attack on the operators of the enemy scalar installation , entraining their minds into hypnogogic trance and getting them to shut down their systems .
And ultimately psychoenergetic warfare goes to the very heart of human identity itself .
For if my thoughts might no longer be " mine , " then who and what am I ?
Can my very sense of being " me " be hijacked by some nefarious psychoenergetic scheme ?
Will the " secret government " eventually dictate directly into your mind how you feel about yourself ?
Or what you think you are ?
Or what you should do ?
How Does Longitudinal EM Mind Control Work ?
The physics of scalar psychoenergetics as expounded by Col .
Bearden seems even more arcane and over - my - head than that of extracting energy from the vacuum .
I can't understand it , but I look through it anyway .
Each time another tiny understanding might occur , or a term might fall into place .
I know the mathematics is forever beyond me .
One paper to begin with is Mind Control and EM Wave Polarization Transductions
This is such serious stuff that Bearden includes a strong warning about misuse of this knowledge .
Psychoenergetics weapons can mentally maim and physically kill .
Warning !

" Bearden
After the serious warning comes the description of the paper .
This is heady stuff for the layman .
" Calling full attention to the special note above , in this paper we present a high - level over­view of the novel electromagnetic nature of mind operations , mind and body coupling , and intent - the induction of physical 3 - space EM energy changes into the brain and nervous system , and into every cell of the body , from the mind 's time - like coherent operations .
We summarize the time - polarized electrodynamics used to engineer and affect mind operations and the mind - body coupling loop .
Transduction mechanisms whereby differing EM wave polarizations can be transformed one - into - the - other are presented . "
Bearden I will leave it to the technically astute to try to understand the mechanisms of operation which are described in scientific language .
But there are tidbits for the layman .
Here he speaks of the difficulty Western scientists have in opening up to the " immaterial " ( longitudinal wave ) nature of the human mind .
Western Science Remains Largely Materialistic
" Ironically , most Western scientists are materialists and consider " mind " as a mystical and nonscientific concept .
They tend to consider mind operations and functions either to be simply " meat computer " operations and functions , or at best to be very weak ordinary transverse - wave EM operations and functions in the brain and nervous system .
This serious self - limitation exists because in the body we measure only weak TW [ transverse wave ]
EM operations and functions correlated to biological behavior and brain operations .
We simply do not know how to measure " mind operations " directly .
" With no mind measurements possible and no instruments , it is understandable that Western science considers only the physical side of the mind - matter interface .
" Presently our scientists do not measure the longitudinally - polarized EM wave operations and functions in the body and around it in nature .
Few of them are aware that a maelstrom of such LW [ longitudinal wave ] functions exist in the body and in all of nature in general . "
Bearden
Western methods of influencing the mind with EM waves have only used transverse waves , not the longitudinal waves of the vacuum .
If only transverse waves are used one pretty well has to hit the target mind with a sledgehammer of waves .
Western Science knows only transverse EM waves Brute Forcing Time Functions versus
Fine Control Methods
" Ironically , Western mind control researchers using transverse EM waves for mind control research , are using a brute force method of evoking and using vacuum engines ( spacetime curvature engines ) and a special form of general relativity , although they do not appear to realize it .
" While KGB scientists also use TW EM " brute force " TW waves when necessary , they do " imprint " or " activate " those waves with the desired internal LW and time - polarized EM wave and photon structures required to directly perform the mind engineering desired ...
Bearden
" These " fitted brute - force models " certainly can be very powerful , and certainly can produce the exact results shown in the experimental verifications of the fittings .
However , they do not of themselves allow sophisticated design for example of the necessary time - polarized wave assemblies for engineering the entire human collective unconscious simultaneously , or for engineering the entire collective unconscious of all species on Earth ( i.e. , Gaia 's collective unconscious ) , or even for precisely engineering the memory and knowledge base of an individual .
Bearden
The seemingly magical operations of psychoenergetics , sometimes called " psychotronics , " cannot be achieved with ordinary transverse EM wave energy .
But they are possible with longitudinal scalar waves because the mind itself is scalar in nature .
" We note that all mind operations are time - like , i.e. , they are comprised as scalar EM photon functions and scalar EM wave functions .
Thus the mind is a very special kind of electromagnetic system , existing in the time domain ... "
Bearden
The engineering of the mind can only be accomplished with the waves of time .
The course of psychoenergetics development necessitates the building of a vast database of settings and patterns which bring about given mental and / or emotional states .
A kind of " genome " of the psyche .
Bearden describes the process of the decoding of this " genome . "
" Now the scientists would perform many phenomenology experiments , making one little change at a time and profusely recording the data .
Each time , they would establish the physical change (s ) that occur in the body and / or the mental and emotional changes that occur in the mind for each spectral reinsertion back through the " ship 's portholes " .
They would simply but painstakingly ( over some years ) build up an extensive database of those individual correlates .
" In these experiments , the experimenters will eventually be able to provoke any body or mind change they wish .
Strong emotion .
Intense pain .
Intense pleasure .
Painful thoughts .
Images .
Memories .
Perceptions .
Dreams .
Visions .
Memory losses .
Memory changes .
Personality changes .
Etc. The " delta " in the emission spectrum ( the changes from zero reference spectrum ) represent the precise totality of all mental , physical , organic , chemical , etc.changes and interactions . "
Bearden
" A second stage in the research would be to test the correlates and porthole insertions upon a statistically significant cross section of ordinary people , and / or specialized populations ( such as toughened soldiers ) .
The program would evolve a highly complex , very effective , ever - improving science and technology of mind and behavior control and engineering mechanisms , complete with finished database and developed applications equipment . "
Bearden Summing up his paper Bearden speculates on what the actual situation the science of psychoenergetics probably is .
The intense secrecy with which this knowledge has been kept from the public has led to the current farce of the " government " pretending it all does not exist , and this secrecy may have now put us at great risk .
" The implication is that in the West one or more highly classified , sustained , heavily funded developments in advanced mind control programs , probably exists and probably has existed for some time .
Due to loose formation of rogue groups inside such programs , they may have dual or triple purposes , may not operate under very much legitimate government control at all , and may operate specifically for the purposes of the rogue group or groups that have gained control . "
In a nutshell , that 's what may be going on in the clandestine mind control projects in several Western governments .
The involvement of at least some rogue groups , some being " cowboys " who operate well outside all laws and ethics , could also result in such things as assassinations , clandestine testing on individuals without their consent , etc .
In short , it could account for what seems to be actually occurring .
As also is " usual " in such a mess , one or more of the rogue groups eventually may become very powerful because their secret weapons are very powerful .
They may become confident , thinking they have the " best in the world . "
They may actually believe they are ahead of the Russians ... "
" Remember that , in every large and powerful human organization , the basis for rogue groups is power and secrecy .
They are always seeking to increase their power , control , influence , prestige , etc .
Nothing else .
Patriotism and mission are — to rogue groups — often just idle words .
They have their own agendas .
And being rogue groups , they may well bring in unethical , immoral tricks : assassination , bribery , entrapment , disinformation , plausible deniability , etc .
A certain percentage of a highly secret rogue group will wind up using all these things and more .
It 's a human characteristic , the old primate dominance game .
Only now disguised and hidden under deep classification . "
" The Russians , with their additional knowledge of the actual mechanisms in the transforms , will be much more advanced than the West , because their fundamental psychoenergetics science is far more advanced , so long as we continue to use the old U ( l ) electrodynamics .
Further , the Russians have decades of use of longitudinal interferometry beams to reach right through the earth and ocean and produce stringent EM effects at a distance .
So they will also be able to do the same things here in " mind control " with LW [ longitudinal wave ] interferometers , through intervening mass . "
Bearden Bearden cites two examples where he believes the Russian KGB tested the psychoenergetics capabilities of their scalar interferometers .
One was the case of Captain Button in his A - 10 " Warthog " aircraft on April 2 , 1997 .
" Over Arizona , Captain Button was thrown into a hypnogogic state , and his perceptions instantly altered and controlled .
In his instant " dream - waking " state , everything seemed perfectly normal .
His sense of direction was altered a bit more than 90 degrees , so he simply corrected and turned and " flew toward the range " , actually flying off course by more than 90 degrees and ignoring radio contacts .
He flew right on out of Arizona . "
" At one point he circled , probably thinking he was over the range , and he probably dropped his ordnance there .
Then he " flew on back toward home , " as he thought in his waking dream state , until his fuel ran out and he crashed and died in the explosion — dream - thinking until he died that everything was normal .
All the while , his sense of the passage of time was altered .
To him , in his dream - thinking , dream - acting state , everything was normal and nothing untoward had happened .
So the distant KGB transmitters and associated psychoenergetics team controlled him for over an hour .
" Indeed , that was the exact purpose of the test : demonstrate control ( at a great distance ) of a skilled person performing highly skilled tasks . "
The paper Mind Control and EM Wave Polarization Transductions ends with the most chilling and frightening possibility of all : the psychoenergetic engineering of the human species as a whole .
The Ant World
The Final Race for Direct Mind Control of the Entire Human Species " The KGB psychoenergetics weapons scientists — because of their direct measurements and detections ( and use ) of t- polarized waves and LWs [ longitudinal waves ] for decades — also understand that Jung 's collective unconscious mind ( of the entire human species ) also has its own time - like operations and correlates , which one measures also when using t- polarization measurements and sorting it all out .
The collective unconscious mind operations are buried several levels deeper inside the recursive Whittaker structuring inside the EM fields , waves , and potentials .
"
The KGB scientists also know that something very like Gaia — a collective unconscious mind for all species on earth — also exists , and they are striving to be able to sort out and measure that one as well .
The Gaia operations are buried even deeper in the recursive structuring inside the EM fields , waves , and potentials . "
" Actually , from day one , the Russian mind control scientists have had their eventual goal set upon this " deeper area of mind and possible mind control " of the entire human species .
" I am convinced that the KGB psychoenergetics scientists understand this deeper area .
If they can learn to directly engineer the collective human species unconscious , they can then convert the human species easily into a sort of " ant " society , modeled along ideal Communism lines , except of course with an excluded " hierarchy at the top " running everything .
The " ant society " — communist style — is still a variation of feudalism ( all systems tend to feudalism or some form thereof ) .
" The KGB psychoenergetics weapon scientists are seriously pressing on toward that very goal .
In my opinion they are not very far from it right now ...
" Some versions of Russian mind control devices were used on Russian soldiers in the Afghan War to condition them for performance of merciless acts . "

More about " The Ant World "
Whether it is the Russians planning an " ant world " society or rogue U.S. black - ops groups withholding a great boon from human race , the secrecy on all sides around has allowed largely criminal elements to take over this technology while leaving the civilized elements in the dark .
Openness and the spreading of this knowledge among good and decent people is essential , and for that we will have to overcome our frightened denial .
" Meanwhile , rogue groups amongst Western clandestine mind control researchers will probably arise if they have not already done so .
They will likely seek to increase their personal control and further isolate the programs from orthodox government review and from government and legislative control .
They may even divert the research into highly illegal and unethical means , because it furthers their own rogue agendas .
That is how clandestine U.S. government research can sometimes go sour , unless great care is exercised by the oversight committees in the House and the Senate .
" Sometimes when rogue groups do gain control and total secrecy of a given new technological area , then what appears to be " U.S. government operations " do start to encompass a criminal and unethical operations , hidden usually beneath the deep veil of high classification .
Also , if it's " scientific , " no one is ever brought to justice , even if the " evil science actions " are uncovered and publicly revealed . "
Bearden
Like the huge energy of the Tesla howitzers , the ability to engineer the mind with longitudinal waveforms is a seeming " magical " thing which can be used for good or ill .
Bearden envisions that further developments will allow something like the " downloading " of knowledge via scalar interferometry .
Everyone could be highly educated , and quickly and easily .
In the conclusion of the paper " Mind Control and EM Wave Polarization Transductions " Bearden makes a plea to the nations of the world regarding the use of psychoenergetic engineering .
" Let us hope this great new area , already off to a bad start , can be bridled and steered in the direction helping and healing people , rather than killing or abusing them .
The excesses in its bad use are a potent threat to all nations on earth .
" Yet it can revolutionize medical science , education , communication , and psychology .
We foresee the day -- perhaps 30 years hence -- when education will be accomplished by directly loading the software into the mind .
Then in three weeks one will " load " a doctorate , say , in physics .
In three more weeks on will also load a doctorate in chemistry .
Another three weeks , in electrical engineering .
Another three weeks , an M.D. And so on .
When that happens then truly everyone on earth can be educated .
Freedom from ignorance may well be another great freedom that is legally recognized .
There will be no impoverished large groups lacking the education to find decent , productive jobs .
" We urge all nations to use the principles involved : not for human abuse , but for healing , educating , uplifting , and life - expanding of every person on earth .
If we do , we shall all have a far brighter future .
Then we shall check what has started out to be the Sword of Damocles and turn it into the golden Millennium .
" Bearden ( Perhaps after so many frightening topics a slight break is in order here to consider the lighter side of psychoenergetics .
For example , what will be the ultimate impact on the entertainment industry ? )
The Feelies at Last !
Psychoenergetics will be able to bring about at last , for better or for worse , Aldous Huxley 's fanciful idea in his novel " Brave New World , " an entertainment format which he called " The Feelies . "
Those were something you went to , like going to the movies , but you would experience all the actual feelings themselves , as if the depicted events were actually happening to you .
Although our " leaders " seem too dim to grasp what is going on in the world of scalar electromagnetics , it should not take some young Hollywood genius too long to understand that The Feelies are now possible , and that the immense megabucks of potential profit more than justify heavy investment in bringing it to market .
One can imagine that first " Feelie " theater , " The Huxley " perhaps , a large comfortable area surrounded by nine giant screens ( not just one screen ! ) , which become 3D if you put on your headset .
And The Huxley is fitted with the finest sound , and oh , by the way , a modest sized scalar interferometer with computer .
And there are one or more new tracks now recorded on the film next to the sound track .
These are the digital patterns of thoughts , feelings , and ideas to be fed into the theater 's interferometer .
And these thoughts and feelings and ideas will be felt by the audience as if they were their own thoughts and ideas .
It is an entirely new art form .
Psychevision .
As important ( and no doubt famous ) as the actors would be the " feelers , " those from whose minds the feelings were lifted in the original programming of the Feelie tracks .
Because , for example , Brad Pitt might be a good and handsome actor , but can he really feel it ?
Like the dubbing of foreign language films , it might be necessary to dub the " emotional track " using a deeper and more profound person 's feelings , thoughts and ideas .
It might even be engineered so that if you sat on one side of the theater you would feel like the hero , and on the other side you would feel exactly like the bad guy !
What would that lead to ?
We have all cried at a movie some time , most people have , though they might not want to admit it .
But this would be deep sobbing and a flood of tears , if the director so desired it .
You would feel it at your core .
Or , take a big chase scene , you would be terrified .
They are breathing down your neck !
You would be gripped by panic .
For that matter , the whole genre of Horror - Feelie would be too much for many people to take .
Do I really want to feel that an actual vampire is tearing at my throat with his fangs ?
A Religious Feelie would make you feel the exaltation of a saint at his prayers , or give you the definite feeling that you are Christ suffering on the cross .
All the pain could be there too .
The stickiness of the blood .
The very feeling itself : " Why hast thou forsaken me ? "
Who among us could come up that despair for scanning ?
Had this been developed a bit earlier we might watch a documentary of , say , Mother Theresa , containing her own actual deep sense of compassion , which we would feel arising in us as our own .
Then again , a Psychedelic Feelie could induce an LSD - like state and simply blow the audience 's minds .
Even in its simplest most primitive mode , the hypnogogic trance induction with its increased suggestibility , would completely alter the experience of even ordinary current movie going .
A woman had a rude awakening when she discovered a hidden camera in her room .
Since reporting the incident it has been revealed that a suburban Philadelphia landlord secretly videotaped 34 female tenants over two decades after hiding cameras in their apartments .

Thomas Daley , 45 , was arraigned on more than 2,000 charges by Magisterial District Judge Francis Lawrence Jr. and waived his preliminary hearing Friday .
Authorities had not previously disclosed the number of tenants involved .
Daley had installed the cameras – typically one in the bedroom and one in the bathroom – in at least 7 apartments he rented to women in Norristown over the last 19 years , Reynolds said .
Anzeige
Daley 's sophisticated set - up fed the camera images to a recording system in the basement , enabling him to view the tapes from his home via the Internet , authorities have said .
He hid the tiny cameras behind mirrors and in cabinets and ceiling fans , and some turned on with the flip of a light switch , they said .
Defense lawyer Timothy Woodward did not immediately return a message Friday from The Associated Press .

The investigation began after a tenant discovered a camera this year and contacted police , leading to Daley 's arrest Sept. 19 on charges including wiretapping and invasion of privacy .
Detectives have since searched his other apartments and recovered videotapes , records and evidence that led to new charges Friday involving 34 current and former tenants .
The charges being added Friday include 34 counts of invasion of privacy , 14 wiretap counts based on 14 audio devices found , and two counts each of burglary and evidence tampering , based on his alleged attempt to break into two apartments and remove cameras after he learned of the probe , Reynolds said .

Hawking spoke at George Washington University in Washington , DC , US , in honour of NASA ’s 50th anniversary ( Image : NASA ) In 2007 , Hawking experienced zero gravity aboard a modified Boeing 727 aircraft ( Image : NASA / Jim Campbell / Aero- News Network )
Stephen Hawking called for a massive investment in establishing colonies on the Moon and Mars in a lecture in honour of NASA ’s 50th anniversary .
He argued that the world should devote about 10 times as much as NASA ’s current budget – or 0.25 % of the world ’s financial resources – to space .

The renowned University of Cambridge physicist has previously spoken in favour of colonising space as an insurance policy against the possibility of humanity being wiped out by catastrophes like nuclear war and climate change .
He argues that humanity should eventually expand to other solar systems .
But in a speech in Washington , DC , US , delivered in honour of NASA ’s 50th anniversary in 2008 , Hawking focused on near - term possibilities , backing the space agency ’s goals of returning astronauts to the Moon by 2020 and sending humans to Mars soon after that .
The Moon is a good place to start because it is “ close by and relatively easy to reach ” , Hawking said .
“ The Moon could be a base for travel to the rest of the solar system , ” he added .
Mars would be “ the obvious next target ” , with its abundant supplies of frozen water , and the tantalising possibility that life may have been present there in the past .
Some space experts have recently called for NASA to send astronauts to a near - Earth asteroid instead of the Moon as a next step .
Hawking did not mention the idea , but said that any long - term site for a human base should have a significant gravity field .
That ’s because long missions in microgravity lead to health issues such as bone loss .
Boldly go
He also called for an acceleration of NASA ’s plans for human landings on Mars , which one NASA study suggested could be done in the early 2030s .
“ A goal of a base on the Moon by 2020 and of a manned landing on Mars by 2025 would reignite the space programme and give it a sense of purpose in the same way that President Kennedy ’s Moon target did in the 1960s , ” he said .
Hawking made a pitch for human space exploration , rather than just sending robots to explore space , a position taken by Nobel laureate Steven Weinberg , among others .
“ Robotic missions are much cheaper and may provide more scientific information , but they do n’t catch the public imagination in the same way , and they do n’t spread the human race into space , which I ’m arguing should be our long - term strategy , ” Hawking said .
“ If the human race is to continue for another million years , we will have to boldly go where no one has gone before . ”
Interstellar travel
Eventually , Hawking said , humanity should try to expand to Earth - like planets around other stars .
No such planets are known so far .
But even if only 1 % of the 1000 or so stars within 30 light years of Earth has an Earth - size planet at the right distance from its star for liquid water to exist , that would make for 10 such planets in our solar system ’s neighbourhood , he said .
“ We cannot envision visiting them with current technology , but we should make interstellar travel a long - term aim , ” he said .
“ By long term , I mean over the next 200 to 500 years . ”
Humanity can afford to battle earthly problems like climate change and still have plenty of resources left over for colonising space , he said .
Intelligent life
“ Even if we were to increase the international [ space exploration ] budget 20 times to make a serious effort to go into space , it would only be a small fraction of world GDP , ” he said .
GDP , or Gross Domestic Product , is a measure of a country ’s economic activity .
Hawking argued that the world can afford 0.25 % of its collective GDP to devote to space colonisation .
“ Is n’t our future worth a quarter of a percent ? ” he asked .
The physicist also speculated on the reasons that SETI ( Search for Extra - Terrestrial Intelligence ) projects have not yet detected any alien civilisations .
He offered three possibilities : that life of any kind is very rare in the universe ; that simple life forms are common , but intelligent life rare ; or that intelligent life tends to quickly destroy itself .
“ Personally , I favour the second possibility – that primitive life is relatively common , but that intelligent life is very rare , ” he said .
“ Some would say it has yet to occur on Earth . ”

ECONOMIC DIS-EQUILIBRIUM
Can you have your house and spend it too ?
" What remedy is there if we have too little Money ? " asked Sir William Petty ( the author of Political Arithmetick , designer of an ill - fated high - speed sailing catamaran , and cofounder of the Royal Society ) in his brief Quantulumcunque Concerning Money in 1682 .
His answer , amplified by the founding of the Bank of England in 1694 , resonates to this day : " We must erect a Bank , which well computed ; doth almost double the Effect of our coined Money :
And we have in England Materials for a Bank which shall furnish Stock enough to drive the Trade of the whole Commercial World . "
And in the beginning , there were tally sticks .
This collection of 13th - century Exchequer " stocks " is stored at the National Archives in London .
Courtesy National Archives , UK
Petty showed that wealth is a function not only of how much money is accumulated , but of the velocity with which the money is moved around .
This led to the realization that money , like information but unlike material objects , can be made to exist in more than one place at a single time .
An early embodiment of this principle , preceding the Bank of England by more than five hundred years , were Exchequer tallies — notched wooden sticks issued as receipts for money deposited with the Exchequer for the use of the king .
" As a financial instrument and evidence it was at once adaptable , light in weight and small in size , easy to understand and practically incapable of fraud , " explained historian Hilary Jenkinson in 1911 .
" By the middle of the twelfth century , there was a well - organized and well - understood system of tally cutting at the Exchequer ... and the conventions remained unaltered and in continuous use from that time down to the nineteenth century . "
A precise description was given by Alfred Smee , resident surgeon to the Bank of England and the son of the accountant general ( as well as the inventor of electroplating , electrical facsimile transmission , digital image compression , an artificial muscle , and other prescient ideas ) : " Curiously enough , I have ascertained that no gentleman in the Bank of England recollects the mode of reading them , " Smee reported in 1850 .
" The tally - sticks were made of hazel , willow , or alder wood , differing in length according to the sum required to be expressed upon them , " Smee explained .
The tally sticks were notched to show the amount and inscribed on both sides with the name of the person paying the money along with the date ; the stick was then split down the middle so that each side retained a copy of the inscription , and one half of every notch .
One part ( known as the " stock , " thus the origin of this term ) remained at the Exchequer and the other part was given to the person depositing their money with the king .
As Smee puts it : " Rude and simple as was this very ancient method of keeping accounts , it appears to have been completely effectual in preventing both fraud and forgery for a space of seven hundred years .
No two sticks could be found so exactly similar , as to admit of being identically matched with each other , when split in the coarse manner of cutting tallies ; and certainly no alteration of the particulars expressed by the notches and inscription could remain undiscovered when the two parts were again brought together . "
Exchequer tallies were ordered replaced in 1782 by an " indented cheque receipt , " but the Act of Parliament thereby abolishing " several useless , expensive and unnecessary offices " was to take effect only on the death of the incumbent who , being " vigorous , " continued to cut tallies until 1826 .
" After the further statute of 4 and 5 William IV the destruction of the official collection of old tallies was ordered , " noted Hilary Jenkinson .
" The imprudent zeal with which this order was carried out caused the fire which destroyed the Houses of Parliament in 1834 . "
The notches were of various sizes and shapes corresponding to the tallied amount : a 1.5 - inch notch for £ 1000 , a 1 - inch notch for £ 100 , a half - inch notch for £ 20 , with smaller notches indicating pounds , shillings , and pence , down to a halfpenny , indicated by a pierced dot .
The code was similar to the notches still used to identify the emulsion speed of photographic film in the dark .
And the self - authentication achieved by distributing the information across two halves of a unique piece of wood is analogous to the way large numbers , split into two prime factors , are used to authenticate digital financial instruments today .
So far so good .
The breakthrough was in money being duplicated : the King gathered real gold and silver into the treasury through the Exchequer , with the tally given in return attesting to the credit of the holder who could enter into trade , manufacturing , or other ventures , eventually producing real wealth with nothing more than a notched wooden stick .
So what 's the problem ?
Are n't we just passing around digital versions of the tallies we 've been using for almost one thousand years ?
Are n't mortgages , whether prime or sub - prime , just a modern version of paying for houses with fraud - resistant sticks ?
The roots of the current financial meltdown can be found in John von Neumann 's " Model of General Economic Equilibrium , " first developed in 1932 .
Von Neumann elucidated the behavior of an expanding autocatalytic economy where " goods are produced not only from ' natural factors of production , ' but ... from each other ... " and proved the coexistence of equilibrium and expansion via the saddle - point topology of convex sets .
Some of his assumptions — such as that " the natural factors of production , including labour , can be expanded in unlimited quantities " and that " all income in excess of necessities of life will be reinvested " — appeared unrealistic to others at the time , less so now that Moore 's Law , and the zero - cost replication of information , is driving the economy of today .
Other assumptions , such as an invariant financial clock cycle , are conservative under the conditions now in play .
Von Neumann , who made seminal contributions to digital computing , left a number of distinct monuments to his abbreviated career : among them his " Theory of Games and Economic Behavior " ( with Oskar Morgenstern ) and his " Theory of Self - Reproducing Automata " ( with Arthur Burks ) .
Synthesis between these two regimes is now advancing so quickly that no unified theory of the economics of self - reproducing systems has been able to keep up .
Periodic instability should come as no surprise .
We may be on the surface of a balloon .
Or in the saddle of a dynamic equilibrium — we hope .
The unlimited replication of information is generally a public good ( however strongly music publishers , software developers , and other pockets of resistance disagree ) .
The problem starts , as the current crisis demonstrates , when unregulated replication is applied to money itself .
Highly complex computer - generated financial instruments ( known as derivatives ) are being produced , not from natural factors of production or other goods , but purely from other financial instruments .
When the Exchequer splits the tally stick in two , the King keeps the gold and silver , and you keep one half of the stick .
Derivatives are the equivalent of splitting off ( and selling ) further copies of the same stick — or the " clipping " and debasing of coinage that led Isaac Newton to spend the later part of his life reforming the financial system as Master of the Mint .
The result is a game of musical chairs that follows von Neumann 's model of an expanding economic equilibrium — until the music stops , or we bring in Isaac Newton , whichever comes first .

The Bush administration wants federal agencies to decide for themselves whether construction projects such as highways , dams and mines might harm endangered animals and plants .
The new regulations do n't require the approval of Congress .
WASHINGTON 
The Bush administration is providing insufficient time for public comment as it seeks to loosen rules protecting endangered species , representatives of more than 100 conservation groups charged Friday .
The Interior Department set a 30 - day public comment period last week on an administration proposal that would allow federal agencies approving or funding dams , highways and other projects to decide for themselves — without input from government experts — whether endangered species are likely to be harmed .
That 's half the time that was originally scheduled in a draft obtained by The Associated Press .
A shorter timeframe would give the administration a better chance of imposing the rules before November 's presidential election .
Representatives of 103 organizations urged Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne and Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez in a letter Friday to quadruple the time for public comment from 30 to 120 days and to hold public hearings .
An Interior Department spokeswoman , who had yet to see the letter , said Friday that requests for more time are always considered , but that 30 days was not unusual .
Members of Congress have also requested extensions and public hearings .
Last week , House Natural Resources Chairman Nick Rahall , D - W.V. , along with House Energy and Commerce Chairman John Dingell , D - Mich . , and Interior Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Norman Dicks , D - Wash . , called for an additional 30 days .
Senate Environment Committee Chairwoman Barbara
Boxer urged the secretaries to suspend further action on the rule altogether .
If they chose not to , she asked that the public get six months to scrutinize the proposal , guaranteeing that a final decision would rest with a new president .

Husqvarna 's New Solar - Powered Robot will Mow Your Lawn
October 25th , 2008 by Timothy B. Hurst
When I think of Husqvarna , I think of chainsaws with 36 ″ blades that can fell large trees in a single pass .
I think of 10 horsepower snow blowers that can clear a driveway in ten minutes .
So when I learned that the Swedish power equipment company had developed a solar - powered lawnmower , completely eliminating the gas - powered hum created by virtually all of their products , I was intrigued .
Americans love their lawns .
But keeping that patch of Kentucky bluegrass green and neatly - cropped has some pretty serious environmental impacts , especially considering that 54 million Americans mow their lawns each weekend .
According to the Environmental Protection Agency , a traditional gas powered lawn mower produces as much air pollution as 43 new cars each being driven 12,000 miles .
So how can a person who wants to maintain a neatly - kept lawn do so more sustainably ?
Putting the question of water needs aside , one must look at the tools they use to cut the grass .
There are the stalwart human - powered lawnmowers , which are pollution - free and provide a good workout to the operator and there are the electric lawnmowers , which reduce localized air pollution but still require to be plugged - in .
There are even lawnmowers converted to run on biodiesel .
But for those who are looking for the latest in solar - powered home gadgetry , look no further than Husqvarna ’s new line of automatic solar - powered lawnmowers .
The 18 volt , 4 amp Auto Mower 230 can take care of a lawn of up to 3/ 4 acre on its own , cutting up to 1300 square feet per hour and running 90 minutes on a single charge .
The mower operates practically silently and has “ collision sensors , ” which react to garden furniture , trees , pets and whatever else in its path .
The little guy is even equipped with anti-theft protection .
Much like the technology used in invisible dog fences , a small wire is staked to the ground below the grass level , or buried just beneath it , around the perimeter of the lawn to be mowed .
The on - board navigation system on the Auto Mower monitors its position relative to the wire keeping it in the area to be mowed .
And what I think is perhaps the coolest feature of the Husqvarna ’s new solar - powered lawnmowers , when the Auto Mower needs more power , it finds its own way to the charging station , charges itself and begins mowing again .

For indispensable reporting on the coronavirus crisis , the election , and more , subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter .
In the past few days , during Sarah Palin ’s rough introduction to the American public , it has been reported ( first by ABC News ) that Palin , the governor of Alaska tapped by John McCain to be his running mate , was once a member of the Alaska Independence Party ( AIP ) .
This minor third party advocates for the secession of Alaska from the United States .
It is affiliated with the Constitution Party , which supports the reign of Biblical common law .
If Palin has indeed been an AIP true - believer , it would be rather curious : she would be a vice presidential candidate who favored reducing the size of the United States .
But it is getting harder to make that case .
The McCain - Palin campaign on Tuesday released voter registration to show she was never registered to vote in Alaska as a member of the party .
And a key source for the stories about Palin and the AIP backed off his account in an interview with Mother Jones .
Palin ’s husband has been a long - time AIP member , but ascertaining her true association with the party has been difficult .
In recent press reports , Lynette Clark , the AIP ’s chairman , has been quoted as saying Palin was at an AIP convention in 1994 and was an official party member at the time .
Other sources within the party tell Mother Jones that the only way to become a member of the AIP is to register to vote with the AIP .
Yet the state of Alaska released records confirming what the McCain - Palin campaign had maintained : Palin never registered as an AIP member .
What explains the contradiction between Clark ’s claim and the records ?
Dexter Clark , husband of Lynette and a vice chairman of the Alaska Independence Party , said that when his wife told reporters that Palin had been an AIP member she was “ acting on information from Mark Chryson , ” the party ’s regional chair for Wasilla , Palin ’s hometown .
The 1994 convention was held in Wasilla , where Palin was a city councilmember at the time .
Chryson “ has repeatedly said to me personally and my wife , Lynette , and groups of party members at large , that at that 1994 convention , Sarah and Todd Palin attended and registered as members , ” Dexter Clark told Mother Jones .
Asked how Palin could have been a member , when state records did not indicate Palin ever registered as an AIP member , Chyrson , in an interview with Mother Jones , backed off his account .
“ What could have been the confusion — her husband was a member of the party .
He was at the convention .
She could have been considered — it might have been thought she was a member then . ”
Talking Points Memo has reported that Todd Palin was a member of the AIP from 1995 to 2002 , with the exception of a short period in 2000 when he was undeclared .
Chyrson said he did not remember seeing Sarah Palin at the 1994 convention : “ I do n’t , no .
I was working behind the scenes .
Back then I was only vaguely familiar with her .
I would not have recognized her .
I had just met her .
I probably would not have recognized her . ”
He added that Sarah Palin did not play “ an active role in the party ” or to speak out for its causes .
Not being registered as an AIP member did not keep some Alaskans from being supporters of the party and its aims .
Jack Coghill , the lieutenant governor of Alaska from 1990 to 1994 and a candidate for governor in 1994 on the AIP ticket , told Mother Jones that being friendly with the AIP and a registered Republican was “ common ” in the 1990s .
Might Palin had had a similar relationship with the party ?
Given her husband ’s long - time membership in the group , Palin was likely aware of the group ’s tenets .
And in 2008 , as governor , she submitted a welcoming video to the AIP convention in Fairbanks .
“ Your party plays an important role in our state ’s politics , ” she said .
“ I ’ve always said that competition is so good , and that applies to political parties as well …
We have a great promise : to be a self - sufficient state . ”
She closed by saying , “ Good luck on a successful and inspiring convention .
Keep up the good work , and God bless you . ”
Having a vice presidential candidate associated in any way with a party that boasts the slogan “ Alaska First — Alaska Always ” could be a problem for McCain , whose slogan is “ Country First . ”
There ’s no documentary evidence now that Palin was a member .
But the question lingers : was she a fellow traveler ?

The Butterfly Ballot : Anatomy of a Disaster About the Author : I 'm neither a Democrat nor a Republican .
I 'm an Independent , with strong Libertarian leanings .
( I 'd probably be a Libertarian , but the Libertarians are just too organized . )
I have written what follows strictly so we can learn from the mistakes that caused the recent meltdown in the American election process .
The man who lost the popular vote both country - wide and in the state of Florida was recently elected President of the United States because a ballot in Palm Beach , Florida , was printed in such a way that when people attempted to vote for the Democratic candidate , Gore , many ended up voting for the conservative candidate , Buchanan , or for both Gore and Buchanan .
That the voters of America who cast their ballots for Gore feel hurt is understandable , but George Bush 's supporters should not take too much comfort in their candidate 's windfall .
Unless swift and significant changes are made , the same thing could happen to them .
In fact , in one of the many curious twists of this peculiar happening , four years ago it did .
I have used " disaster " in the title of this piece , not because having George Bush as president is in any way a disaster for the country , but because having elections decided by a handful of judges is not the way the American democracy was designed to work .
( " My conservatives judges can beat up your liberal judges ! " )
Had Al Gore eventually carried the day , the process would have been an equal disaster .
The only thing different would be the half of the country distressed by it .
Disasters Do n't " Just Happen "
One of the first things I learned in flying was that airplanes do n't just fall out of the sky .
( This , by the way , comes as welcome news to the student pilot . )
Airplane accidents can almost always be traced back to a series of mistakes and events :
The night was dark AND visibility was limited by fog AND the area being flown over was water , lacking in reference lights , AND John Kennedy , Jr. had only a few scant hours training in instrument flying AND he was flying illegally based on his visual flight rules license , perhaps causing him to hesitate before asking for help AND ....
An equally elaborate series of critical mistakes and conditions caused singer John Denver 's aircraft death .
The investigation of the near - meltdown at Pennsylvania 's Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in March , 1979 , listed a remarkable series of seemingly disconnected events that converged to almost cause a major disaster .
Along with other causes were such human factors as lack of operator training and a confusing and misleading control layout .
As with many disasters , the series of events that arose from a single trigger could have been short - circuited at any point , had anything gone right .
The Challenger Space Shuttle blew up because of O - Rings that failed in the face of excessive cold , but that 's not the whole story as to what killed those seven American astronauts .
What killed them was taking off after an all - night engineering meeting concluded that the O - Rings were OK .
Charts displayed at the meeting demonstrated that a launch under current conditions could not help but kill all aboard .
Why did they take off anyway ?
Because the design of the charts was so bad that no one could see this critical information .
A redesign by Edward Tufte , after the fact , showed all .
The Elements of the Florida Ballot Disaster
The press has identified the problem in Palm Beach as being a badly - designed ballot .
That specific design was certainly the most important ingredient in what occurred , but , like most disasters , other elements contributed their part .
 The Punchcard Voting System
The punchcard voting system was first used in the 1964 Presidential primary election , quickly gaining popularity .
Once the system came into widespread use , it became apparent that it had a most unusual characteristic :
Every time the cards were fed through the reader , the reader came up with a different answer .
The reason was simple :
The now - infamous " chad , " the bits of paper the holes in the doughnut that are supposed to be punched out by the user .
Often , they are not .
Could the Registrar of Voters in Palm Beach have known of this system 's problems ?
She should have .
Even the simplest of web searches reveals that , as far back as 1988 , the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) strongly recommended the elimination of Votomatic - type cards just because of this chad problem .
Unfortunately , their recommendation came with no enforcement power , so the chad chugged on .
Even as late as 1996 , 37.3 % of the registered voters in the United States were still casting their ballot using punched cards .
When the ballot disaster happened in Palm Beach , it was this chad with which the Democrat 's hopes lay .
They could do nothing to fix the ballot that had caused so many thousands of voters to double - punch the ballots , but they could perhaps get an accurate count of the vote that had been legitimately made , and they rightfully expected such a recount to find their candidate victorious .
Why ?
Because the counties that used the punch card system were predominantly Democratic .
Since most people had voted for Gore , it stood to reason that most improperly - punched ballots would end up being for their candidate .
With the country long - since on notice that the punchcard systems were inherently defective , Palm Beach , along with many other counties in America , continued to use them .
Why ?
Because nothing had ever gone seriously wrong .
Yes , there had been a smattering of contested elections brought about by the machines , in St. Louis , Atlanta , Los Angeles , but nothing yet that would alter the course of history .
No reason for alarm .
 The Low - Income Paradox Actually , a quiet change has been going on for some time .
In fact , by the early 1990s , wealthy counties across America were pulling out the punchcard system with all deliberate speed .
The poorer counties just felt they did n't have the funds .
Meanwhile , it was becoming apparent that the punchcard system had another key characteristic :
The higher your socioeconomic class , the less likely you were to make an error using the punchcard system .
Therefore , we were soon requiring punchcard ballots only in those areas where people were the least able to use them .
Among those disadvantaged areas : Palm Beach County , Florida .
It is very likely the Registrar of Voters wanted to change the machines , but where was the money ?
 Design of the Palm Beach Ballot
The chad problem alone would not have tipped the balance in the 2000 election , since thousands upon thousands more voters went to the poles to vote for Al Gore in Florida .
It took an atrociously bad design to really foul things up .
Not only does it appear that perhaps 4.000 people made the error of punching the second hole on the ballet in the mistaken belief that the second hole represented the second candidate , more than 19,000 people made the error of punching more than one hole , since both were directly alongside their candidate .
This is yet another disgraceful example of what happens when you do n't bother to user test .
Why were the people who laid this out unable to see the problem , even without testing ?
Because they were not users , they were designers .
As such , they were interested in all 10 candidates on the ballet ( plus space for a write in ) , and they saw all ten candidates .
They viewed the ballot as a 2X6 staggered matrix with a line of radio buttons in between the two sides .
Their cute little arrows appeared to be enough to help people choose the right box from this matrix .
The voters saw things very differently .
They were not interested in 10 candidates .
They were interested in one candidate , the one they wanted to vote for .
Their entire focus was on finding that candidate and punching the hole next to his or her name .
In the case of Gore , that required scanning only two names down in the first column .
There was never any reason at all for Gore voters to ever even see the right hand column , and we now have thousands of pieces of evidence that they , indeed , did n't .
Rather than a staggered matrix , they saw a single column with a dedicated column of radio buttons adjoining .
So here I come doing a little Monday morning quarterbacking .
Sure , it 's easy enough to see now what a stupid design it was , now that they game is over .
That 's what user testing is for .
So you can play the game before you play the game .
A competent designer , in my opinion , would have predicted this outcome just from a glance at the ballot , but even a beginner should have had enough sense to user test the design before release .
That rather obviously was not done in this case , and a serious miscarriage of thousands of voter 's wishes resulted .
( I 've been attacked for using the term , " designer , " to refer to the people involved in the layout of this ballot .
I 've seen no information on who actually laid the thing out .
As a designer myself , I would hope this person was not a member of our noble profession .
I use the term only because , whoever it was , they were acting in the role of designer . )
 The Republican Experience Another Warning Still and all , perhaps Palm Beach is not to be faulted for fouling up .
After all , they had never had such a problem before .
Or had they ?
Yes , they had .
In the 1996 election , the exact same problem occurred , for the exact same reason .
In that instance , the Republican candidate , Robert Dole , had 14,000 ballots tossed out because of double - punching .
Why the Republican in that election ?
Because Dole was the second name on the ballot , just as was Al Gore this time around .
Exactly how many massive failures of this kind does it take to break through the denial of the powers - that - be in Palm Beach , Florida ?
 Jeb Bush Elected Governor
If Jeb Bush had lost the 1998 gubernatorial election , Al Gore would have been elected president .
Why ?
Because candidate of the party of the incumbent governor appears first on the ballot .
In 1996 , Democrat Lawton Chiles was in the Governor 's Mansion , and so Republican Dole got all the ruined ballots .
With Jeb Bush as Governor , Al Gore found himself in second place on the ballot , and second in the count .
Disasters have these strange little complicating factors .
It 's one of the things that make them so interesting .
 Ensuring Disaster Even if nothing had been done about the ballot itself , much of the effects of the design could have been mitigated .
Voters could have been shown the problem with the ballot .
The tiny arrow could have been pointed out and it could have been explained that it may not actually point right at the hole , that you 've kinda got to slide the ballot around a bit .
They could have been told " no double - punching ! " and , of course , told how to get another ballot if they made a mistake .
They could have been properly trained in how to remove hanging chad , as has been done in many areas around the country .
Unfortunately , all of this would have required training the precinct workers , and it appears that training was in short supply in Palm Beach County .
The elements were all in place .
All it took was the predicted close election to set the disaster in motion .
What Needs to be Done about Election Ballots
We need :  A uniform voting standard across America People are mobile .
They should not have to learn the idiosyncrasies of different systems in different places .
 Accurate machines  Maintenance of privacy  Means for post-election verification
What happened in Florida is nothing compared to what will happen when someone " hacks " the election .
We will likely need to maintain a paper record of each voting session , even if the actual voting is carried out on a machine .
 Professional layout of individual county ballots
No one evidencing the lack of design ability seen in the Palm Beach ballot should be allowed within 20 feet of a ballot design .
Designers should be required to prove competence and experience in forms layout and interaction design .
No exceptions .
 User testing How much user testing would have been needed in Palm Beach ?
It appears that one out of ten users have some problem with this design , with approximately one in one hundred failing completely .
A professional usability tester running twenty subjects in a 10 minute test each would have amply shown that something was seriously amiss .
Would such a test be cost - effective ?
Certainly in Florida it would have .
What happened there cost millions .
Even in a plain old election , the benefits are manifold .
Studies show that most users do n't make mistakes when confronted with bad interfaces , they just slow way down .
( The Florida results bear this out .
One in ten people have trouble with the ballot , but only one in one hundred end up making an error . )
When people slow way down , you need more machines and more workers .
That costs money , a lot more than a user test .
A lot more .
The Lessons for Those of Us on the Web Most human - machine interaction problems do n't rise to the gravity of altering the outcome of a national election , but most share identical characteristics .
The only thing unusual about what happened in Palm Beach is the shear magnitude of the result .
These kinds of interaction meltdowns go on all the time .
They are never just the simple result of a really bad design .
One can , in looking over the historical record , find warning after warning that was ignored before the final crisis occurred .
Compuserve had an abysmal interface , much beloved by the early adopters of networking .
The company knew it was abysmal , but they also knew they could make more money " this next quarter " by not fixing it .
Then one day , AOL burst on the scene .
Compuserve 's users realized for the first time what they had been missing and quickly the company slipped into a steep and fatal decline , bowing out of the content market .
Horrible websites , built by amateurs , appear every day .
The companies involved maintain a blissful ignorance throughout the development process , often turning away from the most glaring evidence that something is seriously amiss .
In almost every case , someone has made a conscious decision early - on that the company could not afford the expense of user testing .
The penalty for this decision is death .
The Web is no longer an amateur playground .
Sites such as Amazon and Ebay have set people 's expectations for how the web should work .
If you try to feed them an incompetent design , they will turn away and you will be out of business .
If you hire an outside firm to do your website , ask for their user - testing plan .
If they do n't have one , run , do not walk , to another firm .
I make my living as a consultant , helping companies of all sorts set up the processes and procedures that result in successful design .
I 've seen the kind of transformation that iterative design methodology ( design - test - design - test ) can bring .
It costs little in money and typically shortens time to market .
If you do not use iterative design as standard operating procedure for your in - house work , start doing so .
If you do n't know how , find out how .
It is not that difficult .
Much easier than looking for another job , and that is quickly becoming the alternative .
SOMETIMES , the crocodile biting your leg is n't the one that eats you .
Default is on everyone 's mind and deflation keeps economists turning restlessly until dawn .
But the risk of inflation should not be ignored while we 're nationalising and bailing out .
It might already matter .
One of the stranger concerns of the financial crisis has been fears over student loan programmes .
These were included in Hank Paulson 's proposal to Congress yesterday for a new consumer credit facility .
Student loan disruptions , from most accounts I 've seen , have been largely over - grieved , but they get a disproportionate share of attention because it seems absurd for a government - backed loan programme to be judged as risky .
Default , however , is the risk we 're used to , but not the only one out there .
Fixed - rate loans , which Stafford student loans are , present a considerable risk if inflation erases the gain from interest .
With credit markets so unpredictable and so much stimulus money sloshing around the planet , price volatility may well be the next crisis .
Credit instruments like student loans and fixed - rate mortgages might become far less desirable to lenders because of very interventions meant to keep them flowing .
A note to commenters — I may not rest again until there is at least one good Ludwig von Mises rant posted below .
Spare no exclamation marks .
DIGG THIS
My earlier articles on the current economic and financial problems begin last January and continue to today .
( See here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , and here )
Little did I think that we would end up where we are today , with the Congress passing the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 .
My last article , not included in the above list , focused on this Act as a gigantic tax increase .
This article points out the shocking increases in government power that the government has conferred upon itself in this Act .
I believe that the American public has every right to rise up in anger against what this Act does and retire from office every legislator who voted " Yes " to its passage .
None of them has upheld his oath to support and defend the Constitution .
There is absolutely nothing in Article 1 , Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution that empowers the Congress to do what this Act authorizes , nor is this Act a law made as a necessary or proper adjunct in order to support those powers that the Constitution does delegate to Congress .
The Emergency Economic Stabilization
Act of 2008 is manifestly unconstitutional .
I pen these words just for the record .
Since the Constitution has long since been tarred , feathered , and ridden out of town on a rail , unconstitutionality no longer excites much emotion or interest .
What matters is only what the American people will stand for .
How much power over their lives and fortunes are they willing to put up with ?
This bill will go down in history alongside all of those similar bills in other lands and times that have odiously transformed a government from at least a semi - free institution into one that is clearly dictatorial .
In the usual case , a strong man takes power and then consolidates his hold over legislation and the judiciary .
Hitler ’s Enabling
Act in 1933 gave him power to issue edicts .
The Military Commissions
Act of 2006 is one of Bush II ’s many power grabs .
He can , if he wishes , place you or me in a prison camp without any of the constitutional protections .
In keeping with the capitalistic core of the economy , dictatorship is now arriving via a more intense degree of financial dictatorship than has heretofore been the case .
Up to now , Americans have had a decided lack of monetary freedom .
We have had monopoly money in more ways than one ( see Parker Brothers ) .
This
Act places financial intermediaries under a much higher degree of control by government .
The capital markets can also expect much greater control because investment banking is merging into banking and the SEC will be brought to heel eventually .
All roads lead to a financial czar .
This
Act marks the beginning of the end of the American Empire , in my opinion ( along with the Iraq debacle ) .
It is the first of several large - scale and last - ditch attempts by the reigning powers to maintain the financial center of the American State so that it can preserve the American Empire .
To understand the massive power that the Secretary ( of the Treasury ) has been given in this Act , first understand that it gives him complete and total power over " troubled assets . "
But the Act ’s definition of " troubled assets " is so broad that it includes all assets .
The definition is :
" … residential or commercial mortgages and any securities , obligations , or other instruments that are based on or related to such mortgages … the purchase of which the Secretary determines promotes financial stability ; and any other financial instrument that the Secretary , after consultation with the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System , determines the purchase of which is necessary to promote financial market stability , but only upon transmittal of such determination , in writing , to the appropriate committees of Congress . "
The phrase " any other financial instrument " literally gives him power to purchase any option , futures contract , any stock , preferred stock , any bond , any repurchase agreement , any money market instrument , etc .
And the only criterion is that he determine that his purchase promotes financial stability .
But since the Act has no definition of financial stability , he is being given unlimited power to interfere in any market for any financial instrument anywhere .
The Act does not limit these purchases to domestic securities .
It specifically authorizes the purchase of securities held by foreign banks and central banks :
" The Secretary shall coordinate , as appropriate , with foreign financial authorities and central banks to work toward the establishment of similar programs by such authorities and central banks .
To the extent that such foreign financial authorities or banks hold troubled assets as a result of extending financing to financial institutions that have failed or defaulted on such financing , such troubled assets qualify for purchase under section 101 . "
This of course has no warrant in the Constitution , but neither do the IMF , the World Bank , foreign aid , or raising armies to defend other lands .
The control over his power is virtually zero .
He is supposed to consult with the Chairman of the Fed but the Act does not say that the Fed Chairman can veto a purchase of he disagrees with the Chairman , so that this phrase is toothless .
Furthermore , he has to inform Congress of his purchases but they too have no statutory authority to control his financial actions .
They of course will pressure him in a host of ways to play favorites for them .
The Secretary has power to set up the bureaucracy to carry out his wishes .
He gets to determine the " methods for pricing and valuing troubled assets " and the " criteria for identifying troubled assets for purchase . "
The Secretary has the power to set the prices at which he buys assets .
He alone establishes the terms .
We read : " The Secretary is authorized to establish the Troubled Asset Relief Program ( or " TARP " ) to purchase , and to make and fund commitments to purchase , troubled assets from any financial institution , on such terms and conditions as are determined by the Secretary … "
This provision does not appear to give a financial institution any say in the matter .
It says that he can purchase assets on his own terms .
He is then authorized to hold them and sell them when he wants to and at such prices that he wants to .
The Secretary is to become the manager of a portfolio of very great size .
When a purchase is made from an exchange - traded company , the Secretary has a right to receive nonvoting stock or preferred stock in the institution .
The government will be owning stock in many banks .
( It is strange that the Secretary is made the recipient and that he is not even said to be a trustee on behalf of the government or the American people . )
This provision is advertised as providing " protection for the taxpayer against losses from sale of assets . "
This is a cruel joke .
The taxpayer has no say in the matter .
She is forced into becoming a participant in this process .
She has no control over her portfolio .
She pays all the bills , and any proceeds , if there are any , are impounded by Congress for its own purposes .
This is a socialist version of the " ownership society . "
Under Section 109 ( foreclosure mitigation effort ) the Secretary is given power to rewrite mortgage contracts unilaterally .
Of course , ex post facto laws are unconstitutional .
The powers of the Secretary in all these matters and others that I have not reviewed are shielded from judicial review in Section 119 of the Act : " LIMITATION ON ACTIONS BY PARTICIPATING COMPANIES —
No action or claims may be brought against the Secretary by any person that divests its assets with respect to its participation in a program under this Act , except as provided in paragraph ( 1 ) , other than as expressly provided in a written contract with the Secretary . "
It does not matter in the slightest that the authority granted will expire at the end of 2009 ( whereupon it will be renewed ) or that various oversight boards are built into the arrangement .
What matters is the powers granted .
Once the ice has been broken , it is easier to break it again and again .
These powers will soon be taken for granted , at which point they can be extended .
This is what matters .
This bill is about power even more than it is about money or saving the banks , although the two are linked .
The Paulson Plan that I discussed in April , 2008 here already revealed the same power objectives as this Congressional Act instigated by Paulson .
The expansion of government power is a major , major theme in the Bush II administration .
He has been aided and abetted by Congress including members of both parties and the Supreme Court .
Bush II has a fondness for dictatorship ( see here , here , and here ) as he made clear in 2000 , again in 2007 , and by many of his actions such as his signing statements that routinely ignore Congressional Acts .
In this light , it is no surprise that he gave power to such figures as John Yoo , Alberto R. Gonsalves , and Henry M. Paulson , Jr. or made Dick Cheney his vice - president .
Indeed , he has peopled his administration with any number of war criminals like himself .
Americans are being held hostage by their government .
The government is rubbing sand in their faces and defying them , both on Iraq and on its financial measures .
The government is overstepping its bounds so egregiously that it is arousing even passive Americans to action .
It is only a matter of time before they rise up and cast off their bonds .
The Best of Michael S. Rozeff
US Republican presidential candidate John McCain , whosepresumptive running mate disclosed that her unmarried 17 - year - olddaughter is pregnant , has opposed proposals to spend federal moneyon teen - pregnancy prevention programs and voted to require poorteenage mothers to stay in school or lose their welfarebenefits .
Alaska Governor Sarah Palin 's announcement yesterday about herdaughter Bristol was aimed at rebutting Internet rumors that Palin 's youngest son , born in April , was actually her daughter 's .
Palin said her daughter intends to raise her child and marry thebaby 's father , identified in news reports as Levi Johnston , 18 , ofWasilla , a high school hockey player whom Bristol has dated forabout one year .
The baby is due in late December .
McCain 's record on issues surrounding teen pregnancy andcontraceptives during his more than two decades in the Senateindicate that he and Palin have similar views .
Until yesterday , when the subject surfaced in a deeply personal manner , teenpregnancy and sex education were not issues in the nationalpolitical campaign .
Palin herself said she opposes funding sexual - education programsin Alaska .
She has supported abstinence programs in schools .
" The explicit sex - ed programs will not find my support , " shewrote in a 2006 questionnaire distributed among gubernatorialcandidates .

Canadian phone pranksters : Palin 'as gullible as Britney Spears ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Monday November 3 , 2008
Print This Email This The Montreal radio DJs known as the " Masked Avengers " who fooled Sarah Palin with a prank phone call on Saturday say that among all the celebrities they have taken in , only Palin was " as gullible as Britney Spears . "
" When you were the phone with her , did she have any idea what was going on ? " CBS 's Harry Smith asked the duo on Monday .
" Absolutely not , " replied Marc - Antoine Audette , who pretended during the call to be French president Nicolas Sarkozy , calling up to wish Palin luck in the election .
" She was as gullible as Brittany Spears , " added his partner , Sébastien Trudel .
The call was sprinkled with what should have been clear giveaways .
When the Sarkozy impersonator suggested " I just love killing those animals .
Mmm , mmm , take away life , that is so fun , " Palin merely giggled appreciatively .
She did not even tumble to the joke when he described his wife as " so hot in bed . "
Audette finally resorted to stating , " I loved the documentary they made on your life .
You know , Hustler 's Nailin Palin . "
But even then , Palin 's only response was a cheery , " Oh , good , thank you , yes . "
At that point , Audette gave up and told her she 'd been pranked .
" There are only two people that we 've pranked that never caught on that it was a joke and that we had to explain it to them at the end -- Sarah Palin and Britney Spears , " marveled Trudel .
" And Brittany Spears could not ever be president of the United States , but Sarah Palin could . "
" It 's pretty disturbing to see that idiots like us can go through to a vice - presidential candidate , " Trudel continued .
" Two stupid comedians with a bad French accent . "
Trudel said it took just four days for them to arrange the call , starting by talking to low - level people in Alaska and working up through Palin 's campaign staff .
" When we started to work on the idea last Tuesday , " Audette told the Globe and Mail , " we thought it would be mission impossible .
But after about a dozen calls , we started to realize it might work , because her staff did n't know the name of the French President .
They asked us to spell it . "
" It 's our fastest one except Britney Spears , " Audette boasted to Harry Smith .
" When we pranked Paul McCartney , it took us about two months , " Audette amplified .
" Bill Gates a month .
Brittany Spears two days . "
An spokesperson for the Obama campaign commented , " I 'm glad we check out our calls before we hand the phone to Barack Obama . "

Ted Stevens to attend her father ’s funeral in California has admitted that her father had not died and that she went to California to attend a horse race .
The juror , Marian Hinnant , admitted to U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan in a Monday morning hearing that her father had n't died and she was in fact at the Breeders ' Cup in Arcadia , Calif .
According to Roll Call , Hinnant told Sullivan a convoluted story about criminal activity in the horse racing industry , alleging that her phone had been tapped and that someone she once worked with in the industry was involved in crime and drugs .
Later , she told Roll Call she thought Stevens was guilty believed Stevens was guilty , but that she also believed most other Members of Congress were guilty of crimes as well .
“ He did n’t do anything any of the other Congressman and Senators had n’t done , ” she told the paper .
The defense has indicated they were filing papers related to the juror 's admission , according to a spokesman for the court .
However , the spokesman did not indicate what those papers would be .

About Those Philly Fan Egging the Team Bus
Eagles fans , earlier this year .
( By Chris Gardner - Getty )
During his appearance on Elliot In The Morning today , Chris Cooley discussed yesterday 's egging of his team bus by Eagles fans in admiring tones :
" You know what , though , they 're good shots , " he said of the Philly fans .
" They 've been practicing .
You could see them coming in ; they were leading the bus .
It was good egging . "
The Redskins Blog told a similar tale .
Herewith , the Redskins discuss yesterday 's performance from the Eagles fans and their love of eggs .
" Oh yeah , they just come raining down when you pull in there , " Casey Rabach said .
" You know , I do n't know how many we got hit with , but it looked like a hailstorm . "
" They were lighting it up , " Devin Thomas said .
" I 'm talking about whoop , " Malcolm Kelly said .
" I 'm talking about the middle of the bus , like , bammmm , like busted and everything , " Kedric Golston said .
" I ain't never been thrown eggs at .
I mean , at Philly , they throw everything . "
" My bus only got hit with one egg , but I had my headphones on listening to music , and it was like two windows back , and all you hear was thump , " Mike Sellers said .
" Everybody starts cracking up , it was like , ' Oh we got here , here it comes . '
" It must have been one of those big ones too , an ostrich egg , " Golston said .
" It was crazy , though , because the egg was actually thrown in front of the bus , " Kelly said .
" It was like a quarterback almost ; you throw it to where the receiver 's gonna be at .
I was very impressed . "
" Very impressed , " Thomas agreed .
" If they ever had a replacement [ team ] in Philly , they'd have to get that dude for quarterback , because he hit that thing on point . "
" You would think it would probably happen in Dallas or something , " Sellers said , " [ but ] they 're nicer fans than Philly fans . "
" The only thing we ever had happen in college was they tried to rock our bus and stuff , " Thomas said .
" Nah , that happened to us : OU - Texas game , " Kelly said .
" They were throwing nachos , drinks .
Everything , everything you could name . "
" We did n't get no eggs , " Rock Cartwright said of his bus yesterday .
" I just know we got flipped off .
By everybody , kids and everything . "
" You 've got the six - year olds flipping you off , and the dad 's patting them on the back , " Rabach said .
" They give us the bird , we wave , " Sellers said .
" The universal greeting , I guess , for Philly . "
" Grandma 's mooning you , " Jon Jansen said .
" Oh yeah , definitely , " Rabach said .
" I 've had some old ladies moon us , oh yeah , " Jansen said .
" It 's hard to tell from the backside , to tell you the truth , " Rabach said .
" Oh , you can tell , " Jansen said .
" When it 's an old lady , you can tell . "
" Even all the fans after the game were flipping [ us ] off , and we had a couple guys that were gonna moon 'em , " Cooley said on Elliot .
" We were flipping 'em off back .
Our windows are so tinted , I really do n't think they can see us . "
" That just makes 'em happy , that they can [ tick ] you off , " Rabach said .
" All they 're looking for is a rise out of you , a reaction , " Jansen said .
" That 's Philly , " Rabach said .
" That 's what makes it fun , " Jansen said .

I did n’t think I ’d be revisiting this topic again so soon .
After all , I wrote one of my characteristic magnum opuses ( opi ? ) less than two months ago , when I asked whether a recent animal study had vindicated Linus Pauling ’s belief that high dose vitamin C is a highly effective cancer treatment .
After that tsunami of verbiage that can only be exceeded by my fellow blogger Dr. Atwood when he’s on a roll doing a multipart deconstruction of some woo or other , I thought it would be best to give it a rest for a while .
I guess less than two months will have to be enough .
The reason struck me as I was perusing the very latest issue of Cancer Research , hot off the presses October 1 .
As I did so , it did n’t take me long to come across an article from the Memorial - Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center at Columbia entitled “ Vitamin C Antagonizes the Cytotoxic Effects of Antineoplastic Drugs “ , whose first author is Dr. Mark Heaney .
Once more into the fray !
You may recall that , when last I discussed the topic of vitamin C as a “ cancer cure , ” I discussed a recent study out of Mark Levine ’s laboratory at the Molecular and Clinical Nutrition Section , National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases , at the National Institutes of Health .
At the time , Dr. Levine argued that the doses of vitamin C used in previous randomized , double - blind trials of vitamin C against cancer were oral and thus did not produce levels of ascorbate in the serum high enough to kill cancer cells because absorption of vitamin C is limited by the rate that the gastrointestinal tract can take it up .
He argued that , to reach the very high doses found to be necessary in cell culture to kill lymphoma cells preferentially to normal cells , .
We ’re talking huge concentrations ranging from 2 to 20 mM , which are levels of active drug that are virtually unheard of for normal drugs .
In mice , he showed that attaining such high blood concentrations was feasible in mice and that they demonstrated a mild antitumor effect in a three mouse models of cancer and differential toxicity to cancer cells over normal cells through , paradoxically , the induction of reactive oxidant species , as it turns out that this particular antioxidant can become a pro-oxidant at sufficiently high concentrations .
Overall , I concluded that the available evidence suggests that , even if vitamin C does have an anti-tumor effect , it ’s likely to be modest , making it a long run for a short slide ; in other words , huge doses of vitamin C , such that they are difficult to get into the patient , for a pretty wimpy benefit .
Of course , as I pointed out before , every time there ’s a study suggesting that “ vitamin C might work after all , ” the press go ga - ga all over it .
Certainly that ’s what happened for Dr. Levine ’s cell culture study back in 2006 and his animal model study a couple of months ago .
So , take a guess .
What do you think the reaction to to the study I mentioned above published in the October 1 issue of Cancer Research ?
Crickets chirping .
Yes , the silence was deafening .
I wonder why ?
True , I did find articles in the Canadian press , in Medpage Today , and Medscape , but not much anywhere else .
To find out why , let ’s look at what the study found :
October 2 , 2008 — Large supplemental doses of vitamin C could interfere with the therapeutic cytotoxic effects of a wide range of chemotherapy agents , suggests a new preclinical study .
Although the finding comes from research conducted in cancer cell lines and mice , the authors say the conditions they created are similar to those found in the body , and speculate that the same mechanism might affect patient outcomes .
“ It is possible that vitamin C supplementation may alter the effectiveness of commonly used chemotherapeutic agents and adversely influence treatment outcome , ” the researchers write in the October 1 issue of Cancer Research
.
So what did the researchers do ?
First , you have to understand that a common mechanism of action of many chemotherapeutic drugs is the generation of reactive oxygen species ( some of which are known as oxygen free radicals ) , which the result in DNA damage .
Consequently , one might reasonably hypothesize that vitamin C ( ascorbate ) might interfere with the action of some of these chemotherapeutic agents .
On the other hand , if Dr. Levine is correct it could be argued that ascorbate might potentiate the activity of such chemotherapeutic agents .
Therefore , first , as scientists so often do , investigators tested combinations of different chemotherapeutic agents with increasing concentrations of vitamin C .
One difference between this study and the previous two studies by Dr. Levine is that the range of ascorbate concentrations examined was from 0 to 0.5 mM , which is 10 to 20 times lower than the concentrations that Levine used .
In any case , what he found was that treating two different leukemia and lymphoma cell lines with ascorbate at those concentrations before treating them with chemotherapeutic agents , including mechanistically dissimilar agents such as doxorubicin , which intercalates with DNA and causes DNA breaks ; methotrexate , which inhibits folate metabolism ; cisplatin , which crosslinks DNA ; vincristine , which interferes with microtubule function ; and imatinib mesylate ( better known by its trade name of Gleevec ) , a selective inhibitor of the activity of a protein called bcr-abl , which is the oncogene that plays a central role in the development of chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) .
The point is that these drugs all have very different mechanisms of action , and the finding was that vitamin C inhibited their effects .
At the concentrations used , it did n’t inhibit or stimulate the growth of cells in and of itself .
However , it did interfere with the actions of these drugs , decreasing their cytotoxicity to tumor cells by 30 - 70 % .
Next , they tested the effect of vitamin C and chemotherapy in mouse models of cancer using 250 mg / kg , again a much lower dose than what Dr. Levine used .
Once again , vitamin C interfered with chemotherapy .
What was puzzling about these results is that not all of these drugs are thought to have as part of their mechanism of toxicity the generation of reaction oxygen species , and yet vitamin C interfered with them all .
The question then became : Why ?
A series of additional experiments showed that it was n’t because vitamin C made tumor cells better able to pump chemotherapeutic agents out .
They then compared vitamin C to another chemical ( N - acetylcysteine ) , which like vitamin C helps cells replenish their supply of free radical scavenging thiols such as glutathione , which neutralize reactive oxygen species .
When cells were treated with N - acetylcysteine , it only protected them from one of the five chemotherapeutic agents , cisplatin , and vitamin C had minimal effects on intracellular reactive oxygen species .
This result suggested that vitamin C works through a more general mechanism than simply an antioxidant mechanism .
A further experiment showed that vitamin C was protective against mitochondrial damage caused by chemotherapeutic agents , a mechanism of action common to all five of the drugs .
Dr. Heany speculates :
“ Our study is a preclinical model that addresses only the situation when vitamin C is given in the setting of chemotherapy treatment , ” Dr. Heaney emphasized .
There have been no clinical studies of this topic so far , he said .
However , the finding could be of potential concern because “ many people , cancer patients included , take supplemental vitamin C , ” Dr. Heaney pointed out .
Clinical studies of vitamin C supplementation in patients with advanced cancers have had mixed results .
There are conflicting hypotheses , he explained .
One theory is that vitamin C supplementation protects the cancer and is therefore detrimental to the patient .
But there is also the opposite view , that vitamin C supplementation enhances the immune system or prevents indolent cancers from mutating more and becoming aggressive , which would be beneficial for the patient .
Asked to comment on this study , Len Lichtenfeld , MACP , deputy chief medical officer at the American Cancer Society said : “ Vitamin C has a long history in cancer prevention and treatment .
Although there is no evidence to demonstrate that vitamin C improves the outlook for patients with cancer , there are still reported observations that cancer patients continue to believe in the potential benefits of vitamin C. Although oncologists do not routinely recommend that patients with cancer take excessive doses of vitamin C , there are reports that cancer patients are being treated with vitamin C by alternative practitioners . ”
Once again , it must be emphasized that this is a study in cell culture and a mouse model ( in fact , much like the studies of Dr. Levine ) .
It ’s applicability to humans is not clear and requires testing .
However , it does bring up an issue .
Clinical trials are moving forward , spearheaded by Dr. Levine , of high dose intravenous vitamin C and cancer .
Granted , the doses he is using are many times higher than what was used in the study showing vitamin C interference with chemotherapy .
Also granted , Dr. Levine ’s study implicates reactive oxygen species generated by vitamin C when it is present in very high concentrations , while Dr. Heaney ’s study examined concentration ranges that are achievable with oral dosing .
It ’s not clear if the same results will apply .
So what to do ?
Dr. Heaney is cautious :
Lead author Mark Heaney , MD , PhD , from Memorial Sloan - Kettering Cancer Center , in New York , New York , told Medscape Oncology that he advises his cancer patients to avoid supplemental vitamin C during chemotherapy .
“ I recommend that my patients continue to eat a well - balanced diet that includes fruits and vegetables that contain vitamin C. ”
“ Such a diet could be expected to have moderate amounts of vitamin C as well as other important nutrients .
There are no data to suggest that vitamin C obtained from fruits and vegetables is intrinsically different from vitamin C supplements .
Given that our research was done in experimental model systems and was not a clinical trial , I am reluctant to predict a dose of supplemental vitamin C that could be extrapolated to our work .
That said , oral vitamin C supplementation with doses as low as 250 mg over a 1 - month period resulted in intracellular vitamin C concentrations in normal white blood cells that were close to those that we studied in white blood cell cancers , ” Dr. Heaney said .
One thing that concerns me about this study is that any clinical trial that will be carried out with vitamin C and cancer will be chemotherapy plus vitamin C , not just vitamin C alone .
After all , that ’s the standard methodology for testing a putative chemotherapeutic agent :
Add the experimental agent to standard of care chemotherapy .
Based on Dr. Heaney ’s result , a compelling case can be made that such a trial would be unethical , at least at the lower “ megadoses ” of vitamin C , because there is a plausible mechanism by which vitamin C might actually interfere with chemotherapy and thus do harm .
At the the super high doses of vitamin C , such as the ones that Dr. Levine studied , we do n’t know whether the vitamin C would interfere with chemotherapy based on a mechanism similar to that postulated in Dr. Heaney ’s study or whether it might potentiate the activity of chemotherapy by generating reactive oxygen species , as the results of Dr. Levine ’s studies might predict .
However , I would argue that any study of super high dose vitamin C a la Dr. Levine plus chemotherapy would also be unethical , unless animal and cell culture data could be produced that would show that vitamin C as such high concentrations does not interfere with chemotherapy .
Another thing that bugs me about this study is that it ’s another example of how the media reports anything having to do with Linus Pauling ’s idea that megadoses of vitamin C can treat cancer .
Whenever a study is reported that seems to be consistent with a use for vitamin C in treating cancer , almost inevitably it gets wide coverage .
When a study is reported that suggests that high dose vitamin C has no use or–even worse–may be harmful , you hear nothing about it .
Same as it ever was .
Esquire , December 1997
Radovan Karadzic is on the phone .
He is wounded and in search of a little understanding .
" Why does America hate me ? " he pleads .
" What did I do wrong ? "
The fugitive Bosnian Serb leader , indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal at The Hague in 1995 for genocide in the war that killed two hundred thousand people , sounds tired , with just a touch of whine , some manufactured outrage , and real fear in his toast - master 's voice .
His English is pretty good .
" How can they call me the worst war criminal in the world ? "
Things have gotten way out of hand .
It 's all a terrible misunderstanding .
Others are to blame .
" I was a moderate ! " he cries .
" We did n't kill any prisoners of war ! "
He never imagined that this day would come , and now he wants to meet somewhere and set things straight .
" I 'm not in charge .
I was n't in charge then .
I 'm not a magician ; I can't make more than a million
people follow me .
I can't stop them from committing acts of violence .
" Uugghh ! " he groans , exasperated .
" Where can I get a fair trial ?
They are spitting on me in America . "
" He 's got smoker 's foot , " Bosko's young wife says as her husband , a former New York City gangster , spurs our puny car around a dark mountain curve .
We 're on a road somewhere in Yugoslavia , slewing on thin tires downward toward an isolated border crossing into Bosnia , toward the town of Pale and Radovan Karadzic , whose thugs in the secret police are waiting for us on the other side .
Smoker 's foot ?
" His feet are numb .
The doctor says that if Bosko does n't stop smoking , they 'll have to cut them off . "
She turns toward me in the backseat , her blond hair cascading onto my hand .
" Promise me you 'll keep him from smoking . "
Our driver , Bosko Radonjich , fifty - four , a squat bear of a man with thick black hair and a mad , triumphant smile , is a fugitive from American justice .
He is wanted by the FBI for fixing the jury in the 1987 - racketeering and murder trial of his close friend John Gotti , head of the Gambino crime family .
Bosko , through a Serb , was also a boss of the Westies , the murderous Irish gang that served as enforcers for the Gambino family and controlled a good chunk of New York 's West Side in the 1980s .
Bosko fled the United Stets in 1990 , just weeks before Gotti and several associates were indicted again .
The Serbian mafia that Bosko currently runs out of Belgrade has won him certain privileges and some very powerful friends .
During the Bosnian war , he provided Karadzic and the deadly Serb paramilitary with millions of dollars in cash and weaponry and became one of Karadzic 's close advisers .
Now Bosko has a secret plan to save Karadzic , the man he describes as " my angel , my saint , " but time is running out .
He 's afraid that it might be too late already .
Tim Buckholz , an ex-U.S. Army Special Forces soldier , is squeezed in beside me on the backseat .
Seventeen years on covert missions for your government .
Now he 's a freelancer and considers Bosko his friend .
Buckholz does n't look military .
His hair is sandy , his face kind , almost innocent .
In 1978 , when he was eighteen , he was an army medic assigned to bag bodies in Guyana after the Jonestown mass suicide .
The Special Forces sent him to school to knock the military out of his gait and speech .
He specialized in counterterrorism , hostage rescue , and close - quarters combat .
I am here to talk to Karadzic , who , until very recently , was the least sought , most wanted war criminal in the world .
Why does a psychiatrist wake up one morning and decide it 's time to kill his neighbors ?
And how has he managed to keep the world at bay ?
Two weeks ago , NATO came calling , and a British team killed indicted war criminal and Karadzic crony Simo Drljaca , the police chef of Prijedor , in a botched snatch attempt .
The White House had given the green light , and another indicted war criminal was successfully captured the same day .
Just days before , Karadzic was breezing through NATO checkpoints in his Mercedes .
I am also here because I happened to meet Tim a couple of years ago at the Pub , a netherlounge of military spooks , conspiracists , and soldiers for hire , just outside Fort Bragg , North Carolina , Tim invited me to Belgrade to meet Bosko , who wants to broker a meeting with Karadzic .
The last time Bosko escorted an American to visit Karadzic was when Jimmy Carter came to negotiate a cease - fire during the Bosnian war .
This time , Bosko wants to prove again that he's an international fixer , and he seems to think that my story will give Karadzic a new reputation .
At the border , the three of us get out of Bosko's Honda .
It is 3:30 A.M. , pitch - black , and the early August air is damp and chilly .
Bosko's wife , Sabrina , turns around and heads back into Yugoslavia .
Their car has Florida license plates .
" I could have FUCK USA on my license plate , but I do n't , because I love America , " Bosko growls in his gravelly Serbo - New Yorker accent .
" Even though the cocksuckers betrayed me . "
Bosko steps gingerly .
" Damn , my feet hurt . "
His hand is on my elbow , steering me toward the crossing .
Up ahead is a guard shack is illuminated by a milky , fluorescent light .
Tim walks behind us , covering our backs .
Two armed Yugoslav guards step toward us .
They each , in turn , hug Bosko and kiss him on both cheeks .
Tim and I produce our American passports .
Bosko , wearing tennis shoes with no socks , shiny sweatpants , and a jacket with BOSS emblazoned across the front , never bothers to show his papers .
We walk across the border toward a Volkswagen Golf idling in the darkness .
We are now inside the self - declared Republika Srpska , an " ethnically cleansed " area the size of Vermont that is home to nine hundred thousand Serbs .
To a nationalist like Bosko , this land , blood - soaked by war , is Palestine .
He has dreamed his whole life of a Serbian state independent of Yugoslavia .
Tim has stood on this border before .
In 1994 , when the Serbs were winning the Bosnian war and when Yugoslavia was trying to convince the world that it was n't helping them do it , the United Nations Security Council hired independent contractors like Tim to monitor this very crossing .
Only medical supplies , food , and used clothing were allowed through .
Unless , of course , you were a VIP or a smuggler .
That 's when Tim and Bosko first came to an understanding .
Along with a handful of other ex-Special Forces soldiers on the same detail , Tim became sort of an honorary Serb nationalist .
As an unpaid favor to Bosko , in his spare time he helped train several bodyguards for Karadzic , who was just being isolated by the West as the Maximum Villain of the war .
" It was standard executive - protection training , " Tim says .
" Route planning , countersurveillance , that kind of thing . "
Did they follow your advice ?
Tim raises an eyebrow .
" He has n't been caught yet . "
At the end of his last stay here , in July 1995 , Tim was asked to leave Yugoslavia , having been informed by the U.S. State Department that his safety could no longer be guaranteed .
Why not ?
" Because of my association with Bosko .
The chief of the mission asked , ' Do you know who you 're dealing with ?
This is the man who fixed the Gotti trial .
He 's been convicted of blowing up embassies in America .
He was involved in Jimmy Hoffa 's murder . ' "
Tim 's response : Cool .
As we head down a winding mountain road into the strange new country of Srpska , we are being tailed .
" Friend or foe ? "
Tim asks , checking the headlights behind us .
" Friend , " Bosko affirms .
Earlier that night , at Club Boss , his mountain casino an hour from the border , Bosko told me that we'd be escorted by a " war criminal " into the Serb enclave .
" They hate Americans down there , " Bosko said .
" Nobody is safe .
I 'll need to go with you . "
When I asked Bosko the name of our resort , he traced a finger down the middle of his face and across his lips — the mob sign meaning silence .
In the aftermath of a war with mass murderers on all sides , men who committed unspeakable atrocities , that any one man 's name could inspire such caution , even in someone like Bosko , chilled the room .
In the escort car behind us now is that faceless , nameless war criminal .
He is providing us safe passage into the darkness of Srpska .
Dogs , yelping wildly , race our car into the sleeping town of Visegrad , where we see in the beam of our headlights the face of Karadzic .
Blown up poster - size , it is pasted on every shopwindow .
His silver hair , usually an unruly bouffant , has been combed ; the cleft in his chin looks the size of a bullet hole .
In red , under each of these color portraits , are the words DON'T TOUCH HIM !
Karadzic is hiding out somewhere in this country , protected by his most trusted soldiers , surrounded by mines and antiaircraft weapons .
Bosko says that Karadzic has ten different hideouts .
Eight thousand American soldiers are currently in Bosnia , the largest continent in a NATO force of thirty - one thousand .
Even though Washington denies it , Tim believes that an American snatch team has been training secretly since the spring to bring him in .
Karadzic has instructed his guards to shoot him rather than allow him to be captured .
Visegard , a garrison of hard - line Serbs , was one of the first towns to be cleansed of its Muslims .
Fourteen thousand just vanished , deported or executed in the summer of 1992 .
A laboratory of killing , Bosko calls it .
My homework , he calls it .
He does n't say what he means by that , but he knows this town .
Visegrad is where he went to school as a boy .
Our driver turns down an alley and stops at a bar called Cafe 10 .
A half dozen men , mostly former soldiers and paramilitary men , step out of the darkness .
Each one greets Bosko with an embrace and a kiss .
It 's 4:00 A.M. , but they have kept the lights burning for us .
Inside , we crowd into a corner booth .
Our driver pulls out his wallet .
I see the flicker of his secret - police badge .
No one uses names , and it is understood that we are not to ask .
The bartender opens a bottle of slivovitz , the local homemade plum brandy .
Tim , who is not much of a drinker , figures it 's 400 proof .
Even Bosko must hammer his chest with every swallow .
After three shots , Bosko throws a heavy arm around me .
" You 'll put in a good word for me with our friends in Virginia when you return , " he says .
" You know , Bosko , " I answer carefully , " the CIA no longer recruits journalists or priests . "
Still , he slides the bottle of slivovitz over me to consecrate the moment .
" You are the voice of America , " he says , pulling me closer .
" You can help the Doctor .
My angel is getting bad advice .
It 's my advice he needs .
I know the double game .
America is after him , but these fuckers here are ready to kill Americans if they try it .
We need to convince America that Radovan Karadzic is the only hope for stability in this whole fucking godforsaken country .
We need to show the whole world the good man he is . "
Bosko raises his glass .
" Somebody put dirt on the Doctor , " he says .
" We 've got to make the Doctor clean .
You put in a good word for me and make me clean , too . "
It 's almost dawn , and Bosko Radonjich , John Gotti 's fixer , wants to mediate this grave international crisis .
He wants to save Karadzic .
He wants to save American lives .
But most of all , he wants to save himself .
He wants to go home to New York , where he lived in a $ 5 million townhouse on the East Side and drove a Rolls - Royce Corniche .
He misses his " work " for the CIA , and he surely does n't want to be here if the war breaks out again .
The Serbs at the table seem not to comprehend Bosko's agenda .
They are soldiers in a lost war , unready to concede defeat , willing to kill again , expecting to kill again .
They sit now with their arms draped easily over one another 's shoulders , their young faces spent and teeth broken .
" If they try to snatch Karadzic , that is war , " says a young Serb quietly , not a hint of bravado in his voice .
" We will kill every soldier we see .
We will pile American bodies to the sky .
We 'll start with you if we have to . "
At daybreak , having killed only two bottles of slivovitz , we leave the bar .
Mist is rising off the Drina River , which runs through the heart of Visegrad .
A massive stone bridge , built in 1510 by Turks during the days of the Ottoman Empire , spans the river 's jade water .
At one end of the bridge is Bosko's old school .
" Do n't let the beauty fool you , " Bosko says as we drive over the bridge .
So many Muslims — he calls them Turks — were executed on this stone bridge during the war that the Drina turned red .
And I now see in the hills beyond the bridge what had been hidden from view in the night .
" Them is all the houses of Turks , " Bosko says sleepily .
Each charred house is a tombstone .
We pass hundreds in the hills above the Drina .
Tim , seated again beside me in the backseat , checks for the tail car , but the faceless war criminal is no longer behind us .
Bosko snores in the front seat as our driver races at drunken speeds toward our rendezvous with Karadzic .
In the mountain village of Pale , the seat of Karadzic 's power , the Minister of Fear plants three kisses on Bosko , Serbian style , one on each cheek and then back to the first .
As head of the Republic of Srpska secret police , Dragan Kijac is one of the most feared men in the country .
Bosko introduces Tim and then me .
" This is Daniel .
He was with me and the Irish in New York , " he says , lying .
" So you want to see Dr. Karadzic ?
If only you had come a few days earlier , " the minister says , stiffing us fast .
" Now even I can not know where he is . "
The minister , who looks a bit like Bobby Kennedy , is saying something else to me in Serbo - Croatian .
" He wants to know , " Bosko translates , " how big is the circulation of your magazine ? "
His final words to me before this meeting had been " Lie , lie , lie — everything is a double game . "
" Seven million , " I answer .
The Minister of Fear , who I suspect speaks perfect English , raises his eyebrows , impressed .
But then I falter .
" Well , uh , actually , it 's a couple million , if you count , like , people who , you know , pick it up in bus . . . "
I do n't dare look up .
I can feel Bosko's glare , his disappointment .
" And he 'll appear on TV , " he says confidently , stepping in .
" CNN , CBS , all the networks .
He 's the greatest writer about postwar countries .
He is the voice of America . "
The Minister of Fear shakes his head .
A period of awkward silence follows .
Tim , who has been sitting quietly nearby , playing the role of my bodyguard , reaches for his business card .
In America , Tim is a partner in Spartan Security out of Mamers , North Carolina .
Recently , his firm , made up of a couple of other ex-Special Forces buddies , bought a $ 45,000 copier and added " International " to its name .
Now Tim is after high - stakes contracts .
The first proposal Spartan printed on the new copier is entitled " Current Training Programs Available to Serb People . "
" Right now , America is arming your enemies , " he tells the Minister of Fear .
" Hell , former associates of mine are training the Muslims and Croats with $ 100 million from the United States .
When the American troops leave here next summer , you 're going to be slaughtered .
It 'll be Serb season . "
For Tim , it 's an avalanche of words .
It 's his Hail Mary pass , a way to save me and sign up a client .
Tim 's prospectus offers " cutting - edge hostage - rescue and surgical - strike operations " and proposes training for " worst - case scenarios . "
With forty thousand police on his payroll , the largest armed force in the Republic of Srpska , the minister perks up .
" I live one step away from treason , " Tim winks .
The Minister of Fear directs us to a ruin of a hotel at the top of the mountain , Hotel Paranoia , where we are to await further instructions .
At twilight , we settle into a room .
Tim opens a window .
Outside , NATO helicopters are flying patterns over Pale .
And higher up , Tim figures , there are at least four satellites watching this area .
Bosko hunches down in front of me .
I 've been kicking myself since we left the Minister of Fear .
" So you fuck up , " he says .
" Forget about it . "
The phone rings and Bosko answers , switching between Serbo - Croatian and English .
" That was Karadzic , " Bosko says , hanging up .
Former U.S. assistant secretary of state Richard Holbrooke is touring Bosnia , trying to salvage his Dayton Peace Accord , and he is making Karadzic 's life hell .
Our meeting has been postponed .
" But he 's got a package for you , " Bosko says .
" Something he wants you to advise him on .
He 'll call you next week at the casino . "
Bosko is in pain .
" You have to help me , " he says .
There is fear in his eyes .
He 's very worried about his feet .
He wants to be healthy for our meetings with Karadzic .
We are now in Zlatibor , a spa on the Yugoslavian side of the mountains .
He 's been getting therapy for his feet here all summer .
" The capillaries have all collapsed , " his doctor tells him as Bosko pulls of his shoes and stretches out on the bed , his feet naked .
A nurse hooks Bosko up to a machine that sends electric pulses into his feet .
" He 's only fifty - four years old , " says the doctor , shaking her head .
" We do n't amputate the feet here .
They do that in Belgrade . "
Bosko's feet are numb , swollen , and blue .
But he is in good cheer , and the staff of women , all wearing white , brighten when they see him .
He introduces me .
" This is Danny .
He 's writing the screenplay about my life .
He knows things about me I forgot . "
After these treatments , we wrap ourselves in towels and head into the Truth Sauna , where no lies can be told .
He 's not talking of Bosnia , but of New York and the mob .
" When Eddie came back from Attica , " Bosko says , " he put a cock on the bar .
Somebody 's fucking cock he had cut off .
' Anybody who be a stool pigeon , ' " he says , affecting an Irish brogue , " ' will be like this . "
That 's what Eddie says .
Shit , the Irish were good killers . "
Bosko believes that if we understand New York mobs , we 'll understand Bosnia .
Maybe even the world .
It 's his Hell 's Kitchen school of diplomacy .
" America is the Boss of Bosses , " Bosko says .
" The Serbs , Croats , and Muslims are three rival gangs — no matter who started the damn thing , everyone has spilled blood .
When you have a turf war like this , you separate the gangs .
That 's why Dayton wo n't work .
You do n't ask them to live together .
Not after boundaries have been set in fresh blood . "
Bosko is not one to offer up his own history easily , but in these Truth Saunas , I hear of his relationship with death , a relationship that started early , with the killing of his father , who was shot by communist police when Bosko was a toddler .
Soon after , his brother was imprisoned for his anticommunist beliefs , and then one day came a knock at the door .
Bosko and his older sister were home when the secret police entered .
The two agents wore black trench coats ; they had pistols .
They were in the basement , scraping the walls .
" They were looking for a radio transmitter , a channel to America .
I was just a kid .
I did n't ' know what they meant .
I thought maybe behind our wall there was a long tunnel across the ocean . "
Finding nothing , the police pistol - whipped Bosko's sister .
Two days later , she died from a blood clot .
Whenever he needs fuel to fight , Bosko remembers that scene .
When he was twenty - seven , he fled to America .
" Without America , the world is shit , do you understand ? " he says .
" Without that dream , without that beautiful fucking Constitution . "
Granted political asylum , he arrived in Manhattan , Hell 's Kitchen , in 1970 and joined New York 's Serbian underground , becoming an explosives expert .
In 1979 , Bosko pleaded guilty to bombing the Yugoslav consulate in Chicago and served three years in Allenwood Federal Prison in Pennsylvania .
He got out of jail in 1982 and soon after took over the Westies .
" If you 're a freedom fighter , " he says , " you have to love the Irish . "
After the sauna , Bosko cannonballs into the swimming pool .
Suddenly , out of nowhere , his former high school teacher arrives poolside with two glasses and a guitar , pours us slivovitz , and , in honor of Bosko's American patriotism , strums " When the Saints Go Marching In . "
At his Casino the next evening , Bosko sits near the piano and plays host to a constant parade of customs officials , Serbian film stars , military judges , basketball stars , cops , and war criminals .
All come to pay homage and to seek favors of the man they call Boss .
A young Serb , returning from South of Africa , unfurls the gist of a zebra skin .
Tonight , Bosko cooks spaghetti for twenty .
Before dinner , he makes everyone watch Getting Gotti , a video that tells the story of how Bosko's jury tampering kept the crime boss from going to prison in 1987 .
" The actor playing me looks like Boris Fucking Yeltsin , " he complains .
Three weeks after Bosko left America in 1990 , Gotti was arrested again .
Sammy " the Bull " Gravano , the number - two man in the organization , later turned state 's evidence .
Gotti was eventually convicted of ordering the murder of Paul Castellano , his former boss in the Gambino family , and was sent away for life without parole .
Gravano also testified that Bosko had paid $ 60,000 to a member of Gotti 's first jury , a man named George Pape .
Pape had been an usher at Bosko's wedding , had testified on Bosko's behalf in his Chicago trial , and had visited him in prison .
" There were people in high places who knew that he was my best friend , " Bosko says .
" Somebody wanted Pape on that jury , just like somebody wants Karadzic in power .
One man does not hold off the superpowers of the world unless someone wants him to remain in power . "
Belmondo , one of Bosko's self - named errand boys , joins us for dinner .
He has a pistol in his waistband and the swagger of a young thug on the make .
Also slurping spaghetti at our table is a man with a pronounced underbite who is known as Mr. Fun .
A former police chef and bamboo - furniture executive , Mr. Fun always wears a suit and will cross a room to light a lady 's cigarette .
For laughs , he slaps his face like Curly and stuffs his necktie into his mouth .
On the Hague list of indictments , he is murderer number seventy - four .
I have a copy of the list .
Mr. Fun circles his name for me .
When Karadzic finally phones , a waiter whispers the news into Bosko's ear .
Bosko waves me through swinging doors into the casino 's back room .
" I knew Daniel back in New York , " Bosko lies into the receiver .
" He was with Mr. Gotti .
He 's a journalist now — on TV , in the magazines .
You must tell them you 're a friend of America , that you are anticommunist you whole life .
It 's only in America that you could get a fair trial . "
He hands me the phone : " Say hello to Dr. Karadzic . "
This is strange .
Somewhere , the most wanted man in the world has found the comfort to chat on the phone .
I look at the receiver for a moment .
" Hello ? "
" I was sorry I did n't have the pleasure of seeing you in Pale , " he tells me .
No satellites could scramble the energy out of that voice .
" I 've been having a few security problems . "
He asks about the package he sent : " You read my blue book .
What did you think ? "
His gift had been an advance copy of The Case of Dr. Radovan Karadzic , a defense written on his behalf .
In the literature of shifting responsibility , it is a masterpiece .
Truly the thinking of a psychiatrist , a man whose specialties were depression and paranoia , a man who once hypnotized the entire Sarajevo soccer team .
" Dr. Karadzic , I wonder what 's not in the book .
In order to indict you , The Hague must have strong evidence . "
" They arrested two Serbs , took them to The Hague , and then had to send them home , " he says .
" They had the wrong men .
And another one they sent home for lack of evidence .
The Hague is a political institution .
They respond to pressure .
They make mistakes . "
A number of legal scholars had told me that the second indictment against Karadzic , for the massacre at Srebrenica in July 1995 , in which as many as eight thousand Muslim civilian men were executed , will be very difficult to prove .
In his book Karadzic is eager to implicate Slobodan Milosevic , the president of Yugoslavia , for devising and carrying out the military plan that led to the genocide , No wonder he is afraid for his life .
The threat he poses to Milosevic , or any of the other leaders America has kept off the Hague list , could earn him a bullet from anyone .
Even his own people .
He says he wants to meet but explains that he can't appear to grant an interview .
" He says I ca n't talk . "
Who says ?
" Richard Holbrooke . "
" Is the promising you something if you stay quiet ? "
There is silence on the other end .
" Do you trust him ? "
Bosko is whispering into my other ear .
Tell him you 're a psychiatrist , too .
Tim has told me that every syllable of this conversation is being sifted somewhere , analyzed .
Somewhere , an analyst can hear the fear in Karadzic 's voice .
Even on the phone , I can feel it in his breath .
This is a man counting his days .
Recalling that he likes chess , I suggest a game .
" The loser goes to The Hague , " I say .
He laughs .
" I 'm very good at chess . "
Finally , he says , " If you wanted to do a fact - finding mission . . . "
Yes , I say , yes , a fact - finding mission sounds perfect .
" That would n't be regarded as an interview . "
Absolutely not .
There 's a real distinction .
" When we meet , you can ask me anything .
You , of course , ca n't say that you were here . "
This is Bosnia , and everything is a double game .
It was all a matter of language , of finally detecting the nuance of what he was driving toward .
I pass the phone back to Bosko .
Karadzic tells him , " We will have to blindfold Daniel , and he 'll have to walk deep into the mountains . "
" He 'll go naked if that 's what it takes , " Bosko tells him as he hangs up .
We can't tell the Minister of Fear about this , Bosko says , turning to me .
" It would make trouble . "
This means we have no guarantee of safe passage across the territory .
In fact , now we have to evade the secret police .
Tim opts to stay behind .
" By now , they 'll have checked up on me , " he says .
" My background is just too suspicious .
If they think we 're a snatch team , we 're all dead . "
He kindly instructs me on what to expect from Karadzic 's security detail .
" They 'll most likely put a hood on you .
They 'll remove your watch , electronics , anything where a transmitter can be squirreled away .
And they 'll make you change clothes .
They 'll be worried about magic dust .
The KGB used to use a kind of radioactive dust when they were trailing people in Washington . "
I 'm a little worried and do n't quite know what to say .
I have gotten used to Tim watch my back .
" It 's in their best interest for you to come out alive , " he says , punching my arm .
" Just do n't do anything stupid . "
Bosko and I hit the road again that night , leaving the casino at 2:00 A.M. Karadzic 's voice compels us forward .
Belmondo , the wiry thug who during the war was in the deadliest Serb paramilitary , is riding shotgun .
We 're in a black jeep , heading back into Srpska .
" This is a black operation , " Bosko says .
" Nobody can know we 're going in . "
Again we arrive at Hotel Paranoia , following Karadzic 's instructions .
I am trapped with Bosko and Belmondo in a room with orange bedspreads .
Karadzic will contact us with the next move .
From our window , I watch refugees picking mushrooms on the ski slope .
The next day , we do n't venture from our room , wary of alerting the Minister of Fear that we are here .
Bosko is lying supine , with his feet up on a pillow .
An arm covers his eyes , and he is moaning in pain as he drifts in and out of sleep .
It is more than either Belmondo or I can bear .
Something must be done .
We flip a coin .
I lose .
" I 'm going to try to put some life back in these dogs , " I tell Bosko .
Back at the casino , during off - hours , I had seen a Serb bartender take out a bottle of slivovitz , the good stuff , and pour it over Bosko's feet before he began to massage them .
My technique is not so inventive .
I drape a white towel over Bosko's feet .
He winces at first as I dig my thumbs into the ball of his foot , but then he begins to relax .
" When I was a boy , I had a dog named Jack , " he says .
" One day , a cop asks me the dog 's name .
I tell him , you know , ' It 's Jack . '
The copy says , ' That 's a fucking capitalist name . '
He takes out his pistol .
He shoots Jack . "
And with that Bosko's eyes roll back and he is snoring .
Belmondo and I wait a few minutes , and then , despite Bosko's warning to stay out of sight , we head to the hotel bar , dying for a drink .
We order and look up to see that seated not twenty feet away , with a blond at his side , is the Minister of Fear .
He has a wary smile and lifts his hand slightly .
Belmondo orders a drink for the minister , who , leaving his date behind , walks over and joins us .
He speaks smugly in Serbo - Croatian .
" He is sorry that your interview with the Doctor is not possible , " Belmondo translates .
" Please call again in a year . "
The minister sniffs , downs his drink , and returns to his table .
Belmondo and I finish our drinks .
It 's over .
Upstairs , we lie in the dark , listening to Bosko snore .
Neither of us wants to wake up and deliver the awful news .
So you fuck up .
Those are Bosko's first words in the morning , said with a devil 's smile .
Forget about it .
No one knows about our meeting except us and Karadzic .
Bosco says he 's sure .
" I hear his voice .
Only me .
And you . "
At the gates of Karadzic 's compound later that day , Bosko and I are surrounded by soldiers , all heavily armed and wearing bulletproof vests .
A guard asks for identification .
" My cock is the only identification you 'll ever need ! " Bosko thunders .
The guard retreats into his shack and dials the rotary phone .
When he comes out again , his hands are up in apology .
And now a hand is gently on each of our backs , ushering us in .
Karadzic 's compound is the Famos truck factory .
Inside , everyone is on high alert .
But no one has taken away my backpack yet .
No naked trek through the mountains .
No magic dust .
We 're walking in .
We 're escorted past another guard station and then upstairs and down a hall to the end office .
Karadzic 's office .
A very familiar photo of him is on the wall .
His secretary hands me a document
She says it was drafted last night by Dr. Karadzic himself .
Reading it , I am at first puzzled :
COMMITMENT
I , Daniel Scott Voll , herein confirm that I have made a commitment concerning my visit to the Republic of Srpska , as follows :
I have been in a " fact of finding mission " in the Republic of Srpska .
During the visit , I have met Dr. Radovan Karadzic under strict conditions that he give me only some knowledge useful for my mission , and that under no conditions can I quote him , or publish any kind of interview , because he forbids to be interviewed , or considered to be interviewed .
I have made this commitment with my full moral and material responsibility .
This was the double game at its best .
Even I had to wonder , upon signing it , if I had perhaps already met Karadzic .
" Do we get to see him now ? " I ask , looking into Karadzic 's office .
" Come back next Tuesday , " I am told .
Bosko takes a copy of the letter from Karadzic 's secretary , rolls it up , and walks out , holding it as if he were the Statue of Liberty .
He 's one step closer to his dream .
Brokering peace .
Winning a get - out - of - jail - free card .
Me , I want this business over with .
Sick with a hacking cough and a fever a few nights later , I fear I am becoming as toxic as this place .
" I know just what you need , " Bosko says , and off we go , driving hours through the rainy night to Belgrade for the after - midnight floor show at Club Lotus , a red-velvet den of iniquity on the Danube .
The place was an SS bordello during World War II .
Bosko owns it now .
The Exhibitionist is dancing in the cage , doing her striptease .
In an effort to cure my fever , Bosko orders snifters of warm cognac , and after I 've had a couple , he offers his apartment upstairs for the night .
He 'll sleep elsewhere , he says .
At 4:00 a.m. , sleeping fitfully , I hear a key turn in the door .
Footfalls cross the floor .
And then a hand on my shoulder , touching me lightly .
Now a hand on my face .
I turn over , disoriented , and then I see these legs , beautiful , long legs , dancer 's legs , sheathed in black silk .
The Exhibitionist .
A finger against my lips .
In this light , away from the stage , I see the circles , like bruises , under her eyes .
He kisses my cheeks , kneels beside me .
" I'm your bodyguard . "
" I do n't need a bodyguard . "
" Bosko says you do . "
" Did Bosko send you ? "
" I told him I wanted to come and see you . "
" But he gave you the key . "
" Yes .
And he told me not to fall in love or he would kill me . "
Now both her hands are touching my face .
I close my eyes and take a deep breath .
She lies on top of me .
" I had a boyfriend once before the war , " she says quietly .
Her mouth is on my lips , my neck .
And then her head is resting on my chest .
Her mother , she tells me , is a Serb , her father a Croat .
Her Serb boyfriend was killed during the war .
Her brother fought for the Croats .
She 'd worked as an interpreter for the UN before she started dancing for Bosko .
" He is my protector , my daddy . "
And then she adds softly , " Be careful of Bosko . "
" Do not underestimate how dangerous this world is , " Bosko says the next day as we stroll through downtown Belgrade , trailed by his male bodyguard .
" We are surrounded by killers . "
Bosko is waiting for the details of last night .
I can see it in his sly smile .
He likes to get folks dirty .
He once got a rival gangster in New York addicted to cocaine , took him right out of the picture .
He likes to control his world .
But when I remain silent , he takes a different tack .
" You 're a good boy , " he says .
" I taught you well . "
I stop walking .
He wanted to set me up .
" Fuck you , Bosko .
I 'm not going to play your game anymore .
I 'll go to Karadzic myself .
Or I 'll go home . "
He shrugs .
Lights a cigarette .
Squints .
" Bosko , what did you mean that Visegrad was your homework ? "
" It 's a joke .
Like when I say , ' I want a donkey to fuck you . '
It 's a joke . "
I 'm sick of jokes .
This morning , my editor in New York faxed me a newspaper article about a killer names Lukic from Visegrad .
According to the article , Lukic is responsible for killing more Muslims with his bare hands than any other individual in the war .
Lukic has been so well protected that no journalist has ever seen him .
" Bosko , do you know Milan Lukic ? "
He stops , waves his bodyguard away .
For a moment , he 's off - balance .
" It 's no good to say his name out loud .
Them 's killers . "
" Do you know him ? "
" Sure , I know him .
So do you .
Lukic arranged for your safety the first night we crossed into Bosnia . "
" What ? "
Now I am off - balance .
" He is the one I called to make sure you would be safe .
He was in the tail car , " Bosko says .
" You sat with him on our last trip across the border .
At the café in Visegrad .
He bought you coffee .
You liked him . "
Bosko grits his teeth ; a cloud passes over his eyes .
" Do n't fuck up , Daniel .
You are here for Karadzic , not Milan . "
He pauses , lights another cigarette .
He is shaking his head , watching me .
" I do things wrong , yes .
Maybe I killed .
Maybe I did other things .
But Karadzic is honest .
I know devil .
He is inside me .
But Karadzic is angel to my people .
" But he was president during the entire war , " I say .
" His own blue book shows that he had command control .
And what about Srebrenica ?
If a mob boss orders a hit , he 's still guilty of murder , even if he did n't pull the trigger . "
" He did n't know all the killings would happen . "
" How do you know ? "
" I know goddamnit ! "
On the night before we are to meet Karadzic , American troops storm the Minister of Fear 's police barracks in several towns along the Bosnian border .
Crowds are retaliating with stones and firebombs .
Tim calls from America , worried .
Do n't go back to Srpska , he warns .
Bosko composes a fax to Karadzic , telling him that we have information vital to his safety and that he must still meet with us .
The double game .
" It 's the only way to get his attention , " Bosko says .
An hour later , at Bosko's apartment above Club Lotus , the phone rings .
It 's Karadzic .
" It 's a very bad time , " Karadzic says before hanging up .
" This is not a safe phone .
Be in Pale tomorrow .
My office will make the arrangement . "
" We 're going to need some protection down there , " Bosko says to me .
" They 're handing out long guns . "
I am Bosko's hostage .
For the first time , I feel like I am in trouble .
The jeep has been making a clanking sound since we left Belgrade .
I have ignored it , but now , on a dangerous mountain road , Bosko makes me pull over .
Almost all the lug nuts have been sheared off our wheels .
" Sabatoge , " Bosko says .
" Because of you .
I saved your life . "
As we approach Pale , Bosko's sources report that Italian troops , who control this NATO sector , have a snatch team on the ground , ready to move on Karadzic .
Everyone is on snatch alert .
We turn a corner and face the cannon of a tank .
Armored personnel carriers and UN trucks with whip antennae are parked on overlooks .
We are invited inside Karadzic 's compound for dinner , which is served in a private salon by waiters in black tie .
Brandy is poured .
Our hosts for the evening are Karadzic 's Ministers of Rationalization and Denial .
" If they storm the compound , we 'll give you a gun , " one says , smiling .
" You 'll have to shoot the Italians . "
" Dr. Karadzic sends his apologies , " says the Minister of Denial .
He is unavailable and has asked me to provide you whatever help you need . "
The rumor is that Karadzic has fled to another country , at least temporarily .
Bosko lectures the ministers in English .
Their strategy is all wrong .
" He 's charged with genocide — you can't rationalize genocide !
You can't hide from that charge ! " he yells .
" He 's got to show his face to America !
Show his heart !
It can make him clean ! "
The Ministers of Rationalization and Denial trade nervous glances .
The Yugoslav border guard asks me to step away from the jeep .
My visa has expired .
I cannot leave Srpska .
Bosko shrugs .
It 's dark .
" It 's Friday night .
It might take me a couple days to get you out .
I 'll start making some calls in the morning .
Belmondo will stay behind with you . "
As we get into a border guard 's car for the complimentary ride back into Visegrad , Belmondo turns to me : " You 're chief , I 'm security . "
Milan Lukic sits on the terrace of his café , which commands a view of downtown .
He is surrounded by cops .
" Milan trusts no one , " Belmondo as we climb the stairs .
" We must let him know we 're here . "
The last time they met , Lukic kissed Belmondo on both cheeks .
Now he gives him only a slight nod .
Wearing shirtsleeves , jeans , tennis shoes , the Butcher of Visegrad does n't look remarkable .
He is in his thirties , tall , with an athletic build , just a little fleshy under the chin .
He runs his hand through his hair .
The cops talk in whispers .
Belmondo is very nervous .
Without Bosko , the rules have changed .
Whatever his own killing tally , he is no match for this crowd .
During the cleansing , Lukic walked these streets with a megaphone , exhorting , " Rise up , Serb brothers .
Kill the Muslims . "
He killed thousands .
Most of his work was done on the bridge .
Daily , he would herd groups of Muslims there , garrote or shoot them , and laugh maniacally .
So many bodies were swept downriver that the dam clogged .
He incinerated hundreds more inside their houses .
Lukic is not on the published Hague list ; investigators may never even reach Visegrad .
Hhis terror was not limited to this town .
At Srebrenica , survivors remember Lukic requesting refugee Muslims from Visegrad .
Now Lukic walks over , taps Belmondo on the shoulder , directs him inside , where they sit alone .
I hear anger in Lukic 's voice .
He wants to know why Belmondo has brought this American back here .
When Belmondo comes out , he puts a hand on my shoulder and says quietly , " We must go , Friendo . "
I risk a last look at Lukic .
He nods his head , smiles , and shows his teeth .
They are discolored , pushed slightly inward , shark 's teeth .
We take a room at a hotel in the hills above the town .
Filled with amputees , mostly war veterans here for therapy in natural sulfur pools , this is Hotel Sorrow .
On a terrace a few hundred yards downhill , accompanied by an accordion , an aging blond sings Serb nationalist songs .
We join them , and Belmondo begins downing drinks .
" I am not a quisling , " he keeps repeating .
" I was in the underground .
I spend seven years fighting for this country .
What the fuck do I have to show for it ? "
The blond singer comes to our table , and Belmondo gives her a hundred deutsche marks to keep her singing .
A circle of veterans joins us .
All seems lost to them but the words to these melancholy war songs .
A man with bushy red hair tilts his head back like a hungry bird and sings , his voice barely audible .
Another man puts his hand on my shoulder before we leave and says , " Please give my heart to Dr. Karadzic . "
Belmondo is smashed and tries to pick up the hotel receptionist .
He tells her that during the war , he once killed four Muslims upriver and then returned to this hotel to sleep .
A few hours later , he knocks on my door , appearing sober .
He tells me he is afraid Lukic will come in the night and kill us .
" Much paranoia " Belmondo says .
" Milan much paranoia . "
Neither of us has slept .
" We can walk across the border , " he offers .
" You and me .
I know a secret route along the river .
I know it from the war . "
Yes , I say .
I want to leave .
I do n't want to die in Hotel Sorrow .
Back at Bosko's casino in the mountains of Yugoslavia , I am packing to leave .
" Always he has been in the company of killers , " his wife , Sabrina , says .
" In New York , forget about it , they were all killers .
When I met Bosko , he thought I was a spy .
Sabrina was born in Zagreb .
" Is n't it strange , Super Serb marries a Croat ? "
They met at the Women 's National Republican Club across from Rockefeller Center in New York , where Bosko had an office .
She was a concert pianist , spoke six languages , and modeled on the side .
After Bosko fled America , she sold their townhouse and followed him here .
" I felt sorry for him , " she says .
I apologize for keeping Bosko away on the night of their tenth anniversary .
" During the war , " she said , " he would be gone for weeks . "
Doing what ?
" Operations .
He was training .
I had my own work . "
Sabrina points to a hotel up on the hill .
" During the war , I ran the casino up there .
Some nights , I had $ 250,000 in my pocket , and I 'd carry three pistols .
The town was full of soldiers then . "
She pauses .
She is struggling with something .
" Daniel , the night before Srebrenica , Bosko and I had two hundred soldiers locked in the casino , all of them wearing black masks .
Nobody in town could know they were here .
They left in the night .
There were buses and bulldozers . "
She gets quiet , looks away .
" It was awful . "
Then she hands me a photo of a magnificent rottweiler .
" The dog is a trophy from Srebrenica .
I got her as a gift . "
I am just beginning to comprehend what she has told me :
This place had been a staging area for the worst massacre in Europe since World War II .
" Only five living creatures were left when it was over .
The dog was one of them . "
She looks at the picture , and her face brightens .
" Is n't she beautiful ? "
My bus to the airport departs from Uzice , the town where Bosko was born and spent his childhood and where his family was killed .
As we stand at the station , he looks at me grimly .
His grand plan has failed in every respect .
When I last spoke to Karadzic , Bosko's angel sounded to me like an unsaved man , a man trying desperately to compose some contemporary version of the Nuremburg defense , a man signing off as the world closed in .
Bosko stands facing me now and looks himself to be unsaved .
He could n't save Gotti , can't save Karadzic , wo n't be able to save himself .
As we were escaping Visegrad , Belmondo told me a few things .
He said that Bosko is furious that I came to know of his familiarity and ease with such a prolific killer as Milan Lukic .
Bosko meant to show me one thing , but instead he showed me another .
By introducing me to this world of killers , he knows that he has made Karadzic frighteningly comprehensible .
And he fears that I 'm actually not CIA , as he had continued to believe , and that there 's a chance my handlers at Langley wo n't come through with that new , clean passport that shows how much the United States of America appreciates his work and his devotion and all of that mob unpleasantness in New York City is a thing of the past .
Come on home , Bosko .
For such an intimidating , exuberant , even winning figure , Bosko seems , like his country to be completely lost .
He knows that when the war breaks out again , it will be Serb season , just as Tim said .
And they will never be able to kill enough to keep that from happening .
The look in his eyes says , Get me out of here .
He has a request before I board my bus .
He reaches into his pocket , and as he does , he says , " You 'll put in a good word .
Tell them I 'm ready to go to work again . "
He hands me six unsmiling passport photos of himself , taken this morning .
And six copies of his signature on a neatly folded sheet of white paper .
As always , his feet are hurting him , as if just standing on this ground is killing him .
" You can make me clean , " he says .
" Make me clean . "

Almost since its inception , Israel has been in conflict .
What role does war play in shaping the Jewish states ’ identity ?
I ’m on a bus in Israel leaving the airport .
It ’s very early in the morning .
The day is already so hot you can see waves of heat shimmering off the highway .
I feel like I always do at the start of a great adventure : jet lagged , thirsty , excited .
The buildings of Tel Aviv are getting smaller the further we drive .
Our tour guide , his name is Eitan , is talking into a microphone .
“ As we head out of the city you ’ll see a lot of countryside , ” he says , his blue eyes gazing fondly out the window at his adopted homeland ( Eitan is American , you see , and he has “ made aliyah , ” or taken Israel as his homeland and chosen a Hebrew name ) .
“ Israel is not all desert like you might have thought . ”
I pay attention now , because this is what I did in fact think .
“ Look at that field of sunflowers , for example . ”
I look out the window to my left and see the tall yellow flowers .
I ’m thinking they are pretty and picturesque , then Eitan says , “ Do n’t they look like proud soldiers lined up ready for battle ? ”
It wo n’t occur to me until much later , when my ten - day tour around Israel is finished and I ’m back in the safety of my predictable , air - conditioned American life , that this comment represents two things I ’ve come to understand about Israel and its people .
One : Israelis are determined to show the world their country is beautiful , not just bombs and problems .
Two :
They have an unwavering belief in their right to belong as a nation and their right to defend it .
Conclusion : Where Americans see sunflowers , Israelis see soldiers .
A Clean Slate
I ’m on this whirlwind tour of the Holy Land courtesy of Birthright , a foundation that offers every American with Jewish heritage a free trip to Israel .
I went into my trip to Israel a veritable clean slate , a sheltered girl from small - town Nevada with no strong political convictions .
The only requirements are that you ’re between the ages of 18 and 26 and you have at least one Jewish parent .
That ’s it .
Birthright gives you an all - expenses paid tour ( I ’m talking airfare , food , accommodation , everything ) around Israel to learn about the country and its complicated past and precarious future .
Although my father is Jewish and I grew up going to Passover at my grandmother ’s house , I consider myself more “ Jew-ish ” than Jewish ( as one girl on my trip put it during one of many group conversations on Jewish identity ) .
At this point in my life I do n’t follow Judaism or any religion for that matter .
Culturally , I ’m kinda whatever , celebrating Christmas and Groundhog Day and any other holiday that seems like fun .
I went into my trip to Israel a veritable clean slate , a sheltered girl from small - town Nevada with no strong political convictions .
An agnostic in faith and in life .
I did n’t know much about Israelis as a people , and knew hardly anything about the politics of the region .
I came out of my trip with dates and history and passionate speeches rattling around in my head , less sure than ever who should have rightful “ ownership ” of the land .

The Jewish Experience
On day one we arrived in the Galilee , the northernmost region of Israel .
As we drive past the rugged hills and occasional olive tree , Eitan mentions , “ Someone famous performed most of his miracles here . ”
The Son of God would be mentioned occasionally throughout the trip as a sort of background player .
Like the keyboardist in a band .
You might have heard of that someone .
His name is Jesus Christ .
The Son of God would be mentioned occasionally throughout the trip as a sort of background player .
Like the keyboardist in a band .
This surprises me , which makes me realize I ’m more culturally Christian than I thought .
We drop off our luggage at the first of several hostels and head directly to hike Mt. Arbel .
That night we watched the moon rise over the Sea of Galilee , drank cold Israeli beer , and talked about our backgrounds and what we hoped to learn on the trip .
Most days would be like that first one .
Up at dawn for the first hike of the day , museums and synagogues , lectures by intense Zionists and Holocaust survivors , complex conversations in the evenings about the future of Israel .
We float down the Jordan River and hike up steep canyons .
We go to a kibbutz in the Golan Heights called Misgav Am , where we have a regional view of Lebanon , Syria , and Hezbollah headquarters , as well as a passionate discourse on Israel ’s right to fight by an expatriate American who has fought in four of Israel ’s wars .
I especially enjoy the day we spend navigating the steep streets of Tzfat , built into a mountain and known for its artist colonies and as the birthplace of Kabballah .

Everyday Is Like 9/11
There is the salty air in the haunting ocean caves of Rosh Hanikra .
There are the tears in the hallways of Yad Vashem , the Holocaust museum .
We navigate the crowded stalls of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv ’s markets , squeezing peaches and bargaining with our best version of todah , Hebrew for “ thank you . ”
We wake up at 3 am to climb Masada and are rewarded with breathtaking views of the Dead Sea at sunrise .
We then swim in the Dead Sea , and are rewarded with stinging eyes and mud splattered bathing suits .
We see Jaffa at sunset ( where the human race has had a city since the beginning of time ) .
We pretend to be comfortable sleeping in a Bedouin tent and rise at dawn for a camel ride .
I pick up white chalky stones in the riverbed where David fought Goliath ( I later put them on my desk at home to remind me I can overcome any obstacle ) .
I touch the smooth pillars in a small , non-descript chapel in Jerusalem where the Last Supper took place .
I peer down into a deep , dark canyon where babies were sacrificed in ancient times - the canyon that inspired the concept of Hell .
Most significantly : we travel with eight Israeli soldiers who are impossibly exotic in our eyes , though they look just like the Americans we grew up with .
They have the same discussions on dating and pop culture as we do , yet their lives have been punctuated by periods in which “ every day is like 9/11 . ”
Devotional Envy
Like most tourists , we visited the Western Wall during our tour of the old city .
But on our trip , we went twice .
Once in the day and once at night .
Maybe having a common enemy , a constant threat to safety , is the ironical path to happiness .
During the night visit , I stood with my forehead touching The Wall , the ground beneath me finally cool after a day of scorching heat .
The air around me was filled with the hushed chatter of a thousand worshipers .
I know I ’m supposed to be praying or asking forgiveness or in the very least thinking profound thoughts , but instead I ’m mesmerized by the women around me , young and old , their hands pressed together , some bobbing rhythmically to the verses in their heads .
Watching them , I feel both disturbed by and strangely envious of their devotion .
For the first time in my life , I felt seduced by the idea of belonging to a religion .
Of belonging to a nation where fighting for its defense is the rule rather than the exception .
So many of us Americans create our own problems .
Depression .
Anxiety .
Maybe having a common enemy , a constant threat to safety , is the ironical path to happiness .
The Value Of Identity
Perhaps creature comforts and national security are n’t actually the ingredients of contentment .
Have we forgotten that humans like to be challenged , have something to fight for , to believe in ?
We thrive on these feelings because they give us an identity .
I reached out and touched The Wall .
I slipped my folded note into the ancient crevices , and I pressed my palm flat against the stone .
In that moment I felt a rush , of hope , of sorrow , of belonging .
And then , all at the same time , I became aware of a Jewish woman to my left reciting verses in Hebrew , and the tall minaret by the Dome of the Rock singing the Muslim call to prayer .
And quite softly but distinct still , church bells ringing somewhere nearby .

Prominent Republican figure , and four - star General , Colin Powell , caused a big splash this past Sunday when he endorsed Barack Obama for president .
But he ’s not the only prominent Republican figure to offer an endorsement of Obama .
Yesterday , former White House Press Secretary under George W. Bush , Scott McClellan , went on DL Hughley ’s new CNN program “ DL Hughely Breaks the News ” and essentially gave Obama his official endorsement .
Hughley , the famed comedian , asked McClellan if he would endorse either of the two presidential candidates , all the while joking that McClellan should not let Hughley ’s being black affect his endorsement .
McClellan responded by saying , “ From the very beginning I ’ve said I ’m going to support the candidate who has the best chance of changing the way Washington works and getting things done .
I will be voting for Barack Obama . ”

Watch the video for yourself :
While Powell ’s endorsement may have made a bigger splash because it got more media play , McClellan ’s endorsement is actually nail in the coffin for John McCain .
Powell was involved with the Bush White House but chose to step away and cut ties nearly four years ago .
Besides , most people following the first Bush term could easily tell that Powell was never comfortable with the limitations and dictations the Bush Administration placed on him in that role .
And anyone watching knew that the Bush inner circle ( of which Powell was never a part of ) mistreated and abused Powell .
Powell never quite fit into the administration .
McClellan is a different story .
McClellan is a Texas native and has known Bush , and worked with / for him for a long time .
McClellan followed Bush to the White House from Texas , eventually becoming Press Secretary .
He was part of the Bush inner circle .
Granted , many will argue differently , considering the fact that Karl Rove and “ Scooter ” Libby lied to him .
But I would submit that McClellan was part of Bush ’s inner circle ; Bush said he and McClellan would be sitting together on rocking chairs in old age at McClellan ’s farewell press conference .
McClellan was not part of Rove ’s or Libby ’s , and certainly not part of Cheney ’s , and it was these three men that occluded McClellan from certain truths .
A former Press Secretary who was in on the daily dealings and functions of the White House , a member of the Bush sanctum , someone who felt so betrayed by his friend / boss at such a fundamental level coming out and endorsing the opposition candidate just drives that stake deeper into the heart of McCain ’s election chances .
I ’d been compiling notes for a post on why ( I believe ) John McCain lost the presidential election .
I ’ll make one brief observation before getting to the meat of this post .
As I review my own notes , past posts and consider other people ’s opinions , I ’ll just say , given all Obama ’s advantages and McCain ’s mistakes , I ’m amazed the election was as close as it was .
Anyway , this morning , Glenn linked Ann Althouse ’s piece How McCain lost me where she basically assembles her posts offered during the course of the election and concludes with some commentary .
I highly recommend it .
I think she ’s a little harsh in her fourth point ( at the end ) , but , hey , that ’s her opinion .
I do , however , share her view on points one ( “ He did not understand economics , the most important issue ” ) and three ( “ He never defined himself as a principled conservative ” ) .
They basically correspond to conclusions I have reached .
Read the whole thing !
Down in Alabama , you do n't lose your vote if convicted of a felony unless it's for a crime of " moral turpitude ' - and simple drug possession does n't fall into that category .
Which means somewhere around 50,000 Alabamans are allowed to vote and maybe do n't know it - including about 6 - 7,000 still in prison .
The Ordinary People 's Society and their national partner the Drug Policy Alliance had been working in the prisons , registering voters with the full support of the Alabama Department of Corrections - until ...
Alabama Prisons Commissioner Richard Allen stopped a voter registration drive for inmates Thursday under pressure from the Alabama Republican Party .
In a letter to state Republican Party Chairman Mike Hubbard , Allen said individuals conducting the program " were not doing anything for the inmates that they could not do themselves by simply contacting the Secretary of State 's Office for the voter registration postcard . "
Still , Allen said he decided to stop the drive because of a section in the state code that prohibits using state - owned property to promote or advance candidates for election .
" While it is not clear that assisting voters to register would violate those provisions , I cannot expose departmental employees to that possibility , " he wrote .
...
Allen 's letter to Hubbard was in response to one the chairman e-mailed him earlier in the day , saying the GOP supports the idea of registering more people to vote , but not when it comes to prisoners .
" Furthermore , I have concerns about potential issues with how this effort is being monitored to ensure no form of voter fraud occurs , " wrote Hubbard , who is also minority leader of the Alabama House , which votes on the prison system 's budget .
Of course , the subtext here is " stop , or we 'll vote to cut your budget " .
Meanwhile , the State AG is trying to get the whole law overturned and ban everyone convicted of a felony from voting .
But we 're not talking about murderers , rapists and violent criminals here - we 're talking about tens of thousands convicted of a simple possession charge who have stayed clean thereafter .
Trouble is , those folk do n't usually vote Republican .
Minimum Volume Embedding ( MVE ) is an algorithm for non-linear dimensionality reduction that uses semidefinite programming ( SDP ) and matrix factorization to find a low - dimensional embedding that preserves local distances between points while representing the dataset in many fewer dimensions .
MVE follows an approach similar to algorithms such as Semidefinite Embedding ( SDE ) , in that it learns a kernel matrix using an SDP before applying Kernel Principal Component Analysis ( KPCA ) .
However , the objective function for MVE directly optimizes the eigenspectrum of the data to preserve as much of its energy as possible within the few dimensions available to the embedding .
Simultaneously , remaining eigenspectrum energy is minimized in directions orthogonal to the embedding thereby keeping data in a so - called minimum volume manifold .
We show how MVE improves upon SDE in terms of the volume of the preserved embedding and the resulting eigenspectrum , producing better visualizations for a variety of synthetic and real - world datasets , including simple toy examples , face images , handwritten digits , phylogenetic trees , and social networks .

I know , I know , I run a blog called “ Political Irony ” but sometimes something comes along that is so ironic that it boggles even my jaded mind .
Esquire Magazine has a fascinating report on the political views of white supremacists , racists , and other hate - mongers and finds that many of them are supporting Obama for the presidency !
Here are some of their views :
Rocky Suhayda , chairman of the American Nazi Party :
White people are faced with either a negro or a total nutter who happens to have a pale face .
Personally I ’d prefer the negro .
National Socialists are not mindless haters .
Here , I see a white man , who is almost dead , who declares he wants to fight endless wars around the globe to make the world safe for Judeo - capitalist exploitation , who supports the invasion of America by illegals–basically a continuation of the last eight years of Emperor Bush .
Then , we have a black man , who loves his own kind , belongs to a Black - Nationalist religion , is married to a black women–when usually negroes who have ‘ made it ’ immediately land a white spouse as a kind of prize — that ’s the kind of negro that I can respect .
Tom Metzger , director of White Aryan Resistance and former Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan :
The corporations are running things now , so it ’s not going to make much difference who ’s in there , but McCain would be much worse .
He ’s a warmonger .
He ’s a scary , scary person–more dangerous than Bush .
Erich Gliebe , chairman of the National Alliance and former pro boxer with the nickname “ The Aryan Barbarian ” :
Obama might be a better candidate for our cause because he ’s racially conscious . …
I give Obama credit , he seems to have stuck to his guns as far as pulling the troops out of Iraq .
He ’s a very intelligent man , an excellent speaker and has charisma .
John McCain offers none of that .
Perhaps the best thing for the white race is to have a black president .
My only problem with Obama is perhaps he ’s not black enough .

Going For The Record Aaron Fotheringham , 16 , attempts to set a Guinness Book of World Record for a wheelchair backflip .

Aaron Fotheringham went into the record books as a pioneer in wheelchair sports Saturday .
Guinness World Records recorded the Northwest Las Vegas resident , in front of a crowd of more than 300 at Doc Romeo Park , as the first to complete a back flip in a wheelchair .
" It feels awesome to get this , " said Fotheringham , 16 , who performed the flip before the Vegas AmJam skatepark competition .
To achieve the trick , Fotheringham , rolled down a skatepark ramp to generate enough speed .
He then went up another ramp and landed his flip on flat ground .
He first completed the trick in 2006 , and has dozens of videos of his backflips , but had yet to make it official .
" I think it 's fantastic , " his mother , Kaylene Fotheringham , said .
" So often we said 'we think he is the first one , ' but today we know he has the world record , "
Aaron Fotheringham , who suffers from spina bifida and has been in a wheelchair since he was 13 , came up short in his quest to set a record for most consecutive backflips in 45 seconds .
His unofficial record is six back flips in a row , however , he could not get consecutive flips Oct. 25 .
" I'm a little bit disappointed I did n't get the consecutive flips , but I guess I 'm taking it for granted that I got in the book , " Fotheringham said .
Completing the trick requires perfect judgment of speed and concentration , he said .
Approaching the ramp too fast or too slow could result in a nasty spill on the pavement .
Wearing a helmet , Aaron Fotheringham hit his head on a couple of falls on Oct. 25 .
Encouragement from spectators helped him get back up .
" I 'm really grateful for all the support , " he said .
" They may not have been my biggest crowd , but it was the most important one . "
After getting the record , Aaron Fotheringham competed in the Vegas AmJam finals , and took first in the BMX advanced division .
AmJam coordinators allow him to compete with his wheelchair in the BMX division .

LewRockwell.com was the first to comprehensively analyze the motivations behind the bailout and to identify those who were its primary intended beneficiaries : JP Morgan and Citibank .
That October 2 piece showed how JP Morgan and Citibank were poised to be first in line to receive as much as $ 850 billion in newly printed dollars , a significant increase in the U.S. money supply .
As Irish - French ( but truly Austrian ) economist Richard Cantillon first observed , in a fiat money system those who benefit the most when the money supply is increased are those who are first in line to receive it .
This is because when new money is created asset prices in the market do not immediately reflect the increase in the supply of money .
Because sellers of fruit and just about everything else generally do not check their daily prices against the adjusted monetary base as published by the St. Louis Federal Reserve , they are for the most part initially unaware that the currency has been debased .
They realize the loss in purchasing power only long after the initial debasement has occurred .
Because most sellers are generally unaware of the debasement , the holders of the new dollars can purchase assets from them at relatively deflated prices .
Once the initial infusion runs through the system , the market ( sellers ) recognizes that that the supply of dollars has increased and that they can and must charge more for their product to keep up .
Contrary to the popular view , inflation is therefore really nothing more than an increase in the money supply .
The consequent increase in wages and prices ( the popular view of inflation ) is just a delayed effect of the earlier increase in the money supply .
It must be noted that inflation is not limited to fiat , paper currencies .
If gold were the exclusive currency and a mine that doubled the world 's supply of gold was discovered , the supply of money would be doubled and one would expect , all other things being equal , that asset prices would double .
The problem in any centralized , government - controlled money system is of course who holds the keys to the mine or , in our case , the printing press .
The most pertinent issues in the fog of the bailout debate were not a crashing stock market , Wall Street salaries , the New Deal origins of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the unconstitutional Neighborhood Revitalization
Act or other red herrings .
The most pertinent facts were that , one week prior to the $ 850 billion bailout , the FDIC coerced over $ 600 billion in asset transfers from the two biggest subprime lenders to the biggest , most politically - connected banks in the country : foreclosing Washington Mutual and handing its assets to JP Morgan and putting a gun to Wachovia 's head and forcing it to agree to sell to Citi by the end o the year .
Finally , the October 2 piece showed that those who claimed that the government would " make money " or " profit " by purchasing unmarketable securities were either dishonest or deluded .
The politicians who coyly claim that the government will " profit " " over time " very likely cynically understand the inflationary effects of the bailout and know that , if the government buys a non-performing $ 100,000 mortgage in 2008 and three years later sells the underlying property for $ 200,000 , this does not necessarily mean the government has profited .
If the money supply has doubled in that same time and a bottle of Coca Cola has gone from $ 1.00 to $ 2.00 , bread from $ 3.00 to $ 6.00 , milk from $ 4.00 to $ 8.00 and gas from $ 3.00 to $ 6.00 , then there is no " profit ' in the sale .
The government 's sale of the property for $ 200,000 in 2011 is no different than if it had sold it for $ 50,000 today .
Devaluing the dollar by half and then selling some thing for twice the present price is not profit .
On the day after the October 2 piece , in a " surprise announcement " Wells Fargo and Wachovia disclosed a deal in which Wells would pay Wachovia $ 13 billion more for its assets than Citi had agreed to pay with the coercive help of the FDIC .
On October 9 , LewRockwell.com explained this deal for what it clearly was : pigs fighting to be first in line at the trough .
Wells management , in perhaps a cynical Austrian epiphany , suddenly saw value in acquiring the right to sell perhaps as much as $ 300 billion in subprime securities to the US taxpayer .
In the days between October 3 and October 9 , Wells , Citi and Wachovia battled over which pig would get to be first in line with JP Morgan , who had already secured its subprime booty with the help of the FDIC .
The October 9 piece , however , warned Wells and Citi to be careful of what they wished for , because the market price of JP Morgan since the bailout had gone precipitously down , notwithstanding its unequivocal spot as first in line at the trough and the infusion of $ 10 billion in cash .
As indicated in the October 9 article , absent market manipulation the omniscient and invisible hand of the market could be warning Wells and Citi that JP Morgan 's right to receive $ 850 billion in newly printed inflationary dollars could be as " toxic " as the securities sold in exchange .
On the evening of October 9 , 2008 , Citi announced that it would bow out of the fight and allow Wells to go forward with the Wachovia acquisition .
Although reports indicate that Wells " won , " it is very unlikely that Citi sees it that way .
Citi will hang on to its very good and very powerful breach of contract and tortious interference claims against both Wachovia and Wells , but it will not partake in the morally odious practice of acquiring unmarketable securities through coercion and selling them to the US taxpayers .
As with all things in life , Citi 's correct moral decision is also market - wise .
Even though Rockefeller Republican Barack Obama is poised to become the next president of the United States , Citi has wisely decided that it will not be a party to fleecing the US taxpayer .
It recognizes that the " right " to receive $ 850 billion in a government - controlled transaction could end up being a very messy , very inefficient and very unprofitable " obligation . "
If , in the unlikely event that Wells achieves enormous profits from the bailout , Citi 's lawsuit will put it in a position to recover any and all profits that Wells obtains .
No risk , high reward .
Smart .
Citi 's decision reflects what all serious students of capitalism and economics know : freely flowing , private commerce without government interference is the lifeblood of humanity .
Further , the market is eminently moral in its judgments and truly does reflect the " invisible hand " of collective wisdom .
As any lawyer who has tried a case to a jury can attest , there is a certain magic in the decision - making of groups of people that are given complete access to all relevant facts .
This so - called Wisdom of Crowds is evidenced every day by a stock market that is free from government interference and manipulation .
A free stock market is the world 's best and most well - informed jury and the truest sign of a free society .
If the market does not look kindly on JP Morgan or Wells over the next few years , I would argue that its invisible hand is recognizing that these companies have , through aggression , deceit , and coercion , sought to acquire a portfolio of unmarketable assets and sell them to a taxpayer at inflated prices .
In short , they are accomplices to theft .
For someone who sincerely likes and admires Wells , this is troubling issue .
In the author 's experience , through its merger with Norwest Bank Wells acquired some of the best , most capable and qualified people in the country .
Norwest alums Chairman of the Board Dick Kovacevich and former general counsel Stanley Stroup are great men and great leaders .
Wells opportunistic participation in the bailout signals a negative turn .
For JP Morgan , this could be a particularly hard time as it seeks to sell its portfolio of subprime securities to a new government sponsored entity that will likely be under the control of Rockefeller establishment man Barack Obama who menacingly warns of more government " oversight " and " regulation " to come .
In the century - long feud and battle between these two big banks it cannot be a good thing for Morgan to be the holder the world 's largest portfolio of subprime securities and the only willing and able buyer is a Rockefeller administration .
So what should JP Morgan and Wells do ?
First , they must recognize that no great company became or stayed great through government assistance or by making government its primary customer .
As trite as it might sound , great companies are great because they first seek to do what they do best and thereby serve humanity .
Great companies and great people first seek to do good and only then do they know that they will do well .
Profit , competition and seizing opportunities are what makes capitalism fun , but knowing that one has truly provided a valuable good or service and perhaps altered the course of someone else 's life for the better is what capitalism is really about .
Companies like Nordstrom , Wal - Mart , 3M , Apple , Microsoft , Sony , Hewlett Packard , Toyota and Proctor and Gamble recognize this .
Making money is not the end , it is only an imperfect measurement of how well one is doing at providing a valuable good or service to society .
In this context , money is nothing more than receipts for services rendered to society .
Good banks provide needed capital to businesses ; they do not enter into no -bid contracts with the government to unload a pile of unmarketable debt and get first in line at the fiat trough .
Second , if JP Morgan and Wells truly want their share price to increase and people to invest in their companies , they should first seek to do the right and moral thing .
On Monday , October 13th they should jointly announce that they want no part of the federal bailout and that they have formed a privately funded clearing - house corporation to which they will transfer all of their newly acquired subprime mortgages at 5 – 10 percent of their face value .
Realistic " mark to market " FASB 157 would appear to support placing this value on what is clearly illiquid and unmarketable .
Because the new corporation must do the dirty work of actually selling the properties , must understand and accurately apply the foreclosure laws of all 50 states and must hold the properties for often lengthy redemption periods , this significant transactional cost should further deflate the value of the subprime portfolios .
New tax regulations would also appear to allow these banks to take an accelerated loss on the sale .
The purpose of this new corporation will be to efficiently foreclose and liquidate all of the non-performing loans on their books .
They will invite other lenders to participate in the corporation pro rata so that the entire mess can get cleaned up efficiently and effectively .
There are still plenty of people with lots of dollars sitting on the sidelines waiting for a bottom of the real estate market .
This new entity will find that bottom quickly and will stimulate billions of dollars in transactions as investors and individuals acquire these properties .
Having acquired the non-performing loans at 5 – 10 percent of face value , the new entity , unlike the GSE created in the bailout , will also very likely turn an actual , non-inflationary , profit .
If the Obama - controlled IRS challenges the sale , JP Morgan and Wells can point to the impending inflation caused by the Fed and Congress and find plenty of Austrian economists who will truthfully and credibly testify that , as a result of recent fiscal and monetary inflation , the non-performing loans could very well be worthless if the banks took no private action .
These economists will likely testify that the subprime mortgage became valuable only because these brave banks rejected government interference and took private action .
Finally , should JP Morgan and Wells take this action , the wisdom of the market ( the same market consisting of millions of people who told their Congressmen to vote against the bailout in a 10:1 ratio ) will respond with hosannas of populist support by purchasing their stock .
The wisdom of the crowd will recognize that these brave companies have saved them $ 850 billion and may have saved the dollar itself .
A further benefit will be that the public will recognize that the market , not the government , is the answer .
They will witness the free capitalist market , not callow and dishonest politicians , solve the unsolvable .
JP Morgan and Wells are positioned to prevent the next great depression but they must reject the interference of government in their business .
If they refuse to deal with the devil , the market will reward them .

DUNN , North Carolina ( CNN ) -- Barack Obama 's campaign announced Sunday the Democratic presidential candidate raised $ 150 million in donations in September , setting a new high - water mark in campaign fundraising .
Barack Obama calls a prospective voter from a headquarters in Kansas City , Missouri , on Saturday .
In a campaign video , Obama campaign manager David Plouffe said a record 632,000 new donors gave to the campaign , with the average contribution under $ 100 .
More than 3 million donors have given so far .
The Obama campaign raised $ 65 million in August .
Regardless of the stunning haul , Plouffe told supporters the campaign still needed more money because of " the slime that we 're getting from the McCain campaign . "
Plouffe cited recent attack ads and automated phone calls in battleground states and said the campaign needed to have every resource to " fight back . "
" Their campaign is going to descend even more into the gutter , " he said .
Plouffe also said the campaign was expanding its reach to compete " aggressively " in West Virginia .
Tightening polls in Georgia and North Dakota meant more money and resources could be sent to those two states in the remaining days , he said .
" We can't afford to make any cuts .
We have to execute everything we think is required to win , " Plouffe said of their battleground strategy .
" None of us can look back on the night of November 4 or the morning of November 5 and wished we had done something extra . "
The McCain campaign accepted $ 85 million in federal matching funds for the last two months of the campaign .
The Obama campaign opted out of the matching funds program and is free to raise and spend as much money as it can .
CNN 's Paul Steinhauser and Sasha Johnson contributed to this report .

A fungus called microsporidia that causes chronic diarrhea in AIDS patients , organ transplant recipients and travelers has been identified as a member of the family of fungi that have been discovered to reproduce sexually .
A team at Duke University Medical Center has proven that microsporidia are true fungi and that this species most likely undergoes a form of sexual reproduction during infection of humans and other host animals .
The findings could help develop effective treatments against these common global pathogens and may help explain their most virulent attacks .
" Microsporidian infections are hard to treat because until now we have n't known a lot about this common pathogen , " says Soo Chan Lee , Ph.D. , lead author and a postdoctoral researcher in the Duke Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology .
" Up to 50 percent of AIDS patients have microsporidial infections and develop chronic diarrhea .
These infections are also detected in patients with traveler 's diarrhea , and also in children , organ transplant recipients and the elderly . "
Of the 1200 species of microsporidia , more than a dozen infect humans .
Their identity had been obscured because these tiny fungi cannot live outside of an infected host cell and they have a small number of genes which are rapidly evolving .
The Duke scientists used two genetic studies to show that microsporidia apparently evolved from sexual fungi and are closely related to the zygomycete fungus in particular .
They found that microsporidia share 33 genes out of 2,000 with zygomycetes .
which the microsporidia did not share with other fungi .
This genomic signature also shows that microsporidia and zygomycetes likely shared a common ancestor and are more distantly related to other known fungal lineages .
In addition , these two types of fungi have the same sex - locus genes – and in the same order – in their DNA .
Other genes involved in sexual reproduction are also present .
The findings suggest that microsporidia may have a genetically controlled sexual cycle , and may be undergoing sexual reproduction while they infect the host , Lee said .
Lee said the next step is to explore the sexual reproduction of these species , which may cause more severe ( more virulent ) infections because they use the host 's cellular environment and machinery as a safe haven in which to reproduce .
" These studies resolve the enigma of the evolutionary origins and proper placement
of this highly successful group of pathogens , and provide better approaches to their experimental study , " said senior author Joseph Heitman , M.D. , Ph.D. , director of the Center for Microbial Pathogenesis and director of the Duke University Program in Genetics and Genomics .
The team will pursue further studies with Duke genetic researchers Raphael Valdivia , Ph.D. , and Alejandro Aballay , Ph.D. , using cultured cells and C. elegans , a worm that researchers recently found is a natural host for microsporidia .
" Using this roundworm may prove to be a useful way to study microsporidia genetics in a living creature , " Heitman said .

Winston Churchill Quotes
If you have quotation to add , please send it to me .
In a stroke of self - satire , Pentagon officials tried to block Stars and Stripes  the military ’s respected independent newspaper  from covering the troops ’ plain and honest reactions to the election night news about their new commander in chief .
The Department of Defense once again made news by smothering news .
The boneheaded muzzling of the newspaper , which is protected by First Amendment guarantees against editorial interference , barred reporters assigned to do simple color stories from the public areas of military bases in order to “ avoid engaging in activities that could associate the Department with any partisan election . ”
Partisan ?
By that rationale , the civilian news media ’s coverage of the spontaneous celebrations across the land on Tuesday night was an act of journalistic bias .
It ’s ludicrous that Pentagon brass feared men and women in uniform might be caught smiling , frowning or variously exclaiming “ Whoopee ! ” or “ Rats ! ” at voting results from the democracy they defend with their lives .
The good news is that Stars and Stripes found commanders in the Middle East and Europe that ignored the foolish directive , as if it were a premise for a “ M * A * S * H ” episode .
When other commanders clamped down in Japan and South Korea , the paper properly took the ban as illegal under longstanding Congressional and military policies .
Its reporters did their jobs until forced to stop .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Celebrity chef Antony Worrall Thompson has apologized after accidentally recommending a potentially deadly plant in organic salads .
A screenshot of Celebrity chef Antony Worrall Thompson 's website , taken on August 4 , 2008 .
REUTERS/www.awtonline.co.uk
The chef and TV presenter said in a magazine article that the weed henbane , also known as stinking nightshade , made an excellent addition to summertime meals .
There was plenty of it , it grew locally and was used by the ancient Greeks and the Arabs for its anesthetic properties .
Er , not quite .
Henbane , or Hyoscyamus niger , is toxic and can cause hallucinations , convulsions , vomiting and in extreme cases death .
Worrall Thompson , who was discussing his passion for organic foods , had confused the plant with another of a similar name .
The magazine “ Healthy & Organic Living ” printed an urgent warning : “ Henbane is a very toxic plant and should never be eaten .
As always , check with an expert when foraging or collecting wild plants . ”
Henbane , a close relative of deadly nightshade , was used by Dr Crippen to kill his wife in 1910 , and is thought to have been the main ingredient in the poison Romeo took in Shakespeare ’s play “ Romeo and Juliet . ”
The chef had intended to refer to fat hen , a weed rich in vitamin C , that is edible , media reports said .
It too can be harmful because of its high level of nitrates , but cases of poisoning are rare , Garden Organic said on its website .
Worrall Thompson was reported in the media as saying the confusion had been “ a bit embarrassing . ”
“ There have been no reports of any casualties , ” he said .
“ Please do pass on my apologies . ”
It is not healthy to be jealous of your colleagues .
Even less so to snoop on their emails and leak them to the press .
Just ask Larry Mendte , the former news anchor of a CBS - owned TV station who has been sentenced to six months ' house arrest
In affectionate 1970s news spoof Anchorman , Will Ferrell 's comic creation Ron Burgundy is consumed by jealousy with the arrival of his younger female colleague , Veronica Corningstone .
But while Burgundy ended up wrestling bears in San Diego zoo , real - life US TV news anchor Larry Mendte has been sentenced to six months ' house arrest after a long - running feud with his younger female colleague , Alycia Lane .
Lawyers for Lane , 36 , said 51 - year - old Mendte had " destroyed her career and made her a tabloid feeding fenzy " .
Mendte - who features , above , on YouTube in an unfortunate Burgundy - esqe blooper - was said to be jealous that Lane 's $ 780,000 salary was rather more than his .
She allegedly told him during an on - set row that she was the " rising star " and he was on the way out .
Except he wo n't be going out anywhere right now .
Mendte , speaking about the affair earlier this year , has been sentenced to house arrest and 250 hours of community service , plus a $ 5,000 fine .
Mendte was sacked from his job at CBS - owned Philadelphia station KYW - TV in June this year .
The pair co-anchored the evening news bulletin on the station from 2004 until the beginning of this year .
Mendte , who snooped on his colleague 's emails 537 times , told the court : " I felt I was in trouble .
My career , my future , my family 's future was in trouble .
And , this is where I got into more trouble – federal trouble . "
But the drama is not over yet .
Lane herself was fired by the TV station at the turn of the year after she was arrested following a scuffle with police .
Her departure was reported , with delicious irony , by none other than Mendte himself .
How differently we watch that report now .
The charges were later dropped , and Lane is suing KYW for wrongful dismissal .
On -air personality clashes between high profile news anchors tend to be rather less high profile in the UK .
BBC News 24 presenter Philip Hayton - here presenting the BBC's One O'Clock News - was the exception rather than the rule when he quit three years ago rather than carry on co-presenting with Kate Silverton .
" It boils down to incompatibility , " said Hayton .
" We did four hours of live TV every day , and you have to like each other . "
Ouch .
Back in the US , Lane is now known as " anchorbabe " thanks to bikini - clad pictures she sent of herself to a well - known sports broadcaster that were intercepted by his wife .
She began to suspect her emails were being leaked when stories about her began appearing in newspapers , including a photo of her dancing with Prince Albert of Monaco .
By coincidence , Ferrell was rumoured earlier this year to be considering a sequel to Anchorman .
He may rule out this real - life plotline for being , well , a little too fanciful .
His 35 - course menu is so dazzling that two million people try to book his restaurant each year , 400 for every table , and even some food critics claim it has changed their lives forever .
But Ferran Adria , the Spanish chef behind El Bulli , has revealed that he actually wants to eat at McDonald's .
In an interview with The Independent , Adria said it had been a long time since he had visited the burger giant , which has been attacked over its approach to animals , the environment and health and castigated by many as a symbol of US culinary imperialism .
" But I want to go back , " he added .
Adria – whose restaurant has been named the world 's best for three years running by Restaurant magazine – said he did not think he could make a better hamburger for the money .
He said he would like to visit McDonald 's to " discover " its cooking .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
As the head chef of El Bulli , in Girona , northern Spain , Adria creates scientifically - developed dishes such as menthol watermelon and hibiscus paper with blackcurrant and eucalyptus .
A meal at El Bulli is a five - hour extravaganza , from which diners are sometimes forced to take a break after experiencing sensory overload .
In London to promote his new book , A Day at El Bulli , Adria said people 's diet could be improved through education , and he praised Jamie Oliver for doing more than any other chef to publicise the benefits of healthy eating .
But he added : " I do n't think people should come and say , ' McDonald 's is n't good ' , if you do n't give me an alternative ; what is the alternative , for the same price ?
It 's like saying everybody should be driving an Aston Martin or Rolls - Royce ; most people do n't drive them .
Cars have the price they have .
" About five or 10 years ago , the mobile phone did n't exist and people could live without it .
With the price you pay for a phone , you could be eating fresh fish every day .
[ But ] if you ask most children would they rather have a phone or eat fresh fish , they are going to say ' a phone ' . "
Indicating that he was concerned that McDonald 's would use his comments for marketing , Adria nonetheless suggested said that if the fast - food giant hired 10 of the world 's top chefs they would not be able to make a better burger – for the price .
" Maybe ... they could increase the price and make a hamburger of the best quality with fresh meat .
And people would have the option to eat it – but it 's going to cost three times as much , " he said .
" I 've only been [ to McDonald 's ] three times in my entire life , now it 's ages since I went there .
But I want to go back . "
Adria , who closes El Bulli from January to May to develop new dishes , says most tastes and flavours have yet to be discovered .

Today we released Mono 2.0 to the world .
You can download sources and binaries from our download page .
And our official release notes are up as well .
This of course would not be possible without the open source contributors that worked tirelessly on Mono sending patches , fixing bugs , helping the community , answering questions , creating test cases and supporting us all these years .
Mono 2.0 is both a runtime for application and a kit for developers for writing applications with C# and other ECMA CLI languages for a wide spectrum of uses .
Big thanks go to the fantastic Mono team at Novell that has kept the excitement and the pace over all these years ( we started in 2001 ) , the large contributions from Mainsoft , Unity3D and our users that pushed us to fix bugs , implement new features and tune Mono .
Also , we very much appreciate the work of the ECMA 334 and 335 committee members that worked on the CLI and C# specifications and everyone at Microsoft that answered our questions over the years and specially those that licensed code under open source licenses .
We originally started to work on Mono , because we wanted to make developers happier and more productive on Linux .
We liked C# , we liked the CIL and we wanted to have those technologies available on our platform .
Since we have been active in the Linux Desktop world , it is not a surprise that the early use of Mono was mostly on Linux desktop applications , and Mono continues to shine there .
Server - side use of Mono was a natural evolution and we soon were powering ASP .
NET sites on Linux .
There is one area where we under - delivered in the past , and it has been a constant source of pain .
Up until now , we did not have a working debugger .
This has finally changed , and Mono 2.0 includes for the first time a debugger , the time for WriteLine ( ) debugging is now behind us .
As the project matured , developers started taking advantage of Mono 's open source nature : essentially .NET on their own terms .
A platform that could be adapted , morphed , ported and modified to suit many different uses .
Today Mono is embedded in portable mp3 players and powers Unity3D 's game engine on the Apple iPhone , the Nintendo Wii , MacOS X and Windows ( Some folks at Novell are working with Unity on bringing Unity3d to Linux ! ) .
It has also been deployed to run code on large clusters of servers for SecondLife , powers our open source Silverlight implementation ( Moonlight ) and powers the popular DekiWiki : a Social Collaboration Tool .
Mono is a large project and it is hard to pick one feature to talk about as there are so many , so instead I put together a quick table of the major features that are part of this release :
We have ported Mono to a wide variety of platforms and operating systems on this 1.0 to 2.0 cycle .
These platforms include :
Linux ( x86 , x86-64 , PowerPC32 , Itanium , SPARC , ARM , s390 , s390x .
Solaris ( x86-64 , SPARC ) .
MacOS X ( x86 , PowerPC32 ) .
Windows ( x86 , support for x86 - 64 will come in Mono 2.2 ) .
Nintendo's Wii .
i Phone / iPod Touch ( ARM , limited functionality due to licensing requirements ; I will blog later this week about this ) .
* BSD ( x86 , x86-64 ) .
Developing with Mono
Long time Linux developers will probably continue to use Emacs and VI , but some new Linux developers might want to use an IDE .
New developers can use our open source MonoDevelop IDE on Linux , or alternatively the commercial X - Develop IDE or SlickEdit .
If you are a Windows developer , you can continue using Visual Studio or your IDE of choice to write the code and compile it .
Your binaries will run just fine on Linux .
To assist Windows developers in porting their applications to Unix , we have provided the Mono Migration Analysis tool .
Runtime Changes
The Mono Virtual Machine gained plenty of features since Mono 1.2 was released .
We have added :
Generic Code Sharing and VTable Compression have been implemented : this significantly reduces the memory footprint of generic type instantiations , while still getting the speed benefits of using generics .
AOT support : in addition to x86 , we now also support ARM and x86 - 64 .
COM interop is now complete ( works on Windows with " real COM " and can be used on Unix with Mainsoft's COM or Mozilla 's XPCOM ) .
AOT code can now AOT parts of 2.0 assemblies ( assemblies that contain generics ) .
Full AOT support ( allows code to run JIT - less , this is limited to 1.0 code ) .
CIL Verifier : Now Mono has a CIL verifier .
CoreCLR Security : the security system used by Moonlight .
Many optimizations that improve execution performance : New intrinsics operations ( Math . Min/Max for example ) ; various operations are now inlined by the JIT ; managed allocations ( no transition to unmanaged code for allocating memory ) ; multi-array access is now tuned by the JIT ; constant and block initializations are now handled by the JIT ; Faster initialization and access to multi-dimensional arrays ( 4 x faster ) .
The runtime went on a diet , many runtime data structures are smaller making Mono lighter .
Tools
In addition the the Mono Debugger making its debut appearance on this release , we are very proud of our code analyzer Gendarme .
Gendarme is a extensible rule - based tool to find problems in .NET applications and libraries .
Gendarme inspects programs and libraries that contain code in ECMA CIL format ( Mono and .NET ) and looks for common problems with the code , problems that compilers do not typically check or have not historically checked .
Feedback
Mono is not perfect , but we want to improve it .
Like many other open source projects , we need your bug reports to improve Mono .
If you have problems with Mono , help us by filing a bug report .
Special Thanks
Special thanks to Hacker Extraordinaire Aaron Bockover who not only brings us the best media player in the world , but created the new web site design and implemented and tuned it over very long extra hours up until 7 am in the morning on his weekend .
And to our packaging and QA team that spent extra hours to get all the bits and pieces in place for the release .
A reader writes :
Really any woman who considers herself a conservative or identifies with the Republican party should be embarrassed by Sarah Palin .
Seriously , this is the female face of the party .
The debate was a joke , setting the bar so low that as long as she did n't drool all over herself it 's considered a victory .
That is what Republican women should be proud of ?
Her winking and talking " folksy " , you betcha goshdarnit , that 's the way the party wants to represent itself to the country and the world ?
The fact that so many other qualified women in the party , like Olympia Snowe ( whom I admire greatly ) , Kay Baily Hutchinson , Christie Todd Whitman ( my former governor ) are able to communicate and connect with the American people , were passed over for this disaster of a candidate , is greatly disheartening to me as a young woman .
Say what you want about Hillary Clinton , but she did n't ask to be treated differently .
She was able to take on the big boys and even throw some elbows , too .
I just can't believe this is the example that the Republicans want to set for the future and for young women especially .
More gay couples were married in California in the first three months that same - sex marriages were legal than were married in the first four years it was legal in Massachusetts , according to a new study .
The data , released Monday by UCLA ’s Williams Institute , found that an estimated 11,000 same - sex couples were married in California from June 17 , when the California Supreme Court began allowing the weddings , to Sept. 17 .
As of spring , 10,385 same - sex couples had wed in Massachusetts since the state legalized such unions in May 2004 , according to a study by the institute released in July .
Next month , Californians will decide whether gay couples can continue to marry when they vote on Proposition 8 , which would amend the state Constitution to define marriage as between only a man and a woman .

Predictably , the two sides in that battle had dramatically different reactions to the study .
“ People have waited for so long to be able to do this .
. . .
I ’m sure that is the reason for the big response , ” said Stevie St. John , a spokeswoman for the L.A. Gay & Lesbian Center .
She added that she thought the huge number of marriages was “ great . ”
Pastor Jim Garlow of Skyline Church in La Mesa , who has been rallying voters to pass the constitutional amendment , said : “ The fact that there are big numbers does n’t change the reality that it is still bad for the country . ”
Garlow , who along with hundreds of other Christians , is observing a fast until election day as a way to show his support for the proposed amendment , added : “ There are enormous numbers of people doing cocaine right now .
. . .
Simply because large numbers of people are doing something does not make it right . ”

Gary Gates , a demographer at the Williams Institute , a think tank devoted to the study of sexual orientation and the law , said the number of marriages , though large , represents only about 10 % of the same - sex couples in California
“ Who are these people getting married ?
What the other studies tell you is they are people in pretty long - term , stable relationships , ” he said .
There are more than 109,000 same - sex couples in California , an increase of 19,000 since 2000 , according to a Williams Institute analysis of the U.S. Census .
Nearly a quarter of these households have children -- and all together , there are more than 50,000 children living in same - sex households .
There is no way to know exactly how many same - sex marriages have been performed in California because the state does not collect information on the sex of couples who register to marry .
Advertisement
Gates said researchers arrived at their estimates by comparing the number of marriages in each county last year , before gay marriage was legal , with the number this year .
Any increase was assumed to be from same - sex couples tying the knot .
The only exception is San Francisco , which is keeping an exact tally of same - sex marriages .
There have been 2,708 from June 17 to Sept. 17 .
Gates speculated that many of the marriages in San Francisco and some other counties may be attributed to out - of - state couples , because many of the places with the biggest spikes in marriages -- Los Angeles , San Diego , San Francisco and Riverside counties -- are top tourist destinations .
California and Massachusetts are the only two states in the country to allow same - sex marriage .
And until recently , Massachusetts allowed only legal residents to marry .
Advertisement
Also this month , the California Department of Public Health said that it is changing the state ’s marriage license form -- again .
After same - sex marriage became legal , the state released forms that eliminated “ bride ” and “ groom ” and replaced them with “ Party A ” and “ Party B . ”
Many couples were offended by the change .
One couple filed a lawsuit demanding to be allowed to identify themselves as bride and groom .
State officials refused to comment on the suit , but the new forms , set to go into effect Nov. 17 , give couples the option of identifying themselves as bride and groom .
Advertisement
Couples can also choose to identify themselves as bride and bride or groom and groom .
Or they can leave the space blank .
Of course , if Proposition 8 is approved by voters , the state may need to change the forms again .
In a report filed with the secretary of state ’s office , the No - on - 8 campaign disclosed it had raised $ 15.75 million by the end of last month , including $ 1.36 million from donors giving less than $ 1,000 .
The no-campaign has spent $ 14.7 million this year , including $ 10.4 million on television advertising .
Among the major donors to No - on - 8 were several wealthy gay rights advocates ; in addition , the Service Employees International Union has given $ 500,000 and the California Teachers Assn. $ 250,000 .

The Yes - on - 8 campaign had not filed its disclosure by late Monday .

« Senate Votes Today on $ 700 Billion Bailout | Main | NO BAILOUT : Watch Ron Paul on CNN Today »
Bailout is no solution : A simple accounting procedure fixes this whole thing
This whole thing can be fixed by simply allowing the banks that hold these bad mortgages to write them down to zero ( if necessary ) and take the loss .
Then the money will flow again as the banks will now be within their reserve requirement limits .
This wo n't be wanted by the bank execs however as they are paid BIG BONUSES on profits , not on losses .
Again , we can save $ 700,000,000,000 ( yes that is what 700 billion looks like ) by urging our government to make a short term accounting rule modification that will free up the credit markets .
A simply stroke of the pen will save us billions , probably trillions .
Call your senators today and urge them to vote " No " .
If you want a short further explanation for this see below .
The banks are allowed to lend up to 10 times the money they hold in reserves .
That means that for every dollar you deposit , the bank can lend out $ 10 .
This $ 1 is know as the reserves that must be held by the banks in cash so you can get cash back out of the bank .
( When you hear of banks going insolvent , it is because their cash on hand has fallen below the 10 % reserve requirement .
In short , they do n't have the money to give back to their customers .
SO the FDIC steps in to return the deposits to the banks customer . )
In good times the banks make these loans on the 10 to 1 ratio ( loans to reserves ) on mortgages etc .
They in turn get a piece of paper call a promissory note and mortgage that is their guarantee of either getting paid their mortgage or getting the home .
The banks would then sell this paper to investors who wanted the interest rate return ( say 6 % ) .
The bank then received money for the loan and could then loan out the money again .
What has happened is that the investors are not buying the loans anymore because the loans are not sound investments .
Thus the banks are stuck with them .
Since they are stuck with them , they can no longer turn this note and mortgage into cash .
If the banks do n't have the cash , they can't loan it out .
Thus a credit crunch occurs .
Which is where we are today .
THE FIX :
The EASY way to fix this is as follows .
Temporarily change the accounting rules to allow the banks to write off these bad loans .
Down to zero if necessary .
Then the banks will have money again to make loans and free up the credit .
The banks could then sell these loans at a much reduced price and the market would open up again as the price for the note and mortgage fell .
Problem solved without any tax payers dollars .
Where does the money to loan out again come from is we are just writing this off on the books .
The same place the banks got the money from in the first place ... out of thin air .
It is all on paper .
It is not real cash , because the banks are allowed to lend out 10 times the amount they take in from deposits .
It is money created out of thin air .
And it happens all time since 1913 .
Personally , I would like to see that if the accounting rules were changed , that the banks would have to give these zero value loans to the taxpayers , who would then collect interest on the loans and act in the capacity of Fannie Mae .
Everyone makes out except the shareholders ( as no dividends would be issued ) and the execs that are paid bonuses on profits . :)

Summary : Landscapes in different climates respond very differently to similar management .
Management that does n't suit the landscape is the leading cause of desertification worldwide .

The concept of brittleness was developed by Allan Savory to explain differences in how landscapes respond to disturbances such as grazing :
In places such as England and eastern North America , land heals fastest when left undisturbed .
Free of fire or grazers , it revegetates rapidly .
In Africa , landscapes that fed wild herds of millions quickly desertify when grazed by just a few cattle .
The key difference is how these landscapes respond to prolonged rest ( absence of disturbance ) .
Brittle or nonbrittle ?
Savory calls these areas
Areas where prolonged rest causes problems may have high or low rainfall , but all have a dry season .
These areas are brittle .
Most areas lie somewhere between brittle and nonbrittle .
Brittleness is different from aridity .
An arctic forest may need only a little moisture to remain damp throughout its short , cool growing season .
By contrast , an 8 - month dry season makes some parts of Africa very brittle in spite of 1500 mm ( 60 inches ) rain per year .
Brittleness varies within landscapes .
The windy , sun -baked top of a hill may be dry and brittle , while the bottom of the sheltered ravine below it stays damp year - round .
Nonbrittle areas
Constant moisture keeps decay organisms active throughout the growing season .
Dead grass stems and twigs quickly rot at the base and fall over , producing natural mulch .
Insects , fungi , and microorganisms work together to compost this material , and quickly turn it into new soil and plant food .
The soil surface stays moist and easy to for seedlings to push through , and the damp earth keeps young plants from drying out .
Conventional range science originated mostly in nonbrittle and semi- brittle areas .
It fails when transplanted to brittle landscapes because ecosystem processes work so differently there .
Brittle areas
Oleg Kosterin Joy Livingwell Joy Livingwell
Because of long dry periods , brittle areas have slow decay .
New plants have a hard time establishing , and bare ground is difficult to vegetate .
Dry periods cause decay organisms to die off during part of the year .
Without active decay , dead growth may stand for years or decades , trapping nutrients and shading growing parts of the plant .
Unmulched soil between plants often dries into a hard cap ( crust ) that seedlings can't push through .
Young plants are likely to dry out before their roots get deep enough to find reliable moisture .
Yet many of the world 's most productive landscapes are brittle or semi-brittle , including Africa 's Serengeti and North America 's deep - soiled prairies .
What 's nature 's secret ?
In brittle and semi - brittle areas , nature depends on animals to plant , mulch , and compost .
These areas are or were home to vast numbers of herding grazers , such as wildebeest , springbok , and bison .
Pack - hunting predators kept them bunched and moving .
A bunched herd tramples dead vegetation into mulch that protects the soil surface and keeps it moist .
Hooves break soil crusts and plant seeds deeply enough to survive dry periods .
The grazers ' digestive systems provide year - round composting that recycles vegetation into high - quality fertilizer .
Brittleness affects land management
The distinction between brittle and nonbrittle environments is crucial because
Nonbrittle areas thrive on prolonged rest .
Bare ground quickly covers with vegetation , and if the climate is right , a forest soon springs up .
Brittle areas need disturbance to recycle standing dead vegetation into mulch , plant seeds , and break soil caps that keep air and water out of the soil .
Plants in these areas depend on periodic grazing to remove their standing dead growth , which then becomes new soil .
Because of the obvious damage livestock do if left in one place too long , people often try to heal brittle landscapes by reducing or eliminating grazing animals .
This may produce temporary improvement , but in the long run rest desertifies brittle land .
On the other hand , periodic grazing and trampling followed by adequate recovery periods keeps brittle land healthy .
This is how nature manages these landscapes -- with herds that move and migrate , grazing and trampling heavily but then moving on .
How to tell if a landscape is brittle or nonbrittle
These columns describe extremes .
brittle and nonbrittle .
Nonbrittle Brittle Always humid while above freezing Long dry periods Dependable moisture throughout the year
The year is divided into wet and dry seasons
In most years rainfall is close to average Rainfall is often far above or far below average Rapid biological decay ; dead growth rots from the bottom and falls over Slow decay by weathering at the tips of twigs and grasses ; dead growth may stand for years or decades , turning gray with age Rested land heals from damage ( bare ground returns to forest )
Prolonged rest damages and desertifies land ; animal impact ( the intense trampling and dunging of animals in a tight herd ) heals it Vegetation grows nearly everywhere , on roofs and gutters , on rocks and vertical banks , even on window glass Bare surfaces are difficult to vegetate and steep banks may remain bare of even algae for decades Closely spaced grasses , with individual plants often hard to distinguish .
Strongly clumped grasses , often widely spaced Heavy overgrazing produces tight plant cover in a near monoculture , resembling a lawn ; small bare areas may develop near points of extreme concentration Heavy overgrazing produces bare ground between plants , but plant spacing is controlled mainly by amount of animal impact , which plants seeds .
Few big herbivores that are solitary or live in small bands ( tapir , okapi , gorilla , moose )
Many big herbivores forming large herds ( bison , wildebeest , zebra ) Solitary predators ( tigers , cougars ) Pack - hunting predators ( lions , wolves )
Brittleness scale
Savory places landscapes on anfrom 1 ( very nonbrittle ) to 10 ( very brittle ) .
He emphasizes that this scale is not precise -- the important thing is whether you are dealing with a brittle , semi- brittle , or nonbrittle environment , because that 's what affects the land 's response to management .
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 very nonbrittle nonbrittle semi- brittle brittle very brittle
Brittleness - productivity scale
Recently Jim Howell developed athat does more to explain the management differences between biomes : Jim 's scaleFor instance , the main issue in a high - production brittle environment is getting enough grazing and trampling to prevent dead plant material from building up .
In low - production brittle environments , giving plants sufficient recovery periods between grazings is more important .

A few decades ago , the concept of brittleness was unknown .
Understanding it helped unravel the age - old mystery of desertification .
Today this new knowledge is helping people around the world reverse desertification and restore damaged land .
As humanity comes to understand more about how nature works , we can restore nature 's productivity and health , and thus sustain ourselves and future generations .

Setup for a Stolen Election ?
AP Poll “ Tightens ” Race to a Point – 44 % - 43 % Michael Collins
“ Scoop ” Independent News
The Associated press came out with a remarkable poll Thursday .
It claimed that the presidential race had tightened from the consistent leads Obama has shown over the past weeks to become one of those “ too close to call ” national elections .
Their poll , conducted by German polling firm GfK , showed 44 % for Obama and 43 % for McCain .
How could this be ?
In the Real Clear Politics average of major national polls , Oct 24 , Obama ’s average lead is 7.5 % .
The four national polls conducted on the same days as the AP poll show an average 9.2 % Obama lead .
The polls after the AP “ tightening ” effort shows an 8.7 % Obama lead .
Clearly the AP - GfK poll is an exception or outlier , as those are called .
Yet the AP presents this as news , not opinion .
What is AP Up To ?
AP acknowledges that its poll is different from the other national polls but claims it ’s not “ alone . ”
It is n’t .
There is exactly one other poll that agrees with AP out of 16 presented on the Real Clear Politics summary for Oct. 24 .
AP ignores the tentative nature of the poll and presents the story as “ news . ”
It begins drawing conclusions from the poll at the start of the article with “ rumors ” from unidentified sources ;
“ The poll , which found Obama at 44 percent and McCain at 43 percent , supports what some Republicans and Democrats privately have said in recent days : that the race narrowed after the third debate as GOP - leaning voters drifted home to their party and McCain ’s “ Joe the plumber ” analogy struck a chord . ”
AP , Oct. 23 , 2008
Reviewing the internal details and questions of the poll analysis by GfK , there are no questions about Joe the Plumber .
Since this is the opening claim , mentioned again as central to the shift AP is selling us , it ’s important to look at how the debate was viewed by the public .
CNN and CBS both did national polls the evening of the debate .
CNN reported that 58 % of those watching the debate thought Obama won , with only 31 % favoring McCain .
CBS polled uncommitted voters who judged Obama the winner over McCain by 53 % to 22 % .
This was the biggest margin for Obama for the series of three counters .
What was going on with the AP sample of voters ?
AP ’s Flawed Poll
The Associated Press is no stranger to polling .
It is the lead sponsor for the national exit polls for Presidential and Congressional elections .
Their recent effort in 2006 surveyed over 13,000 individuals and produced detailed demographic results on voters that actually contradict their current effort .
The built in bias of the AP poll is obvious when one reviews the internals .
45 % of the 800 person likely voter sample described themselves as “ born again or evangelical ” Christians .
The remaining 55 % said no ( AP - GfK p. 24 ) .
AP should have known that it ’s 2006 exit poll showed that 36 % of respondents were born again , a much lower percentage than included in their McCain friendly poll of yesterday .
Also , AP should have known the 2006 exit poll the group had a 60 % preference for Republican candidates over Democrats .
The election magic for McCain was complete before the presidential preferences were even sampled .
The over representation of Christians and the born agains in the sample guaranteed a preference for McCain .
But there was more .
A look at the poll shows that 1,101 registered voters were surveyed .
The final poll consisted of 800 “ likely voters ” taken from that group .
The registered voters divided up with 48 % for Obama and 38 % for McCain .
The reduction of Obama support and increase for McCain indicates that McCain ’s voters are highly motivated to turnout while Obama ’s are more likely to stay home .
This contradicts the actual evidence available showing major gains in newly registered voters for Obama and huge advantages in primary turnout for Democrats compared Republicans .
It ’s small crowds for McCain and record breaking gatherings for Obama around the country , including 35,000 in Leesburg , Virginia on Thursday Oct. 23 .
In polling , the sample determines the outcome of a poll .
If you bias the poll sample toward groups that are well known to support one party , then the poll will reflect that sample selection .
In this case , AP , GfK did just that .
They created a Republican friendly sample which displayed more motivation to vote because it started out Republican friendly .
The AP - GfK “ Giveaway ”
Within the details of the poll , there ’s a major clue that something is very wrong .
The likely voter sample was asked questions that are directly related to attacks and negative campaigning .
Voters are consistent in decrying what they perceive as unfair attacks .
Note how they perceive each candidate ’s “ attacks ” during the campaign :
AP wants us to believe that the same sample that made these responses also showed lower than average support for Obama and higher for McCain even .
A clear majority describe McCain and Palin as “ mostly unfair ” in their attacks on Obama .
An equally clear majority of the sample say that the Obama and Biden attacks on McCain are “ mostly fair .
” On a recent Larry King show , the anchors for the major networks were asked for a prediction on the presidential election .
Brian Williams of NBC practically came out of his seat when he encouraged viewers to get up and “ run ” from anyone who tells you that they know how this election will come out .
The other anchors echoed these sentiments .
This is the very worst type of news commentary .
How could Williams know that a month or so ago ?
Why would the others just bob their heads ?
Are they preparing us for something “ special ? ”
The analysis of the AP , ABC , CBS , CNN , FOX , NBC “ media consortium ” final exit poll might provide a clue : Election 2004 : The Urban Legend .
The past is prolog .

Entertainment is perhaps the best use to which the pseudoscience of polygraphy can be put , just so long as everyone understands that it's all for laughs ( as on the Howard Stern show ) .
Regrettably ,
Admitted Sex Addict Michael
The 26 November 2008 installment of the Dr. Phil show , titled ,
Desperate Wife Elaine
Michael 's wife , Elaine , suspects that there is more that her husband has n't told her .
She fears that he may take a sexual interest in children and that their two young daughters may be at risk .
Elaine is desperate for answers .
And so Dr. Phil suggests a lie detector test :
Quote :
Dr. Phil :
You understand , at this point , there are two issues here that I 'm looking at .
One is ( facing Michael ) , " Can you get help and get this under control ? "
And the other is ( facing Elaine ) , " What do you need to do ? "
What do you need to do about your marriage ?
What do you need to do about your family ?
Whether he gets this under control or not , number one , you gotta know where the bottom is .
You gotta know the truth , right ?
So you 're dealing with a full set of data so you can make an informed decision , and your number one mission in this world , in life , is to protect those two girls .
So you have to know the truth .
You need to polygraph this man .
You need to find out whether he 's thought about these daughters , whether he 's done anything with these daughters , whether he deals with those images , and what it is that you do n't know that you need to know , so that you can make some informed decisions .
Do you agree with that ?
Elaine : Absolutely , I do .
Dr. Phil : ( to Michael )
Are you willing to do that ?
Michael : Yes .
Dr. Phil :
Are you willing to sit for a polygraph and answer the questions that she needs so she has a full set of data to make an informed decision ?
Michael : Anything she needs .
I 'm tired of seeing her suffer through this .
Polygraph Operator Jack Trimarco
Retired FBI polygrapher
Quote :
Dr. Phil : I asked Jack Trimarco to come here today .
He is a highly respected polygraph examiner , and he is willing to administer a polygraph to Michael .
Jack , you understand , this one 's important , right ?
I mean , that she needs some serious answers here about where he is .
Jack Trimarco : Very important .
Sex Addiction Faith Healer Michael Weiss
Quote :
Dr. Phil :
There are people that specialize in this kind of intervention .
Dr. Douglas Weiss is the executive director of the Heart to Heart Counseling Center , which is based in Colorado Springs .
He 's written numerous books and learnèd treatises on this -- is what I consider to be a cutting edge expert on this area .
He 's here today .
He says that sex addicts often lie about these things to themselves and others .
Dr. Weiss , what do you think about this situation .
Dr. Weiss :
Well I think that Michael is a classic sex addict .
And he 's an opportunist .
You know , when you talk about a polygraph , that 's very insightful because an opportunist usually does n't get better unless a polygraph is there regularly so they can grow , emotionally and morally .
So this is a good start , Dr. Phil .
A scientifically invalid test for emotional and moral growth ?
Really ?
As an aside , regular readers of AntiPolygraph.org may recall that former Colorado Springs clergyman
But let us return to our present polygraph saga .
The show returns from a commercial break :
Jack Trimarco Polygraphs Michael
Quote :
Dr. Phil : Elaine says , if the results of the polygraph show that Michael is lying to her , that that 's it .
She 's done .
That 's grounds for divorce .
So when we come back , we 're going to have some of those answers .
Well , we 're continuing the story of Elaine and Michael .
Now , they both say their marriage hangs by a thread because of the double life Michael has been leading .
Now Michael has just taken a polygraph examination and has been asked very specific questions that Elaine says she needs answers to .
You 've just been gone for a brief commercial break .
We 've actually been gone for about three hours , because we had to conduct this polygraph in accordance with the appropriate protocols , and that takes a lot of time .
She says she 's ready to divorce Michael if he showed deception on any of the answers .
Now , I guess my question to you before we get to the results here is , " Where are you on all of this ? "
And I ask that because , as we went over this morning , you had glaring warning signs of sexual dysfunction on the part of your husband before you married him .
You 've had a series of , of problems along the way that you know about .
And you 've continued to stay hooked up despite the fact that there are children in this , in this situation .
Um , are you at a crossroads ?
Elaine : I am most definitely at a crossroads .
When your children see you cry every single day , it makes it harder and harder to stay and fight .
I justify it .
I tell myself it 's for the kids .
It makes it a really really tough decision .
Before we get these results , I would like to give him one last chance , before he 's made to tell me the truth , if there is anything he needs to tell me , because just in his own writings , which he has allowed me to read some of his thoughts , with his permission , he wrote , in his own words , " I met a woman for sex several times at lunch . "
About twenty times I 've asked him , he said it was " once . "
Dr. Phil : ( to Michael )
Have you lied to her about that ?
Michael : I , uh , do n't believe so .
Uh ...
Dr. Phil : I guess the thing that I 'm trying to do here is -- look , at this point , the only possible way to have any sense of -- I mean , you went into the pre-interviews with us before this show blaming her for your addiction .
Michael : Yeah .
Dr. Phil :
But you know that one of the characteristics of a sexual addict is to blame others , to project on others , to deny , justify , rationalize , to do everything you can to hang on to your addiction and not take accountability for it .
And you 're doing that here .
And she 's asking you , she 's pleading with you to tell her the truth .
Jack Trimarco is going to tell us the results of this in a minute , but I 'm just saying , if there 's something you want to do now to tell her the truth , tell her now .
Michael :
It 's been hard to know what I 've told her and what I have n't told her .
Things have gotten so --
Elaine :
That 's so typical .
That 's his excuse every single time .
Michael :
That 's what I 'm saying .
I've --
Elaine : I can't be his memory 24/7 for him .
When I am , I 'm told that I do n't remember it correctly or he did n't say that .
This is what we go through at home when there 's no cameras , when there 's no doctors , when there 's no therapists and there 's no professionals .
Dr. Phil : ( To Michael )
You know , I want to grab you and shake you .
I do .
And I say that out of kindness .
I want to grab you and shake you , ' cause I 'm watching you self - destruct .
You have your wife sitting -- this beautiful woman sitting here in front of you saying , " Tell me the truth ! "
You 're saying , " Gee , I do n't recollect . "
Come on .
I mean , that 's insulting to me .
It 's insulting to her , and it 's insulting to you .
Michael : I feel like I 've told her everything there is to tell , I mean --
Dr. Phil : Okay .
All right .
When we come back , we 're gonna take a look at these polygraph results .
It 's tragic that Elaine is ready to base her decision whether or not to divorce Michael on the results of a lie detector test .
But it 's an outrage that Dr. Phil and Dr. Weiss have n't disabused her of the notion that polygraph chart readings can be relied upon for such purposes .
The show returns from another commercial break :
Quote :
Dr. Phil :
Well today we 're talking about what to do when a sexual addiction is destroying your marriage .
This affects millions of people in our society today .
It wrecks marriages , it wrecks relationships , and it destroys the lives of the addicts as well .
Elaine and Michael have been married for seven years .
They both admit that Michael 's sexual addiction is tearing their marriage apart .
Jack Trimarco is here .
Jack , you 've conducted this polygraph .
What is your confidence in the test results that you 've generated here .
Jack Trimarco :
Well my confidence is very high .
Science tells us the polygraph is 93 percent accurate when conducted by someone who has like credentials .
Here , Trimarco
Quote :
Dr. Phil :
All right .
And , Michael , let me ask you .
Did you feel that you were treated carefully and professionally and appropriately by Jack Trimarco in the administration of this examination .
Michael : Yes .
Very much so .
Dr. Phil :
All right .
So , you did n't get ambushed , there were n't any tricks .
You were explained everything before it was asked .
There was n't any shock effect --
Michael : No .
Dr. Phil : -- or anything of that nature .
Michael : Yeah .
While Trimarco may have been polite and , in keeping with normal polygraph practice , reviewed all questions during the pretest phase , he would not have revealed to Michael that polygraphy actually depends on trickery -- and the naïveté and gullibility of the person being " tested . "
Nor would Trimarco have disclosed that the procedure is inherently biased against the truthful : the more candidly one answers the so - called " control " questions ( answers to which are secretly expected to be less than honest ) , and as a consequence feels less anxiety when answering them , the more likely one is to wrongly fail !
See Chapter 3 of
And now the moment the audience has been waiting for , the polygraph results !
First Question
Quote :
Dr. Phil : ( To Elaine )
So , they 're probably pretty confident in these , and I know they 're important , so you need to hear them .
All right , let me ask the question : " Since October 2001 , have you deliberately not told your wife about any sexual contact with another person ? "
That 's a key date , right ?
Michael :
That was our marriage date .
Dr. Phil : Right .
And you answered what to that question ?
Michael : " No . "
Dr. Phil : Okay .
Do you really mean that ?
Michael : Yeah .
Dr. Phil :
The answer 's " No . "
Michael : Yeah .
I feel like I 've told her everything .
Dr. Phil : Jack , what was the result .
Jack Trimarco : Conclusively deceptive .
" Deceptive " Flashes on the Screen
If you 're like me , you might be wondering , why on Earth did Jack Trimarco select such a poor relevant question ?
Is he taking his job seriously at all ?
Michael has already admitted to numerous sexual encounters that he had hidden from his wife .
It seems both Michael and Elaine are confused , too :
Quote :
Dr. Phil : Okay .
Um , he 's saying that this is not true , that since your marriage you have deliberately concealed from your wife sexual contacts , and since October 2001 you have deliberately not told you [ sic ] -- not just that you forgot -- that you deliberately failed to tell her about sexual contact with another person .
Michael :
The first part of the test , I was confused on at first .
Because I said well I 've , I 've told things to her since we were married .
So you know , I have n't withheld everything .
Dr. Phil :
But I just asked you before we went over the results , I said , did you get a fair test , was it a judicious [ sic ] test --
Michael : Yes , I was --
Dr. Phil : -- did you understand , was it clear , were you -- was it appropriate ?
You said , " Yes , yes , yes , yes , yes . "
Now , when it says you were deceptive , you say , " Well , I was confused . "
Elaine : What ?
Does that include ...
Did that question specify anything that ...
Yes .
Okay .
He has withheld things since that day .
But he 's come clean on some things .
Was that specifically about anything else he might be hiding ?
Dr. Phil :
We 'll talk about that in a minute .
Let 's get to the other questions .
We 'll have it all on the table , and then we 'll discuss it as much as you would like .
Question Two
Quote :
Dr. Phil : ( Addressing Michael )
" Have you ever touched any child for sexual purposes ? "
Michael : No .
Dr. Phil : Your answer was ?
Michael : No .
Dr. Phil : ( Adressing Jack Trimarco )
And the result was ?
Jack Trimarco : Conclusively deceptive .
" Deceptive " Again Flashes Across the Screen
Quote :
Michael : Taah .
Elaine Sobs
Dr. Phil proceeds to the third and last question :
Third Question
Quote :
Dr. Phil :
Have you ever used an image of a child as a sexual stimulant ?
( On the board , " stimulate " is written . )
Michael : No .
Dr. Phil :
And the result was ?
Jack Trimarco : Deceptive .
Note that this time the result is just " deceptive , " not " conclusively deceptive . "
No explanation is offered , and the distinction is not mentioned on the show .
Michael , maintaining his innocence , tries to explain the results :
Quote :
Michael : I know I was nervous during that entire time , and my back was twitching from the chair I was sitting in , but no , I have not done those , and that really bugs me that test says that ( I'm ) deceptive , because I have not ever touched a child or looked at a child in that way or done that .
Ever .
I do n't know why they would have came up deceptive .
Dr. Phil : ( To Elaine )
What 's your reaction to all this ?
Elaine : ( long pause ) I ... ( long pause ) I do n't want to believe it .
I do n't want to believe that there was something wrong .
To know that I have allowed this around my kids .
He 's gonna go home and he 's gonna tell me that , there , it was n't true .
Where do , what do I do with that ?
What do I do with that ?
Michael :
It actually disgusts me to think of children in that way .
I mean , I 've ... I 've said that .
So I do n't know why that test --
Dr. Phil :
Why did you say that you should have -- that if you get a divorce you should be supervised in your visitation with your children ?
Why did you agree to that ?
Elaine : I think because he knows , and he has a progressive disease .
He does n't have a choice in that matter .
Michael : And I agreed to that .
Because if we divorce and that is what she decides , I 'm not gonna -- I 'm not gonna fight her on it .
I mean , I want what 's best for my children in that case , and I 'm not gonna -- I 'm not gonna put them through a custody battle or any of that .
Dr. Phil then turns to Jack Trimarco to bolster the dependability of the polygraph results :
Quote :
Dr. Phil : Jack , you do n't have a dog in this fight , do you ?
Jack Trimarco : ( shakes head " no " )
Dr. Phil : I mean , you 're totally objecti -- I mean do you have any preconceived notion about this one way or the other ?
Jack Trimarco : No , Dr. Phil .
Whenever I go into a polygraph I 'm on the fence post .
It does n't matter what evidence there is .
I believe the polygraph charts .
That 's what I 'm trained to do , and that 's what , uh , qualified professional polygraph examiners do .
However disinterested a polygraph operator may believe himself to be , it 's unrealistic to suppose that a polygraph examiner 's expectations will have no influence on test outcomes .
Michael continues in vain to try to explain the results :
Quote :
Michael : I did mention that the chair was uncomfortable ...
Jack Trimarco : Yeah , you did .
Michael : ' Cause I could n't get relaxed .
Jack Trimarco : Right .
After a digression , Dr. Phil takes up the polygraph results with Michael .
The confusion relating to the wording of the first question rises again :
Quote :
Dr. Phil :
We have the polygraph result , which says deception , deception , deception .
You say ( facing Michael ) , " That 's wrong . "
Michael : Mmm hmm .
Dr. Phil : Okay , ' cause I want to make sure you 're on the record here of denying that and saying that 's wrong .
Michael : Mainly the last part about children .
Dr. Phil : I 'm trying to get an answer that we can build some truth on here .
I 'm trying to help you here , man !
Michael : I know , and I want to get better .
Dr. Phil :
Are you telling me that since your marriage , that you have not deliberately concealed from your wife any sexual contact with another person ?
Michael :
Well , see , I was thinking guilty conscience of that , because yes , at first I did .
Before we found out I was a sex addict , I was withholding that information .
Dr. Phil :
So why did you say no ?
Michael :
He said , the question was worded " deliberately . "
He said , " So , since you 've divulged information to your wife , is there anything you have -- you deliberately withheld when you divulged .
Dr. Phil : ( to Elaine )
You have told us there were times that he said , " I 'm stuck in traffic , " and you later found out --
Elaine : Oh , I 've talked to him and he told me he was --
Dr. Phil : that he was at a bookstore , that he 's over visiting with family , and you later found out ( facing Michael ) that you were at a bookstore .
That 's just not credible !
Michael : Yeah .
But I have came clean with her on that .
Michael asks Dr. Weiss whether his sex addiction could have influenced his polygraph results :
Quote :
Michael : Could we ask Dr. Weiss if it 's very hard for a sex addict with scrambled , confused thoughts to pass a polygraph test ?
Has that been a known thing ?
Dr. Weiss :
That 's a fair question , Michael .
That , I mean , we 've done hundreds of polygraphs with sex addicts and most sex addicts , they 're either being deceptive or they do pass .
Note that while Dr. Weiss characterizes Michael 's question as " fair , " he does n't provide a straight answer .
It is not unusual that anyone -- sex addict or not , truthful or not -- would react strongly when asked " hot " questions of the kind that Trimarco put to Michael .
Because Michael has failed the polygraph , Elaine now fears she might commit an act of violence against Michael :
Quote :
Elaine : I fear for my children , please do n't mistake that .
But what I fear is him making it home to my children .
Dr. Phil : I understand that 's a macho thing to say .
The prudent thing that I 'm asking you is , " Do you intend to take precautions with your children ? "
Have you heard things here today that suggest to you that you would not feel comfortable with him being around your children ?
Elaine : Yes .
Michael : I 'm sure she has , because I failed the polygraph .
But I would -- I 'll take that polygraph however many times you want me to take it .
Elaine :
Is it worth having him take it a second time ?
Is it gonna be any different ?
And what if it comes back the second time the same ?
Then what ?
A third shot ?
I mean , Dr. Phil 's not me .
I give you twenty chances .
Michael : I 'm the only one who knows me , and what I have and have n't done , and I have not done those things .
Elaine expresses a desire to speak with Jack Trimarco , and a post - taping session is held :
Post - Taping Conference
Quote :
Elaine : ( to Michael )
They 're not giving me any reason to believe you .
Michael : Huh , the lie detector test .
What more can I do about it ?
Elaine : I mean you surfed the Web so much .
Do you realize any of that could have been child pornography , and maybe your psyche remembers it ?
Michael : Anytime I saw it , I moved directly to something else .
Elaine : Okay , did you tell him that , that you have seen it ?
Michael :
Is it possible for a sex addict whose mind is just constantly got [ deletion ] going on --
Elaine :
You got to clear your mind for a lie detector test .
Did he not tell you that ?
Michael : No , he did n't tell me that .
Jack Trimarco Enters the Room
Quote :
Jack Trimarco :
Hey guys .
Elaine : I just have a few questions .
When a person takes a test , and they 're sitting there , thinking in their head , all that thought that just went through their mind , what does that do ?
Jack Dodges Elaine 's Question
Quote :
Jack Trimarco :
Well that 's why we review the questions first , before they 're asked on the test .
Trimarco 's answer to Elaine is not really responsive .
Although questions are reviewed first , as Trimarco correctly states , this pre-test review cannot stop thoughts , such as revulsion at the question being asked , or fear of the consequences of not being believed , from producing reactions that could lead a truthful person to wrongly fail .
Having failed to answer Elaine 's question , Trimarco directs an accusatory statement to Michael :
Jack Accuses Michael
Quote :
Jack Trimarco : I reviewed those charts , and they were very clear that you 've got some explaining to do .
Michael Is Angered by Jack's Accusation
Quote :
Michael : I 'm really mad as hell right now .
I 've been falsely accused of doing something that I did not do .
I have not touched a child .
Elaine : Can you give me something to believe in ?
Michael : No .
Elaine :
You know , you leave me with no choice .
Michael : Yeah , I know .
( Gets up and exits the room . )
Elaine :
He 's still the father of my kids , and I still love him and I would still want him to get help .
What am I supposed to do ?
One thing Elaine should not do is to rely on polygraph results to make the crucial decisions she faces .
As in numerous past Dr. Phil episodes where the lie detector has been trotted out , the polygraph has failed to provide any real answers .
Nonetheless , the lie detector may well have achieved its intended effect : that of boosting viewership during Nielsen 's all - important Entertainment is perhaps the best use to which the pseudoscience of polygraphy can be put , just so long as everyone understands that it's all for laughs ( as on the Howard Stern show ) .
Regrettably , Dr. Phil McGraw -- who with a Ph.D. in clinical psychology should know better -- has for years been falsely promoting polygraphy as a scientifically valid test that can provide meaningful answers to serious life questions -- though somehow it never seems to do so in the episodes wherein he turns to the polygraph for answers .
The 26 November 2008 installment of theshow , titled , " A Husband 's Double Life , " is a prime example of such misplaced and irresponsible reliance on the lie detector .
The episode delves into lurid details of husband Michael 's numerous infidelities to his wife , Elaine .
Michael -- a self - described " sex addict " and father of two young girls -- admits that he has performed oral sex on an estimated 80 men at adult bookstores , that he has met other women for sex , that he has masturbated while driving on the freeway , and that he now faces legal consequences for his behavior .
He has been in counseling since October 2007 and claims to have been sexually " sober " since September 2008 .
Michael 's wife , Elaine , suspects that there is more that her husband has n't told her .
She fears that he may take a sexual interest in children and that their two young daughters may be at risk .
Elaine is desperate for answers .
And so Dr. Phil suggests a lie detector test : Retired FBI polygrapher Jack Trimarco is on hand to perform the polygraph services :
A scientifically invalid test for emotional and moral growth ?
Really ?
Dr. Weiss operates the Heart to Heart Counseling Center in Colorado Springs , Colorado , which markets sex addiction counseling services .
A FAQ on Weiss ' website offers an interesting explanation of why people become sexually addicted : " Spiritually , a person is filling up the God hole in them with their sexual addiction .
" As an aside , regular readers of AntiPolygraph.org may recall that former Colorado Springs clergyman Ted Haggard went to erstwhile male prostitute Mike Jones to get his " God hole " filled .
Jones failed a polygraph test regarding his sex and drug allegations , but was vindicated when Haggard resigned in disgrace as president of the National Association of Evangelicals .
Perhaps Haggard had in fact been filling up the " gay hole " in him with religion ( not to mention an extra large helping of hypocrisy ) ?
But let us return to our present polygraph saga .
The show returns from a commercial break :
It 's tragic that Elaine is ready to base her decision whether or not to divorce Michael on the results of a lie detector test .
But it 's anthat Dr. Phil and Dr. Weiss have n't disabused her of the notion that polygraph chart readings can be relied upon for such purposes .
The show returns from another commercial break :
Here , Trimarco repeats a falsehood that he has uttered numerous times .
In fact , polygraphy has not been proven to reliably detect deception at better - than - chance levels under field conditions .
The best available field studies suggest ( 255 kb PDF ) that " if a subject fails a polygraph , the probability that she is , in fact , being deceptive is little more than chance alone ; that is , one could flip a coin and get virtually the same result for a positive test based on the published data . "
Indeed , the consensus view among scientists is that polygraphy has no scientific basis While Trimarco may have been polite and , in keeping with normal polygraph practice , reviewed all questions during the pretest phase , he would not have revealed to Michael that polygraphy actually -- and the naïveté and gullibility of the person being " tested . "
Nor would Trimarco have disclosed that the procedure is inherently biased against the truthful : the more candidly one answers the so - called " control " questions ( answers to which are secretly expected to be less than honest ) , and as a consequence feels less anxiety when answering them , the more likely one is to wrongly fail !
See Chapter 3 of The Lie Behind the Lie Detector ( 1 mb PDF ) for a thorough exposition of polygraph procedure .
And now the moment the audience has been waiting for , the polygraph results !
If you 're like me , you might be wondering , why on Earth did Jack Trimarco select such a poor relevant question ?
Is he taking his job seriously at all ?
Michael has already admitted to numerous sexual encounters that he had hidden from his wife .
It seems both Michael and Elaine are confused , too : Dr. Phil proceeds to the third and last question : Note that this time the result is just " deceptive , " not " conclusively deceptive . "
No explanation is offered , and the distinction is not mentioned on the show .
Michael , maintaining his innocence , tries to explain the results : Dr. Phil then turns to Jack Trimarco to bolster the dependability of the polygraph results :
However disinterested a polygraph operator may believe himself to be , it 's unrealistic to suppose that a polygraph examiner 's expectations will have no influence on test outcomes .
Michael continues in vain to try to explain the results :
After a digression , Dr. Phil takes up the polygraph results with Michael .
The confusion relating to the wording of the first question rises again : Michael asks Dr. Weiss whether his sex addiction could have influenced his polygraph results :
Note that while Dr. Weiss characterizes Michael 's question as " fair , " he does n't provide a straight answer .
It is not unusual that anyone -- sex addict or not , truthful or not -- would react strongly when asked " hot " questions of the kind that Trimarco put to Michael .
Because Michael has failed the polygraph , Elaine now fears she might commit an act of violence against Michael : Elaine expresses a desire to speak with Jack Trimarco , and a post - taping session is held : Trimarco 's answer to Elaine is not really responsive .
Although questions are reviewed first , as Trimarco correctly states , this pre-test review cannot stop thoughts , such as revulsion at the question being asked , or fear of the consequences of not being believed , from producing reactions that could lead a truthful person to wrongly fail .
Having failed to answer Elaine 's question , Trimarco directs an accusatory statement to Michael : One thing Elaine shoulddo is to rely on polygraph results to make the crucial decisions she faces .
As in numerous pastepisodes where the lie detector has been trotted out , the polygraph has failed to provide any real answers .
Nonetheless , the lie detector may well have achieved its intended effect : that of boosting viewership during Nielsen 's all - important November sweeps , the last day of which was 26 November , the day this episode aired !
Wikinger Reformstau im Drachenboot
Die Wikinger waren die größte Seemacht des frühen Mittelalters .
Als Plünderer , Händler und Pioniere legten sie sich in die Riemen , wenn Profit lockte .
Im dänischen Roskilde sind Archäologen den vergessenen Künsten ihrer Vorfahren auf der Spur .
