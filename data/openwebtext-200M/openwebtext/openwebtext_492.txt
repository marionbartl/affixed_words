In order to fight its ongoing battle against Microsoft and Google on the whole issue of “ collaboration , ” Cisco today added yet another weapon to its arsenal .
The San Jose , Calif . - based company said it ’s buying PostPath , which will allow it to add email and calendaring features to its WebEx collaboration software , for a whopping $ 215 million .
The acquisition should n’t come as a surprise : John Chambers , CEO of Cisco Systems , recently said : “ We believe we are entering the next phase of the Internet as growth and productivity will center on collaboration enabled by networked Web 2.0 technologies . ”
PostPath , a relatively unknown start - up based in Mountain View , Calif. , makes a Linux - based e-mail system that includes an independent AJAX Web client and works well on mobile clients .
OK , it ’s nothing more than a Linux replacement for Microsoft Exchange , sort of like Zimbra , which got acquired by Yahoo last year for $ 350 million .
It came out in stealth in 2006 and has operated under the radar for a long time .
It recently announced that it worked with Apple ’s iPhone .
It is not clear who funded the company or for how much .
The board members include representatives of Worldview Technology Partners , Matrix Partners and JAFCO Ventures .
Despite this acquisition , in addition to $ 3.4 billion purchase of WebEx , Cisco is primarily a hardware company that makes a living selling switches and routers .
Nevertheless the company has the sales force and the channels to dent Microsoft ’s domination .
Oh , this battle is more fun to watch than anything else out there .
Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty and his wife , Mary , appear with Republican presidential candidate John McCain in St. Paul on July 10 .
" I had 10 or 15 people on my team : two - thirds lawyers , a couple accountants , a couple regular people .
We looked at taxes and financial statements , political positions and , the most distasteful part , personal behavior . "
— Washington lawyer Lanny Davis , who vetted people for President Clinton Enlarge By Alex Brandon , AP Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama shakes hands with Sen. Evan Bayh , D - Ind. , in Portage , Ind. , on Wednesday .
WASHINGTON  Indiana Sen .
Evan Bayh , who campaigned last week with Barack Obama as news stories weighed his vice presidential prospects , is a blank slate to most Americans .
So is Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty , who deflected questions about running with John McCain during a recent appearance at the National Press Club .
At the same time , teams of lawyers , accountants and other campaign aides are learning a lot about them .
Known to the campaigns as " vetters , " they are combing through the tax returns , campaign - finance reports , financial disclosure statements and other personal information of potential VP picks .
They are sworn to secrecy as they search for a hidden time bomb that could derail a presidential campaign .
One goal : Determine " how the crazy , cynical left or right of the ( political ) spectrum is going to misuse the information , " said Washington lawyer Lanny Davis , who vetted Cabinet candidates , including Janet Reno , who became President Bill Clinton 's attorney general .
" I had 10 or 15 people on my team : two thirds lawyers , a couple accountants , a couple regular people , " Davis said .
" We looked at taxes and financial statements , political positions and , the most distasteful part , personal behavior . "
Former Iowa governor Tom Vilsack , who was vetted by Democratic nominee John Kerry 's campaign in 2004 , said he was asked for " every piece of paper I could put my hands on , " from his state Senate voting records to the budgets he had submitted as a city mayor .
The vetters also wanted local newspaper columns written by his wife , as well as their health records and tax returns .
" We turned over 30 banker boxes full of material to a law firm in D.C. , " he said , before sitting down for a seven - hour interview with vetters and then a two - hour dinner with Kerry , who ultimately selected North Carolina 's John Edwards .
The Obama and McCain campaigns wo n't discuss the process or even confirm who is being examined .
McCain's VP search is being run by Washington lawyer A.B. Culvahouse , while Obama 's is supervised by Caroline Kennedy and Eric Holder , a former senior Justice Department official .
Issues of ethics and campaign finance are likely to receive particular scrutiny because Obama and McCain are self - described reformers who set unusually strict ethical standards for their campaigns .
McCain prohibits lobbyists from working as paid campaign staffers , while Obama refuses campaign contributions from political action committees and federal lobbyists .
Some issues involving potential running mates that the vetters may be mulling : • Bayh 's wife , attorney Susan Bayh , has earned $ 1 million a year in recent years , and nearly $ 2 million in stock options , through her service on 10 corporate boards , according to TheJournal - Gazette of Fort Wayne , Ind. , including drug and insurance companies that have been denounced by Obama as overly powerful special interests .
Bayh spokesman Eric Kleiman said Susan Bayh has a right to her own career , and that Bayh and his aides do not allow themselves to be lobbied by representatives of the companies on whose boards his wife serves .
• Pawlenty amended his financial disclosure forms in 2003 after revealing that a businessman had paid him $ 4,500 per month — a total of $ 60,000 — for legal consulting while he was campaigning for governor in 2002 .
He had listed his consulting business , BAMCO and Associates , as an investment on the state form designed to disclose his income .
State campaign officials and local prosecutors quickly absolved him of any wrongdoing after Democrats charged the payments amounted to illegal campaign contributions .
The allegations " were deemed to be without merit , " Pawlenty spokesman Bob Schroeder said .
• Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine accepted a $ 12,000 trip to a Democratic governors meeting in Aspen , Colo. , in 2006 from Barr Labs , a drug company with a large presence in his state , according to his financial disclosure statements .
He also let Dominion , a Richmond - based energy company , spend $ 1,356 to pay his way to the NCAA basketball tournament in Indianapolis and conferences in West Virginia and New Orleans , the records show .
In a state with no limits on campaign giving , he has accepted $ 660,000 in three years from a single donor , billionaire venture capitalist Randal Kirk , records show .
Kirk , who was given the state 's Outstanding Industrialist Award in April by Kaine and the Science Museum of Virginia , told USA TODAY he does no business with the state .
A Kaine spokeswoman , Delacey Skinner , said Kaine is not influenced by political contributions .
The trips were within the rules , she said .
• Rep. Eric Cantor , R - Va. , has been a prolific fundraiser from the lobbyists and interest groups that McCain says hold too much sway in Washington .
In 2006 , he donated to charity $ 10,000 he had received from disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff , who had named a sandwich after Cantor at a deli he owned , according to the Jewish newspaper The Forward .
McCain helped expose the Abramoff scandal .
Rob Collins , Cantor 's chief of staff , pointed out in an e-mail that Abramoff funded a group that attacked Cantor during the 2000 primary .
" Cantor or his staff never met officially with or did any actions for Jack Abramoff , " he said .

Cette décision avait été prise suite à une enquête demandée par plusieurs députés .
Celle - ci avait révélé que les besoins des députés pouvaient être couverts par le libre et que cette migration amènerait à desnon négligeables , malgré le coût prévu de la mise en place de ces ordinateurs et systèmes .
Après un appel d'offre lancé fin 2006 , Linagora et Unilog avaient remporté le marché .
Le système installé allait être une distributionavec les logiciels suivants : le navigateur2 , le client de messagerieet son extension d'agenda , et enfin2.0 .
Le marché comprenait l'installation , le support technique , la maintenance et la formation .
La mise en place a été effectuée en juillet dernier , il y a maintenant quasiment un an .
En dehors de l'économie de quelque , les députés interrogés par CIO Online semblent s'êtreà leur nouvel environnement .

Le bilan n'est cependant pas entièrement positif puisque certains députés reconnaissent avoir eu des , notamment de synchronisation entre leurset les postes de l'Assemblée .
Ceux - ci ont été depuis résolus mais certains ont dû investir dans l'achat d'un PDA compatible .
Rappelons que cette migration a été avant toutpuisque ne concernant que quelque centaines de postes .
Cependant , l'APRIL , association pour la promotion et la recherche en informatique libre , se réjouit de ce premier bilan et commente : " Ils [ les députés ] encouragent les acteurs français d'un secteur économique prometteur , promeuvent l'interopérabilité et ouvrent la voie à d'autres migrations " .
Selon l'association , " malgré des délais très courts et un rythme de travail soutenu , les députés et leurs assistants se sont aisément adaptés à leur nouvel environnement .
Cela montre que les logiciels libres sont indubitablementpour le poste de travail , tant en entreprise que pour le grand public " .

If you needed any additional evidence that music licensing remains 1 ) byzantine and 2 ) frustrating , even to the players most involved with it , consider what happened last week to eMusic after it posted early work from the Rolling Stones .
e Music , the number two download service with more than 400,000 paying subscribers , scored a major coup last month by acquiring the Rolling Stones ' complete catalog of music from 1964 through 1970 .
That early , fertile period included albums like Beggar 's Banquet and Let It Bleed and hits like " ( I Can't Get No ) Satisfaction , " " Sympathy for the Devil , " and " Gimme Shelter . "
The material was licensed through label ABKCO and distributed through Universal Music Group Distribution .
As befits such an important " get " for the site , the eMusic folks " pursued every level of due diligence possible " before posting the music , trying to make 100 percent sure that all the rights were in place .
After staff " triple - and quadruple - checked " the clearances , eMusic posted the albums along with commentary from its in - house music writers .
Not surprisingly , the material soared to the top of the download charts , and fans were thrilled to have an indie- oriented site like eMusic offering the Stones .
Paint It , Black
Within weeks after it went up , the catalog was back down .
A Hypebot reader noticed the news , which appeared as an eMusic forum post .
" Due to events outside of our control , we are being forced to remove the entire ABKCO catalogue from eMusic , " said the note , which went on to rail against the industry 's " arcane details " and the " maddening situation " surrounding the rights .
Looking for more clarity , I checked into the situation .
All ABKCO would say is that eMusic " executed an excellent promotional campaign " but that the label " has decided that at this point in time we wish to further evaluate this area of the digital marketplace . "
e Music , for its part , expressed frustration .
" Unfortunately , during this time of transition in the music industry , customers are often caught in the middle as traditional music companies determine how to adjust to new opportunities in the marketplace , " it said in a statement .
The odd part is that ABKCO had apparently adjusted to those realities already by offering its albums on eMusic for around 25 ¢ a track .
While this price is great for consumers , it 's not always so great for labels and established artists used to commanding much higher premiums .
If money ( and concerns about creating new consumer expectations surrounding cheap music by big - name bands ) is n't at the root of the current flap , then call me a brown - sugar loving street fighting man married to a parachute woman who sings the stray cat blues .
Editor ’s note : OK , we ’re usually not so potty - mouthed , but , as you ’ll see , it ’s perfectly ( and literally ) appropriate this time around .

Here ’s a sneak peek at bathroom fun .
What you may not realize , cherie , is that whatever you flush down comes back around .
Our waste fertilizes our fields and is pumped back into the waterways that are our major sources of drinking water .
Let ’s take the journey from toilet to tap , shall we ?
Oui oui .
( We ’re affecting French here for a touch of sophistication in a post centering on fecal matter . )
Americans use about 70 gallons of water indoors , every day .
About three - quarters of that is used in the toilette — shower , bath , sink , crapper — and over one - quarter is used whisking away our waste .
You can cut this water usage by making sure your toilet is n’t leaking , using a composting or low - flow toilet or even displacing the water in the tank with a brick or container filled with sand .
Your toilet is not a trashcan , so save cigarette butts , tissues and used condoms for the basket , not the bowl .
We do n’t want to bum you out , but cutting water usage means a lot in an era when more than a billion people lack access to safe drinking water .
According to Claudia McMurray , U.S. Assistant Secretary for Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs , “ On any given day , approximately 50 % of the world ’s hospital beds are filled with patients suffering from water and sanitation related diseases .
Each year 1.8 million children in developing countries die from diarrheal disease – the second leading cause of death after pneumonia . ”
When aiming for more equitable water usage , hippie wisdom comes in handy :
If it ’s brown flush it down ; if it ’s yellow , let it mellow .
S’il vous plait .
( Our hippie is French . )

Police have returned 39 teenagers and children who were attending a camp run by a neo -Nazi youth organization to their homes .
The group that ran the camp , the Heimattreuer Deutsche Jugend ( HDJ ) had described it as a youth adventure holiday .
The police raid uncovered racist propaganda and Nazi material , including tea towels with swastikas on them and maps showing Europe and Germany with pre-1918 borders .
The camp was in an isolated spot in the German state of Mecklenburg - Western Pommerania , down a concrete road , surrounded by forest .
From the outside it looked just like any other summer camp .
Authorities there were tipped off to the camps true intentions by some locals , said Volker Werner , spokesman for the Rostock police , who took charge of the investigation .
After receiving a search warrant , police and youth authorities entered the camp .
In addition to the 39 campers , there were also a dozen adults .
The camp 's alleged leader was a 24 - year - old from the town of Rottenberg in the southern state of Baden - Wuerttemberg .
The organization Network Against Nazis believes that camp was designed to bring whole families over to the right wing movement .
The children , who came from all over Germany , said they had permission from their parents to take part in the camp .
Neo -Nazis turning increasingly violent
The German Federal Crime Office has said that neo -Nazis are adopting more violent tactics
The head of Germany 's Federal Criminal Police Office ( BKA ) , Joerg Ziercke , told the German daily Tagesspiegel neo-Nazis were adopting increasingly violent tactics .
Ziercke said neo -Nazis were attacking left - wingers and police officers with an aggression that can be seen as a change in strategy .
" Before , neo - Nazis largely avoided violence for tactical reasons , but this no longer appears to be the case , " he added .
Ziercke said the riots on May 1 in Hamburg were an example of the new strategy .
Clashes erupted in Hamburg when 6,000 people took to the streets to protest against a march involving some 1,500 supporters of the far - right NPD party .
Twenty police officers were hurt and some 60 people were arrested .
Arson attacks by right - wing groups were also on the rise , according to Ziercke .
There were some 15 incidents reported in the first five months of 2008 - five times as many as in the same period last year .
There has been increasing news coverage of alternative energy , most notably due to the explosion in energy prices over the last couple years .
I saw two interesting articles over the last day , one from the conservative editorial pages of The Wall Street Journal , and the other from The New York Times .
Please note – photo courtesy of The New York Times ( photographer : Christinne Muschi ) .
The WSJ opinion piece points out that one of the key barriers to growth in alternative energy is infrastructure , most notably transmission lines connecting the sources of energy ( wind and solar fields in rural and desert locations in the plains and Southwest ) and the cities in which most people live .
The WSJ , in it ’s characteristic fashion , blames this challenge on liberals , who they claim support alternative energy but oppose the construction of transmission lines , as they often have to go through protected lands .
Here ’s a link to the piece .
The Times describes challenges and conflicts of interest that have arisen in upstate New York , where wind revenue has become critical for family farmers .
The article highlights instances when local town boards have voted on wind leases for firms when several of the individual members already had contracts in place for their own farms .
A key issue , the article goes on to discuss , is that there is no statewide ( New York ) law on wind power , so it is up to the individual towns to decide .
Here ’s a link to the article .
If alternative energy is to become more widespread ( according to the WSJ , wind only provides two - thirds of 1 % of electricity generated in the U.S. , and solar one - tenth of 1 % ) , there will have to be better statewide and national legislation that fast tracks the development of wind farms , solar fields , and other energy sources .
At the same time , a balance has to be struck between speed and careful examination of the intricacies of development ( impact on local environments , costs , etc ) .
Nevertheless , it is no longer debatable that these technologies are needed .
In fact , weaning our country off of foreign oil and developing better domestic , renewable ( and clean ) energy resources are key elements and ingredients to the future success of our country .
My sincere hope is that the right balance can happen in order to unlock this power and bring jobs to local markets with it .

Number of War Child projects in 2019 : One
Total number of participants : 2,667
National Situation
Sudan has been the scene of prolonged armed conflicts - both internal and external - since 1950 .
Political and border disputes have fuelled tensions inside the country .
Violent clashes for control of natural resources - from grazing rights to oil - contribute to the atmosphere of violence .
A ceasefire - and with it the end of Africa ’s longest civil war - came to Sudan in 2005 with the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement ( CPA ) .
The agreement between northern and southern factions included the referendum which led to the secession of South Sudan in 2011 .
Yet armed conflict between Sudan and South Sudan continues along the border to this day .
Sudan remains in the grip of continued instability .
Widespread demonstrations against the 30 - year rule of President Omar al - Bashir triggered a military coup in April 2019 .
The ensuing power vacuum has seen continued public protests met with violent force - including the killing of four high school students during a protest in El - Obeid .
Situation of Children
Children have suffered markedly as a result of the decades of conflict in Sudan .
Young people across the country - particularly those living along the country ’s border - face displacement , separation from their families and the threat of violence .
An estimated three million children are currently out of school - around one third of the school age population .
Children and youth living in refugee and IDP settlements go without many basic services and are at risk of disease and malnourishment .
They are also regularly exposed to the threat of violence .

WAYNE , W.Va . 
The location of Democrat Barack Obama 's just - opened headquarters here says a lot about the challenges facing him and this community as voters prepare to go to the polls in Tuesday 's primary .
His office is across from the courthouse and next to a thrift shop .
The torn awning over its door indicates the storefront used to be a restaurant .
Though the bell tower atop the courthouse gleams with a fresh coat of paint — the state colors of blue and gold — the rest of the town has the faded look of a community that has seen better days .
Many
Wayne residents used to make good money in nearby Huntington , about 20 miles north .
But the factories making glass and auto parts and the chemical supply plants where people used to work " have gone on the skids in recent years , " says Wayne County Clerk Bob Pasley .
In West Virginia , Gov. Joe Manchin says " you drive to survive " and the gas price spike has hit particularly hard .
" It 's hard to drive from here to Huntington when gas is $ 4 a gallon and you 're getting paid minimum wage , " says Wayne Mayor Junior Ramey .
This state of small towns is home to the gun-owning , church - going , financially struggling voters whom Hillary Rodham Clinton is targeting Tuesday .
She says Obama alienated them with his remark before the Pennsylvania primary last month about " bitter " dislocated workers in small towns " clinging " to guns and religion .
Democrats outnumber Republicans nearly 2 to 1 , but President Bush won here in 2000 and 2004 .
" It was because of three things : guns , God and abortion , " says Danny Jones , the Republican mayor of Charleston , the state capital .
" The people in the last election were persuaded by the gun issue , " said Robert Dennie , a retired Union Carbide employee , a Democrat who cast an early vote Tuesday for Clinton in Charleston .
" Everybody has wised up . "
Though Obama is ahead nationally in delegates and the popular vote , Clinton has a huge lead in statewide polls here .
Local politicians say it will take more than a well - decorated storefront for Obama , the Illinois senator , to make headway .
" He 's going to have to visit , " says Bob Pasley , who adds that Obama should come prepared to answer " tough questions , " including some about his religion .
" Is he Islamic or is he not ? "
Pasley says of Obama , who is Christian .
" I know he 's tried to talk about it but he has n't looked anybody in Wayne in the eye and told them . "
Demanding that a presidential entourage make it up the tricky switchback roads that lead to this town of 1,144 is n't as farfetched as it seems .
No Democrat has won the White House without winning West Virginia since 1916 , and at least one made it to Wayne .
" Jack Kennedy was a Catholic , and there were skeptics about that , " says Pasley , who was 7 years old when the future president showed up to campaign in 1960 .
" It was the biggest thing that happened in Wayne in a long , long time , " Pasley recalled .
Kennedy 's trip made an impression elsewhere in the state .
At Jim's Steak and Spaghetti House in Huntington , a brass plaque stating " President Kennedy sat here " marks a booth that , according to owner Jimmie Carder , some customers will wait 45 minutes to get .
Most Democrats who succeed here politically here are conservative .
State Auditor Glen Gainer , one of Obama 's leading backers in the state , keeps a framed copy of his endorsement from abortion opponents West Virginians for Life on his wall and an autographed copy of the late minister Jerry Falwell 's biography on his coffee table .
Manchin complains the state 's most important economic resource — coal — does n't get enough attention from the party because environmentalists consider the industry as too polluting .
Ethanol , the corn - based gasoline additive that gets presidential candidates ' praise in Iowa , has gotten a disproportionate share of federal subsidies while research on technology to make coal burn more cleanly is chronically underfunded , Manchin says .
At the moment , West Virginia appears to be Clinton country , especially the southern half of the state .
" She 'll win our county with 75 % or 80 % , " says Ramey , a Clinton backer .
" Maybe more . "
Even Obama 's supporters in the state acknowledge that West Virginia could prove to be a speed bump for their surging candidate .
" It is an uphill struggle for Sen. Obama , that 's for sure , " says local congressman Nick Rahall , who was booed at a Wayne Democratic pig roast after he endorsed Obama .
" It was unreal , " says Ramey , who was there .
" There have been respectful disagreements , " says Rahall .
Politicians on both sides of the presidential primary fight say Clinton 's healthy double - digit lead is due in part to the overt appeal she 's making to blue - collar voters and in part to nostalgia for her husband 's administration .
" How can you not like Bill Clinton ?
He 's a good old boy , " says Obama backer Gainer .
Hillary Clinton held rallies in Shepherdstown and Charleston this week .
Her husband has his own busy campaign schedule , including a stop at Wayne High School today .
Obama 's schedule is less certain .
Gainer says Obama needs to campaign here even if he wo n't win Tuesday .
" He needs to invest for the fall , " he said .
For all of Clinton 's advantages , however , she 's picked up only a few major endorsements here .
Manchin and Sen. Robert Byrd , both superdelegates , are remaining neutral .
Obama is also backed by Sen. Jay Rockefeller and Beckley Mayor Emmett Pugh .
Another factor could help Obama :
For the first time Democrats are allowing the state 's estimated 156,000 registered independents to vote in their primary .
Mark McMillian , a Charleston attorney who is a registered independent , voted early for Obama on Tuesday .
He said it was " a hard decision " between the two Democrats , but added that he believes either can win West Virginia in the fall .
" I just think people are at the breaking point , " he said .

A 72 - year - old Buena Park woman became the first person in California to die from the West Nile virus infection this year , the Orange County Health Care Agency reported Monday .
Testing confirmed that the woman died from complications from West Nile neuroinvasive disease , the more serious neurological form of the disease , said Howard Sutter , spokesman for the Orange County Health Care Agency .
She died this month , but healthcare officials would not provide a specific date or say where she had been hospitalized .
This is the first West Nile - related fatality in Orange County since 2004 .
There have been 30 cases of West Nile reported in 2008 in the county , a higher number than usual for this time of year , Sutter said .
Four of the Orange County residents did not exhibit symptoms of the disease even though tests showed they had been infected .

The woman was probably infected by a mosquito , Sutter said .
Humans and animals contract the West Nile virus from the bites of infected mosquitoes , which contract it by feeding on birds that have the virus in their blood .
Health officials say the risk of human infection in Southern California is the highest it has been since 2004 , when 710 people became infected with the virus and 21 died .
“ We think it is very important that people take the precautions they can take to protect themselves against mosquito bites , ” Sutter said .
“ This is an important reminder that this can be a serious illness .
It is a very unpredictable virus . ”
As of Monday , 112 cases of human West Nile virus have been confirmed in the state , with 97 of the infected people showing symptoms .
The peak season for infections is between August and October , and the Southern California region has seen an increased number of dead birds and mosquitoes this year , officials said .

Officials have blamed much of the increase in the virus on the thousands of abandoned swimming pools in foreclosed homes throughout Southern California , which provide a breeding ground for mosquitoes .
The neurological form of the virus , which the Buena Park woman died from , is on the rise this year , Sutter said .
Though it usually affects people older than 50 , it has infected 21 of the 30 Orange County individuals infected with West Nile this year , said Deanne Thompson , a health agency spokeswoman .
Scientists and healthcare officials do not know why there have been more cases of the neurological form this year , she said .
Most people who are infected by the virus do not become ill , but about 20 % develop flu - like symptoms .
In its most severe form , West Nile can cause encephalitis , meningitis and death .
Officials recommend that people use insect repellent , put screens on their windows , get rid of standing water and wear long pants and long - sleeved shirts at dawn and dusk , when mosquitoes are most active .

Woman falls from consulate in Olympics protest SAN FRANCISCO Free Tibet group claims her ropes had been severed
A rappelling protester fell two stories from the roof of the Chinese Consulate in San Francisco Wednesday , two days before the Olympic Games begin in Beijing and amid worldwide protest against China 's human rights record in Tibet .
San Francisco police and the State Department are conducting a joint investigation into the incident , including claims that the protester 's ropes may have been intentionally cut .
The protester was identified as Nyendak Wangden , 22 , of Suisun City and a member of Students for a Free Tibet .
She was taken via ambulance to San Francisco General Hospital where she was in stable condition .
Students for a Free Tibet released a statement Wednesday afternoon saying Wangden had fractured a wrist and a bone in her forearm .
Defa Tong , a spokesman for the Chinese Consulate , said questions about whether the ropes were cut should be directed to police .
He said media attention should be focused instead at the unlawful action of the two protesters invading Chinese territory .
" Their action is really a violation and an infringement of Chinese sovereignty , " he said .
" This is unbearable to any country , to any people . "
The incident began shortly after 8 a.m. , when about two dozen protesters converged on the consulate building at Geary Boulevard and Laguna Street .
Most of them stood across the street while three women chained themselves to two ornamental lions on either side of the wooden front door and carried a sign reading , " Tibetans are dying for freedom ! "
Above them , Wangden rappelled a few feet down from the rooftop wearing a harness , wrapped herself in a black cape and hood and was suspended on ropes in a hangman - like position .
Onlookers then heard a shriek and a thud , and Wangden was lying on a balcony two stories below .
Another protester , Brihannala Morgan , 26 , of Oakland , was on the rooftop assisting Wangden .
She was later arrested and shouted " They cut the ropes ! " before being driven away in a police car .
Wangden was also arrested , while the three women in chains cut themselves free and were not detained , police said .
After the fall , part of a blue rope hung over the rooftop .
Yellow police tape was strung around the scene and several police officers were on hand .
Police Sgt. Wilfred Williams said investigators have not determined whether Wangden 's rope was cut .
" I can't say that is accurate , " he said .
" That 's why we 're conducting an investigation - to see what happened . "
The protest was part of the Global Day of Action around the world to protest China 's treatment of Tibet , which the Chinese government claimed sovereignty over in 1950 .
" We 're trying to shine a light on that , " said Tenzin Seldon , 19 , one of the protesters .
More events are scheduled in the Bay Area in coming days , including a march today that is scheduled to proceed from the Civic Center to the consulate .
Tong condemned local police for not doing more to protect the building .
He said the consulate has asked for security repeatedly .
" We believe the American side should hold responsibility for this incident , " he said .
" We 've expressed our strong dissatisfaction ( with the police ) . "
Vinyl shower curtains sold at major retailers across the country emit toxic chemicals that have been linked to serious health problems , according to a report released Thursday by a national environmental organization .
The curtains contained high concentrations of chemicals that are linked to liver damage as well as damage to the central nervous , respiratory and reproductive systems , said researchers for the Virginia - based Center for Health , Environment & Justice .
The organization commissioned the study about two years ago to determine what caused that “ new shower curtain smell ” familiar to many consumers .
“ This smell can make you feel sick , give you a headache , make you feel nauseous or [ cause ] other health effects , ” said Michael Schade , a coauthor of the report .

Researchers tested the chemical composition of five unopened polyvinyl chloride , or PVC , plastic shower curtains bought from Bed Bath & Beyond , Kmart , Sears , Target and Wal - Mart .
One of the curtains was then tested to determine the chemicals it released into the air .
The study found that PVC shower curtains contained high concentrations of phthalates , which have been linked to reproductive effects , and varying concentrations of organotins , which are compounds based on tin and hydrocarbons .
One of the curtains tested released measurable quantities of as many as 108 volatile organic compounds into the air , some of which persisted for nearly a month .
Seven of these chemicals -- toluene , ethylbenzene , phenol , methyl isobutyl ketone , xylene , acetophenone and cumene -- have been identified by the Environmental Protection Agency as hazardous air pollutants , said Stephen Lester , the center ’s science director and a coauthor of the report .
Potential health effects include developmental damage and harm to the liver and the central nervous , respiratory and reproductive systems , according to the report .

Phthalates and organotins , which are not chemically bonded to the shower curtain , are often added to soften or otherwise enhance the curtain .
These additives evaporate or cling to household dust more easily than the chemicals in the curtains themselves , Lester said .
Volatile organic compounds also evaporate more easily than the less harmful chemicals , he said .
Vinyl chloride , which is a major building block of PVC , is a known human carcinogen that causes liver cancer , Lester said .
“ PVC is just bad from cradle to cradle , ” said Martha Dina Arguello , executive director of the Los Angeles chapter of Physicians for Social Responsibility .
“ It ’s a mess when you create , it ’s a mess when you get rid of it , and it ’s off - gassing when you ’re using it . ”
Representatives of Target and Sears Holding Co. , the parent company of Kmart , said their companies were phasing out curtains that contain PVC .
Target said about 90 % of the store ’s “ owned brand ” shower curtains offered this spring were made of materials other than PVC .
Officials from the other companies were not immediately available for comment Thursday .

The report said that Bed Bath & Beyond had increased the number of PVC - free shower curtains it offered by selling those made of ethylene vinyl acetate and fabrics , but that Wal - Mart did not respond to the organization ’s faxes or letters requesting the retailer ’s PVC policy .
The American Chemistry Council issued a statement Thursday saying there was “ no reliable evidence ” that phthalates were harmful or linked to serious health problems , or that they were tied to the new shower curtain smell .
Arguello said studies were still being done on the effects of phthalates and other chemicals on people .
Little information on toxicity is available for 86 of the 108 chemicals detected in the curtains , Lester said .

The EPA has tested vinyl shower curtains and in 2002 said it had found that many of the same chemicals listed in the center ’s report .
Lester said the test drew attention to the lack of government regulations or health - based guidelines governing indoor air pollutants .
“ The EPA does not regulate indoor air , period , ” said Barbara Spark , the indoor air program coordinator for the EPA ’s Pacific Southwest region .
“ We have not been given that authority by the Congress . ”
The Center for Health , Environment & Justice sent a letter to 19 major retailers Thursday informing them of the new report and encouraging them to stop selling PVC products .

“ Most companies are n’t aware of some of the risks these products entail , ” Lester said .
“ Once they ’re informed of this , they ’re in many cases ready to make changes and purchase alternative products . ”

Two excerpts from Alan Greenspan ’s book , The Age of Turbulence , provide a succinct expression of how political systems generate the bulk of social disorder and human suffering .
While I have not read his book , these two passages go to the essence of the destructive nature of the political mindset : ( 1 ) " there can be little doubt that global warming is real and manmade ; " and , ( 2 ) " [ s] ometimes the duty of political leadership is to convince constituencies that they are just plain wrong . "
Regarding his first proposition , Greenspan may or may not be correct in his conclusion that global warming is manmade .
It is not my purpose , here , to confront him on this issue , or to suggest that any who believe in the human origins of global warming represent a destructive threat to mankind .
My criticism , rather , is found in the words " there can be little doubt . "
Contrary to the articles of faith that unite members of the high church of Global - Warmingism , there is a great deal of doubt — particularly within the scientific community — as to whether global warming has its origins in human activity .
There are thousands of respected scientists who say either that there is insufficient evidence to support this charge , or that global warming is , in fact , traceable to non-human causes .
Whatever the outcome of any extended inquiry into this question , it is clear that practitioners of the political manipulation of humanity are eager to intervene in the lives of others often on the basis of the skimpiest of evidence , and always without an awareness of the interconnected nature of events and other influences that make the prediction of outcomes impossible .
The study of the field known as " chaos " is bringing to our attention a truth that will likely prove fatal to the mindset that sustains vertically - structured social systems — particularly the state — namely , that complex systems are subject to too many variables and other intervening factors to allow for predictable outcomes .
This is what makes weather prediction unreliable for more than a few days .
The failure to understand the uncertainties inherent in all complex systems is what allowed Rudy Giuliani to make a fool of himself in responding to Ron Paul ’s explanations of " blowback " ( or , the " unintended consequences " of human action ) .
In boldly declaring that he had never heard of such a theory , Giuliani admitted to his lack of awareness of this fatal flaw in all political systems .
Alan Greenspan appears to be equally ignorant of the limitations complexity imposes upon those who presume to direct it .
There is probably no realm of human behavior that is more subject to variation and inconstancy than the economic activity through which billions of people spontaneously interact with one another in unpredictable ways .
No one who understands the dynamics of both the marketplace and chaotic systems , would have the hubris to think that he or she could manage economic life toward any generally accepted ends .
The study of chaos informs us of the impossibility of marshaling and measuring all of the factors that play upon events in our lives .
When we act without complete knowledge — as it is our fate to do — there will always be some error in our calculations that will continue to influence future events .
If , for example , the residents of other countries resent the impact that American foreign policies have had on their lives , the United States ’ continued pursuit of such policies may cause these objections to be iterated back into the set of facts to which future policies will be offered .
As American policies continue to disregard such resentment — as , for example , when Madeleine Albright contemptuously declared that the deaths of 500,000 Iraqi children was a " price " she was willing to pay for Clinton - era boycotts — the reiteration of such factors may escalate into the turbulence of so - called " terrorist " attacks whose causation continues to befuddle the likes of Rudy Giuliani .
The same analysis holds true for Alan Greenspan ’s causal contributions to the economic turbulence in which the American economy now finds itself .
Had he been informed of the unpredictable nature of complexity , his intelligence might have suggested to him that a Federal Reserve Board presuming to " run " an economy was about as absurd as turning over to NASA the task of running the solar system !
Whether Greenspan suffered only from a lack of depth understanding of complex systems — such as an economy — or whether the lure of political power was too much for him to resist , is a question only he can answer .
Whatever that answer might be , it is the combination of this lack of understanding of the uncertainties of complex systems combined with the second of the above - quoted portions of his book , that make his behavior destructive to the interests of the rest of us .
In regarding it as a " duty of political leadership " to convince others of their " plain wrong " thinking , Greenspan gets to the essence of every political system .
Political leadership is inseparable from the exercise of state coercion , and while many speak of the " arrogance of power , " every exercise of power by which some coerce others is the essence of arrogance !
The title of his book is a giveaway to what his political career has been about .
In presuming to prescribe and direct the complexities and uncertainties of a system that is beyond anyone ’s power to control , Greenspan ’s policies have been a major contributor to the " turbulence " of which he writes .
But by insisting upon the exercise of such power as a " duty of political leadership , " the man inadvertently confesses to an arrogance that defines such " leadership . "
In this era of totalitarian empire - building , his book ought to have been titled The Age of Arrogance .
But what else could we have expected from this man ?
A long - time friend and devotee of Ayn Rand , he doubtless remains convinced that both the physical and moral dimensions of existence can be known " objectively . "
To paraphrase H.L. Mencken , my last act upon the gallows will be to insist upon the subjective nature of all human understanding .
I believe that our knowledge of the world is built entirely from our own experiences — our language , religious and philosophic views , formal and informal learning , the customs and mores of the community in which we live , etc .
Prior experiences provide a frame - of - reference with which we interpret new ones .
We formulate a world - view that is as internally consistent as we can make it , and tend to reject anything that fails to conform with this picture .
This is not to suggest that our subjective opinions are in error , or the " relativistic " view that one person ’s opinions are as good as another .
To the degree your opinions differ from mine , I regard yours as wrong , but I will acknowledge the subjective nature of my preferences .
I believe that our prospects for living in free , peaceful , and civilized relationships with others , depends upon a conscious awareness of the limited and subjective nature of our opinions .
In the humility that arises from knowing that our understanding of the world derives from the limited nature of our experiences , we may find the basis for a tolerance of others that dissuades us from using force ( i.e. , Greenspan ’s " political leadership " ) to compel their obedience to our subjective views .
It is an insistence upon epistemological certainty — wrapped in the arrogance of self - righteousness — that makes people - pushers of all persuasions an annoying and dangerous crowd .
From evangelicals to secular religionists such as environmentalists , global - warmingists , drug - warriors , dietary dictators , egalitarians , and the censors who come at us from different directions with their politically - correct speech codes , we find ourselves beset by those trying to overcome their internal insecurities by insisting that their sordid opinions constitute " objective " truth .
And why should we expect otherwise ?
If I believe that my thinking conforms to an objective reality with the same certainty found in the multiplication tables , why would I not try to alter the opinions and behavior of others to enhance the quality of their lives ?
But , lacking the omniscience for generating predictable outcomes , what are the likely consequences of such actions ?
The question that continues to intrigue me , however , is why the rest of us are willing to accept such people as authorities over us ?
There was something pathetic in watching millions of otherwise intelligent men and women awaiting the pronouncements of Alan Greenspan as to whether they will enjoy a bright or dreary future .
Greenspan ’s role has been taken over by Mr. Bernanke , with ordinary people and politicians now hanging on every nuance of his words ; or looking for facial expressions , that might carry some hidden meaning as he , too , attempts to inject certainty into an uncertain world .
Society has been rendered turbulent by centuries of the Platonic belief that philosopher - kings could render the world a better place .
It is time for us to give up our belief in such Olympian - wizardry , and get back to the task of cleaning up our respective corners of the turbulence in which our innocence has left us .
The Best of Butler Shaffer
WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
As a trusted adviser to a member of the ruling family of the United Arab Emirates , Texas businessman Bassam Nabulsi says he safeguarded the sheik 's most important documents : financial records , investment documents , and videotapes showing the sheik torturing people with a cattle prod and a spiked plank .
When the business relationship began to deteriorate , Nabulsi says , he also was imprisoned for months and tortured by jailers trying to get the tapes back .
Now , the tapes could become evidence in a federal lawsuit against Sheik Issa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan , a son of the late UAE president and brother of Abu Dhabi 's crown prince .
By custom , a member of the Al Nahyan royal family serves as president of the UAE .
The lawsuit and the tapes could prove embarrassing to the UAE , a U.S. ally that promotes itself as a pro-Western nation catering to business travelers and tourists .
The tapes have not been made public but The Associated Press viewed 11 still frames from one of the videos .
They showed a man who appeared to be Sheik Issa beating another man with lumber , firing an automatic weapon into the sand around him and forcing an apparent cattle prod into his anus .
The victim also appeared to have been partly run over by a SUV and had salt poured on his wounds .
Lawyers said the video also showed the victim 's genitals being lit on fire .
They said the abuse began because the sheik felt he had been overcharged in a grain deal .
" Ultimately this video , or certainly large portions of it , will be played in court , " said Anthony G. Buzbee , who represents Nabulsi in his lawsuit .
The UAE Embassy in Washington released a brief statement Monday , saying it was aware of the lawsuit but that , since the government itself was not being sued , it would not comment on the accusations .
Nabulsi is suing for millions he says he is owed for various business deals .
He also charges Sheik Issa and other members of the royal family with false imprisonment and with torturing him .
Buzbee says he has three other torture videos .
If he prevails , his lawyers said they would try to seize Issa's U.S. assets , which could include portions of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority , which is the largest sovereign wealth fund in the world and has an estimated $ 875 billion in assets .
Last year it invested $ 7.5 billion in Citigroup .
The lawsuit has been languishing in a Houston federal court for nearly two years as attorneys tried to serve Issa and others with court papers .
Efforts to deliver the documents to the royal family through UAE lawyers have failed and a confirmation of mail delivery was returned unsigned , according to court records .
A federal judge gave Nabulsi 's lawyers until the end of the month to try again and , if unsuccessful , explain why the case should not be dismissed .
The lawyers filed an amended lawsuit Monday describing the videos in greater detail .
Nabulsi worked for years making arrangements for Arab investors and dignitaries who traveled to Houston seeking medical care .
According to the lawsuit , Sheik Issa recruited him to work as his personal business manager .
" As the Sheikh 's moods grew darker , he began a habit and custom of torturing his employees and anyone else with whom he disapproved , " the lawsuit claims .
" As his degeneracy increased , Sheikh Issa began to have such torture sessions taped , so he could enjoy viewing them later . "
The torture sessions became a wedge in the business and , when it became clear the relationship were falling apart , Sheik Issa allegedly had Nabulsi arrested on marijuana charges .
He was ultimately acquitted of those charges but the lawsuit says Nabulsi was interrogated about the videotapes while being held for more than three months .
" He was told daily that his wife would be raped , his children would be killed , that he would be killed , " Buzbee said .
His original lawsuit sought more than $ 1 billion but the amended lawsuit filed Monday does not seek a specific amount .

The final vote was a rout : 69 - 28 .
No surprises here .
Just the weight of disappointment .
Late Update : Worth noting that Hillary voted against the bill , while Obama –as we ’ve noted here before — changed positions on telecom immunity and voted for the bill .
The sun shines though the distinctive leaves of a marijuana plant during a drug raid in the remote northern Lebombo mountains in Swaziland , in this May 24 , 2005 file picture .
REUTERS / Mike Hutchings
AMSTERDAM ( Reuters ) - A 73 - year - old Dutch man was astonished to learn from police that the begonias he had lovingly tended on his doorstep concealed a secret marijuana plantation .
“ Police officers suddenly noticed marijuana plants sprouting from his begonias , ” a police spokeswoman in The Hague said on Friday .
The Hague pensioner promised to destroy the marijuana plants , which he believes were planted by local youngsters , while preserving his begonias .
Earlier this month the Dutch government set up a task force to crack down on marijuana cultivation in the country .
Growing marijuana is illegal in the Netherlands , but sales of it and other cannabis - related soft drugs in coffee shops have been tolerated for decades .
How the American “ free press ” toed the government line on Georgia
By Tom Eley
22 August 2008
During the first several days of the war between Georgia and Russia , the US media ’s readers and viewers could find in the nation ’s newspapers and on its airwaves a degree of ambiguity and even rare moments of objectivity .
Though vaguely anti-Russian , a good share of the initial coverage tended not to lay the blame for the war fully at the feet of Moscow and provided some insight into the Georgian military ’s devastation of the South Ossetian capital , Tskhinvali .
Then , between August 11 and 12 , a sharp change occurred in the way the US media presented the war .
The initial response to the war gave way to what can only be described as a tidal wave of anti-Russian propaganda .
Now there was only one side to the story .
What had happened ?
The change in the media line corresponded to a sharpening of the anti-Russian posture of the Bush administration .
For the first few days of the conflict , when no clear line had been laid down by the government , the mainstream media was somewhat at sea .
But once the official line had been clearly established , the corporate - controlled media snapped to attention and marshaled all of its considerable resources to perform its customary service of vetting the “ news ” and manipulating public opinion to suit the aims and requirements of the state .
The media presentation of the Georgia crisis is a textbook example of the way in which the “ free press ” in America functions as little more than a semi-official propaganda agency of the government .
The first response of US media on August the 9 was to shrink before a complex story .
The Wall Street Journal editorial page , a reliable mouthpiece for the most right - wing sections of the political establishment , published an editorial noting that it was “ unclear at this stage which side is more at fault for the current fighting , ” adding “ that the two countries have seemed to want [ war ] for some time . ”
The Chicago Tribune headlined its article on the developments , “ Georgian Conflict Puts US in Middle . ”
The Los Angeles Times ’s lead article was entitled “ US Pushes Truce in Caucasus Fighting , ” and its subtitle noted that the war “ Put Washington in a Tough Spot . ”
The New York Times ’s first article on the war was headlined “ Russia and Georgia Clash Over Separatist Region . ”
The Times also published an article entitled “ Taunting the Bear . ”
It was a lengthy analysis of the interaction of ethnic and regional tensions in relation to Georgia ’s breakaway provinces , Tblisi , and Moscow .
The article was fairly even - handed in its treatment of Russia , although , true to form , the Times elided the provocative role the US has played in the Caucasus with its long - term strategy of encircling Russia and securing US access to Caspian Basin oil via pipelines that bypass Russian territory .
On August 10 , the Times published two further articles that maintained a semblance of balance , bearing the headlines “ In Georgia Clash , a Lesson on US Need for Russia , ” and “ In Georgia and Russia , a Perfect Brew for a Blowup . ”
On the other hand , the Washington Post responded to the war with its own rapid mobilization against Russia .
On August 9 , it produced an editorial entitled “ Stopping Russia , ” pinning the blame on Russia ’s pursuit of “ hegemony in the Caucasus ” ( which , the article left unstated , runs headlong into the US pursuit of worldwide hegemony ) .
Ready from the first for brinksmanship , the Post ominously demanded that the “ United States and its NATO allies impose a price on Russia . ”
In those first few days of confusion , the media happily had two diversions at their disposal .
Even as the situation in Georgia was erupting , the media continued to lavish its attention on the extra-marital affair of former senator John Edwards and the opening days of the Beijing Olympics .
The outbreak of a war that threatened to draw into its wake two powers armed to the teeth with nuclear weapons fell to third place after the private sexual peccadillo of a politician and the hoopla surrounding the Olympics opening ceremonies .
The media ’s initial bewilderment reflected the response of the White House , and , in particular , President Bush , who reacted to word of the fighting with a degree of ambiguity and indecisiveness not typical of a politician who characteristically lets pass no chance to engage in military bluster .
It is inconceivable that Georgia ’s attack on South Ossetia — timed to coincide with the opening of the Olympics — was undertaken without US approval .
Georgia is a vassal state of the US .
Its military is funded , trained and technically supported by the American military .
Mikheil Saakashvili , the Georgian president , maintains close relations with Bush .
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice had been in Tbilisi only a month earlier endorsing Saakashvili ’s application for membership in NATO and his avowed aim of recapturing South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
Nor is it conceivable that the United States was unaware that Russia would be compelled to respond to such a provocation .
Nonetheless , it seems that the swiftness and force of Russia ’s response took the Bush administration aback .
Bush ’s first response on August 8 , through spokeswoman Dana Perino , was to call for “ the territorial integrity ” of Georgia .
But the US president , who was in Beijing attending the Olympics opening ceremonies , also struck a public pose of mediator , calling for restraint on all sides .
“ We urge all parties , Georgians , South Ossetians and Russians , to de-escalate the tension and avoid conflict , ” he declared through his spokeswoman .
At that point , however , it was not yet clear how quickly and decisively the Russian force would rout the much smaller Georgian military .
Rice took a stronger position , calling on Russia “ to respect Georgia ’s territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from Georgian soil ” — in other words , to accede to the Georgian invasion of South Ossetia .
The aspirants for the White House weighed in on August 8 .
Democratic candidate Barack Obama ’s first response to the invasion was virtually identical to that of Bush , calling for the territorial integrity of Georgia , but appealing to “ all sides ” in the conflict and calling for international mediation .
McCain much more clearly anticipated the foreign policy consensus that would emerge , quickly adopting a belligerent anti-Russian posture and demanding that Russia “ immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign Georgian territory . ”
On August the 9 , Bush largely reiterated his position toward Russia .
His statement remained very similar to the position of Obama , calling for international mediation and a “ stand - down by all troops . ”
On August 10 , while still in Beijing , Bush assured NBC Sports that he had a “ good relationship ” with Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin .
However , his position became somewhat more focused , as the scale of the Georgia ’s military debacle became evident and Georgian forces withdrew from South Ossetia .
He now called for a return to the “ status quo ante , ” meaning a withdrawal of Russian forces that had occupied both South Ossetia and Abkahzia , as well as military bases outside of the breakaway provinces .
The White House indicated that it held the same position on the conflict as France , and the Bush administration farmed out the diplomatic work of reaching a cease - fire to French President Nicholas Sarkozy and the European Union .
The hand - raisers and talking heads of the US media stood ready at their posts , but they had yet to receive clear instructions .
On August 10 and 11 , the marching orders arrived .
On Sunday the 10th , while Bush was still in China , Vice President Dick Cheney intervened to press for a more aggressive anti-Russian policy .
In a telephone conversation with Saakashvili , he denounced Russian “ aggression ” and told the Georgian president that Russia ’s actions “ “ must not go unanswered . ”
The next day , Bush returned from Beijing and issued a highly provocative statement from the White House Rose Garden that signaled a sharp escalation of the confrontation between the US and Russia .
Denouncing Russia ’s “ dramatic and brutal ” military escalation and charging that Russia was seeking to overthrow Saakashvili , he demanded that Moscow agree to an immediate cease - fire and withdrawal of its troops from Georgia .
All pretense of even - handedness and mediation had been dropped .
On August 11 , neoconservative Robert Kagan wrote a hysterical opinion piece in the Washington Post equating Russia ’s limited invasion of Georgia with the Nazi invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1938 .
Kagan assured his readers that “ the details of who did what to precipitate Russia ’s war against Georgia are not very important ” — a mere trifle , really .
On the same day , another neoconservative , William Kristol , published a similar piece in the New York Times .
Within hours of Bush ’s shift , Obama and the rest of the political establishment were on board with the new line .
Obama , then on vacation in Hawaii , altered his position , issuing a statement that placed full blame on Russian “ aggression . ”
The media was close behind .
The New York Times and Washington Post each produced articles on the 12th attributing the war to a Russian desire to overcome national humiliations endured since the breakup of the Soviet Union .
On the same day , the Times published another article meant to cover the US role in preparing the initial Georgian attack ( “ After Mixed US Messages , a War Erupted in Georgia ” ) and an anti-Russia guest op - ed piece ( “ Russia Blames the Victim ” ) .
The Los Angeles Times featured a column entitled “ Stand up to Russia . ” On August 13 , the Wall Street Journal wrote an editorial condemning Bush ’s “ lethargy ” in responding to Russia ( “ Bush and Georgia ” ) .
The media propaganda campaign deployed several buzzwords aimed at poisoning public opinion .
For example , the word “ blitz ” — meant to conjure up images of the German Wehrmacht ’s “ blitzkrieg ” invasions of Europe in World War Two — suddenly made its way into the airwaves and print .
A Google News search reveals that the word had not appeared in a major news source prior to August 10 .
Now , Russia ’s air campaign , which , in fact , resulted in few civilian deaths , was regularly referred to as a “ bombing blitz ” or “ air blitz . ”
Needless to say , the media uses entirely different words to describe the much larger and more deadly US aerial bombardments of Iraq , Yugoslavia , and other countries — words like “ precision , ” “ surgical ” and “ smart bomb . ”
Other buzzwords that rapidly made their way into the daily lexicon of the US media beginning on August 10 : various forms of the word “ aggression ” in defining Russia ; the words “ massive ” and “ disproportionate ” to describe Russia ’s incursion ( less than 15,000 soldiers , or about one tenth the number of US troops who continue to occupy Iraq ) ; the words “ assault ” and “ attack , ” used earlier to describe Georgia ’s operations against South Ossetia , were now routinely applied to Russia ’s retaliation ; “ democracy ” and “ democratic ” began to appear with much greater frequency in describing Georgia .
The major cable news networks —
Fox , CNN and MSNBC — are particularly adept at this sort of word game .
They are also skilled at manipulating visual images to support their chosen slant .
A Russian cameraman has accused CNN of using film footage of destroyed buildings that he took in the South Ossetian capital of Tskhinvali and presenting it to an American audience as evidence of Russian atrocities in the Georgian city of Gori .
In its day - to - day operations , the US media displays a combination of disdain and ignorance of history , particularly when that history reveals uncomfortable truths about the origins of current events .
However , when the chance to confuse and terrify readers and viewers presents itself , the mainstream media is quite ready to invoke some bogus history lesson against whatever country has run afoul of US imperialism .
A favorite historical theme trotted out again and again is “ appeasement , ” which is meant to conjure up images of British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain crumbling before Hitler at Munich in 1938 , and thus preparing the way for World War Two .
Such a presentation of the historical episode itself is grossly oversimplified .
But more to the point , it is used to swing public opinion behind the idea that the US and the world must adopt the most belligerent and violent stance toward whatever nation Washington has defined , at any given time , as a “ rogue state , ” “ axis of evil ” member , or “ aggressor . ”
Hence , the US media currently bristles with warnings against “ appeasing ” the Russian Bear .
Some lessons of history the US media prefers not to address .
The media does not square Washington ’s condemnation of the “ illegal ” Russian invasion of Georgia with the infinitely more destructive US invasion and occupation of Iraq .
As predatory as Russia ’s aims may be , it certainly can lay claim with more credibility to a “ security ” interest in a neighboring country , formerly part of the Soviet Union , that is openly hostile to it .
All the threadbare rationales for the US invasion of Iraq , on the other hand , have long since been exposed .
The media makes no effort , moreover , to square Washington ’s support for the “ territorial integrity ” of Georgia with its own war only 10 years ago against Serbia in support of Kosovan separatists , in which the infrastructure of Serbia was destroyed and its capital bombed .
One could draw up an endless list of such examples of rank hypocrisy .
Once the digital transition ( DTV ) concludes on February 17 , 2009 , there will be yet another big change if the Federal Communications Commission has its way .
Low - power auxiliary stations , including bases for wireless microphones , will be prohibited from broadcasting in the 700MHz band on TV channels 52 through 69 .
The FCC yesterday voted to propose the ban in a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and Order .
The decision will " ensure that low power auxiliary operations do not cause harmful interference to new public safety and commercial wireless services in the band , " the agency 's news release says .
Full - power TV broadcasters will vacate channels 52 through 69 after February 17 , leaving the area for public safety agencies and the commercial wireless companies that bought licenses in this years ' auction of the spectrum .
The FCC presently authorizes low - power auxiliaries to broadcast at around 100 meters , and some of them transmit in the 700MHz range .
The Order also proposes that the agency block the manufacturing and sale of low - power auxiliary applications that operate in that area ( actually , it 's 698 - 806M Hz , to be precise ) .
And outfits currently approved to run wireless mics and other devices as such will lose that privilege after the last day of analog broadcasting for full power television stations .
The FCC says it is " proposing " these measures because it plans to ask for public comment on the moves .
But the agency seems pretty certain about its decision — the vote was unanimous .
The Commission also says that it will impose a freeze on new applications for low power auxiliary stations intended for operation in said 700MHz region after DTV Day .
At present 156 entities are licensed to run these sort of stations in the 700MHz zone .
Most broadcast elsewhere as well .
Only 30 operate solely in various notches along the 614 - 806M Hz dial .
The permits are available to AM / FM radio license owners , broadcast networks , cable systems operators , and movie / TV producers .
But critics charge that the band region abounds with illegal users .
Unauthorized and ineligible
In July , a consortium of public interest groups warned the FCC that unlicensed wireless mic use in the area poses a threat that will become more pronounced after the DTV deadline .
The Public Interest Spectrum Coalition 's ( PISC ) petition estimates that between 500,000 to 1 million unauthorized wireless mic systems operate in the 700MHz channels , " creating pools of potential interference that could undermine the reliability of these new public safety and commercial wireless systems .

PISC , which includes Public Knowledge and the Media Access Project , threw the book at wireless mic manufacturers in comments filed with the FCC in July .
Their filing called for an investigation of nine companies that they say " willfully and knowingly " market and sell wireless mics to " unauthorized users for ineligible purposes . "
The coalition wants the FCC to probe Shure and eight other alleged culprits for " deceptive advertising practices , " and offer " amnesty " for unlicensed wireless mic users , as long as they relocate their operations elsewhere .
The PISC filing represents something of a counterpunch at wireless mic advocates who charge that allowing unlicensed broadband devices to tap into the " white space " TV bands will cause interference .
The FCC's Notice says nothing about that issue , but asks for public comment on the various elements of the petition .
They include the proposed investigation and creating a new " General Wireless Microphone Service " ( GWMS ) that will broadcast across vacant UHF channels below Channel 52 on a secondary basis and eventually operate on the 2020 - 2025 MHz Band .
Obviously wireless mic companies , especially Shure , are watching this proceeding with interest .
Shure Director Mark Brunner told
Ars this morning that the company " plans to work closely with the FCC " during this rule - making , and discontinued the marketing and sale of wireless mic products in the 700MHz area in 2007 .
PISC sent out a press release calling the FCC Notice a " welcome step . "
PISC also includes the Consumers Union , the National Hispanic Media Coalition , the Open Source Wireless Coalition , and U.S. PIRG , among other groups .

Biblical scholars in Colorado Springs have uncovered startling evidence that Senator John McCain may be the Antichrist .
Their conclusions , while highly controversial , may have a dramatic impact on the 2008 elections , since many Bible - believing Christians have already expressed doubts about McCain 's fealty to Christianity .
The analysis was conducted by the respected True Bible Society , and it will be published next month in the End Times Journal .
The analysis was especially ironic , given that it came out just one day after McCain was accused of subtly hinting that Barack Obama could be the Antichrist .
McCain ran a commercial depicting Obama as " The One , " giving rise to charges that he was sending a subliminal messages to anti-Obama Christians .
" What started us looking at this issue is the fact that Senator McCain has declared his intention to maintain US forces in Iraq for a hundred years , " said David Jenkins , a leading Biblical scholar .
" That means that McCain wants to control Babylon for at least a century . "
According to many scholars of the Book of Revelation , the Antichrist will try to rebuild the ancient city of Babylon in order to use it as a springboard for an international effort at world domination .
Ultimately , the Antichrist will marshal forces from Babylon to spark a showdown with Christian and Jewish - led forces in the battle of Armageddon .

" We believe that the End Times is near , based on the pattern of wars , earthquakes .
and other strange phenomena we 've been witnessing since the start of the New Millennium , " said Jenkins .
" Given that it may be imminent , the person who controls Babylon must be the Antichrist . "
Until 2003 , many Christians believed that Saddam Hussein might be the Antichrist , since he started excavations to restore Babylon in the mid 1970s .
But Hussein 's death meant that the Antichrist is someone else .
Since Obama wants to get out of Iraq , he can't be the Antichrist either , concluded Jenkins .
Jenkins said his teams suspicions were further heightened when genealogical research showed that McCain 's great - grandfather was actually not John McCain , but John Mihai .
Mihai is an ancient Romanian name , and according to Bible - believing Christians , the Antichrist is likely to be a Romanian .
" What clinched it for us was that the name Mihai means ' who is like the Lord , ' " said Jenkins .
" As far as we 're concerned , that was enough .
It means that McCain might easily pretend to be the Redeemer . "
McCain 's geniality and folksiness are consistent with his being the Antichrist , Jenkins said .
" Many people think that the Antichrist will be a evil - seeming leader , but in fact the Bible tells us that he will be charming . "
So far the McCain campaign has refused to comment on Jenkins ' study .

Senator Obama has supported corn subsidies to farmers
US presidential hopeful Barack Obama is coming under increasing pressure to change his policies on biofuels .
Senator Obama has been a big supporter of corn subsidies for American farmers to produce the plant - fuel ethanol .
But a new report from his own green adviser warns of the many problems associated with the biofuel .
Daniel Kammen 's paper says that a car will emit more greenhouse gases driving on corn ethanol processed with coal than it will using normal petrol .
The University of California , Berkeley , professor says the boom in subsidised American corn production is driving up the cost of animal feed - and forcing soy production to Brazil where it creates still more greenhouse gases if it is planted on virgin land .
Energy security
Professor Kammen says much smarter biofuels policies are needed , but admits that the analysis of this highly complex field will prove very difficult .
" To address this clash of policies , views , economic valuations and environmental goals , a clear set of evaluation methodologies , and high - quality , open access to data will be required , " his paper adds .
Senator Obama has previously been a strong supporter of President Bush 's corn subsidies which put money into the pockets of his voters in Illinois - the second biggest corn state in America .
He has also said in the past that the subsidies help with energy security and climate change .
Recently , he has been shifting position somewhat but we may not know until after the election how much he has been listening to Professor Kammen .
At the moment , he faces a clear tension between upholding subsidies to the farmers who helped him into the presidential race and upholding his promises on the global stage to tackle climate change and help the poor .
Senator Obama has also backed President Bush 's controversial coal - to - liquid fuel programme which benefits coal miners in the south of his home state .
Senator McCain has been consistently sceptical of corn subsidies to farmers .
What to do when colleagues in the workplace just wo n’t — will not , will not , will not — reach a little further to the left with that grip of paper they no longer want hanging around , instead opting for the trash can rather than the nearby recycling bin ?
Not long ago , when I finally joined Big Cooperate America after resisting for more than a decade , it did n’t take long to realize I had cloaked myself in an environment that was not ‘ green . ’
The company , a rather major one , considers itself an environmentally aware corporation .
And it is — to an extent .
But only to the extent of its masses , which are still more inclined to consider recycling paper and plastic bottles the cutting edge of the green game .
But , looking at the positive , it ’s been a lesson in accepting limitations .
As I said in a previous sustainablog.org post — CNN ’s Glenn Beck and Other Doubters Need More Faith — one person can only do so much on a daily basis .
I ’ve come to the conclusion that I need to strike a balance between my drive to recycle every scrap of paper with the idea that I must not alienate my co-workers .
One , it will create a polluted work environment , if you will , causing tension and resentment .
And Two , it will only turn them off of the cause .
( They may never ever ever be turned on to the cause , but jabbing them in the ribs every day with guilt trips wo n’t do any good either . )
How to Make Earth a Better Place
I continue to ponder my role in making this world a better , cleaner , more protected place .
It has so many problems and so many different viewpoints on solving them — or neglecting them — that it ’s a daunting mission for all of us .
In my quest to seek middle ground and solutions with people of opposing views , I have backed off feeling the urge to chide co-workers .
I just let it go and do n’t bother with getting riled about it .
Instead , I try to keep my modest grumbles silent and any eye - rolling hidden when I see that someone opts to toss copier paper into the trash can instead of the recycle bin around the corner .
If no one is around , I ’ll move it to its properly useful place .
In general , I try to hold firm in living my life as I see fit and not remind those around me who do not get it , that I do not approve of how they are living theirs — at least this one aspect of it .
Unfortunately , that seems to be more or less every one of my colleagues , right now .
( Frankly , I consider preachy religious fanatics to be a nuisance .
And in the attempt to minimize hypocrisy , I ’m hoping that my “ religion ” of caring for humanity and the Earth — by the way , should n’t that be the same goal that so - called religious zealots should have ?
— will just respect what I do .
Who knows — maybe they ’ll one day follow suit ? )
Another lead - by - example I ’ve opted for is : Instead of taking food from my workplace cafeteria in styrofoam , I carry the plates and bowls and silverware to my office .
Then I return it by the end of the day .
It ’s what I consider the right thing to do , even if styrofoam piles high in trash cans around the headquarters campus , contributed by a couple thousand of my workplace neighbors .
I quietly do it .
Just as I quietly ride my bike to work — often the only one on the campus who does ( again , of nearly 2,000 people ) .
But people see me .
And since I ’ve begun , two others ride at least some of the time .
Maybe — just maybe — my example had something to do with that .
In all , continuing to live in a responsible way while stepping aside as others live , well , in other ways , seems to just be part of finding personal balance for me — emotional balance , as much as anything .
Anyone got other constructive suggestions for coping with minority status as an Earth - lover in the workplace ?

For decades the Second Amendment might as well have been called the Second - Class Amendment .
The U.S. Supreme Court spent the late 20th century expansively interpreting the First , Fourth , Fifth , Sixth and Eighth amendments , not to mention unenumerated rights ranging from travel to sexual privacy .
But not until last month did the court hold that the Second Amendment means what it says : that " the right of the people to keep and bear arms , shall not be infringed . "
What ...
In Revisiting the M3 Contraction I stated " consumers are saving , rather than spending their stimulus checks " .
Some found that statement hard to believe .
Let 's take a look .
Sev writes : " Mish , the argument that more people are saving is something I find hard to believe .
Their bills are skyrocketing and " price " increases are eating into their monthly costs .
Maybe some have paid down bills but I would bet the vast majority do n't have the means .
Now maybe ultra rich people are moving their vast sums into perceived safer investment vehicles but the thought that actual saving is increasing I do n't think makes complete sense .
I do buy that they are moving more money into checking accounts and are tapping their retirement early as well .
As for seeing into what the dark pools of liquidity are doing I think that is the kernel . "
What Is The Savings Rate ?
Before we can state whether or not the savings rate is going up , we need to define it .
The Federal Bank of San Francisco explains how the savings rate is calculated in a March 2002 article called What 's Behind the Low U.S. Personal Saving Rate ?
How is the personal saving rate measured ?
The most frequently cited measure of the personal saving rate is based on the National Income and Product Accounts ( NIPA ) .
It is constructed by forming the ratio of Personal Saving to Disposable Personal Income ( DPI ) , where DPI is defined as Personal Income ( including wage and salary income , net proprietors ' income , transfer payments less social insurance , income from interest and dividends , and net rental income ) less tax and nontax payments to governments .
Personal Saving is found by subtracting from DPI total Personal Outlays , 97 % of which consists of Personal Consumption Expenditures ( including consumer durables ) , with the remainder composed of Interest Paid by Persons ( individuals , nonprofits , and trust funds ) and Net Personal Transfer Payments to the Rest of the World .
Current low personal saving rate would not represent a problem that is overhanging the U.S. economy , but is instead a manifestation of a more efficient deployment of the economy 's resources .
What 's Behind The Soaring Savings Rate ?
Congress enacted the tax rebate program earlier this year because it perceived a growing risk of recession .
In addition , it feared monetary policy alone would not be effective because of the dysfunctional credit markets .
As American taxpayers know , most of the rebate checks have now been mailed and cashed .
Those of us who supported this fiscal package reasoned that the program would boost consumer confidence as well as available cash .
We hoped the combination would cause households to spend a substantial fraction of the rebate dollars , leading to more production and employment .
My Comment
Here 's the deal .
Consumers are tapped out .
Confidence is in the gutter .
Much of the stimulus will be used to pay down debt .
Most of the rest of it will be to buy necessities that people were going to buy anyway .
That is the easily seen , or at least should be easily seen .
My conclusion is there is not going to be a noticeable surge in spending in the second half of this year .
Those banking on stimulus checks to carry a second half recovery just might wish to reconsider .
The evidence is now in and that optimism was unwarranted .
Recent government statistics show that only between 10 % and 20 % of the rebate dollars were spent .
The rebates added nearly $ 80 billion to the permanent national debt but less than $ 20 billion to consumer spending .
This experience confirms earlier studies showing that one - time tax rebates are not a cost - effective way to increase economic activity .
These conclusions are significant for evaluating the likely impact of Barack Obama 's recent proposal to distribute $ 1,000 rebate checks to low and middle - income workers at an estimated cost of approximately $ 65 billion .
His plan , to finance those rebates with an extra tax on oil companies , would reduce investment in refining and exploration , keeping oil prices higher than they would otherwise be .
My Comment
Stimulus Plan Stymied
The graph plots monthly data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis ’ personal income accounts spanning the years 2000 - 2008 .
It shows personal consumption , income , and saving for the 3 recent rebate periods :
1. 2001 : Economic Growth and Tax Reconciliation Act of 2001
2. 2003 : Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003
3. 2008 : Economic Stimulus Act of 2008
For the 2001 and 2003 rebate periods , personal saving rose sharply , but fell quickly thereafter .
Real consumption grew in both periods , which contributed to economic growth .
For the 2008 rebate period , personal saving rose sharply , and as in the previous periods , fell quickly thereafter .
However , real consumption continued its previous downward trend .
Most estimates expected consumers to spend at least 40 % of the rebate checks , but in the end , they only spend 10 % - 20 % .
This has had negligible effects , if any , on economic growth .
Where To From Here ?

One of the World Wide Web ’s most distinguished organs of fake news , the Borowitz Report , leads its current issue with this flash :
The liberal blogosphere was aflame today with new accusations that Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill ) is trying to win the 2008 presidential election .
Except that sometimes it ’s hard to tell fake from real .
These sentiments , for example , are from actual blogs :
If Obama believes the BS he said about the FISA Capitulation bill , then he is not fit to be President . >
He is turning on every major issue and I am not going to vote for him .
From here on out , the netroots should refuse to donate to any Democratic nominee , including Barack Obama .
Obama , it turns out , is a politician .
In this respect , he resembles the forty - three Presidents he hopes to succeed , from the Father of His Country to the wayward son , Alpha George to Omega George .
Winning a Presidential election does n’t require being all things to all of the people all of the time , but it does require being some things to most of the people some of the time .
It does n’t require saying one thing and also saying its opposite , but it does require saying more or less the same thing in ways that are understood in different ways .
They ’re all politicians , yes —very much including Obama , as Ryan Lizza shows elsewhere in this issue .
But that does n’t mean they ’re all the same .
It was inevitable that the boggier reaches of the blogosphere would eventually smell betrayal .
In contrast , what bloggers call the MSM — the mainstream media — seldom trades in the currency of moral indignation .
Although the better newspapers have regular features devoted to evaluating the candidates ’ proposals for workability , the MSM generally eschews value judgments about the merits .
The MSM — especially the cable - news intravenous drip — prefers flip - flops .
Obama has been providing plenty of plastic for the flip - flop factories with the adjustments he ’s been making as he retools his campaign for the general election .
Under headlines like “ IN CAMPAIGN , ONE MAN’S PRAGMATISM IS ANOTHER’S FLIP-FLOPPING , ” the big papers have been assembling quite a list of matters on which the candidate has “ changed his position , ” including Iraq , abortion rights , federal aid to faith - based social services , capital punishment , gun control , public financing of campaigns , and wiretapping .
Most of them are mere shifts of emphasis , some are marginal tweaks , and a few are either substantive or nonexistent .
Let ’s do a quick tour d’horizon .
On July 3rd , Obama remarked to reporters , vis -à - vis his projected visit to Iraq , that he will “ continue to refine ” his policies in light of what he learns there .
The flip - flop frenzy exploded so quickly that Obama called a second press conference that same day in an effort to tamp it down , saying that while he “ would be a poor commander - in - chief ” if he “ did n’t take facts on the ground into account , ” his intention to withdraw American combat troops from Iraq within sixteen months of his Inauguration — which is to say less than two years from now — remains unchanged .
Flip - flop category : marginal tweak .
The same week , Obama said he did n’t think that “ mental distress ” alone was sufficient justification for a late - term abortion , prompting the president of the National Organization for Women to rebuke him for feeding the perception that women seek abortions because they ’re “ having a bad - hair day . ”
In “ The Audacity of Hope , ” Obama had written that
the willingness of even the most ardent prochoice advocates to accept some restrictions on late - term abortion marks a recognition that a fetus is more than a body part and that society has some interest in its development .
The leading reproductive - rights group , NARal Pro-Choice America , defended him , pointing out that his views are fully consistent with Roe v. Wade .
Flip - flop category : nonexistent .
“ Look , you ’re not the only one with problems . ”
Facebook
Twitter
Email
Shopping
Obama also wrote that “ certain faith - based programs ” could offer “ a uniquely powerful way of solving problems and hence merit carefully tailored support . ”
Yet his recent call for an expansion of President Bush ’s program came as a shock to some , including the Times , which called the program a violation of the separation of church and state .
If it is , it ’s a minor one , like grants to religiously affiliated colleges ; in any event , this is n’t a new position for Obama .
Flip - flop category : shift of emphasis .
For twenty years , nominal support for the death penalty and its partner in crime , “ gun rights , ” has apparently been mandatory for any Democrat wishing to have a serious chance to be elected President .
Without enthusiasm , Obama has endorsed capital punishment throughout his political career .
In his book , he wrote that “ the rape and murder of a child ” is “ so heinous , so beyond the pale , that the community is justified in expressing the full measure of its outrage by meting out the ultimate punishment . ”
But in demurring from last month ’s Supreme Court decision banning executions for child rape alone , he went further : “ and ” is not “ or . ”
As for the Court ’s radical decision conferring upon an individual the right to possess guns separate from service in a “ well regulated militia , ” he did not , as reported , “ embrace ” it .
But he did commend it for providing “ much - needed guidance to local jurisdictions ” — a distinctly Panglossian spin .
Still , if Obama becomes President the practical effect of these panders will be minimal .
It ’s hard to imagine an Obama appointee to the Supreme Court voting with Justices Scalia and Thomas on issues like these .
Flip - flop category : substantive tweak .
As for the last two items on the flip - flop list — well , it ’s a fair cop , as the Brits say .
Obama ’s decision to refuse public funds for the general - election campaign was political hardball , a spikes - high slide at third base .
He still favors public financing in principle , and he says he ’ll work to modernize it in practice .
In a sense , his utterly unexpected success in raising tens of millions from small , no -strings contributors has created a kind of unofficial public - finance system .
But that success is a one - off , and the big contributors are still contributing big , with all that entails .
He did n’t change his “ position , ” but he did break a promise .
Californians can once again home school their children without fear of the state ( well , almost ) .
Is this a victory for Liberty ?
Or did homeschoolers in CA simply benefit from a lucky pull on the legal slot machine — a pull that this time came up three smiling judges ?
Of course , the latter is the case .
The next challenge to homeschooling in CA could be the pull that once again comes up two frowns .
The legal game in CA is similar to the more sophisticated game in DC — a game where it takes five jokers to be a winner , with Liberty never even a card in the deck .
And to smack the face of anyone believing that the bell of freedom rang again , the court noted that “ [ i] t is important to recognize that it is not for us to consider , as a matter of policy , whether home schooling should be permitted in California .
That job is for the Legislature . ”
The court has restated the belief that the legislature has an enforcable first claim to our children .
Constitutions no longer protect the individual from the state .
They are nothing more than the starting point for the state ’s continual abrogation of our ethical rights .

US and Russian warships took up positions in the Black Sea today in a risky war of nerves on opposing sides of the Georgia conflict .
With the Russians effectively controlling Georgia ’s main naval base of Poti , Moscow also dispatched the Moskva missile cruiser and two smaller craft on “ peacekeeping ” duties at the port of Sukhumi on the coast of Abkhazia , the breakaway region that the Kremlin recognised as independent yesterday .
The Americans , wary of escalating an already fraught situation , cancelled the scheduled docking in Poti of the US Coast Guard vessel , the Dallas , and instead sent it to the southern Georgian - controlled port of Batumi , 200 km ( 124 miles ) from the Russian ships , where it delivered humanitarian aid .
“ Let ’s hope we do n’t see any direct confrontation , ” said Dmitri Peskov , the spokesman for the Russian prime minister , Vladimir Putin , as the Russians challenged the US policy of using military aircraft and ships to deliver relief supplies .

The American Pregnancy Association , an organization that presents itself as an unbiased medical resource for women seeking to sustain their pregnancies , in fact acts as a funnel for crisis pregnancy centers .
When a young woman named Jessica wrote to me on Scarleteen to ask whether women who are pregnant should visit a crisis pregnancy center for resources and support , I warned her that CPCs are non-medical establishments that provide false information to women in order to scare them away from abortion as an option .
I explained how easy it can be to be fooled by CPCs , even when you ’re savvy , aware of practices CPCs typically employ — even , I soon learned , when you ’re writing an article in protest of them .
And then I offered Jessica a link to the American Pregnancy Helpline as an option for women looking for support sustaining a pregnancy and as an alternative to a CPC .
I proved my own point too well .
At first blush , Helpline ’s website presents itself as supportive of all pregnancy options .
I found several sites I know to be reputable and fully supportive of choice linking to the Helpline .
But I should know to be wary of any sites offering aid to pregnant women .
If I had , I would have found that the American Pregnancy Helpline is affiliated with a larger organization , the American Pregnancy Association ( APA ) , whose site is linked to even by such organizations as the National Abortion Federation , the Our Bodies , Ourselves blog , the Association of Reproductive Health Professionals , WebMD , RAINN , the Feminist Majority Foundation , and , perhaps most disturbingly , MedlinePlus , a well - vetted consumer health site that is a project of the National Library of Medicine — all of whom are likely unaware of the extent of the APA ’s connection to anti-choice causes .
Once I found the link between the Helpline and the American Pregnancy Association , I found a whole lot more .
By the end of a day of deep digging , I discovered that both the American Pregnancy Helpline and the American Pregnancy Association and their founders have no record of being supportive of all reproductive options .
In fact , the organizations both trace their origins to a crisis pregnancy center .
I found misleading and medically incorrect information on both organization ’s sites , including references to “ partial - birth abortion ” and the suggestion that future fertility or breast cancer has anything at all to do with having had an abortion .
I learned that the Helpline is widely linked in CPC and anti-choice directories .
And I soon noticed the strange absence of any information on contraception at the site for teens , while links to sites pushing ab - only proliferate .
( I emailed the site immediately asking a few basic questions about their stance and background early but have yet to get any response . )

“ As a longtime options and abortion counselor , I am blown away to learn that this place has sneaked under the radar to this extent , ” says Parker Dockray , executive director of the California Coalition for Reproductive Freedom and the Rewire reader who first questioned my link to the American Pregnancy Association .
“ I think it is a wake up call for the pro-choice community that we cannot rely on circular referrals without doing our own due diligence every single time we find a new hotline purporting to do unbiased abortion or pregnancy options counseling . ”
After being informed of APA ’s biases , the National Abortion Federation ’s Vicki Saporta wrote , “ This site is a prime example of how well some crisis pregnancy centers masquerade as legitimate reproductive health care organizations .
Imagine how difficult it must be for a woman facing an unplanned pregnancy to determine which sites and centers provide full options counseling and comprehensive reproductive health care services …
We no longer link to this organization . ”
A waltz through the Helpline ’s web archives reveals that the organization was founded as a textbook CPC .
At that time it was called America ’s Crisis Pregnancy Helpline and did n’t claim any sort of medical accuracy or affiliation .
To its credit , the organization ’s information page did once admit that it does n’t provide referrals to abortion services ; the organization no longer makes that statement anywhere on the current site .
Misleading Readers Since 1999
This 1999 page demonstrates a clear bias .
Note that the questions about finances , about “ long - term physical and emotional effects , ” knowledge of procedures , pressuring , changing one ’s mind or “ looking down on ” women are asked about abortion but not about parenting or adoption .
Parenting is a lifelong endeavor , so why does the options page pose no questions at all about readiness , desire or ability to parent ?
Same goes with adoption : no questions are posed ; only a list of possible benefits is presented .
Abortion gets a list of “ possible emotional side effects , ” but none is listed for parenting or adoption , despite the fact that abortion “ side effects ” also commonly occur to women who parent or give children up for adoption .
If you ’re considering an abortion , the Helpline prods you to ask yourself , “ What would an adoption plan look like ? ” but there is no such question about parenting , nor do the lists for adoption or parenting ask what an abortion plan would look like .
Apparently , only “ when it comes to abortion ” — not parenting or adoption — “ there are many issues to consider when making a decision . ”
The Helpline ’s current online pregnancy test — which reports that you may be pregnant no matter how you respond — offers you the opportunity to see a “ baby ” in the womb “ at every stage , ” though that link leads to a page with no gestation dates listed for the few select photos it provides .
It suggests access to free pregnancy testing through the Helpline but does not instruct readers to purchase a home test or to see a healthcare provider for a test .
Birth of the Helpline
According to the 1999 site archive , the Helpline was established by Mike and Anne Sheaffer in 1995 .
The couple advertised their desire to adopt a baby on two billboards in Dallas and set up a hotline to respond to the calls from pregnant women the billboards provoked .
Says the site archive :
In the 1,100 calls the Sheaffers subsequently received , many were from women facing unplanned pregnancies who did not know where else to turn .
Recognizing this unfulfilled need in society , the Sheaffers envisioned a confidential crisis line where women could receive the help they desperately needed .
[ America ’s Crisis Pregnancy Hotline ] functions in this capacity today as its trained staff provides counseling , pregnancy - related information , and referrals for community resources .
ACPH is an independent , non-profit entity and is funded primarily by corporate and private donations .
The Schaeffers started the CPC called America ’s Crisis Pregnancy Helpline in 1995 ; that CPC was later renamed America ’s Pregnancy Helpline .
In 2003 , that organization spawned the American Pregnancy Association .
Both the Helpline and the APA continued to exist , ostensibly as separate entities ; in reality , at one call center , at the same address .
But the current Helpline site provides no organizational background , nor does it make any reference to the Sheaffers or to a direct affiliation with the APA — even though the current site for the APA tells the story of the Sheaffers and notes that ,
In 2003 , the Helpline became the American Pregnancy Association , a foundation of health services for the public , including education , research , advocacy , public policy and community awareness .
Utilizing a Medical Advisory Committee , and collaborating with other reproductive and pregnancy health organizations , APA is a recognized leader of reproductive and pregnancy health information .
The organization ’s named president , Dr. Phillip B. Imler , seems to exist only on a site profiling Christian Adoption International .
A Dr. Brad Imler , whose doctorate is in psychology , is listed as their contact for corporate partnerships , and appears elsewhere online — in press quotes and in his profile at the forums for the site .
I could n’t find any background , practice or resume for Brad previous to the APA , either — as the President of the APA , not Philip .
Dr. Brad Imler is interviewed here in a publication for the American Life League .
On an exceptionally difficult - to - find page , the founders of the APA are listed as J. Michael Sheaffer and Dr. Brad Imler .
J. Michael Sheaffer can be found in a tax - exempt organization listing as the director of Pastors for Life International , an organization listed as a Right to Life organization in Texas with a return last filed in 2002 .
The website for PFLI appears to have gone dark in 2005 .
Until 2002 , the web archive of the domain shows J. Michael Sheaffer of the organization .
In an archive of the site during the time Shaeffer was listed as a Founding Director , a page lists ways pastors or congregations could get involved with the mission of PFLI .
Those include :
Start a pregnancy center or maternity home .
Create a “ Mentoring Mothers ” network for pregnant teenagers .
Start a post- abortion reconciliation ministry .
Refer women who are unexpectedly pregnant to pro-life safetynets .
Create web links to pregnancy , adoption , and post- abortion resources .
Those goals are paired with contact links , and the Helpline is listed as a contact to “ Help individuals gain access to pro-life safety nets , ” and “ Identify and support a local pro-life agency ( prayer , material assistance , financial , or volunteer ) . ”
In June 2006 , Charisma magazine reported that the American Pregnancy Association had collaborated with a pregnancy test manufacturer to add inserts providing its Helpline number in 3.5 million test kits .
The article quotes “ APA President Brad Imler , ” who tells the magazine , “ What we find is that most women , when they receive information , desire to carry a child to term . ”
Charisma writes ,
Statistics have shown that 70 percent of women did not have enough information before deciding to abort a pregnancy , Imler said .
The APA compiles statistics based on its own data , as well as research coming from other reliable sources , Imler said .
Calling the Helpline
So , knowing all of this , what else could I do but take America ’s Pregnancy Helpline for a test drive ?
Scarleteen volunteer S. called them up .
The Helpline staff answered as the American Pregnancy Association .
S. reported that she was seven weeks pregnant and needed an abortion because her parents would put her in danger if they found out she had gotten pregnant .
The staffer on the line refused to give her a referral for any abortion services or any abortion counseling or information ( nor did the staffer suggest that she get somewhere safe ) , but asked where she was and offered the phone number of “ somewhere nearby she could go to get information on abortion . ”
That number was for the Monroeville Crisis Pregnancy Center , which also calls itself the Monroeville Pregnancy Care Center and Crossroads Pregnancy Services .
The organization , a member of the Pennsylvania Pro-Life Federation , has at least two different websites despite being one business and clearly fails to provide any accurate information about abortion .
We can safely presume my volunteer was not given this number by accident — when pressing for more information , the staffer on the phone refused to give any other resources , even though a Planned Parenthood is located nearby as well .
That Helpline number is the only hotline number offered for questions about abortion procedures on the APA ’s abortion information pages .
What We Know Now
I cannot say whether the APA exists solely or primarily as a way to feed CPCs .
Plenty of the information at the APA certainly is medically accurate , and the organization may very well be as passionate about maternal health as they are about the pro-life cause .
But given all of this information , given the personal bias involved , and the extent to which these links and affiliations are disguised , I think it begs the question .
In many ways this is a sadly perfect object lesson about CPCs .
I ’m streetwise , and I have a keen eye for bias , for things that do n’t quite fit , and for deception when it comes to reproductive options and aid .
What I do n’t have is unlimited time , so , like any busy , stressed woman fearing pregnancy would also do , I relied on not hearing anything bad about these organizations from the pro-choice groups I trust .
“ Exposing [ CPCs ] for what they are takes constant attention , ” cautions Judy Norsigian , executive director of Our Bodies , Ourselves .
I hope my readers understand that this was a sincere error on my part , for which I take full responsibility .
I am certainly glad to have discovered all of this about these organizations and to have the opportunity to reveal this information about them .
I did n’t learn this lesson , after all , as a woman in the midst of an unwanted pregnancy seeking help and the accurate , supportive information I was assured I ’d be given for all of my choices .

NYT 's Joe Nocera - one of the reporters who speculated on the health of Apple 's CEO after WWDC - got a call from Steve Jobs himself .
It was n't pretty from the very beginning :
" This is Steve Jobs .
You think I 'm an arrogant [ expletive ] who thinks he 's above the law , and I think you 're a slime bucket who gets most of his facts wrong . "
Advertisement
What followed was Jobs setting the record straight and spilling the beans about his health .
Click to viewAfter agreeing to an off - the - record conversation , Jobs proceeded to tell Nocera that he did n't have cancer .
All he had , what made him look thinner than usual , was something else that was n't threatening his life .
Nocera revealed this in an NYT article today , arguing that , while Jobs is not obligated by law to disclose his personal health as CEO of Apple , he should do it , for the interest of investors .
Advertisement
Should he really ?
For sure , Steve Jobs ' health is extremely important to Wall Street .
After all , Jobs ' unique vision is credited as the main factor of Apple 's success .
At least , that 's the legend .
A legend created by writers and analysts , who love to embellish history and make heroes ( and villains ) ignoring many other factors and actual history .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
The truth is that , while there 's no doubt that Steve Jobs is The Man , people should also look at all the facts .
With any complex system , like Apple 's , there are many variables that have contributed to the company 's success during these years , starting with luck but , above all , the talent of the rest of the directors ( Schiller , Rubinstein , Ive , to name a few ) and , specially , the amazing engineers working at Apple , along with the hard work and dedication of the rest of the employees .
But let 's forget about the pure facts .
Let 's trash any logical analysis and assume that Steve is the only guy responsible for Apple 's success .
Advertisement
Should he disclose his health then , for the sake of the shareholders ?
He does n't have to .
His health does n't have to be a public matter because he is perceived as the Hero who resurrected Apple .
Not only because that 's not entirely true , and Apple is not Steve , but " Steve + A Whole Lot More , " but because private health is something that only concerns the individual and his freedom , independently of his role in companies and societies .
Advertisement
You do n't have to go far to see clear examples of this , and how not disclosing a medical condition did n't affect the course of anything ( actually , quite the contrary ) .
Take US presidents , for example .
Was FDR less of a president because he hid his medical condition from the American public ?
What about John F. Kennedy , who never disclosed his Addison 's disease , even when asked specifically about it ?
The answer is clear .
FDR and JFK were in much higher positions , with much greater power , and in extremely difficult situations .
Situations that would have really changed the world .
Yet , they did n't disclose their medical conditions .
They did n't make people lose .
On the contrary , they made people win .
One won a war and the other took us to the Moon .
And what 's more , it was n't - and it is n't - illegal for them to hide it :
It 's not a crime for a president to withhold information about his or her health .
In fact , it 's their right not to disclose it .
Advertisement
So , if people with a lot more responsibility than Jobs kept their medical life secret , why should the Apple CEO disclose all the details about his , especially when these details are not about a life - threatening illness ?
Because of the investors ?
Because of a journalist who wants to tell a BIG story ?
Nocera argues , like some analysts , that it would be a disaster for Apple 's stock and that 's why people should be kept in the loop .
I disagree .
And I think that anyone who values their private life , the most intimate part of themselves , their own bodies , would agree too , no matter if you are a fanboy , a hateboy , a journalist or an investor .
Advertisement
What 's more :
The fact is that I do n't believe investors would leave Apple if Jobs leaves .
Watching the people there now , watching how the iPhone steamrolls the competition , the iPod and iTunes and the Mac keep growing , people will stay .
Probably some speculators will sell at first .
After all , we are all human and have emotional reactions .
But , after a while , it would be just fine .
And one day , if the company as a whole fails , then the company will die .
But many companies have survived the loss of CEOs as talented as Jobs .
IBM did n't die .
Disney did n't die .
Sony did n't die .
As brilliant as Steve Jobs is , Apple will survive after he leaves .
Personally , I just hope that he 'll stay for as long as he wants .
He 's good for the industry and the world , because what Apple does keeps pushing technology forward .
Hopefully he 'll leave because he wants to , to live a long life , and not because of any illness .
Advertisement
But if he leaves because of a fatal illness , I 'm positive that he 'll step down and the board will elect someone else .
Like they did before .
That will be business as usual .
Just like business was normal when he was off for cancer surgery and treatment .
Nothing happened , everything worked as expected .
Until that day , Steve Jobs has the right to keep his medical records private for as long as he wants .
Like FDR .
Like JFK .
Like any single person in this country and in the world .
It 's our right , as humans , to do so , as recognized by the United Nations .

[ NYT ]
The UK should take active steps to prepare for dangerous climate change of perhaps 4C according to one of the government 's chief scientific advisers .
In policy areas such as flood protection , agriculture and coastal erosion Professor Bob Watson said the country should plan for the effects of a 4C global average rise on pre-industrial levels .
The EU is committed to limiting emissions globally so that temperatures do not rise more than 2C .
" There is no doubt that we should aim to limit changes in the global mean surface temperature to 2C above pre-industrial , " Watson , the chief scientific adviser to the Department for the Environment , Food and Rural Affairs , told the Guardian .
" But given this is an ambitious target , and we do n't know in detail how to limit greenhouse gas emissions to realise a 2 degree target , we should be prepared to adapt to 4C . "
Globally , a 4C temperature rise would have a catastrophic impact .
According to the government 's 2006 Stern review on the economics of climate change , between 7 million and 300 million more people would be affected by coastal flooding each year , there would be a 30 - 50 % reduction in water availability in Southern Africa and the Mediterranean , agricultural yields would decline 15 to 35 % in Africa and 20 to 50 % of animal and plant species would face extinction .
In the UK , the most significant impact would be rising sea levels and inland flooding .
Climate modellers also predict there would be an increase in heavy rainfall events in winter and drier summers .
Watson 's plea to prepare for the worst was backed up by the government 's former chief scientific adviser , Sir David King .
He said that even with a comprehensive global deal to keep carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere at below 450 parts per million there is a 50 % probability that temperatures would exceed 2C and a 20 % probability they would exceed 3.5C .
" So even if we get the best possible global agreement to reduce greenhouse gasses on any rational basis you should be preparing for a 20 % risk so I think Bob Watson is quite right to put up the figure of 4 degrees , " he said .
One big unknown is the stage at which dangerous tipping points would be reached that lead to further warming - for example the release of methane hydrate deposits in the Arctic .
" My own feeling is that if we get to a 4 degree rise it is quite possible that we would begin to see a runaway increase , " said King .
He said a two - and - half - year analysis by the government 's Foresight programme on the implications for coastal defences had more impact in the corridors of power than any other research on the effects of climate change that he presented .
" No other single factor focussed the minds of the cabinet more than the analysis that I produced through that ...
We begin to have to talk about ordered retreat from some areas of Britain because it becomes impossible to defend , " he said .
" There 's no choice here between adaptation and mitigation , we have to do both . "
Other experts were concerned that Watson 's comments might be seen as defeatist and an admission that emissions reductions were impossible to achieve .
" At 4 degrees we are basically into a different climate regime , " said Prof Neil Adger , an expert on adaptation to climate change at the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research in Norwich .
" I think that is a dangerous mindset to be in .
Thinking through the implications of 4 degrees of warming shows that the impacts are so significant that the only real adaptation strategy is to avoid that at all cost because of the pain and suffering that is going to cost .
" There is no science on how we are going to adapt to 4 degrees warming .
It is actually pretty alarming , " he added .
Speaking to the Guardian , Watson , who is a former science adviser to President Clinton and ex-chief scientist at the World Bank , said the UK should take a lead in research on carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) .
Alluding to the US effort in the 1960s to put a man on the moon he advocated an " Apollo - type programme " to introduce 10 to 20 CCS pilot projects - which work by burying carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels underground - among OECD countries to develop the technology .
" This would allow coal - fired power plants that are currently being built to be modular and capable of having carbon capture retrofitted , and would show the world that we take the issue of climate change seriously , thus demonstrating real leadership .
Without this technology we have a real problem . "
He also said as coal burning is cleaned up to remove harmful sulphur pollution climate change would actually get worse .
The sulphur aerosols are actually preventing some warming from taking place currently .
" This offsetting effect , which is equivalent to about 100 parts per million of carbon dioxide , will largely disappear if China and India follow the lead of the US and Europe in limiting sulphur emissions , the cause of acid deposition , " he said .
Like many people , I was under the impression that the new Meryl Streep film was called “ Mamma Mia . ”
The correct title is , in fact , “ Mamma Mia ! , ” and , in one keystroke , the exclamation mark tells you all you need to know about the movie .
Billy Wilder tried the same trick with “ Avanti ! , ” in 1972 , but that felt like late Chekhov compared with this ferocious onslaught of obligatory good cheer .
From the opening minutes , in which Sophie ( Amanda Seyfried ) , a young pleasure seeker on the eve of her wedding , greets her two bridesmaids as they arrive on a jetty , yelping with delight like unweaned puppies , you can tell that everyone in this story is just going to have the best time .
Ever .
Hazard of the modern musical : Meryl Streep and Pierce Brosnan on a Greek island , singing the Abba songbook .
Illustration by Robert Risko
Sophie resides on a Greek island — an island like any other , where gnarled old ladies drop whatever they ’re doing in the olive grove and tunefully join in on nineteen - seventies Swedish pop songs .
She lives there with her mother , Donna ( Meryl Streep ) , who has been running a shabby hotel for many years , and who wears dungarees to signal her lack of reliance on a man .
Long ago , however , there were plenty of men ; one crazy summer , in particular , provided three in a row .
Any one of them could have been the father of Sophie , and she , needing somebody to walk her down the aisle , has invited all three contenders to the wedding : Sam ( Pierce Brosnan ) , Harry ( Colin Firth ) , and Bill ( Stellan Skarsgård ) .
Little do they suspect the horrors that lie in store .
The script is by Catherine Johnson , who also wrote the stage play on which it is based , although “ play ” may not be the word .
It was more like a theatrical kebab , onto which she skewered as many Abba songs as humanly possible : a clever move , given that half the people in the Western world have the Abba sound stuck itchily in their ears , whether they like it or not .
The show has proved an international wow , so much so that , rather than being subtly adapted for the screen , it has been hauled there pretty much intact — along with the director , Phyllida Lloyd , who oversaw the original London production , and who has never directed a feature film before .
How else does one explain the theatrical quality of the light on the terrace of Donna ’s hotel , which has a curious apricot glaze , bearing no relation to the bright , breathable atmosphere of any known Greek island ?
The credits insist that “ Mamma Mia ! ” was filmed on Skiathos and Skopelos , yet even the exteriors have the feel of interiors , with both leads and locals behaving in ways that seem not so much clichéd as marked out and preordained .
It ’s like the Hellenic answer to “ The Truman Show . ”
To an extent , this is a hazard of the modern musical .
As audiences , we have long since fallen from that state of grace in which the sight of Debbie Reynolds bidding “ Good morning ” to Gene Kelly in song rather than in speech struck us as a natural option .
Any attempt to regain that paradise is doomed to falter .
When Julie Walters — playing a boozy friend of Donna ’s , asked along to the jamboree — suddenly declares , “ If you change your mind , ” to Stellan Skarsgård , we laugh at her presumption , though ours is not the laughter of innocence but the inferior laughter of knowingness .
We recognize the first line of Abba ’s “ Take a Chance on Me ” and duly adopt the brace position , steadying ourselves for yet another mangling of yet another hit .
The legal definition of torture has been much aired in recent years , and I take “ Mamma Mia ! ” to be a useful contribution to that debate .
In a way , the whole film is a startling twist on the black art of rendition : ordinary citizens , often unaware of their own guilt , are spirited off to a secure environment in Eastern Europe , there to be forced into a humiliating and often painful confession of sins past .
“ I tried to reach for you , but you have closed your mind , ” in the bitter words of Sam .
I thought that Pierce Brosnan had been dragged to the edge of endurance by North Korean sadists in his final Bond film , “ Die Another Day , ” but that was a quick tickle with a feather duster compared with the agony of singing Abba ’s “ S.O.S. ” to Meryl Streep through a kitchen window .
Somebody , either a cheeky Swede or another North Korean , has deliberately scored the number a tone and a half too high , with visible results : swelling muscles along the jawline , tightened throat , a panicky bulge in the eyes .
There is no delicate way of putting this , but anyone watching Brosnan in mid-delivery will conclude that he has recently suffered from a series of complex digestive problems , and that the camera has , with unfortunate timing , caught him at the exact moment when he is finally working them out .
What has he done to deserve this ?
His only crime , in truth , is that of being a good sport .
If you are an old pro at song - and - dance routines , then “ Mamma Mia ! ” will go like a breeze — as it does for Christine Baranski , who rolls up as Donna ’s wicked pal , and whose lusty , beach - bound version of “ Does Your Mother Know ? ” shames the rest of the movie .
If , on the other hand , you are a cautious and reactive performer , like Brosnan or Firth ( or like Streep herself , the mistress of watchfulness ) , you grab any chance to cut loose .
Streep has tried this before , with “ Death Becomes Her ” and “ Postcards from the Edge , ” but I am not convinced , on the strength of the new film , that life becomes her — not this relaxed brand of life , at any rate , which entails bouncing on the bed and strapping herself into thigh - high platform boots .
If this great actress is unconvincing as an old hippie , it ’s because none of us can believe she was ever a young hippie .
How , we want to know , did the French Lieutenant ’s Woman wind up jumping off the dock of the bay ?
There are , to be fair , millions of viewers who will relish the sheer unlikelihood of all this .
They will cheer on the actors ’ warbled singing , and the hobbled - donkey style of dancing , precisely because it is so amateur and shambolic — because , in short , it reminds them of themselves having a good time .
I wish I could share that contagion , but then I really saw only half the movie , having spent the other half staring down at my clenched fists and curled toes in a calvary of embarrassment .
This has nothing to do with Abba , the most hook - infested Euro pop ever devised , and I was perfectly happy — well , happy — to sit through the stage show of “ Mamma Mia ! ”
Other films , moreover , have proved surprisingly hospitable to Abba ; listen to the use of “ Dancing Queen ” in “ Muriel ’s Wedding ” ( 1994 ) , or to a Brosnan - free “ S.O.S. ” at the end of the Swedish masterpiece “ Together ” ( 2000 ) , and marvel at the force of emotion that can be wrung from the higher cheesiness .
All credit to Phyllida Lloyd , then , for piling on the songs , sometimes with barely a break ; the trouble is that , being in proud possession of a camera , she will insist on sticking it in people ’s faces as they croon .
Study any of the classic musicals , and you see how they pull away from head shots and become meditations on bodies in space and voices on the move , whereas Meryl Streep , given a windy cliff top , a red silk wrap , and “ The Winner Takes It All , ” is obliged to hold still and belt it out like Cassandra calling down ruin on Troy .
And poor Brosnan ( him again ) has to stand in the blast area and listen to her at a distance of eighteen inches , rubbing his chin thoughtfully as if to check when he last shaved .
From there we hop to the climax , to the resolution of Sophie ’s filial quandary , and to the unheralded revelation that one of her putative fathers may be gay .
Just to blur the issue , all three of them proceed to sport multicolored Lurex pants during the final credits , the better to launch into “ Waterloo ” — the song no plot could contain .
Be warned , though : you also have to watch Streep march to the front of the screen , as if to invisible footlights , and scream at us , “ Do you want more ? ” “ Thank you , but no , ” I replied , as politely as I could , but I do n’t think she heard .
Everybody around me was screaming back .
They wanted more .
Only in selected cinemas will “ Journey to the Center of the Earth ” be available in 3 - D .
Those condemned to view it in two dimensions will be left in mild bewilderment , since many details have been selected for no purpose other than the flaunting of three - dimensional oomph .
A trilobitic bug scurries on at the start and waves its enormous feelers in our direction .
That , however , is the extent of its performance , and the bug might wonder , like an ingénue asked to remove her clothes , if such exposure was artistically justified .
Next up are the yo- yo and the tape measure , both of which come zooming out of the screen , and I ca n’t help thinking of other films that would have been improved by a blast of 3 - D ; I might not have nodded off during “ The Hours , ” for example , if regularly prodded awake by the giant schnozzle of Virginia Woolf .
Brendan Fraser plays a modern - day professor named Trevor , who descends , via a volcano , into the planet ’s guts , together with Sean ( Josh Hutcherson ) , his nephew , and Hannah ( Anita Briem ) , just the sort of unattached blond Icelandic tour guide you need in these situations .
What ensues is closer to a theme ride than to a motion picture , and its dips into pensive emotion are a waste of footage .
Nobody , but nobody , in the audience will care as much about the professor ’s dead brother as about the live T. rex .
Yet most of the movie , directed by Eric Brevig , is as daft , outlandish , and speedy as it needs to be , and , for all its newfangled effects , touchingly old - fashioned in its reverence for the Jules Verne novel that inspired it .
“ It ’s all in the book ! ” the professor cries .
When did you last hear that at a theme park ? ♦
AT&T Busted For Fine Print Trickery Court says mouse print banning class action participation ' unconscionable '
Over the past few years a growing number of wireless and broadband ISPs ( AT&T , Comcast , Verizon and T - Mobile come to mind ) have been trying to erode your legal rights via fine print .
By burying legalese in your contract , carriers attempt to prevent you from participating in class action lawsuits .
Instead of allowing you your day in court , the companies require that customers participate in mandatory binding arbitration ( an outside the court settlement system where you lose most of the time ) .
However , these efforts have been having a tough time holding up in court .
Carriers faced yet another setback this week when the Washington state Supreme Court upheld an AT&T customer 's right to file a class - action lawsuit against AT&T for incorrectly charging him city utility surcharges and " usurious " late fees , according to the quote : AT&T 's Consumer Services Agreement is substantively unconscionable and therefore unenforceable to the extent that it purports to waive the right to class actions , require confidentiality , shorten the Washington Consumer Protection
Act statute of limitations , and limit availability of attorney fees .
. .
Courts will not be easily deceived by attempts to unilaterally strip away consumer protections and remedies by efforts to cloak the waiver of important rights under an arbitration clause .
The provision in your AT&T contract that requires you hand over your first born to the baby bell still stands , however .

I know a lot of lawyers and a few judges .
None of them are worried about food for lawyers ' kids .
However , some of them are worried about staying on schedule and not conducting law school classes in the courtroom on the public 's dime .
You may be the exception , but chances are if you take a blind look at 50 professional plumbing jobs and 50 amateur plumbing jobs , you 'll be able to tell pretty accurately which are which .
So what do you suppose is the result when a non-lawyer tries to do a lawyer 's job ?
About the same .
Even if you are a DIYer in all other aspects of life , unless the case is trivial and the outcome inconsequential , hiring a lawyer is usually a good idea .
You should do a bit of research on " division of labor " and its effects on standards and efficiency in society .

When fix a friends computer , I hate it when they " thought they could fix it so installed program XYZ " and it ended up making it worse .
It 's their computer and they have the right to do what they want , but it only makes things worse .
If they do n't know what they are doing , sometimes it 's better to let someone who knows what they are doing do it .
When I design / program a website , I hate it when a client tells me how exactly something needs to be done when they do n't have a clue what they are talking about .
It 's their site , and they are usually paying by the hour so if they want to pay for things to be done several times to get it done properly , they can feel free to .
But if they do n't know what they are talking about , sometimes it 's better to let someone who knows what they are doing do it .
Same thing applies to legal representation .
In many cases legal professionals have years of personal experience or have access to someone senior that does .
Legal matters are often complex and not knowing the proper way to do something can screw you in the end .
It 's not that a person can't successfully represent themselves , it 's just that it 's often too complex for a layperson to fully grasp everything that they need to quick enough so that you are n't wasting not only their own time , but also everyone else that is involved with the case as well as the other people 's other cases .
And this does n't even touch on the fact that a person that represents them self usually has a fool for a client .
People get emotionally attached to a case and do n't always see things clearly and objectively .

Jester : I do n't know where you get your facts from , but I hope it does n't come as a big surprise to you that reading comprehension is one of the most important skills in life , not just in getting through law school , without which you 'll never become a lawyer , much less a judge .
To get admitted to ANY law school ( except the online diploma mills ) you have to take the LSAT ( Law School Aptitude Test , like the college boards but 10 times harder ) .
If one 's reading comprehension is below par , they 'll never get a grade sufficient for admission to a reputable law school , in fact I doubt whether they wouldd ever rise above fry - cook at McDonalds .

How'd the LSAT work out for you ?
If you go back and read what I actually wrote , you 'll eventually realize that snipper_cr seemed to imply that the judge who wrote the opinion is " smarter than the average bear " because he was able to somehow read the AT&T policy and discern the fact that they were trying to screw customers .
Being able to read and comprehend that does n't make him smart .
It just means he can read .

Jester : actually , the LSAT worked out just fine for me , I do n't remember my score , but it was sufficient to get admitted to law school , I graduated in 1968 with a Juris Doctorate ( but you do n't have to call me Dr. ) and then passed the NY Bar Exam ( reportedly one of the toughest in the nation ) on my first shot .
While I no longer practice law , I still regard the whole experience as a valuable lesson in reading comprehension .
Does that answer your question ?
It seems to me you 're not making the distinction between reading something and comprehending what you have read .
I 'm not here to defend or accuse judges in general , but the mere fact that they went through all this process would seem to give them a leg - up on comprehension , although there are many instances where this seems to have been disregarded .
One can have training and still not use it in certain situations .
Please do n't take any part of this as a personal flame .
I do n't play that game and have been known to issue ' knock it off ' statements to those who do .

The people that do the arbitration are paid by the utilities .
They would lose their business if they found in favor of consumers .
There is probably something in the secret part of the contract that they must not find in the consumer 's favor more than 2 % of the time .

Just want to let you know I investigated the availability of alternative telco telecommunications services in my area .
There are NONE .
The only CLEC is a business line only player ; XO Communications .
Period !
The alternative to telco is COMCAST .
Which is no alternative at all .
Basic package is $ 66.00 / mo , plus taxes and un-fees , for HSI and VoIP , or HSI and CableTv , etc . .
No reliable 911 .
No battery back - up .
No servers allowed , blocked ports customary , along with usage caps , throttling of P2P , etc..
TOS just as onerous and one - sided as AT&T .
So , my only real alternative is to keep the AT&T business line , the COVAD ADSL service , and port my current telephone numbers to a VoIP provider before canceling the two AT&T residential lines I 've had for 30 + years .
A ROYAL PITA !!!
I was resigned to do so , then , yesterday , I received the new AT&T Business Services Agreement ... I will scan and post the AT&T Business Services Agreement within the hour .

Well , that took a little longer than anticipated .
Seems COVAD had some scheduled maintenance to do at my C.O. , and though they informed my ISP , Digizip , Digizip FAILED to warn me about it !!
They are 100 % consistent , having NEVER notified me re any scheduled maintenance , EVER !

Brooklyn , NY tmc8080 Member Means to an end ...
There is an answer to all of this .. if you can't accept the terms of the contract .. do n't sign it in the first place !
Yell , scream , bitch and moan right in the store that you will not sign a contract which includes binding arbitration ( or other limitation of your rights as a consumer to challenge their billing / service quality ) .
Telecom companies have had the rugs pulled out from under them with VOIP and they think they can have free access to your wallet in the cell phone industry ... well , let me tell you my friend , WIRELESS VOIP will begin to eat away at your cell phone customers too , whether or not you cripple smart phone wireless voip capability or not .
IMO , cell phones are only really good for " must carry " service such as " 911 " which must work even if a phone has no activation .
Subscribe and that 's where the major carriers have you over a barrel .
Would they even think of trying this contract crap if you were subscribing to a landline ?
Hells no .
Cellular phone service should become much cheaper than it is .. but because you have greed in the auctioning off of ( your government owned fcc property ) spectrum , greed in the companies who make handsets , greed in the companies who supply upgraded cell phone network equipment and greed upon the companies who supply service ... you have a service which should be dirt cheap by now .. but is not due to all these hands aiming for your wallet even before you walk into the store .
Sure , gasoline should be under $ 2 a gallon too , but is it ?
No .. several complicated intertwining issues cause it to be $ 3 , 4 , 5 a gallon and more .. so the real answer is , when will the price be high enough to break the backs of the consumer to finally choose alternatives in droves ?
Probably not before a major bailout of one or more of the big 3 auto makers .
I always use the adage , it 's your money before you decide to give it to them .
In a poor economy , buyers can sometimes be in the drivers seat if they form boycott coalitions against companies who play the game that plays the consumer for a fool .
AT&T is but one of these ..

Contractual terms cannot abrogate rights granted to the consumer under statute .
The reality is that there is usually only one telco provider in a given market .
As a regulated monopoly , that telco will be subject to strict statuatory requirements by the state utilities commission .
Whether you agree or not , those are the restrictions the telco accepts if they want to continue doing business in that state .

You may have statutory protections , but most such protections may be voluntarily waived , as in the case of AT&Ts new service agreement requirements .
Not content with mandatory arbitration , AT&T insists the arbitrators may not consider the application of any law outside the provisions of the terms of the AT&T Residential , or Business , Service Agreement , and limits claims to the amount of the disputed billing , or in the case of AT&Ts gross negligence , to actual , provable damages .
Punitive damages are specifically disallowed .
Right to bring a class action , or participation in class action lawsuits is specifically waived , and strictly forbidden .
A lawsuit for actual damages in amounts less than the cap on small claims in your jurisdiction may be brought in small claims court only , and punitive damages may not be claimed , or awarded .
You agree to indemnify and hold harmless AT&T , its officers , directors , employees , agents , assignees , subsidiaries , and affiliates from any and all liability for their acts , legal or illegal , past , present and future .
Not entirely correct ; AT&T has applications before the CPUC , and , I 'm sure , in other states as well , to remove it from TARIFF and PUC regulation in consideration of the non-existent , purely fictional new " competitive " market for telecommunications they contend exists .
They intend to set rates with minimal federal , and no state , interference in the future .
Read the new service agreements , and you will find the Guide Book will define Plan features and Plan rates in the future .
The " Real Plan " is to be 100 % free from regulation , period .
AT&T has changed the contract terms for all residential and small business services .
Read the documents I posted , they are the new service agreements everyone will be subject to upon September payment in advance for October service , or on Oct. 1 , 2008 , whichever comes first .

No competing landline carrier I received my new ATT fine - print contract in the mail this month with the compelled arbitration clause .
If I do n't like the new contract my choices are 1 - keep my landline and shut up ; 2 - cancel my service and go elsewhere .
I 've been a Pac Bell customer at this residence for the last 17 years .
It was n't my choice to be bought out by the death star and have these restrictive , and seems now illegal , contract terms forced on me .
There is no landline CLEC in this area , but there is cable phone service which IMO is not equivalent .
Although the court case was in WA not in my home state of CA i'm happy to see that ATT was knocked down a notch in some small way .
As I understand it two parties cannot enter into a contract to agree to overlook rights granted to the parties by statute , or to do some act that is against the law .

Really it does n't quite work that way .
But until they 're challenged on it , it 'll stand .
Pretty much SOP .
Just like a company who tries to get you to sign non-compete sorry you can't work in your industry if you leave us for 6 mos crap when your state specifically forbids such actions .
What I 'm surprised I have n't seen much of in this thread yet are the " you can always change carriers " people .
They usually come out in droves for this type of thing .
Oh and then the " consumer just does n't want to pay " crowd .
They 're usually in this talk too .
Really what it comes down to is AT&T or any other carrier will embed pretty well whatever they like into the ToS until challenged otherwise .
Since the services agreement is supposedly seen as a binding contract they think they can ask for whatever they like and if you agree you 're screwed .
Really it does n't quite work that way .
But until they 're challenged on it , it 'll stand .
Pretty much SOP .
Just like a company who tries to get you to sign non-compete sorry you can't work in your industry if you leave us for 6 mos crap when your state specifically forbids such actions .
What I 'm surprised I have n't seen much of in this thread yet are the " you can always change carriers " people .
They usually come out in droves for this type of thing .
Oh and then the " consumer just does n't want to pay " crowd .
They 're usually in this talk too .

High Court ruling may delay war crimes trials
By MARK SHERMAN
Associated Press Writer
WASHINGTON ( AP ) —
The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that foreign terrorism suspects held at Guantanamo Bay have rights under the Constitution to challenge their detention in U.S. civilian courts .
In its third rebuke of the Bush administration ’s treatment of prisoners , the court ruled 5 - 4 that the government is violating the rights of prisoners being held indefinitely and without charges at the U.S. naval base in Cuba .
The court ’s liberal justices were in the majority .
Justice Anthony Kennedy , writing for the court , said , “ The laws and Constitution are designed to survive , and remain in force , in extraordinary times . ”
Kennedy said federal judges could ultimately order some detainees to be released , but that such orders would depend on security concerns and other circumstances .
The White House had no immediate comment on the ruling .
White House press secretary Dana Perino , traveling with President Bush in Rome , said the administration was reviewing the opinion .
It was not immediately clear whether this ruling , unlike the first two , would lead to prompt hearings for the detainees , some of whom have been held more than 6 years .
Roughly 270 men remain at the island prison , classified as enemy combatants and held on suspicion of terrorism or links to al - Qaida and the Taliban .
The ruling could resurrect many detainee lawsuits that federal judges in Washington put on hold pending the outcome of the high court case .
The decision sent judges , law clerks and court administrators scrambling to read Kennedy ’s 70 - page opinion and figure out how to proceed .
Chief Judge Royce C. Lamberth said he would call a special meeting of federal judges to address how to handle the cases .
The decision also cast doubt on the future of the military war crimes trials that 19 detainees are facing so far .
The Pentagon has said it plans to try as many as 80 men held at Guantanamo .
The lawyer for Salim Ahmed Hamdan , Osama bin Laden ’s one - time driver , said he will seek dismissal of the charges against Hamdan based on Thursday ’s ruling .
A military judge had already delayed the trial ’s start to await the high court ruling .
The administration opened the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay shortly after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks to hold enemy combatants , people suspected of ties to al - Qaida or the Taliban .
The Guantanamo prison has been harshly criticized at home and abroad for the detentions themselves and the aggressive interrogations that were conducted there .
The court said not only that the detainees have rights under the Constitution , but that the system the administration has put in place to classify them as enemy combatants and review those decisions is inadequate .
The administration had argued first that the detainees have no rights .
But it also contended that the classification and review process was a sufficient substitute for the civilian court hearings that the detainees seek .
In dissent , Chief Justice John Roberts criticized his colleagues for striking down what he called “ the most generous set of procedural protections ever afforded aliens detained by this country as enemy combatants . ”
Justices Samuel Alito , Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas also dissented .
Scalia said the nation is “ at war with radical Islamists ” and that the court ’s decision “ will make the war harder on us .
It will almost certainly cause more Americans to be killed . ”
Justices Stephen Breyer , Ruth Bader Ginsburg , David Souter and John Paul Stevens joined Kennedy to form the majority .
Souter wrote a separate opinion in which he emphasized the length of the detentions .
“ A second fact insufficiently appreciated by the dissents is the length of the disputed imprisonments , some of the prisoners represented here today having been locked up for six years , ” Souter said .
“ Hence the hollow ring when the dissenters suggest that the court is somehow precipitating the judiciary into reviewing claims that the military … could handle within some reasonable period of time . ”
The court has ruled twice previously that people held at Guantanamo without charges can go into civilian courts to ask that the government justify their continued detention .
Each time , the administration and Congress , then controlled by Republicans , changed the law to try to close the courthouse doors to the detainees .
The court specifically struck down a provision of the Military Commissions
Act of 2006 that denies Guantanamo detainees the right to file petition of habeas corpus .
Habeas corpus is a centuries - old legal principle , enshrined in the Constitution , that allows courts to determine whether a prisoner is being held illegally .
The head of the New York - based Center for Constitutional Rights , which represents dozens of prisoners at Guantanamo , welcomed the ruling .
“ The Supreme Court has finally brought an end to one of our nation ’s most egregious injustices , ” said CCR Executive Director Vincent Warren .
“ By granting the writ of habeas corpus , the Supreme Court recognizes a rule of law established hundreds of years ago and essential to American jurisprudence since our nation ’s founding . ”
Five alleged plotters of the Sept. 11 attacks appeared in a Guantanamo courtroom last week for a hearing before their war crimes trial , which prosecutors hope will start Sept. 15 .
Navy Cmdr. Jeffrey Gordon , a Pentagon spokesman , said he had no immediate information whether a hearing at Guantanamo for Canadian Omar Khadr , charged with killing a U.S. Special Forces soldier in Afghanistan , would go forward next week as planned .
Bush has said he wants to close the facility once countries can be found to take the prisoners who are there .
Presidential candidates John McCain and Barack Obama also support shutting down the prison .

Cincinnati , OH , August 13 , 2008 — Dairy is recognized as a key component of a healthy , balanced diet .
However , until recently it was unclear how long - term dairy intake contributes to the many aspects of bone health in children , including bone density , bone mineral content , and bone area .
A new study soon to be published in The Journal of Pediatrics investigates the effect of childhood dairy intake on adolescent bone health .
Dr. Lynn Moore and colleagues from Boston University School of Medicine analyzed data from the Framingham Children 's Study in an effort to understand the relationship between childhood dairy intake and adolescent bone health .
The researchers gathered information from 106 children , 3 to 5 years of age at the beginning of the study , over a 12 - year period .
The families enrolled in the study were given food diaries to complete for the child and were asked to record everything the child ate and drank for several days each year .
The researchers used these diaries , along with information from the United States Department of Agriculture , to calculate the children 's average daily intake of dairy and other foods .
At the end of the 12 - year period , the authors assessed the bone health of the now adolescent study participants .
They found that the adolescents who had consumed 2 or more servings of dairy per day as children had higher levels of bone mineral content and bone density .
Even after adjusting for factors that affect normal bone development , including the child 's growth , body size , and activity level , the authors found that these adolescents ' average bone mineral content was 175 grams higher than the adolescents who had consumed less than 2 servings of dairy per day .
The researchers also evaluated the combined effects of dairy and other foods consumed by the study participants .
According to Dr. Moore , " Children who consumed 2 or more servings of dairy and 4 ounces of meat or other nondairy protein had bone mineral contents over 300 grams higher than those children with lower intakes of both dairy and other proteins . "
The study highlights the importance of dairy intake throughout childhood , and Dr. Moore points out that " dairy is a key source of proteins , calcium , and other micronutrients including phosphorus and vitamin D. "
Parents can promote healthy bone development during adolescence by making dairy a regular part of their child 's diet .

A spokesman for Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has rejected Western criticism of the country 's disputed presidential run-off election .
At an African Union summit in Egypt , George Charamba said the West had no basis to speak about the situation - and can " go hang a thousand times " .
Zanu - PF's Robert Mugabe said he had won the vote , boycotted by the opposition .
The opposition MDC said Friday 's one - man election had killed off any prospect of a negotiated settlement .
Tendai Biti , the Movement for Democratic Change 's secretary - general who faces treason charges in Zimbabwe , said the country 's " sham election " last week " totally and completely exterminated any prospect of a negotiated settlement " .
He denied any negotiations were going on between the two parties , or that an agreement was in the offing .
" There are recent widespread reports that Zanu - PF and MDC are talking and are about to conclude an agreement to form a government of national unity , " said Mr Biti .
" Nothing could be as malicious and as further from the truth . "
The run -off was widely criticised by Western leaders as not being free or fair .
' Evolving dialogue ' Earlier , opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai left the Dutch embassy in Harare , where he had taken refuge after pulling out of Friday 's vote because of election violence .
He had decided the situation was calm enough to return home , the Dutch foreign ministry official said .
One of them grabbed my arm and flung me to the ground ...
They dragged me by my hair to where my husband was lying

African leaders ' discomfort Zimbabwe : Possible scenarios Inside Mugabe 's mind Mr Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) says he won the presidential election outright in March , but government officials said he did not secure enough votes to avoid a run-off .
Briefing reporters on the fringes of the Sharm el - Sheikh summit , Mr Charamba was asked whether Zimbabwe should follow Kenya and create a government of national unity .
" Kenya is Kenya .
Zimbabwe is Zimbabwe , " he responded .
" We have our own history of evolving dialogue and resolving political impasses the Zimbabwean way .
The Zimbabwean way , not the Kenyan way .
Not at all . "
Leaders taking part in the AU summit in Sharm el - Sheikh are discussing a draft resolution calling for a Zimbabwean government of national unity , Reuters news agency reports .
' Denied rights '
African leaders have faced growing pressure to take a strong stand against Zimbabwe 's president .
Mr Tsvangirai was arrested several times ahead of the run- off Sierra Leonean President Ernest Koroma told the BBC he strongly condemned Zimbabwe 's flawed electoral process .
" We believe the people of Zimbabwe have been denied their democratic rights , " he said .
Mr Koroma expressed support for a South African initiative to encourage the formation of a transitional government of national unity .
" We would urge the South African group to ensure they engage both parties to form a transitional government that prepares Zimbabwe for fresh elections . "
Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga urged the AU to suspend Mr Mugabe until he allowed free and fair elections .
But Africa 's longest serving leader , Gabon President Omar Bongo , said Mr Mugabe should be accepted as the country 's elected president .
Botswana 's Foreign Minister Phandu Skelemani suggested an interim national unity government could pave the way for new elections .
" We think there should be a way forward where both Mugabe and Tsvangirai will be brought together so that they can talk and hopefully form a government of national unity which will be understood to be interim and to prepare for elections , " he said .
Farmers beaten
The US has outlined a draft Security Council resolution calling for sanctions on Zimbabwe and Italy has recalled its ambassador to the country for consultations .

In Zimbabwe , meanwhile , an elderly farmer , his wife and their son - in - law were found alive but badly beaten on Monday .
Mike Campbell , 75 , his wife Angela , 66 and Ben Freeth had been kidnapped at gunpoint from their Harare farm by a heavily armed mob on Sunday .
When they were found , Mr Campbell had concussion and a broken collar - bone , one of his wife 's arms was broken in two places , and Mr Freeth had been beaten on the soles of his feet .
Mrs Campbell said a mob of Zanu - PF supporters had attacked her with sticks , just as Mr Mugabe was being re-inaugurated as Zimbabwe 's president .
" One of them grabbed my arm and flung me to the ground , hence I have a rather serious break in my upper arm , " she said .
" They dragged me by my hair to where my husband was lying and they trussed us up with ropes lying on the gravel . "
A friend of the family said the Campbells had been forced to sign a document withdrawing an appeal against the seizure of his farm .
' No threat ' Earlier , Zimbabwe 's ambassador to the UN dismissed calls for sanctions against his country over pre-election violence .
HAVE YOUR SAY Mugabe should be isolated and suspended from the AU Joe , Malawi Boniface Chidyausiku dubbed US - led calls for fresh UN measures against Zimbabwe a " non-issue " .
Asked about sanctions , Mr Chidyausiku told AP news agency : " I 'm not even bothered , I would n't lose sleep over it ...
We are not a threat to international peace and security . "
Mr Tsvangirai defeated Mr Mugabe in the presidential vote on 29 March but failed to win an absolute majority .
He reluctantly agreed to participate in the 27 June run-off but withdrew blaming violence which he said had killed nearly 90 of his followers .

All rights reserved A Primer on the Silver Basis Gold Standard University aefekete@hotmail.com
I started writing this piece as the sub - prime crisis was unfolding .
I wanted to establish the connection between the silver basis and the budding banking crisis caused by phony bond insurance schemes and the lack of hedging irredeemable dollar debt with metal holdings .
My original title was Putting Clothes on the Naked Bogeyman .
As writing progressed I realized that it would take more than one article to dress up the bogeyman ; hence the revised title .
Trading hedged corn
When I tell my audience at Gold Standard University Live that huge quantities of commodities are bought and sold every day without any reference to the price , my words are received with an incredulous silence .
It appears incredible to the uninitiated that the price risk can be neatly side - stepped .
I have to explain to my listeners that when the professional grain trader gives an order to buy or sell corn , he may be unaware whether the price of corn is up or down .
He doesn�t care .
He is buying and selling hedged corn , and he takes his clues from the basis , not the price of corn itself .
He has replaced price risk with basis risk which he knows how to handle as its behavior is less erratic and more predictable .
Most people don�t realize that the bulk of grain trading on the futures markets is driven not by the price but by the basis .
In the grain market by basis is meant the difference between the futures price and the local cash price of the grain .
Thus the basis varies from place to place , and from one delivery month to another .
Trading the basis means buying or selling hedged grain .
The merchant goes long on the basis by purchasing hedged grain when the basis is wide , and selling it when the basis is narrow ( possibly negative ) .
He goes short on the basis by selling hedged grain first when the basis is narrow ( possibly negative ) , and selling it later when the basis is wide .
The myth of naked shorts
The silver market is similar .
Large quantities of silver are bought and sold every day without reference to the price .
Professionals trade hedged silver on clues from the silver basis .
They are not gambling on the price variation of silver : they want to earn a reliable income on physical silver already in store .
They may do this on their own account or , more typically , on customer account .
The ever growing inordinate and concentrated naked short position in the face of a strongly rising price is a myth .
I defined silver basis in my earlier articles as the difference between the nearest futures price and the cash price of silver ( see references ) .
It is puerile to assume that most professional traders are naked short in silver , just as it would be sheer ignorance to suggest that most professional traders of grain are naked short in corn .
They are not .
You may rest assured that their corn is well in place in a grain elevator somewhere .
If the elevator is registered with the commodity exchange , then the hedger may post a reduced margin on his position .
But the elevator need not be registered , in which case the hedger posts full margin .
While this is not typical in the grain trade , it is quite common in the silver trade .
Rightly of wrongly , the silver trade is surrounded with far more secrecy than the grain trade .
This has to do with the fact that silver is considered a monetary commodity by many in the first place , and an industrial commodity only in the second .
We must understand that lots of people are accumulating silver not so much for the ride to $ 1000 , which may or may not happen , but in protest against low interest rates on passbook savings and certificates of deposit .
They are happy to post full margin instead of the lower hedge margin on their short position in silver in exchange for anonymity .
Of course , the exchange knows that theirs is a hedge position , but must treat this information as confidential .
So must the C.F.T.C. Let �s start by reviewing the differences between the grain and silver trade .
As most grain is sold to the ultimate consumer within the year of production , the basis has a yearly cycle with trough just before and peak just after harvest .
By contrast , the silver basis is not cyclic .
Silver is typically accumulated year after year by investors and bullion banks .
Instead of an annual cycle following the crop year , the silver basis has a long - term falling trend , a strong hint of a slowly developing shortage .
It is impossible to predict when shortage will hit .
After every major price advance there is profit - taking by unhedged investors , and after every major price decline there is short covering by hedged investors and bullion banks .
Net selling through profit - taking and net buying through short covering may or may not balance out .
Accordingly , the trend towards a permanent silver shortage is going to be uneven .
Historical sketch of the grain trade Farmers produce billions of bushels of grain every year .
Most of this grain is sold several times in the futures markets as part of the basis - trading before it is consumed .
An understanding of the historical development of the futures markets may be helpful .
Standardized futures contracts began trading on commodity exchanges in the late 1800�s .
Futures markets revolutionized the way cash grain was traded and gave the grain elevators and the farmers the ability to buy and sell more easily and profitably .
Grain companies learned how to use futures contracts more effectively to manage risks , and to maximize income from their elevators .
The big revolution was the advent of basis - trading , to replace price - trading .
This revolution is not mentioned in school curricula ; not even in university curricula .
This is a pity .
The story of basis trading is a story of capitalism triumphant .
It teaches how the free market can overcome the capriciousness of nature .
As more and more people learn the skills of basis trading , profitability grows and business expands .
The grain business prospered until the 1930�s when the Great Depression began and governments became heavily involved in grain trading .
Government programs dominated the marketplace .
Storage of grain was encouraged and construction of new elevators was subsidized .
However , the market was stagnant , to a large extent precisely because the new elevator space was taken up by government - owned grain .
This grain was just sitting there in the elevators , until it was ultimately given away to other governments or to charities .
In the 1970�s governments decided to reduce their presence in the grain market .
A new era started when market forces were allowed to prevail once more .
The grain business re-learnt how to increase efficiency , manage risks , and generate income through basis trading .
Generally , the abundance of grain kept the market stable .
Under these conditions the opportunity for trading was confined to buying and holding grain .
This is known as the �carry trade� : buying when the basis is at its highest and selling when it is at its lowest .
The basis was following a consistent pattern and as it declined from harvest to the end of the crop - year , the grain trade was provided with a reliable income .
It would take a sizeable drop in production to cause any significant move in the price and a deviation of the basis from the customary pattern .
While it did not happen very often , the market came away with the flying colors proving the superiority of trading the basis over trading the price especially under volatile conditions .
The 21st century brought new challenges to the grain trade .
The market became demand - driven .
Increasing population and improved living standards around the world opened up markets to more people and boosted demand for processed food and other consumer products .
There has been a tremendous growth during this first decade of the century .
In addition to the carry trade , �value added trade� has put in an appearance and started growing .
In this environment grain does not sit around in elevators for a long period of time .
The market absorbs it and makes it into all kinds of products for human and animal consumption .
Most recently grain has started trading also for use in energy production .
All these changes contributed positively to basis trading as it has changed the dynamics of the marketplace .
Of course , not all grain traders are trading basis .
A dwindling number still trade price .
Most of these traders are barely surviving .
They will have to learn the skills of basis trading , or perish .
It is a safe bet that no new grain elevator is being built with trading the price in mind .
They are built with trading the basis in mind .
Those who are still trading price are missing one of the great opportunities of the century by not understanding basis .
Historical sketch of the silver trade Second only to gold , silver is a monetary metal .
This means that above ground silver represents several years � output of the mines .
One should not be misled by the propaganda line that this silver �has been consumed by industrial applications � .
The recovery of scrap silver is a function of the price .
As the price of silver rises , the rate of recovery will rise with it , sometimes dramatically .
In addition , an unknown but substantial amount of silver still exists in monetary form .
Owners do not want to reveal their identity , or the size of their hoard .
But this does not mean that monetary silver has disappeared in consumption .
There is no support for the claim that silver is in short supply , or that silver has ceased to be a monetary metal .
Any apparent shortage simply means that the carry trade holds back stocks from the market in hope of an early price advance .
At the right price it will make the metal available .
Prior to 1873 the price of silver was stabilized through monetary legislation at $ 1.29 per oz .
After the Civil War the U.S. Mint was closed to silver .
The German government also closed its Mint to silver in the wake of the Prussian victory over France about the same time .
Silver was dumped in the markets in unprecedented amounts , driving the price down to as low as 70 cents by the end of the 19th century .
Although the price spiked back to $ 1.29 at the end of World War I , it did not last and during the Great Depression it hit a low of 25 cents .
We may add that upheavals in the silver market were a direct consequence of government meddling .
Ultimately people have learnt how to neutralize the destructive influence of the government in an effort to control money , and they borrowed a leaf from grain merchandising manuals in trading the silver basis .
Through all this time up to 1965 there was no silver trading on the organized commodity exchanges for reasons of insufficient volatility .
By 1965 the world market price threatened to exceed the statutory price , as demonstrated by the disappearance of silver coinage from circulation , and volatility perked up .
Silver trading on the organized commodity exchanges started .
However , secrecy continued to surround the silver trade as one monetary crises followed another at more or less regular intervals .
There was a conception that silver could also be confiscated as gold was in 1933 .
In the event , the ban on gold ownership and trading was lifted in the U.S. at the end of 1975 , allowing gold futures trading to start and giving a boost to silver futures trading already in progress .
Secrecy prevailed and manuals on how to trade basis in the gold and silver markets were never made public .
Those anxious to learn basis trading of the monetary metals had to buy the manuals for basis trading in grains , and work it out for silver and gold on their own .
This is not as easy as as it sounds , because of pitfalls due to the fact that trading monetary metals differs from trading grains in almost every respect .
Having said that , there is no question that basis trading in gold and silver is a wide - spread practice preferred by the most conservative investors , and even the more venturesome cannot do without at least a rudimentary understanding of the underlying principles .
We have mentioned above that trading the basis for grain instead of trading the price was a triumph of capitalism .
Man has learned how to overcome the capriciousness of nature .
The same also happened in the silver market : trading the silver basis increasingly replaced the trading of the silver price .
The difference is that here it was not the capriciousness of nature but the capriciousness of governments that has been overcome .
Governments want you to believe that they can create and destroy value at will by monetizing debt while demonetizing silver and gold .
In effect they can not do either in a durable way .
Government magic goes only so far as gullibility of the people .
Gold Standard University
Live is a world leader in offering regular panel discussions and primers on basis trading of the monetary metals .
There are plans to run workshops as well on basis trading .
The next session is scheduled from July 3 through 6 at the Martineum Academy in Szombathely , Hungary , to be followed by a session in Canberra , Australia in November ( see Announcement at the end of this article ) .
The Last Contango in Washington Volatility in the gold and silver markets is like a dormant volcano .
Unannounced , it erupts periodically with increasing ferocity .
As it does , trading the gold and silver price is becoming ever more treacherous .
There can be no doubt that the answer is basis trading , that is , buying and selling hedged gold and silver .
It is only a matter of time before a trading house or bullion bank will offer this service .
The significance of the silver and gold basis can be found in the role they play as an early warning system .
Under normal circumstances backwardation in gold and silver is an aberration .
Monetary metals must be sufficiently plentiful in order to serve as such .
This translates into contango .
But at the time of monetary disturbances , like the one triggered by the sub - prime mortgage crisis , the monetary metals tend to go into hiding .
As they do , the cash price goes to a premium against futures prices , and the basis goes negative , indicating the extent of scarcity .
If hyperinflation is in store , gold will go into permanent backwardation , foreshadowed by a steep decline in the basis .
In an earlier article I have , somewhat flippantly , described this momentuous paradigm - shift as � the last contango in Washington � ( with a bow to the movie The last tango in Paris . )
The historic contango of gold will give way to permanent backwardation .
It will mean that gold is not for sale at any price ― not against the irredeemable dollar .
Note that while the gold price is open to government manipulation , the gold basis can not be so easily falsified .
It reflects the truth as it is .
The basis never lies .
Canary in the coal mine According to one hypothesis , permanent backwardation in silver will precede that in gold .
Thus silver is the �canary in the coal mine� .
But you have to have ears to hear the canary sing .
In other words , you must be able to read the message carried by the silver basis .
If deflation and depression is in store , then the case for silver is not so clear - cut , in view of silver�s extensive industrial applications .
It is possible that silver will be dumped by investors fearing that industrial demand is vanishing .
But again , it is also possible that the rush into gold , a regular feature of depressions , will spill over as a rush into silver .
Whatever happens , the silver basis will provide a reliable early warning sign .
The return of contango in silver is an indication that bullion banks are dumping silver .
Continued backwardation is an indication that investors and bullion banks are still accumulating silver .
Investors and traders would do well to learn all they can about the silver basis to be able to interpret events correctly as they unfold , even if they never intend to trade the silver basis .
The inordinate size of the short commitment of traders indicate that bullion banks actively trade the silver basis .
Among their customers are wealthy investors and , possibly , governments or government agencies .
C.F.T.C. investigators insist that there is no market manipulation in silver .
I am willing to take their word at face value .
Basis trading is not a market manipulation , even if done on a large scale .
It is dynamic hedging , and hedging is just what the futures markets are for .
While futures trading would not work without an adequate speculative following , it is not primarily for the benefit of the speculators .
It is for the benefit of the hedgers .
Speculators are supposed to know this and they should stop crying �foul play !�
What is seen and what is not seen
Those who hold that there is market manipulation are victims of an optical illusion .
What appears as an oversize naked short position involving no more than eight trading houses or bullion banks , is just the visible side of basis trading in silver .
But there is another , invisible side as well .
The invisible side is hedged metal in private hoards , in the reserves of bullion banks and , possibly , in secret government depositories .
It is well - known , for example , that the Chinese government controls large stores of silver , remnants of the long - lasting silver standard in China .
A lot of the silver that governments and private individuals dumped in the West after the 1873 demonetization found its way to the East , where the Chinese Mint was still open to silver .
At that time China offered the only unlimited market for silver .
There is some controversy about the question whether silver was flowing into or out of China between 1934 and 1949 .
Be that as it may , after the overthrow of the Nationalist government the Chinese Communists inherited untold amounts of silver .
If there was an outflow of silver from China before the Communist takeover , it certainly stopped after 1949 .
Chinese hedges are no Texas hedges
It is a plausible assumption that the wily Chinese presently trade the silver basis under a seal of secrecy .
Some of the world�s largest banks are in China , and they definitely have bullion trading desks .
Unlike their opposite numbers in Japan and the West the Chinese banks are not brain - dead .
While they also have a large portfolio of dollar - denominated assets , they are probably fully hedged by their holdings of silver and gold .
The Chinese banks don�t have to carry the ideological baggage of anti-gold mentality , so prevalent in the United States .
Their financial condition is incomparably superior to that of banks in the dollar orbit .
In order to understand the silver saga it is important that we put ourselves into the Chinese mindset .
For the Chinese silver is money , and the US dollar is a dishonored promise .
They see no reason to exchange their silver for paper , of which they already have more than their fill .
Their perspective on the market is entirely different from that of silver investors in the West .
Their participation in the silver market is motivated by their desire to earn a return on their holding of silver in silver .
A price explosion would frustrate their strategy .
They don�t want a supply shock in silver .
On occasion they have to pacify the restless silver market through selling , with the idea of buying the material back , preferably at a better price .
This is not naked short selling ; this is dynamic hedging .
No crusade of the �insanely bullish� can reclassify it as market manipulation .
The difference between the Chinese banks and their Japanese and Western counterparts is that the Chinese hedge paper with metal , while the Japanese and their American mentors hedge paper with paper .
Theirs are Texas hedges ( with reference to the anecdotal rancher who hedges his herd with long live cattle futures contracts ) .
Silver basis and the banking crisis
The present banking crisis necessitating unprecedented bailouts of multinational banks is not unrelated to silver basis trading .
By now it is clear that the cause of the crisis is the banks � inordinate portfolio of assets concentrated in debt denominated in the irredeemable dollar , unhedged by gold and silver .
By contrast the Chinese banks , which also have large dollar assets , are hedged in metal .
The Chinese banks are in no need of a bailout .
So much for diagnosis .
The prognosis : more bank failures in the West and in Japan ; further relative strengthening of banks in China .
It is unreasonable to expect that exchange officials and C.F.T.C. investigators disclose the hedging activities of bullion banks , Chinese or otherwise .
I repeat , trading the silver basis is not market manipulation .
The high concentration of short positions is due to the fact that governments and wealthy individuals wanting to earn a return on their silver holdings prefer to take their business to a select few trading houses and bullion banks with the necessary expertise and capital to trade the silver basis on a large scale .
This offers them the best chance to preserve anonymity .
The sluggishness of silver deliveries is explained by the long lines of communication .
It takes time to get the silver from the East for delivery in the West .
One should not read imaginary shortages into this .
Presently silver is not in short supply .
If it were , silver could not drop in price as much as $ 5 an ounce or 25 percent in a matter of days , and continue trading at the lower end of the range .
Paradoxically , sluggishness of deliveries is the very proof that there is no corner in the offing ― not yet .
If there were , the metal would move from East to West in supersonic aircrafts .
The best little warehouse in Comex I strongly disagree with the tactics of Comex in putting a limit on long positions in silver and on silver deliveries , which looks like an admission that there is a shortage .
Silver in approved warehouses is there to be delivered on demand .
Let the chips fall where they may , and let�s see what the market will do if the last bar of silver is removed from the warehouses .
Limit on deliveries does not prove shortage ; it only proves that the exchange is inefficient and does not favor transparency .
In limiting delivery it undermines its own usefulness .
The exchange should oblige hedgers to keep sufficient silver in the warehouses ready for delivery at all times , in return for protection of their privacy .
Failure to comply should be penalized with margin call on short hedge positions , possibly higher than the value of the underlying contract .
This would enhance the credibility of the exchange more than anything else .
As it is , the best little warehouse in Comex is for window - dressing only .
For serious business , such as you know what , you had better go to another warehouse .
Bleeding to death in the bull ring
It is not in the interest of wealthy individuals , bullion banks , and governments with large stockpiles of silver that the price go to $ 100 overnight , which could happen if secrecy were breached and anonymity blown away .
As they can derive an income from their silver holdings already , these owners of silver prefer a controlled rise in the price .
And that �s exactly what we�ve got .
Failure to understand this may lead one to all kinds of superstitious beliefs concerning the power of the bullion banks to manipulate the price of silver .
The panicky short covering predicted when silver was trading below $ 5 never materialized during the run to $ 20 and higher .
There has been and will be a lot of short covering , but nothing what could be called a short squeeze .
Not until the curtain falls on the Last Contango in Washington .
As a quick back - of - the - envelope calculation shows , if the naked silver bogeyman were real , he would have by now lost an arm and a leg after losing his shirt .
He would have bled to death in the bullfight .
Let�s be generous and admit that he does have , at the very least , well , a loin - cloth to wear in confronting the charging bull .

French Open Transcript : Harkleroad to Appear in Playboy
by Staff
Q. I know this is a really weird segue , but ESPN TV reported today that you posed for Playboy .
ASHLEY HARKLEROAD : Right .
Q . When did that happen ?
ASHLEY HARKLEROAD : I got — I did that a few weeks ago while I was out , so I ’ll just be in the August edition .
Q. Can I just say wow ?
ASHLEY HARKLEROAD : Yeah .
You can say whatever you want ( laughing ) .
Q. You went through surgery and then posed for Playboy ?
ASHLEY HARKLEROAD : Yeah .
Like , I do n’t know , I was just laying there for three weeks , and , you know , an offer came to me .
I thought ,
Well , I ’m not really doing anything right now .
So I thought about it , and , you know , it was something that I did .
I ’m proud of my body .
I was representing a female athlete ’s body , you know .
Like Amanda Beard would have done , so , yeah .
Q. I guess the thing that people might be curious about is you had just had surgery , fairly traumatic surgery , so you might not have been in maybe tip top shape .
ASHLEY HARKLEROAD : Actually , I was like super thin , you know .
I was like thinner than I probably would have been like muscle wise .
But we did it in a course of like four different days , so I was working out like a week .
My body was actually getting back to more muscular .
But , see , when I do n’t play tennis I lose all my muscle , so I become like a size smaller in jeans and everything like that .
But at the same time , you know , there was really nothing .
I was n’t really doing anything , and like I said , the offer came to me and I thought about it and decided that I would do it .
Q . Are you like the Playmate for the month , or is this just a separate thing with sort of the scope of it ?
ASHLEY HARKLEROAD : I do n’t know .
I mean , you just , like , check it out .
I think it comes out July 13th .
It ’s the August edition .
So you ’ll see for yourself .
It ’s no big deal to me .
But , you know , just that ’s really all I can really say , you know .
Q . Are you part of the feature with women athletes or something , or is it just you ?
ASHLEY HARKLEROAD : Sometimes they put athletes in there .
Like Amanda Beard , like I said or Gabriella Reece .
So I ’ll be the first tennis player ever .
That ’s kind of cool .
Q. Most of us do n’t get that offer .
Speaking for myself , anyway , in case you could n’t tell .
But what kind of experience was that ?
I mean , interesting or different thing to do ?
What was it like ?
Play ?
Hard work ?
ASHLEY HARKLEROAD :
It was hard work , but , you know , it was just a completely different experience .
It was fun .
Q. Where did you do it ?
ASHLEY HARKLEROAD : L.A .
Q. Where in L.A. was it ?
What was the venue ?
ASHLEY HARKLEROAD : Just a few different places .
They set up a few different places here and there in L.A .
Q. Indoors ?
Outdoors ?
ASHLEY HARKLEROAD :
Two times outdoors , one time indoors .
Q. With water , no water ?
ASHLEY HARKLEROAD : No .
You know , just , you know , check it out .
July 13th it comes out , I think .
Something like that , July 11 or July 13 .
It ’s the August edition , so …
Q. I mean , Ashley , you ’re weighing the pros and cons of doing that .
Can you talk about what you thought the pros were and what the cons would be ?
ASHLEY HARKLEROAD :
You know , there ’s a few reasons why I did it , but I ca n’t really go into it right now .
You know , you can read it and you ’ll understand probably more .
But like I said , I really did n’t think it was that big of a deal , you know .
I ’m proud of my body .
I stay in shape and try to stay fit , so like I said , I ’m just trying to represent a female athlete and her body .
That can be sexy too , you know .
Q. With all due respect , because I heard you talk about this last year , having your career and earnings and money , is money a factor in something like that ?
ASHLEY HARKLEROAD : I mean , Playboy treated me well , you know .
Q . But it was n’t a determining factor ?
They did n’t say , We ’re going to give you all sorts of money , and you said , Yeah , I ’ve got to go ?
ASHLEY HARKLEROAD :
There were pros and cons that I had to deal with , and I took a few days to figure out exactly what I wanted to do and how I wanted to go about it .
So , like I said , they treated me well , and it was a fun experience .
You know , you can — it ’s really no big deal .
It comes out in July , so .
Q. It ’s a two parter .
ASHLEY HARKLEROAD : Okay ( laughing ) .
Q. I have to ask , because the men wo n’t .
Were you clothed at all ?
ASHLEY HARKLEROAD : Uh huh .
I was , sometimes ( laughing ) .
You know , it ’s Playboy .
It ’s very classy , so …
Presidential candidate wants domestic “ security force ” as powerful as U.S. military , columnist compares proposal to Hitler Youth
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet
Thursday , July 17 , 2008
Presidential frontrunner Barack Obama has called for a “ civilian national security force ” as powerful as the U.S. military , comments that were ignored by the vast majority of the corporate media but compared by one journalist to the Nazi Hitler Youth .
“ We can not continue to rely on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives we ’ve set .
We ’ve got to have a civilian national security force that ’s just as powerful , just as strong , just as well - funded , ” Obama told a Colorado Springs audience earlier this month .
World Net Daily editor Joseph Farah asked if he was the only journalist in America who found Obama ’s statement troubling .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
“ If we ’re going to create some kind of national police force as big , powerful and well - funded as our combined U.S. military forces , is n’t this rather a big deal ? ” wrote Farah .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
“ Are we talking about creating a police state here ?
The U.S. Army alone has nearly 500,000 troops .
That does n’t count reserves or National Guard .
In 2007 , the U.S. Defense budget was $ 439 billion .
Is Obama serious about creating some kind of domestic security force bigger and more expensive than that ?
If not , why did he say it ?
What did he mean ? ”
KnoxNews.com is seemingly the only other media outlet to express interest in exactly what Obama is proposing .
“ The statement was made in the context of youth service .
Is this an organization for just the youth or are adults going to participate ?
How does one get away from the specter of other such “ youth ” organizations from Nazi Germany and the former Soviet Union when talking about it ? ” wrote Michael Silence .
Obama ’s proposal smacks of an expanded version of an existing program in which hundreds of police , firefighters , paramedics and utility workers have been trained and recently dispatched as “ Terrorism Liaison Officers ” in Colorado , Arizona and California to watch for “ suspicious activity ” which is later fed into a secret government database .
It is also reminiscent of the supposedly canned 2002 Operation TIPS program , which would have turned 4 per cent of Americans into informants under the jurisdiction of the Justice Department .
TIPS lived on in other guises , such as the Highway Watch program , a $ 19 billion dollar Homeland Security - run project which trains truckers to watch for suspicious activity on America ’s highways .
More recently , ABC News reported that “ The FBI is taking cues from the CIA to recruit thousands of covert informants in the United States as part of a sprawling effort ….. to aid with criminal investigations . ”
Since authorities now define mundane activities like buying baby formula , beer , wearing Levi jeans , carrying identifying documents like a drivers license and traveling with women or children or mentioning the U.S. constitution as the behavior of potential terrorists , the bounty for the American Stasi to turn in political dissidents is sure to be too tempting to resist under Obama ’s new program .

Powerful Explosions Suggest Neutron Star Missing Link
Robert Naeye
Goddard Space Flight Center
Observations from NASA ’s Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer ( RXTE ) have revealed that the youngest known pulsing neutron star has thrown a temper tantrum .
The collapsed star occasionally unleashes powerful bursts of X - rays , which are forcing astronomers to rethink the life cycle of neutron stars .
"
We are watching one type of neutron star literally change into another right before our very eyes .
This is a long - sought missing link between different types of pulsars , " says Fotis Gavriil of NASA ’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. , and the University of Maryland , Baltimore .
Gavriil is lead author of a paper in the February 21 issue of Sciencexpress .
A neutron star forms when a massive star explodes as a supernova , leaving behind an ultradense core .
Most known neutron stars emit regular pulsations that are powered by rapid spins .
Astronomers have found nearly 1,800 of these so - called pulsars in our galaxy .
Pulsars have incredibly strong magnetic fields by Earthly standards , but a dozen of them — slow rotators known as magnetars — actually derive their energy from incredibly powerful magnetic fields , the strongest known in the universe .
These fields can stress the neutron star ’s solid crust past the breaking point , triggering starquakes that snap magnetic - field lines , producing violent and sporadic X - ray bursts .
But what is the evolutionary relationship between pulsars and magnetars ?
Astronomers would like to know if magnetars represent a rare class of pulsars , or if some or all pulsars go through a magnetar phase during their life cycles .
Gavriil and his colleagues have found an important clue by examining archival RXTE data of a young neutron star , known as PSR J1846-0258 for its sky coordinates in the constellation Aquila .
Previously , astronomers had classified PSR J1846 as a normal pulsar because of its fast spin ( 3.1 times per second ) and pulsar - like spectrum .
But RXTE caught four magnetar - like X - ray bursts on May 31 , 2006 , and another on July 27 , 2006 .
Although none of these events lasted longer than 0.14 second , they all packed the wallop of at least 75,000 Suns .
" Never before has a regular pulsar been observed to produce magnetar bursts , " says Gavriil .
" Young , fast - spinning pulsars were not thought to have enough magnetic energy to generate such powerful bursts , " says coauthor Marjorie Gonzalez , who worked on this paper at McGill University in Montreal , Canada , but who is now based at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver .
" Here ’s a normal pulsar that ’s acting like a magnetar .
" Observations from NASA ’s Chandra X-ray Observatory also provided key information .
Chandra observed the neutron star in October 2000 and again in June 2006 , around the time of the bursts .
Chandra showed the object had brightened in X - rays , confirming that the bursts were from the pulsar , and that its spectrum had changed to become more magnetar - like .
Astronomers know that PSR J1846 is very young for several reasons .
First , it resides inside a supernova remnant known as Kes 75 , an indicator that it has n’t had time to wander from its birthplace .
Second , based on the rapidity that its spin rate is slowing down , astronomers calculate that it can be no older than 884 years — an infant on the cosmic timescale .
Magnetars are thought to be about 10,000 years old , whereas most pulsars are thought to be considerably older .
The fact that PSR J1846 ’s spin rate is slowing down relatively fast also means that it has a strong magnetic field that is braking the rotation .
The implied magnetic field is trillions of times stronger than Earth ’s field , but it ’s 10 to 100 times weaker than typical magnetar field strengths .
Coauthor Victoria Kaspi of McGill University notes , " PSR J1846 ’s actual magnetic field could be much stronger than the measured amount , suggesting that many young neutron stars classified as pulsars might actually be magnetars in disguise , and that the true strength of their magnetic field only reveals itself over thousands of years as they ramp up in activity . "
On Wednesday , Industry Minister Jim Prentice introduced a bill that BoingBoing 's Cory Doctorow described as making it " flatly illegal to break any kind of digital lock , or to violate terms in one of those absurd end - user license agreements that make you promise to agree to let the record industry kick your teeth in and drink all your beer , just for the dubious privilege of paying for a song at iTunes or watching a video on Viacom 's website . " .
Doctorow also points out that " [ t ] his amounts to private law : under Prentice 's plan , Parliament would get out of the business of making copyright law , simply enforcing whatever copyright law the entertainment industry itself dreamed up " .
Michael Geist , law professor at the University of Ottawa states , the education provisions " [ t] urn librarians into locksmiths " by requiring that they expire their digital materials after no more than five days .
This is an extremely troubling case , as all signs point to this being far worse than the US 's Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) .
Let 's not forget that Adobe under the DMCA had a Russian programmer , Dmitry Sklyarov , arrested and imprisoned .
His " crime " ?
Distributing a product designed to remove locks from ebooks so that they could be fully used like regular books .
Especially given that consumers are rejecting DRMed media and moving toward services like eMusic , Amazon MP3 , Magnatune and Jamendo , this would be a terrible law to pass .
Geist notes that " the DMCA provisions are worse than the U.S. and the consumer exceptions riddled with limitations " -- the provisions include a potential $ 20,000 per infringement damage award that could see Canadian citizens threatened with legal troubles for uploading a snippet of a song to any video - sharing site .
Canada 's excuse is that it needs the DMCA in order to comply with the 1996 WIPO Copyright Treaty .
But this is no reason at all --
We need to make it clear that an unjust treaty cannot justify a further unjust law !
What can be done ?
Take action !
We simply cannot let this pass .
No matter where you live in the world , if you are a copyright holder on any kind of work -- song , film , article , computer program -- please email the officials below to let them know that you do not want this law and that the people who have been demanding it do not speak for you .
If you are Canadian , please write to your MP to protest the fast - tracking of this bill .
The Canadian government needs to hear that this law is Defective by Design !
Write to your MP , and email the Industry Minister , the Canadian Heritage Minister , and the Prime Minister .
If you are looking for a sample letter , visit Copyright for Canadians .
If you send an email , be sure to print it out and drop a copy in the mail ( no stamp is needed -- c / o House of Commons , Ottawa , ON , K1A0A6 ) .
Do n't stop with email .
Go visit .
In his latest post , Doctorow suggests that every Canadian " Take 30 minutes from your summer , to meet directly with your MP " .
From late June through much of the summer , your MP will be back in your local community attending local events and making themselves available to meet with constituents .
Give them a call and ask for a meeting .
Every MP in the country should return to Ottawa in the fall having heard from their constituents on this issue .
UPDATE : Canadian Colalition for Electronic Rights have a simple form for Canadian citizens to easily email Prentice and others

PETA wants to put vegan ads on border fence PETA wants to advertise vegan message on border fence
While many view the contentious border fence as a government fiasco , an animal rights group sees a rare opportunity .
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals plans today to announce an unusual marketing pitch to the U.S. government :
Rent us space on the fence for billboards warning illegal border crossers there is more to fear than the Border Patrol .
The billboards , in English and Spanish , would offer the caution : " If the Border Patrol Does n't Get You , the Chicken and Burgers Will — Go Vegan . "
" We think that Mexicans and other immigrants should be warned if they cross into the U.S. they are putting their health at risk by leaving behind a healthier , staple diet of corn tortillas , beans , rice , fruits and vegetables , " said Lindsay Rajt , assistant manager of PETA 's vegan campaigns .
The Department of Homeland Security is working to meet a deadline to complete 670 miles of fencing and other barriers on the Southwest border by Dec. 31 .
The fencing operation has run into stiff opposition by landowners fighting government efforts to obtain their land through condemnation .
PETA says its billboards would picture " fit and trim " Mexicans in their own country , where their diet is more in line with the group 's mission .
Another image on the sign would portray obese American children and adults " gorging on meaty , fat - and cholesterol - packed American food . "
PETA'S offer to the feds is expected to arrive in a letter to Border Patrol officials today .
But a government spokesman in Washington said the request will be rejected because it would limit visibility through the fence .
And Border Patrol does not allow advertising on its property or installations , the officials added .
" The fencing being put in place is , in many cases , mesh fencing to allow our officers to see what 's happening on the other side and to better secure the border , " said Michael Friel , a spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection .
One property owner on the Texas - Mexico border laughed at PETA 's proposal .
" I think it 's ridiculous , " said Noel Benavides , who is contesting the construction of a fence dividing his family 's 145 - acre ranch in Roma on the Rio Grande .
" I can't see the point of something like that . "
But Rajt said the rent money they 'd pay would help offset the huge costs of the fencing — and the advertising message " might even be frightening enough to deter people from crossing into the U.S. "
PETA has often been criticized for its aggressive animal rights crusades .
It 's used billboards to push many of its controversial positions such as " Buck Cruelty : Say NO to horse - drawn carriage rides " or " Feeding Kids Meat Is Child Abuse . "

It turns out that Jim Johnson was not the man Barack Obama thought he knew .
The presumptive Democratic Presidential nominee threw the former Fannie Mae CEO over the side as his Vice Presidential vetter yesterday , only a day after he'd said that Mr. Johnson was only " tangentially related " to his campaign and that criticism was a " game that can be played . "
Mr. Johnson was cast off after the Journal disclosed that he had received sweetheart loans from Countrywide Financial – the very firm that Mr. Obama has specifically ...
There are four basic trends which are going to own the future over the next 20 years .
1 > Power is about to become as cheap as information .
Nanosolar , Konarka , and the dozens of other solar power outfits who are pushing the price of solar down , down , down below the price of coal power , and towards the a few cents a watt for the panel , meaning your daylight power comes down below 1 cent per kilowatt hour , or maybe 20 % of the cheapest current grid power .
The whole world is going to get electricity .
In many areas , this will immediately lead to vast improvements in lifestyle and economic productivity as electric tractors , pumps , daytime - factories and many other applications are found for the newfound power .
2 > Computers and cellphones are going to finish their global spread .
E -paper , cheap processors , gigantic solid state drives etc. rapidly push the informational revolution the rest of the way .
And in the daytime you plug them into the panels .
3 > Poor people are going to start getting angry .
With liberal access to information , they are going to become very , very politicized , en-masse , shortly after the arrival of the network .
Totalitarian regimes that wish to impede the free flow of information will be faced with a stark choice : cripple the network , and retard their economic and social progress , or leave it open , and be exposed to the full brunt of network politics .
4 > The entire system we currently call “ government ” is going to be challenged at every level .
Let me tell you why .
Government is slow .
Change is fast , government is slow , and the gap between the two fills with lost opportunity .
Soon this gap is going to be larger than the positive functions of government , as things like spectrum regulation and inane copyright and patent law strangle progress in increasingly vital areas .
Vested interests co-opt the collective power of the people and use it to line their own pockets at the expense of all , and as the network documents what is wrong , but the polling booths offer no remedy , cracks will begin to show .
In America you can see it around medical marijuana .
In Sweden , it ’s around copyright .
In China , it ’s about free speech and free access to information .
In all cases , the problem is that governments are failing to adapt to the current conditions .
People flow like water , but the governments stand like stones .
How long can this go on ?
It is my sincere belief that it ’s time for us to re-architect the political systems of the world around the idea of flexible response in the face of unconstrained scientific and technological progress .
Nanotechnology , genetics , robotics and many other fields are about to make leaps which will leave entire generations staggered .
Are we going to rely on the current obsolete bureaucracies to Do The Right Thing and guide us through this exquisitely dangerous age of runaway technological growth ?
Two words : stem cells .
There are so many cats being released from the universities and laboratories of the world that nobody stands any realistic chance predicting the best way to manage them .
This means we need a diversity of approaches internationally , so that regions can learn from each - other ’s mistakes , rather than a single global authority which will make mistakes which affect all of humanity .
At the same time , we need correct decisions to propagate rapidly across the network , and to be implemented wisely .
Above all , we need to stop having all of us be dumber than any of us .
We need to start effectively funneling problems to the people best able to solve them and listening to what they say , not to scrape past the next electoral cycle , but to actually protect the future of humanity through the ongoing technological crisis we find ourselves in .
The history of politics since the invention of the nuclear bomb – or perhaps the long range bomber – is the history of technology .
At a fundamental level , the State is a wholly - owned subsidiary of science and technology , because all the big , life - or - death decisions are driven by the forces of research and discovery , which the State cannot ever hope to control within its own borders , much less globally .
A discovery made anywhere has ripples everywhere , and so governments cannot hope to control the terrain any more .
Borders are meaningless when a college professor 8000 miles away can make a discovery which will be at your doorstep in 48 hours , and make an entire area of policy obsolete .
People used to talk about the Illuminati , these enlightened schemers who oversaw the long - term evolution of humanity for their own nefarious purposes .
People like to re-invent these mythological figures as conspiracy theories about the Trilateral Commission or the Bilderbergers .
As has been observed many times , the conspiracy theorist draws comfort from the idea that somebody , however nefarious , is in charge .
But , in truth , there is no - one .
The ultra -rich have more than their fair share of control , pushing their chosen candidates up the greasy pole for their four years of fame and power , but they die of cancer or aids , have their lives overtaken by technological change , fear death just like the rest of us .
Critical innovations may occasionally be blocked for a decade or more due to patents being purchased and shelved , but knowledge never dies .
No amount of wealth can hold back the tides of history , and those who stand , Canute - like , soon watch their rusting factories scrapped and their obsolete institutions ignored .
There is no cure for time , and the metric of time is “ the pace of events . ”
A global society means that events anywhere can effect everywhere , and this is particularly true of discovery .
Time appears to accelerate because of communication , as we each get more and more exposed to change by the accelerated network communications .
I fear that our current systems of government have no future because they cannot adapt to the tempo of modernity .
The Cold War temporarily simplified the situation by pitting two bureaucracies against each other : change was artificially retarded by the slowness of the funding cycles , the inherent resistance to change of the monolithic powers .
But the 5 year plan and the 4 year electoral cycle are slow .
The OODA loop , the basic cognitive cycle , in government is measured in years .
Abstractly speaking , the USSR course - corrected four times in 20 years , while the USA course - corrected five times .
Where would either institution be in a world where hundreds of millions of people act on the network with a Observe - Orient - Decide - Act cycle measured in minutes .
Yes , they cannot authorize a hundred billion dollars of programs … but they can often out - perform anything that that a government could fund or buy because you cannot make what is slow fast , or what was designed to be stable into a meta- stable , self - correcting intelligent system .
There is no fly - by - wire government .
I do n’t care about the citizens of the developed world .
You guys are fine .
The water will stay pure , the electricity will keep coming , you ’ll be the last to starve in any global crisis .
Worry not , ye pampered children of fortune .
I , of course , am one of you .
Our problems are being worked on by well - funded teams , commercial and state - run , and while over - governance is an inconvenience , few if any die of it .
But in the rest of the world , the crapness of government is murder .
The famines and epidemics of the poor .
The billions of wasted aid .
The incredible potential of places like Africa as the technological changes I have outlined arrive , and are stifled in the crib as fast as possible by things like state monopolies on telecommunications …
You have to ask yourself , “ how long will this go on ? ”
I think that Wikipedia and those MIT courses that are online in their entirety might actually deliver more services to the poor of the world than their governments do .
You ask me who they will believe when trying to face major issues : the combined wisdom of the academics and private researchers of the internet , or the PR of the same people who left them with hyper-inflation and a failed farm reform that a child could have predicted would cause famines ?
In their position , would we not orient to the network as our path out of poverty , and towards abundance ?
Would it not be the lifeline we hauled on to pull ourselves out of poverty ?
Oh Wikipedia , what do I do to put food in my belly ?
Tell me please ?
And , of course , it ’s not there yet .
But some college student in a Texas Ag program writes up permaculture for Malawi , and a retired doctor in Hawaii translates it , and two teenagers in suburban Durban make a video and dub it , and a Japanese phone services start up compresses the video so it fits over thin pipes , and a guy in Brazil wires it to the GPS formats used by the local phone companies , and pretty soon there ’s your organic green revolution and people stop dying .
No government is smart enough to do this , people .
We can see it ’s there , it ’s waiting to be done .
The hardware roll out is well advanced , over half of the human race has cell phones , but where ’s the coordinated welcome wagon to help them use their cell phones to stop dying of the lack of knowledge .
Solar water disinfection ( SODIS ) : put water which is contaminated with disease organisms into a plastic soda pop bottle and leave it in the sun all day .
You can use a tinfoil reflector , or put it on a black sheet metal heat collector if you want to be fancy .
The UV light and the heat kill most of what would make you sick .
This is a technique you can teach by well - phrased SMS messages .
5 million people a year die of dirty water , many of them children .
SODIS wo n’t get all of them , and it ’s not a perfect technique , but it ’s easier to get people started on and odds - are many people who only have bad water to drink live in places with abundant sun and available discarded plastic soda bottles …
And there ’s more .
I hear that green manures , a technique from organic farming , can boost agricultural output almost as much as applying chemical fertilizers .
If you ca n’t afford fertilizers , or do n’t want to use them for other reasons , you need to know how that works .
Maybe it can be taught by SMS too , or a web page suitable for squirting over a phone , or an audio track that gets translated and delivered as a voicemail to the people on the “ tell us things which will help us live better ” telephone mailing list .
This is endless .
But the network is out there , and we , the rich , can start pulling on our end of it to drag all those poor people in the slums and impoverished villages of the world out .
You pick up a phone , and on the other end of the line , there is a person who is starving ?
What do you say ?
We are all in this position .
The network , as it spreads , puts us directly in the same world as the poor .
I do n’t know why we have n’t started to see spam - style messages from real people in real disasters , asking for us to paypal them $ 5 to survive for the next three weeks , but it ’s coming .
It ’s time to start turning the statistics into simple facts : we can help these people by coordinated action to prepare accurate scientific and technical information on how to acquire the basic necessities of life in an impoverished environment .
We need to work out what to do , and we need to get it translated .
It worked for Wikipedia .
Why should n’t it work here ?
I designed a house that can be manufactured in an emergency in vast numbers by taking cardboard or plastic sheet from any factory , cutting some of them in half , and fastening them together with cable ties or parcel tape .
It ’s called a Hexayurt .
Right now , China , which has a vast manufacturing base of exactly those materials has 5 million people homeless after an earthquake and they are short a vast number of tents .
Click .
Put two and two together .
Click .
I ’ve documented as well as I was able , but it ’s not great .
Click .
We can do this .
Accurate videos which describe SODIS , and beyond that , solar cooking .
A guide to manufacturing hexayurts using resources scavenged from factories outside of the disaster area .
A first aid guide , perhaps based on “ Where There Is No Doctor , ” which can be distributed on micro-SD cards after a disaster so people can refer to it on their phones , or broadcast as a network service on emergency cell towers .
The network is a rope .
There are people on the other end of the network who are drowning , and they are just catching hold of the other end of that rope .
Now it is time for all of us , together , to start pulling the poor , the oppressed , the desperate and the needy out of the lake of ignorance in which they are drowning , and on to the safe shores of knowledge .
We can not get everything on day one .
This discourages some people , and prevents action .
Here is my proposal : we measure our success by the ability to apply the solutions which exist , and discover new ones .
Nobody contests that SODIS , or it ’s big brother , solar water pasteurization , have the capability to solve the contaminated drinking water problem over much of the world .
In some places these systems are all that you need , because there is always sun .
So we start there .
In other areas , there is a rainy season where you cannot purify water using the sun .
Perhaps rainwater collection works , or perhaps people must use bleach to treat their water for a few months .
Some people would see this and stop work on solving the problems which are within reach because we do not have a global solution .
We do not need a global solution to start pulling people out .
We can start with the solutions we have , apply them , and improve both quality and reach as we go .
Let there be no organization .
Let there be no organized raising of funds for the entire agenda .
This is too important to be governed either by a nation state , or by a bureaucracy , or by a non-profit .
Wikipedia exists because of the GFDL – it can be forked if the current governance structure fails .
Similarly , the profusion of open source operating system distributions ensures that if any single group becomes ineffective for whatever reason , the work continues .
The first step is to realize that we can do this .
It is possible for coordinated volunteer action by people in the developed world to help people in the developing world over the network .
The second step is to realize that this is already happening .
Children and adults who have network in the developing world are learning .
Cell phones are making positive changes everywhere they arrive .
Knowledge resources like Wikipedia are being pushed further and further out towards the corners .
The third step is to realize that , at this time , there ’s no comprehensive anticipatory design science institution to coordinate pulling on the Great Rope which is the Network , to haul people out of the poverty of ignorance , and into the relative wealth of practical , living know - how .
Nor am I proposing that such an institution be created .
Rather , there are a profusion of teams working on angles of this problem .
It ’s too big for any group to have a comprehensive overview of the entire space .
But if you want to help , the way is clear : join a project , and start pitching in with whatever resources you have and can afford to use in this way .
We , collectively , need everything you can imagine : translators , librarians , videographers , sound engineers , metallurgists , carpenters , painters , doctors , lawyers , basket - weavers and midwives alike have something to offer .
Every practical art and profession can contribute to helping to build the knowledge - base which will help transform the life of the poor around the planet as the network arrives .
It is inevitable that the network will spread everywhere across the planet , or very nearly so .
Already the cell phone has reached 50 % of the humans on the planet .
As technological innovation transforms the ordinary cell phone into a little computer , and ordinary cell services into connections to the Internet , the population of the internet is going to change from being predominantly educated westerners to being mainly people in poorer countries , and shortly after that , to being predominantly people living on a few dollars a day .
Why will the internet wind up filled with people who live in such poverty ?
Because the Internet will be global , and that ’s how the world really is .
Most people are very poor , and as the price of a connection to the Internet falls to a level they can afford , as they can afford cell phones now , we ’re going to get a chance to really help these people get a better life by finding them the information resources they need to grow and prosper .
Imagine that you are a poor single mother in South America who lives in a village without a clean water source .
Your child gets sick now and again from the dirty water , and you feel there is nothing you can do , and worry about their survival .
Then one of your more prosperous neighbors gets a new telephone , and there ’s a video which describes how to purify water .
It ’s simple , in your language , and describes all the basic steps without showing anything which requires schooling to understand .
After a while , you master the basic practical skills – the year or two of high school you caught before having the child and having to work helps .
But then you teach your sisters , and none of the kids get sick as often as they used to … life has improved because of the network .
Then comes solar cookers , and improved stoves , and preventative medicine , and better agriculture , and diagnosis of conditions which require a doctor ’s attention , with a GPS map and calendar of when the visiting doctors will be in town again .
You can even flag urgent conditions and request them to come sooner .
We live in a poor world .
While a few of us enjoy unlimited abundance , nearly all of the rest are poor .
The world ’s richest few hundred people own more than the world ’s poorest three billion , and this is not a natural condition , but one that emerged from the ways our cultures handle property , including intellectual property , and how we handle capital , including conventions like limited liability , which protects investor ’s profits from any negative consequences of how those profits were made .
As we are increasingly brought together by the network , and as the poor arrive in our living rooms and schools through their blogs and their SMS and their emails and their social networks , we are increasingly going to have to ask why they are poor .
Some of it is accidents of history .
Some of it is maladaptive cultural practices which do n’t make the best of local resources , like slash and burn agriculture .
And some of it is our fault , as rich countries swing their weight around at the negotiating table , occasionally topple governments which refuse resource extraction deals , and otherwise take advantage of those who are weak .
We can not change history .
But we can improve on the future by neglecting to ignore these issues as the poor teach us about their worlds .
As surely as we pull them out of poverty , they pull us out of ignorance .
It ’s time for us to get educated on this planet .
When people from every walk of life talk freely about their worlds , across national , racial , cultural , linguistic , and every other kind of boundaries , then we will begin to understand how , on a planet with such plenty , so many go without and suffer for it .
But it is up to you and me as individuals to coordinate to do this .
The institutions that surround us are not creatures of the network age .
There is no charity or government which can develop knowledge resources as effectively as Wikipedia , or develop software as effectively as the Free Software movement has .
We have to stop expecting the institutions which have their roots in the pre-network age to effectively transition to lead us in the networked , globalized , one - planet era .
This is daunting .
But people have risen to the challenge .
The seed ideas of Wikipedia , of GNU / Linux , of every aspect of the new resources we are creating online started in a few minds , and were accomplished by a sea of minds and hands working together .
I see no reason that the next chapter of human history , the chapter in which everybody in the world gets a place to live and a bowl of food each and every single day , should not be written in a similar fashion .
It is up to you to figure out what you can do to help .
Right now , we are very early .
The phone network is only half way across the human race , and the Internet - enabled devices are still relatively expensive .
But in ten years , neither of those things will be true any more .
I fear that the network is moving much faster than our ability to help people through the network can keep up with .
So let ’s start , today , and maintain the effort over these next few years : to develop the resources that people will need to lift themselves out of poverty over the network and to make sure that these resources are ready , correct , tested , translated and free , for any purpose , as those who need them arrive in our lives .
Do not meet the poor on the network empty - handed .
Bring something they need to help them .
It ’s time for us to work together to do what the governments of the world have failed to do : take effective action to end poverty .
( CNN ) -- Former U.S. senator and Democratic presidential hopeful John Edwards admitted Friday to an extramarital affair .
He denied being the father of the woman 's child , as had been alleged in tabloid reports .
Former Sen. John Edwards told ABC
News that he had an affair with Rielle Hunter , seen above .
In an interview on ABC News " Nightline , " Edwards acknowledged the affair with 42 - year - old Rielle Hunter , which began after she was hired to make documentary videos for his campaign , ABC said .
" I am responsible for it .
I alone am responsible for it , " Edwards said on ABC News " Nightline . "
Edwards told the network that his rise from " a small town boy in North Carolina " who " came from nothing " to a successful lawyer , U.S. senator and national public figure " fed a self - focus , an egotism , a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want . "
Edwards , in the ABC interview , acknowledged meeting with Hunter at the Beverly Hills hotel at the request of a friend of hers .
" I was there from a very simple reason , because I was trying to keep this mistake that I had made from becoming public , " Edwards said .
In a written statement Friday , Edwards said , " In 2006 , I made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs .
I recognized my mistake and I told my wife that I had a liaison with another woman , and I asked for her forgiveness . "
" You can not beat me up more than I have already beaten up myself .
I have been stripped bare and will now work with everything I have to help my family and others who need my help . "
Read the full statement
Edwards said a blurry photograph published by the National Enquirer that purportedly showed him holding Hunter 's child inside the hotel room could not be authentic , since the baby was not there at their meeting .
" I do n't know if the picture has been altered , manufactured , if it 's a picture of me taken some other time , holding another baby .
I have no idea , " he said .
" I was not at this meeting holding a child for my photograph to be taken , I can tell you that . "
Edwards said he has not taken a paternity test but that the timing of the affair rules out the possibility that he could be the father of Hunter 's 5 - month - old child .
Edwards said Friday night he is " truly hopeful " that a paternity test will be done to squelch the rumors .
Andrew Young , a former Edwards campaign aide who is married , has publicly said he fathered the child .
The Washington Post reported Friday that Hunter acknowledged Young as the father .
When the National Enquirer first reported the affair in October , Edwards flatly denied it , calling the claims " false " and " ridiculous . "
Watch an interview with the National Enquirer 's editor »
Contacted through a former aide by CNN on Thursday , Edwards had refused to comment on the reports .
He also dodged reporters at a recent event in Washington .
In a July 24 appearance in New Orleans , Louisiana , he would not answer a reporter 's question about whether he had provided financial support to Hunter or Young .
Watch Edwards says " I sin every single day " »
" I have no idea what you 're asking about , " Edwards said .
" I have responded to , consistently , to these tabloid allegations by saying I do n't respond to these lies . "
Edwards , 55 , of North Carolina , told ABC that his wife , Elizabeth , and other family members have known about the affair since 2006 .
Elizabeth Edwards , in a posting on the Daily Kos Web site , said :
" The fact that it is a mistake that many others have made before him did not make it any easier for me to hear when he told me what he had done .
But he did tell me .
And we began a long and painful process in 2006 , a process oddly made somewhat easier with my [ cancer ] diagnosis in March of 2007 .
This was our private matter , and I frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was I did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well . "
Edwards , the vice presidential candidate during Sen .
John Kerry 's 2004 presidential bid , told ABC that he never expected to be chosen as Sen.
Barack Obama 's running mate , but that his public career has not ended .
He said he would not worry about any possible positions in an Obama administration .
" I do n't know what 's possible and what 's gone , " he said .
Don Fowler , a former Democratic Party chairman , said this week that Edwards might be forfeiting a major role at the party 's upcoming convention in Denver -- or in a future Democratic administration -- unless he cleared the air .
" I think the longer these allegations go unanswered and unresponded to , the more difficult it is for the people producing the convention to give him a prominent spot , " Fowler said .
iReport : What 's your reaction to Edwards ' affair ?
Fowler , of South Carolina , served as Democratic chairman from 1995 to 1997 and will be a party superdelegate at the Denver convention in late August .
He said he had no input into whether Edwards addresses the convention , " but I would expect that he would not speak or have any role at the convention unless this is cleared up . "

Obama , in Hawaii for a weeklong vacation , told reporters he understands that Edwards does not plan to attend the convention .
" This is a difficult and painful time for them , and I think they need to work through that process of healing , " he said .
" My sense is that that 's going to be their top priority .
" John Edwards was a great champion of working people during the first of this campaign .
Many of his themes are ones that Democrats as a whole share ; those will be amplified at the convention , " Obama added .
Presumptive Republican nominee Sen. John McCain declined to comment on a similar question .
Speaking in support of Obama in Las Vegas , Nevada , on Friday , Edwards ' former rival , Sen. Hillary Clinton , responded briefly to a reporter 's question about what , if any , impact the revelation of the affair would have on Democrats .
" My thoughts and prayers are with the Edwards family today , " she said .
" That 's all I have to say . "
The Enquirer 's claims about the affair were revived July 22 when the tabloid reported it had confronted Edwards at a Beverly Hills , California , hotel after receiving a tip he was meeting Hunter and her child there .
On Friday , he said he was ashamed of the affair and hoped it would never become public .
He said he used the fact that the Enquirer story " contained many falsities " to deny it .
" But being 99 percent honest is no longer enough , " he said in the statement .
Edwards told ABC that his wife 's widely reported cancer was in remission when the affair began .
" She was mad ; she was angry , " Edwards said , describing when he admitted the affair to his wife .
" I think furious would be a good way to describe it . "
Watch Edwards describe his wife 's reaction »
According to federal election records , the Edwards campaign paid Hunter 's production company roughly $ 114,000 in 2006 and 2007 for " Website / Internet services . "
The former North Carolina senator announced in January that he was dropping out of the 2008 Democratic presidential race .
" It is time for me to step aside so that history can blaze its path , " he said in New Orleans .
With his wife and children at his side , Edwards said he could n't predict " who will take the final steps to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue , " but he said it would be a Democrat .
Edwards endorsed Sen. Barack Obama on May 14 during a rally in Grand Rapids , Michigan .
He trailed Clinton and Obama in the early contests .
He came in third in key races in New Hampshire and South Carolina .
Edwards had campaigned on the message that he was standing up for the little guy , the people who are not traditionally given a voice in Washington , and that he would do more to fight special interests .
After dropping out of the race , Edwards asked Clinton and Obama to make poverty a central issue in the general election and a future Democratic administration , something both agreed to do .
Edwards is a South Carolina native with an undergraduate degree from North Carolina State University and law degree from the University of North Carolina .
Before entering politics , winning a Senate seat from North Carolina in 1998 , Edwards was a lawyer representing families " being victimized by powerful interests " and gaining " a national reputation as a forceful and tireless champion for regular , hard - working people , " according to his campaign Web site .
CNN 's Ed Hornick , Scott Bronstein , Drew Griffin , Matt Smith and Paul Vercammen contributed to this report .

Something weird is going on – yesterday I received a letter from some asshole in the immigration department telling me that my UK visa was being " withdrawn with immediate effect " .
The letter goes on to say that " certain information has come to light that makes it no longer desirable for you to remain in the United Kingdom " .
I go mental and get Mr Himmler 's lawyer to contact the guy .
It turns out that my name is on some " terror " list and has just been flagged up to " red level " , which means deportation , voluntary or otherwise .
I have three weeks to leave the country of my own free will or I will be arrested and forcibly removed .
The guy is unable to say anything else as it is " classified " .
There is clearly some huge mistake , but it just shows that Obama 's " people " are already in charge of things and the whole system is starting to crack at the seams .
I 'm presuming that there is someone else bearing the proud name of Cooper Brown who has got into some trouble somewhere and it 's trickled down to me .
Nobody seems to care that I 'm now a fully paid - up member of the aristocracy .
It seems that marrying an English chick is not enough to stop me being kicked out .
I call a war conference in the Electric .
Everyone is there – Ben , Victoria , Hugo and an assortment of people that they think could help .
Ben has brought this high - powered lawyer friend , who tells me that there is no way that they can kick me out when people like the hook - armed preacher lounge around in prison eating caviar and watching Jeremy Kyle .
This guy gets really indignant and says that we 'll take my case to the European Court of Human Rights .
We all cheer at this and then Pablo arrives and we get a little distracted but the point is made – I 'm drawing a line in the sand and will fight .
I expect this newspaper to get right behind me .
I know I can count on your support , dear readers – maybe a little petition or something would be the way to go ?
I ring my Mom to tell her what 's going down .
She reacts weirdly and says that she 's convinced that it 's all her fault .
I tell her that , as far as I know , there is no law against being a fat , dumb hippie so she need n't start a guilt trip on my account .
She does n't react like she normally does , which is weird .
She is silent for a while and then tells me about her new " boyfriend " ( at what age does that term start being ridiculous ? ) , " Hakim " .
This guy is from Syria and she met him at some Peace in Iraq demonstration in Monterey .
It 's got pretty serious , as they have been together for three months , which is a record for Mom .
Anyways , this guy is clearly not what he seems .
Apparently he was taken in two times by the Feds and has now totally disappeared as from last Sunday .
I ask her what this asshole does for a living ?
It turns out that he used to be some kind of scientist in Damascus before he " got involved in politics " and had to leave .
All this sounds totally out - there ... but very " my Mom " .
I wonder whether this guy and my problems are connected ?
I 've never even met him and would be the first in line to send him to Guantanamo if there were any suspicions that he's from the Dark Side .
I ring Dave Cameron 's office and leave a message with his assistant .
Dave will definitely be able to sort this out .
Thank God for friends in high places .
Being a top columnist and a friend of the future prime minister is really going to pay off .
I tell the assistant to get Dave to ring me back as soon as possible .
This is the kind of case that he will freak about .
He does n't get back to me as quickly as I 'd like – so I ring his office back .
It turns out that he is having a real chock - a- block week but his assistant says he 'll definitely get back to me soon .
I ring Hugh Grant .
At times like this , star power is what 's needed .
I tell him what is going on and can he go on something like Larry King or Richard and Judy and plead my case ?
He gets all cagey and says that he'd love to but he can't really get involved in this kind of thing as he needs to be careful because of his past with Liz Hurley , who is now married to an Indian ...
Basically , he does n't want to do anything that could prevent him from working in the States .
Thanks a bunch , Hugh , real friend in need ...
Victoria is weeping away at home and worried that she will be booted out as well .
I tell her she is British so they can't kick her out – and where would they send her to , the Republic of Prada ?
It does n't take long for Trinny to hear the news and she 's on the phone pretending to be really sympathetic .
She says that she and Susannah are doing really well in the States and that they have some contacts there that they can use to highlight my case .
I tell her that it's in the UK that I need help and she goes a bit quieter – things are n't so good for those two on the home front ... boo -hoo .
Do n't worry , readers , I 'm going to fight this – you have n't heard the last of me yet .
Any support you could show would be invaluable – get writing .

DENVER 
The sun dipped behind the towering sandstone monoliths of the Red Rocks Amphitheatre on a recent evening as donors to the Democrats ' national convention sipped mojitos and snacked on bison burgers at a private reception .
They later took in an invitation - only concert featuring Sheryl Crow and the Dave Matthews Band .
A day later , big givers to the committee raising money for Democratic senators gathered in a plush hotel ballroom for a private breakfast meeting with the candidates .
When Barack Obama accepts his party 's nomination at the Invesco football stadium here Thursday , major contributors will watch from luxury skyboxes high above the field .
The courting of donors and fundraisers is in high gear at the Democratic National Convention .
Those who helped underwrite the four - day event , raised money for congressional candidates or worked to bring in hundreds of thousands of dollars for the national party to aid Obama 's presidential campaign mingle with celebrities and politicians at dozens of parties , receptions and luncheons .
" It is non-stop , " Ben Barnes , a former Texas lieutenant governor , said of the whirlwind of activities .
Barnes has contributed more than $ 100,000 to federal candidates , parties and congressional fundraising committees in the past two years , campaign records show .
" After four or five days , it becomes a physical endurance test , " he said .
" Can you stay up past 1 o'clock in the morning ?
Can you go to one more party ? "
Craig Holman of Public Citizen , a liberal - leaning watchdog group , said these activities are inappropriate .
" The more donors chip in , the more access they buy , " he said .
" And these are some of the biggest lobbying corporations on Capitol Hill . "
Stacie Paxton , a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee , and Nick Shapiro of the Obama campaign said the events are a way to thank donors .
" Many of our top fundraisers in attendance can attend a range of different events thanking them for the work they have been and are doing to help change Washington , " Shapiro said in an e-mail .
Some of the biggest rewards go to companies that have helped pay for the convention .
Offerings include " exclusive events " with national Democratic leadership , according to the sponsorship guide .
" Silver " sponsors who gave at least $ 100,000 receive convention credentials .
Xcel Energy spokesman Joe Fuentes said his company received an Invesco skybox because it contributed $ 1 million .
" This is a way for us to show our appreciation , " said Chris Lopez , spokesman for the Denver Host Committee , which raised more than $ 40 million in private convention funds .
" I do n't think there is any undue influence " on politicians as a result , he said .
Donors to next week 's Republican National Convention in St. Paul will enjoy similar benefits , including luxury - level seats in the convention hall and preferred bookings at downtown hotels .
Other offerings for donors at the Democratic confab include an invitation - only briefing today with top Obama aides , said Mark Aronchick , a Democratic National Committee fundraiser from Philadelphia .
A schedule for the Senate Democrats ' fundraising arm shows receptions at downtown restaurants for its big givers .
Don Fowler , a former Democratic National Committee chairman , said the care and feeding of top donors at a convention gives party leaders the chance to reward contributors and motivate them to continue raising cash for the sprint to Election Day .
" You want to be nice to them , make sure they have nice hotels and good transportation and good seats , " he said .
" The party also can provide access to important decision makers . …
That 's what pleases contributors . "

( CNN ) --
A prisoner killed in a Maryland county jail on Sunday was a victim of " vigilante justice , " Prince George 's County Chief Executive Jack Johnson said .
Ronnie
White , 19 , died of strangulation and asphyxiation and had two broken bones in his neck , an autopsy showed .
An attorney for White 's family said that because White was being held in solitary confinement at the Prince George 's County Correctional Center , a corrections officer would have had to let whoever killed the prisoner into his cell .
His death came two days after his arrest in connection with the death of Prince George 's County police Cpl. Richard Findley , who died Friday after being struck by a truck .
Authorities believe that White was driving the truck , which was thought to be stolen .
Police were attempting to flag it down when Findley was struck .
" The killing of the officer is absolutely abhorrent , but also , Mr. White was presumed innocent and deserved his day in court just like any other citizens , " Johnson said Monday night .
" We live in a constitutional democracy , and no one has the right to be judge and jury . "
The FBI 's Baltimore field office said it has opened a civil rights investigation into White 's death .
The Justice Department said Tuesday that federal prosecutors have been in contact with the state police and FBI as well as county prosecutors and the department 's own Civil Rights Division .
" In support of the Prince George 's County State 's Attorney 's Office , which intends to retain lead responsibility for the criminal investigation , the U.S. Attorney 's Office will provide guidance and legal advice to the officials looking into the death and seeking to develop evidence of criminal violations , " the department said in a written statement .
Johnson said Monday that he had requested that the Maryland State Police conduct an independent investigation into White 's death .
White family attorney Bobby Henry said there are only two ways someone could get into solitary confinement .
Watch why death has outraged family »
" You either have to be buzzed in from the booth -- I believe it 's called the control booth -- you need a key from there , or you have to get a key from one of two officers who were assigned to his unit on that day , " Henry said .
The attorney said a " yet to be identified person or persons took it upon themselves to be the judge , jury and executioner for Mr. White . "
" The family of Ronnie White is absolutely , unequivocally outraged , incensed and deeply saddened that the life of their loved one could be taken so cold[ly ] , so callously , " Henry said Tuesday .
" Something is dreadfully wrong with the system . "
County authorities have said that police are not suspects and that seven corrections officials and an unspecified number of supervisors were the only ones authorized to be in White 's cell .
None has been suspended or removed .
There were no surveillance cameras in the area of the jail where White was being held .
White had not had the opportunity to meet with an attorney , Henry said .
A physical conducted when White was processed revealed no health issues , according to Johnson .
He was checked regularly in his cell and appeared fine when corrections officers saw him at 10:15 a.m. Sunday .
When officers brought him lunch 20 minutes later , he was unconscious and without a pulse , Johnson said .
Henry said
White 's family was not notified of his death until several hours after it occurred .
They were told to go to Prince George 's Hospital to identify the body , he said , but upon arrival were told the state medical examiner 's office had taken custody of the body and it had been taken to Baltimore .
" At this very moment , the family has not even seen the body of their loved one , " Henry said .
" They have been denied the opportunity to start the grieving process which naturally must occur . "
He said White 's family is calling upon the Department of Justice , the FBI , the Maryland State Police and county officials " to conduct a thorough and exhaustive investigation into all of these tragic events , beginning with the events of Friday , June 27 , and continuing up until this time . "
Prince George 's County State 's Attorney Glenn
Ivey said a grand jury will be convened in the case .
He said his office , which will handle any prosecutions that might result , is keeping an open mind .
" We 'll follow the evidence wherever it leads , " he said .
He added that he 's " never seen one like this .
We 've had deaths in custody , but this could be a unique one . "

This is the back story to the development of NYTProf v2 .
Earlier this year ( 2008 ) I needed to do some performance profiling of the source code of a large application .
Like many perl developers , my first instinct was to try using Devel : : DProf ( actually the Apache : : DProf wrapper as it was a mod_perl application ) .
It was not a great experience .
DProf
DProf seems easily confused by unusual control flow , spewing “… has unstacked calls ” warnings .
Also , the subroutines it said were taking the most time did n’t make sense to me .
Eventually I worked out that Devel : : DProf is effectively broken .
The application I was trying to profile has quite a few large subroutines , so knowing just the time spent in the subroutine as a whole did n’t help much for those .
I wanted to know where in the subroutine the time was being spent .
FastProf
That led me to look at line - based profilers .
At the time there as only one worth looking at , Devel : : FastProf by Salvador Fandiño García ( which was based on Devel : : SmallProf by Ted Ashton ) .
Line profilers spit out a stream of “ file id , line number , time spent ” records to a file .
The time between starting one statement and starting the next is measured and associated with the line number of the statement .
Devel : : FastProf was great .
Fast and effective .
It gave me far more accurate timings , and when I made changes in the code it highlighted I could see an immediate effect on performance .
Devel :: FastProf was great , but I wanted more .
The lack of subroutine level timing was frustrating .
When you have a ~ 100,000 lines of code , knowing the time spent on each , and how many times it was executed , is less useful than you may think – there ’s just too much detail .
Especially when looking for structural problems in the code , or for good places to add caching , or pass extra information down a call chain to save expensive calls deeper in the code .
There ’s a need for both subroutine and line level timings when profiling .
Idea
I ’d had an idea :
The line number output in the FastProf profile need not be the line number of the statement .
It could output the line number of the subroutine containing the statement .
Then you ’d automatically get subroutine level timings !
Simple .
Then I wondered if it was possible to find the line number of the block the statement was in .
That would give block level timing !
A first for any perl profiler .
My perl internals knowledge was getting rusty as it was a few years since I ’d been Pumpkin for the 5.4.x release , so I asked the wizards on perl5 - porters .
They gave me hope and enough clues to get going .
Salvador kindly moved the Devel : : FastProf code to a public svn , so I could contribute more easily , and I started hacking .
I added code to find the nearest enclosing block or sub and it proved very useful .
When I ’m optimizing I start by identifying “ locally inefficient code ” .
That is , code you can optimize without significant structural changes .
Without making changes outside the subroutine .
Moving code outside loops is a common example .
Subroutine timings identify the hot subs , then block and line timings pinpoint the hot spots in the code .
That ’s the low hanging fruit .
Easy pickings , and often very effective .
But there ’s a limit to how far that ’ll take you .
Callers and Callees
There are two ways to optimize a hot piece of code : make it faster , or execute it less often .
The former tends to get much more attention than the latter .
It ’s important to remember to keep stepping back .
To keep looking for the bigger picture .
When I ’m optimizing I often use a well defined chunk of work , like 10 requests to the same URL , so I can see of the number of times a subroutine is called “ feels right ” .
That often shows subs being called “ too often ” .
But what then ?
You need to know why the sub is being called too often , so you need to know where it ’s being called from .
In Devel : : FastProf I added counting of subroutine callers two - levels up the call stack .
So I could see that foo( ) was called 10 times by bar ( ) and that of those 10 calls from bar ( ) 7 has come from baz ( ) and 3 from boo ( ) .
It was very simplistic , slow ( implemented in perl ) and only had counts , not timings , but proved very useful .
Using these additions to Devel : : FastProf I reduced the CPU usage of the application by over 40 % .
Not bad .
( I could see another 10 % or so to be gained fairly easily but had to draw the line somewhere . )
NYTProf
Meanwhile Adam Kaplan had forked Devel : : FastProf , added a test harness and tests , made some internal improvements , grafted on an html report derived from Devel : : Cover , and released it as Devel : : NYTProf .
When I saw NYTProf I switched to working on that .
Again , Adam was kind enough to move the code to a public svn repository .
I was attracted not so much by the html report as by the test harness .
A lesson to anyone wanting to attract developers to an open source project !
Testing profilers is hard and Adam had come up with a good basic testing framework which was easy to extend .
NYTProf now has a strong test suite that profiles 19 different perl scripts with four different combinations of profiler options .
The test suite has proven invaluable in identifying regressions during development , and for identifying portability issues between perl versions .
I re-implemented the block / sub level profiling and the subroutine caller tracking from FastProf in NYTProf , but with more care , more attention to performance , and now tests .
I was particularly pleased with the subroutine caller tracking .
It intercepts the entersub opcode and uses the save stack for storage and to trigger a ‘ destructor ’ call to end the timing when the subroutine is exited by any means .
The end result is an extremely fast and robust subroutine call profiler .
I plan to add an option to disable the other profiler so you can just get subroutine profile details when you do n’t need statement level details .
It currently lacks the ability to give exclusive times but I think I ’ve an efficient solution for that .
( Update : Implemented in r340 and r343 so will be in the 2.02 release . )
Accuracy
Another key innovation was to fix a fundamental problem inherent in all statement profilers .
Consider a statement that calls a subroutine and then performs some other work that does n’t execute new statements , for example :
foo ( ... ) || mkdir ( ... ) ;
In all other statement profilers the time spent in remainder of the expression ( mkdir in the example ) will be recorded as having been spent on the last statement executed in foo ( ) !
Here ’s another example :
while ( <> ) { ... 1 ; }
After the first time around the loop , any further time spent evaluating the condition ( waiting for input in this example ) would be be recorded as having been spent on the last statement executed in the loop !
I fixed this in NYTProf by intercepting all the opcodes which indicate that control is returning into some previous statement and adjusting the profile accordingly .
Reporting
As much effort , if not more , went into the reporting side of the code .
And there ’s a lot more to be done there .
My goal is to keep growing the data model classes to the point where any reporting code can get the information it needs easily enough that there ’s no longer a need for the rather limiting Reporter class .
I ’d like to see a single ‘ nytprof ’ command line tool that loads a class to generate the report .
That would replace nytprofhtml and nytprofcsv .
That would make it easy for other developers to release ‘ nytprof reporting modules ’ to CPAN .
For example , one very useful report that FastProf has but NTProf currently lacks is a list of most expensive lines ( or blocks , or subs ) output in the format used by compiler error messages .
The format is important because most editors have a special mode for reading such files that means you can hop from one ‘ most expensive line ’ to the next with a single key stroke .
( For vim that ’s called quickfix mode . )
That ’s a wonderful way to browse the hotspots and make edits on the spot .
Future
There are many , many , ways NYTProf can be enhanced further .
As I ’ve worked on it I ’ve dumped ideas , issues and random notes into the HACKING file .
Thanks
I ’d like to end by expressing my thanks to Salvador Fandiño García and especially Adam Kaplan for allowing me to contribute to the modules they created and tolerating my strong ideas with understanding .
Thank you both .
It ’s been quite a ride .
Pain and inequality
By Kathy G .
The results of this new study on pain assessment by Princeton ’s Alan Krueger and SUNY Stony Brook ’s Arthur Stone are for the most part not particularly surprising .
As it turns out , economic inequality impacts practically every dimension of human existence ; even physical pain is unequally shared .
For example , the Krueger / Stone study found that respondents with low socio-economic status experienced “ significantly higher pain occurrences and severity . ”
For instance :
The average pain rating is twice as high for those in households with annual incomes below $ 30,000 as for those in households with incomes above $ 100,000 .
And
Participants with less than a high school degree reported twice the average pain rating as did college graduates .
Occupational status seems to play an important role , given that
the average pain rating for blue collar workers is 1.00 during work and 0.84 during nonwork , and for white collar workers it is 0.61 during both work and non-work episodes .
And in an interview , Krueger said , “ Those with higher incomes welcome pain almost by choice , usually through exercise , ” he says .
“ At lower incomes , pain comes as the result of work . ”
It ’s a pretty decent study ; though the response rate was low enough ( 37 % ) to be worrying , the sample was weighted to reflect the composition of the general population .
It ’s also an improvement on earlier surveys which had asked for retrospective estimates of pain over the past month .
This survey , by contrast , asks about pain experienced in the last day , and such contemporaneous estimates tend to be more reliable .
The results are n’t exactly news ; other studies have shown that pain and socioeconomic status tend to be inversely related .
But Krueger said the relationship between pain and socioeconomic status was “ stronger ” than he expected .
What are the policy implications ?
Well , for one thing , the authors say :
The strong association between self - reported disability status and pain is notable given concerns by economists and some policymakers that able - bodied individuals may seek benefits from the Disability Insurance system .
So maybe , just maybe , all those people applying for disability are n’t just a bunch of perfectly able - bodied fakers and whiners after all ?
Also , one expert says the results demonstrate “ the need for pain preventing measures [ in the workplace ] such as better ergonomics . ”
Well maybe , but it ’s hard to see how even the most high - quality ergonomic devices are going to make life much easier for people who make a living by scrubbing floors all day , or lifting heavy boxes .
And sure , a health care system that provided universal access and did a better job at pain management would help things , too .
Given that pain is higher among blue collar workers than among white collar workers , and given that pain tends to increase with age , retirement has got to look to very different to blue collar workers who have done physical labor all their life , than it does to their more sedentary white collar counterparts .
Conservatives and other Social Security crisis - mongerers love to scream about how if we do n’t raise the retirement age the Social Security fund will go bankrupt .
The more honest ones do n’t claim Social Security is going to go under any time soon , but they do say that , given increased life expectancy , increasing the retirement age only makes sense .
In fact , I once heard a University of Chicago economics professor make that very argument .
It was a lecture so I could n’t interrupt , but it was exasperating to listen to .
Easy for you to say , Mr. Economics Professor !
You can do your job until you ’re 100 , or until senility sets in , at least .
But what about the people who scrub toilets for a living ?
Or health care workers who spend much of their work day manually lifting patients ?
Asking people to do highly physically demanding jobs like those until they ’re 65 is already asking quite a lot .
There ’s a reason why the classic union steelworker contract had a “ 30 and out ” pension provision .
After 30 years on the job , a lot of those guys ’ bodies had taken so much that they were n’t physically capable of doing physical labor anymore .
So please , let ’s not hear anything more about raising the Social Security retirement age .
If the Krueger and Stone report can help policymakers get it through their heads that folks who do physical labor experience significantly higher levels of pain , and that that pain increases as they age , maybe they ’ll think twice about raising the Social Security retirement age .
And that would be a very good thing indeed .

America ’s OTHER space program is how John Powell bills his airship to orbit program .
This endeavour , wonderfully encapsulated in his book Floating to Space , describes a less than typical application of a well - known technology .
Using the concept of dynamic climbing , he believes and shows that airships are the better method to putting people and material into space .
Airships are n’t new .
The Montgolfier brothers made the first modern edition and , since then , lighter - than - air transportation has been used to make determinations of weather in high latitudes , as well as to film sports events .
Effectively , by trapping a less dense gas within an envelope , the envelope and a payload ascend .
John Powell is fine tuning this concept for travelling into orbit and plans to soon elevate appreciable payloads to above 400 kilometres .
And , as we all know , at that height , space travel becomes quite achievable .
Given this unconventional concept , Powell ’s book follow the standard fare of all space dreamers .
Like these , his book starts by admonishing the reader to accept physics and forgo tradition .
Next , he justifies his beliefs by providing a review history .
For example , did you know that the Nazca drawings might have been directed by a fellow in a hot air balloon ?
Continuing on , he provides a rational description of the current abilities of airships and their kin and ably convinces the reader that airships have got potential .
Now , if the reader perseveres through this brief background , they will get into the really exciting stuff .
For it seems that John Powell is as much an engineer as he is a dreamer .
Having amassed more than 80 missions over the previous 15 years , he can draw upon real experience and he does so in presenting the reader with steps he ’s made of real progress .
For example , during the early times he describes shooting rockets from balloons , nicknamed rockoons .
Toward the end , he describes how he ’s now floating platforms to above 100 000 feet .
This story would warm any engineer ’s heart .
The technical progress described would set their hearts on fire .
Complementing the book is an enclosed DVD that is part documentary and part fanfare .
In it , Powell ’s placed some choice video taken from payloads as they climb to way - up - high and other videos that show a quite rapid descent from the same height .
Equally exciting segments include footage of the next generation craft , Ascender 90 , with ‘ wings ’ over 90 feet in length .
It gently rises massively above a hanger floor as if coming to life for the first time .
Given that this is a taste of things to come , this book is a wonderful place marker of what ’s happened to date in Powell ’s program and where things will hopefully be going .
In sum , this book ’s got the touch of a visionary and the feel of a practitioner .
It showcases a small cadre of people working against the grain of the norm .
Yet , similarly , their goal is to achieve a great benefit for everyone .
Optimism exudes from the pages as do technical triumphs .
And , success just seems around the corner so that the reader may feel themselves getting drawn into the excitement and look to contribute .
Though not as flashy as rockets , airships provide similar capabilities .
Both loft massive payloads up above the atmosphere .
John Powell ’s book Floating to Space â€ “ The Airship to Orbit Program shows the feasibility of this endeavour as well as results of his own efforts .
With time , it seems , this program is destined for a lofty future .

I mentioned in last Saturday 's letter a report by Louis Gave of GaveKal fame on whether inflation may be waning and its importance .
Louis gave me permission to use it as this week 's Outside the Box .
It is typical of the thoughtful analytical work they do .
Louis and his partners and associates at GaveKal write some of the more thought - provoking material I read .
They really challenge my position on numerous matters , causing me to look at many items from a different view .
That of course , makes this particular piece good for Outside the Box .
Whether you agree or disagree , you need to know why you hold a position .
If you can't articulate the " against , " how can you be sure you truly understand the " for " ?
I think given the current debate on inflation , this week 's Outside the Box is a must read .
While it may look longer , there are a lot of very important graphs here .
And thanks to Doug Harrison for helping with the tricky technical aspects of getting this letter out today .
It was a lot more than a simple cut and paste , and way beyond my pay grade .
And congratulations to Louis and his wife Kelly who by this time may have a new child .
She was due any minute on Friday .
I trust you are enjoying your summer .
I will be on Larry Kudlow 's show tomorrow evening and then having dinner with he and Louis ' father Charles ( and Tiffani of course ) .
And expect an announcement about a new survey in the next few days .

The End of the Inflation Scare ?
by Louis - Vincent Gave
While most economists and strategists spend time worrying about growth , changes in inflation are usually a much greater driver of financial markets than changes in economic activity .
This is because :
1- A surge in inflation usually increases volatility of economic growth -- which in turn reduces P/ Es and the willingness of the private sector to take risks .
2- As highlighted in The Myth of Reverting Margins , inflation typically takes a much meaner bite out of margins than a recession does .
As we wrote back then concerning the US growth / margin relationship : " Margins bear little relationship to the level of GDP or consumption growth .
In fact , as the economy accelerated from the mid-1960s to the early 1980s , margins plunged .
Similarly , as the economy slowed from the early 1980s to the present , margins accelerated ...
It is inflation , not growth , which wreaks havoc on profit margins ( ironically , if everyone has pricing power , no one makes money ) .
3- Finally , a surge in inflation typically means interest rates will be rising in the near future .
Which means that investors get to lose money on both bonds and equities .
For example , from 1966 to 1980 ( i.e. : the last " inflationary surge " period ) , US bonds shed - 2 % per annum and US equities fell - 4.9 % per year .
Unsurprisingly , given the above , fears are now running high that we may have reentered such an " inflationary bust " period ( see The Inflationary Bust Threat ) .
And to be sure , growth almost everywhere around the world is slowing while inflation in almost every country is still accelerating .
Now everyone knows where the slowdown in growth comes from : de-leveraging in the financial sector , overextended consumers needing to tighten their belts , transfers of wealth from the private sector to the public sector through high oil prices , etc ...
And there are of course myriad opinions as to how long the slowdown will last .
But meanwhile , on inflation , our clients seem to be much longer on questions than answers .
Where does the current inflation spike come from ?
How long is it going to last ?
And can inflation abate without a " Paul Volcker " like monetary policy from the Fed ?
In this ad hoc comment , we aim to review some of these questions and , as we always tend to do -- answer these questions with yet more questions of our own !
1- Where Does the Inflation Come From ?
Just like George Orwell 's farm animals , all currencies are equal ... though , of course , one is more equal than others .
Indeed , the US $ remains the world 's reserve currency and , thanks to this status , foreigners cannot impose a particular kind of monetary policy unto the US .
As Treasury Secretary Connolly once said : " the US $ is our currency and your problem " .
And lately , there is little doubt that the US $ has indeed become the world 's problem , with its fall in value associated with the spike in commodity prices , which in turn has triggered a sharp upturn in inflation rates all around the world , but especially in the emerging markets ( where food and energy represent a much bigger piece of the average family 's spending than in most OECD countries ) .
But of course , the surge in commodity prices cannot be the sole explanation for the recent surge in inflation numbers around the world .
After all , an event like the spike in oil prices could also prove to be highly deflationary , since it takes money from the private sector and gives it to the public sector which will typically waste it ( i.e. : Chavez financing Castro , Ahmadinejad subsidizing Hamas and Hezbollah , etc ... ) .
For a commodity price spike to be inflationary , it needs to be accompanied by excess money creation .
If it is not , all that we witness is a change in relative prices across the economy ( i.e. : oil prices up , auto and house prices down ) .
This is why Milton Friedman once said that " inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon " while , around the same time , Jacques Rueff made the observation that " inflation is subsidizing expenditures that give no returns with money that does not exist " .
So given that we are now living through a surge in inflationary prices , the questions we should ask ourselves is a ) where the excess liquidity creation of recent years has come from ?
and b ) whether excess liquidity continues to be pushed into the system , hereby guaranteeing further increases in inflation in the coming quarters and years ?
2- What Explains the Surge in the Amount of Money ?
As highlighted above , the US $ is " more equal " than other currencies and , consequently , the Fed holds a " special place " in our current financial system .
Undeniably , the Fed is the world 's most important central bank and it is thus not that surprising that , as inflationary pressures accelerate around the world , most people are quick to blame the Fed for " falling asleep at the wheel " and allowing money supply in the US to grow unchecked .
But is this a valid criticism ?
After all , as the charts below highlight , narrow money supply growth in the US ( i.e. : the aggregate mostly under the control of the Fed ) has not seen much of a rise in recent years ( incidentally , the same can be said about Japan and money growth is now decelerating fast in Europe ) :
While the Fed did print money aggressively between 2002 and 2005 ( M1 annual growth was above +5 % and sometimes close to +10 % ) , in recent years , the pace of monetary creation has by and large been tame .
So the ‘ excess money ' had to come from somewhere else .
Now as we never tire of pointing out , two sets of players can create money ex- nihilo in our system : central banks and commercial banks .
So if the excess liquidity creation has not been the central banks , then the explanation must lie with the commercial banks .
And sure enough , in recent years , banks have ridden the ' financial revolution ' as hard as they possibly could and we have witnessed an unprecedented expansion in credit ( witness the growth in C&I loans at US banks , red line below ) :
And , as we now know , money creation off the banks ' balance sheets was also , until recently , going strong .
Witness , for example , the rapid expansion in corporate paper outstanding in the period between 2003 and 2007 ( red line below ) :
To return to our old favorite , Irving Fisher 's equation of MV=PQ , it seems obvious to us that the current increase in P ( prices ) has more to do with the past few years ' extremely buoyant V ( velocity ) than excessive M ( money ) growth .
A possibility which immediately raises the question of whether velocity will remain as buoyant over the next two years as it did in the 2003 - 2007 period .
3- Will Velocity Remain As Strong ?
As the chart below suggests , the answer to the above question is a simple " No " .
With bank balance sheets under severe strain , and with bank shares almost everywhere around the world plumbing new depths , an increase in the willingness to take risk from private lenders would be very surprising .
And sure enough , after its longest period ever in negative territory , our velocity indicator is once again negative after a brief respite :
This message of slowing private sector liquidity growth is also confirmed when adding the loans at commercial banks with the issuance of commercial paper ( for a total private credit growth aggregate - - blue line on following page ) .
We have slumped from an annual growth rate of +13 % in private credit one year ago to +2.8 % today ; a level not seen since 2003 ( see chart ) .
So we are now in a situation where a )
The Fed is not printing money and b) US financials are de-leveraging rapidly .
Thus , if inflation is " always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon " , one may conclude that what we are now seeing in the inflation numbers is the echo of the 2003 - 2007 credit boom , but that looking ahead , the inflation picture should start improving rather dramatically .
But such a conclusion would miss out on the other big contributor to global liquidity growth , namely the US current account deficit .
4- The Importance of the US Current Account Deficit
Because the US $ is " more equal " than other currencies in our global system , the US current account deficit plays a specific , and very important , role in our global monetary systems .
In essence , the US current account deficit provides the world with its working capital .
After all , at any given point , the world needs US $ .
For example , Nokia needs US $ to pay for the chips it may buy in Taiwan .
China needs US $ to pay for the iron ore it buys from Australia and Sweden needs US $ to pay for the oil it buys from neighboring Norway ...
This is why , whenever we see an improvement in the US current account deficit , somebody somewhere goes bust .
Indeed , when the US exports a lot of dollars , then the rest of the worlds gets used to a " plentiful " liquidity situation ... and when the US exports less money , then somebody gets cut off .
So in essence , the current account deficit has always been the mechanism through which the United States could reflate , or deflate , the global economy .
When the US current account deficit improved , the US deflated other countries and vice versa .
Now today , the US current account deficit still stands at a rather large 6 % of GDP .
However , the composition of this deficit has changed dramatically : two years ago , around two - thirds of the US deficit went to non-oil producers and one third was for petroleum products .
Today , that situation is inversed to the point where one could argue that , while the US is still reflating oil producing countries ( which hardly need it ) , it is now deflating non-oil producing countries by around 2 % of GDP .
Moreover , should oil prices start pulling back , we would move extremely rapidly into a situation where the US current account deficit was deflating the whole world ( below is a chart we borrowed from The Economist ) !
The fact that the US is no longer reflating non-oil producing countries is a very important change in our economies .
Indeed , over the past few years , the prevalent belief amongst investors of all stripes has been : a ) the US runs a large current account deficit , b ) that US interest rates are low , and that , consequently c ) the value of the US $ could only fall .
And if the value of the US $ could only fall , then borrowing in US $ to finance whatever real estate project , factory , or financial market speculation made perfect sense .
This is why , in a number of countries , we started to witness a growth in central bank reserves which far outpaced trade surpluses and foreign direct investment inflows ; all of a sudden , a number of large countries started to save more than they earned !
But how can one save more than one earns ?
The answer , we have argued in the past ( see The Surprisingly Strong Growth in Chinese Reserves ) is simple : one borrows the difference .
As mentioned above , if the perception is that the US $ can only fall against the RMB , INR , VND , MYR , etc ... then why borrow in local currency to finance one 's capital expenditures or investments ?
Much better to finance any spending in the ever falling , and cheap to borrow , US $ !
So what happens when a Chinese property developer , or a Vietnamese industrialist , borrows US $ to finance his latest project ?
The first thing he does is that he changes the dollars he does not need for RMB , Rupee , Dong , etc ...
And , at this point , the foreign central bank has three choices :
1- It can allow its currency to rise .
This is what Brazil , South Korea ... have done in recent years .
2- It can print money to prevent its currency from rising and then sterilize its FX intervention .
3- It can print money to prevent its currency from rising and just accept the consequences of fast money supply growth ( usually higher inflation and asset prices ) .
And by and large , this is what most nations on the other side of the US current account deficit ( i.e. : Asia and OPEC ) have done .
And unsurprisingly , these are the countries that are today dealing with the largest inflation threats .
We would thus argue that the US current account deficit has been a double inflationary force for the world at large .
First , the US current account deficit has pushed a number of countries towards reflation , and secondly , the large US current account deficit has helped propagate the belief that the US $ could only fall , and thus encouraged large borrowings of US $ outside of the US .
And the US current account deficit , combined with the willingness to borrow US$ , has been an inflationary force for more than just Asia and the Middle East .
It may also explain the surge in money growth in Europe !
Indeed , with central bank reserves growing very rapidly around the world ( despite a high oil price which , at the very least , should have drained the reserves of Asian and European countries ) , central banks such as the PBoC or the RBI have likely spent the past few years diversifying their reserves , which for all intents and purposes means buying the Euro ...
And , as we argued in our book The End is Not Nigh , this " diversification " of reserves means buying European government bonds or , in other words , subsidizing the expenditures of foreign governments with domestically borrowed money .
Et voila !
We are now back to Jacques Rueff 's definition of inflation being " a policy which subsidizes expenditures that give no returns ( i.e. : government spending in Europe or the US ) being financed with money that does not exist ( i.e. : central bank reserves that have been borrowed , not earned ) ! "
5- Will the US Deficit Continue to be an Inflationary Force ?
Having established that one of the main factors of excess liquidity growth in the world ( the willingness of the financial sector to lend very aggressively ) had now disappeared , can we rely on the US current account deficit to continue providing excess liquidity to the world .
Will an ever growing US trade deficit continue to force other countries to reflate and lead to an ever lower US $ ?
We tend to believe that the answer to that question is a very firm " no " .
And , this for several reasons :
Reason # 1 : As reviewed on page 6 , the US current account deficit is already improving .
Moreover , since oil is now a bigger percentage of the US deficit , should oil prices roll over , we could witness the most rapid improvement in the US current account deficit ever seen .
But even without oil rolling over , the recent weakness of the US $ argues for a continued improvement in the deficit :
As does the weakness in US housing :
Meanwhile , the prevalent belief of recent years that borrowing US $ to invest in local currencies was a " no- brainer " is now undergoing a significant test .
For example , in recent months , the " long dong " strategy has undeniably failed ( the black market now expects a devaluation of over 20 % in the Vietnamese currency ) .
The strategy is also failing in India where the Rupee , to many investors ' surprise , has been amazingly weak in recent months ....
In fact , an interesting development is occurring on the US $ : fewer and fewer currencies have lately been rising against the US $ and this despite some pretty poor news from the US ( MBIA downgrade , fears on Lehman , weak housing , weak growth , high oil , fears of war with Iran ... ) .
Now the typical pattern for an equity bull market is that , as it nears its peak , fewer and fewer shares make new highs even as indices keep on powering ahead .
Major corrections are typically preceded by a narrowing breadth ...
And today , we are undeniably witnessing a deteriorating breath in the " anti- US $ " bull market :
To cut a long story short , and with hindsight , the large US current account deficit and the weak US $ were another very potent inflationary force in our system .
But , at least at the margin , these inflationary forces should abate , rather than acceler - ate , over the coming months .
6- Conclusion
There is little doubt that , right now , inflation is proving to be a massive headwind for financial markets .
And part of that " inflation headwind " is the fear that the Fed , the ECB and other central banks will have little choice but to tighten monetary policy in the coming months .
This is most likely true of some central banks , but maybe not all ?
After all , looking around the world , the inflationary threat is a sure thing in certain regions , and less of a threat in others :
In the US : In a recent paper ( see The Dollar 's Successful Devaluation ) , Charles argued that the Fed had just managed to engineer a " good devaluation " for the US$ , whereby the currency is brought down without an explosion in monetary aggregates and a rapid acceleration in inflation .
This makes the economy competitive and local assets attractive for foreigners .
Since then , not much has happened to warrant a change in this view .
In fact , since then , the main development has been the roll - over in velocity and renewed fears as to the health of the US financial sector .
With velocity plummeting , we think that the bond market is broadly right to not anticipate an acceleration in US inflation .
In Euroland : Just like in the US , the bond market does not seem to really anticipate a massive surge in inflation .
And given the very overvalued currency and the inverted yield curve , this makes sense to us .

And given the very overvalued currency and the inverted yield curve , this makes sense to us .
In the Middle East :
The one region of the world which is still experiencing reflation from the US current account deficit is the Middle - East ( and to a lesser extent Russia ) .
The unwillingness of policymakers to revalue their currencies ( see The Arab Pegs ) and the inability of local central banks to sterilize their FX intervention means that the local economies are condemned to continue experiencing inflation as long as they refuse to revalue their currency .
More worryingly , a pursuit of the current fixed exchange rate , inflationary policies could lead local economies into the same kind of boom - bust cycle that Vietnam ( and maybe India ? ) are now having to endure .

In India and Southeast Asia :
If the US went through a ‘ good devaluation ' ( i.e. : a lower currency without a spike in inflation , triggering an increase in foreign and domestic investments and productivity gains ) , then it increasingly looks as if India and Southeast Asia have just gone through a ‘ bad devaluation ' ( i.e. : a lower currency which brings about fast money growth , higher inflation , deteriorating trade balances and foreign investor flight ) .
As such , certain countries ( India , Vietnam ... ) are now stuck in the unfortunate position of having to defend their currencies , which is rarely conducive to either economic , or asset price growth .

As such , certain countries ( India , Vietnam ... ) are now stuck in the unfortunate position of having to defend their currencies , which is rarely conducive to either economic , or asset price growth .
In China : Inflation is undeniably a problem but , thus far , it seems to be mostly contained to food and energy prices ( see A Dummy 's Guide to Chinese Inflation ) .
Meanwhile , the only pressures on the RMB are still of a positive nature .
Thus , if either the US $ rebounds or commodities roll over ( two events that are likely to happen simultaneously ) , China 's inflation problem could dissipate relatively quickly .
Chinese and HK shares would then soar .
Inflation is undeniably a problem but , thus far , it seems to be mostly contained to food and energy prices ( see ) .
Meanwhile , the only pressures on the RMB are still of a positive nature .
Thus , if either the US $ rebounds or commodities roll over ( two events that are likely to happen simultaneously ) , China 's inflation problem could dissipate relatively quickly .
Chinese and HK shares would then soar .
In Japan , Korea , and Taiwan : Japan , Korea and Taiwan have seen little " hot money " inflows in recent years and have also been better at letting their currencies rise against the US $ ( this year , the NT $ is one of the world 's best performing currencies with a +6.5 % rise while the KRW was one of the best performing Asian currencies between 2004 and 2006 ) .
In general rule , these countries today have far less of an inflationary problem than the rest of Asia :
While the markets had started to rally in April and early May , the spike in oil prices fuelled fears of faster inflation and triggered a threat of coming rate hikes from the Fed and the ECB .
In turn , all these events weighed down equity markets around the world .
However , as we have tried to show in this paper :
The inflation threat is very different between countries .
At most risk today are the Middle East , India and Southeast Asia .
Meanwhile , inflation is far less of a threat in the US , Japan and North Asia .
Given the fact that the forces behind the recent pick - up in inflation are now turning around ( strong willingness to take risk amongst financial firms , growing US current account deficits , overall weakness in the US$ ) , inflation could well start abating in the coming quarters .
Moreover , with the turnaround in velocity and the implosion in the banking systems , it seems increasingly likely that neither the Fed , nor the ECB will be willing / have to match their recent hawkishness with rate hikes .
As inflation rolls over in the OECD , the leadership of equity markets should go through a serious adjustment .

The anti-Russian bias of the Western media is really something to behold : “ Russia Invades Georgia , ” “ Russia Attacks Georgia , ” and variations thereof have been some of the choice headlines reporting events in the Caucasus , but the reality is not only quite different , but the exact opposite .
Sometimes this comes out in the third or fourth paragraph of the reportage , in which it is admitted that the Georgians tried to “ retake ” the “ breakaway province ” of South Ossetia .
The Georgian bombing campaign and the civilian casualties  if they are mentioned at all  are downplayed and presented as subject to dispute .
The Georgians have been openly engaging in a military buildup since last year , and President Mikhail Saakashvili and his party have been proclaiming from the rooftops their aim of re-conquering South Ossetia ( and rebellious Abkhazia , while they ’re at it ) .
Avid readers of Antiwar.com saw this coming .
In a column entitled “ Wars to Watch Out For , ” I wrote :
“ As President Mikheil Saakashvili deflowers his own revolution and shuts down the opposition media , he could well try to divert attention away from his political problems by ginning up a fresh conflict with the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia , both of which are protected by Russian troops and regional militias . ”
That ’s what Western reporters are n’t telling their readers : the South Ossetians ( and the Abkhazians ) have had de facto independence since 1991 , when they rose up against their “ democratic ” central government , which had banned regional parties from participating in elections .
They beat back the Georgian army , which , nonetheless , inflicted a lot of casualties and damage .
A low - level war has been in progress ever since , with Saakashvili and his ultra-nationalist party using the rebels as a foil to divert attention from their repressive domestic policies and Georgia ’s sad status as an economic basket case .
As I wrote way back at the beginning of this year :
“ Saakashvili , the great ‘ democrat , ’ is busy charging anyone who opposes him with being a pawn of the Russians ( and therefore guilty of treason ) , but the West is calling on him to restore civil liberties  and , in an apparent effort to propitiate his Western benefactors , he has lifted some restrictions and called new elections .
Widespread and growing opposition to his strong - arm tactics , even among many of his former supporters , spells political trouble for Saakashvili and his corrupt cohorts , however  and an appeal to Georgian ultra-nationalism ( which was always the real ideological motivation of the Rose Revolutionaries ) would bolster him in the polls and provide a much - needed distraction , at least from the ruling party ’s point of view . ”
What ’s particularly disgusting is the spectacle of the fraudulent Saakashvili ’s smug mug all over Western television  the BBC and Bloomberg , for starters  invoking his great love of “ democracy ” and “ freedom ” and calling on the U.S. to intervene in the name of supposedly shared “ values . ”
What drivel !
Up until very recently , Saakashvili has been busy rounding up his political opponents and charging them with espionage , as his police beat demonstrators in the streets .
When this happened , even our somnolent media sat up and took notice , but they seem to have forgotten .
Saakashvili uses the Western media as a platform to broadcast his great love for “ freedom ” and make the case against the Russian “ aggressors , ” comparing the present conflict with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in the 1980s  and even the bloody 1956 repression of the Hungarians !
This is nonsense .
Russia is not the Soviet Union , the Iron Curtain has long since been melted down for scrap metal , and , if anything , Saakashvili resembles the Hungarian satraps of the Kremlin rather than the heroic freedom - fighters , given his absolute fealty to his foreign masters in Washington , to whom he appeals for help in putting down an internal rebellion .
In any case , it was n’t too hard to have seen this coming a mile away , or to predict the American government ’s response .
As I wrote in “ Wars To Watch Out For ” :
“ In the event of an outbreak of hostilities , expect the U.S. to do what they have done for the duration of Georgia ’s political crisis : proffer unconditional support to Saakashvili .
With Russia aiding and giving political and diplomatic support to the Abkhazians and the Ossetians , and the Americans letting loose a flood of military aid to Tbilisi , this could be the first theater of actual conflict in the new cold war . ”
Which is precisely what has occurred .
The United States is denouncing the Russians as aggressors in the UN Security Council and accusing the Kremlin of engaging in a policy of “ regime change , ” in Ambassador Khalilzad ’s phrase .
The Russian response : “ regime change ” is “ an American invention , ” but , hey , in Saakashvili ’s case , it might not be such a bad idea .
They have a point .
The Georgian strongman is a thug and an opportunist who does an excellent imitation of George W. Bush - times - 10 : whereas GWB merely implies his political opponents are traitors to the nation , Saakashvili comes right out and says it  then drags them into court on trumped up charges of high treason .
GWB has presided over a regime that has legalized torture , but only for foreign “ terrorists ” ( José Padilla excepted ) .
Saakashvili , on the other hand , throws his domestic political opponents  whom he labels “ terrorists ”  in jail and tortures his own countrymen .
Georgia ’s notorious prisons are chock full of political dissidents .
GWB justifies his aggression by invoking “ democracy ” and the doctrine of “ preemption , ” while Saakashvili does n’t bother with such theoretical niceties , denying his aggression against South Ossetia in defiance of the plain facts .
In short : if you love GWB , you ’ll love President Saakashvili .
Therefore it ’s no surprise John McCain is portraying the Georgians as the good guys and demanding that Russian troops leave “ sovereign Georgian territory ” without preconditions or delay .
After all , when your chief foreign policy adviser has up until very recently been a paid shill for the Georgian government , what else could we expect ?
As I ’ve pointed out on a few occasions in this space , Mad John has been spoiling for a fight with the Russians  in the Caucasus and elsewhere  for years , going so far as to travel to Georgia to proclaim his sympathy for Saakashvili ’s cause .
What ’s really interesting , however , is how Barack Obama has taken up this same cause , albeit with less vehemence than the GOP nominee .
As Politico.com reported :
“ When violence broke out in the Caucasus on Friday morning , John McCain quickly issued a statement that was far more strident toward the Russians than that of President Bush , Barack Obama , and much of the West .
But , as Russian warplanes pounded Georgian targets far beyond South Ossetia this weekend , Bush , Obama , and others have moved closer to McCain ’s initial position . ”
While calling for mediation and international peacekeepers , Obama went with the War Party ’s line that Russia , not Georgia , is the aggressor , as the Times of London reports : “ Obama accused Russia of escalating the crisis ‘ through it ’s clear and continued violation of Georgia ’s sovereignty and territorial integrity . ' ”
While his first statement on the outbreak of hostilities was more along the lines of “ Ca n’t we all get along ? ” , the New York Times notes :
“ Mr. Obama did harden his rhetoric later on Friday , shortly before getting on a plane for a vacation in Hawaii .
His initial statement , an adviser said , was released before there were confirmed reports of the Russian invasion .
In his later statement , Mr. Obama said , ‘ What is clear is that Russia has invaded Georgia ’s sovereign  has encroached on Georgia ’s sovereignty , and it is very important for us to resolve this issue as quickly as possible . ' ”
This nonsense about Georgia ’s alleged “ sovereignty ” rides roughshod over the reality of the Ossetians ’ apparent determination to free themselves from Saakashvili ’s grip , and it ’s the buzzword that identifies a shill for the Georgians .
“ I condemn Russia ’s aggressive actions , ” said Obama , “ and reiterate my call for an immediate cease - fire . ”
This cease - fire business is meant to feed directly into the Georgians ’ contention that they have offered to stop the conflict , even as they continue military operations in South Ossetia , which have already cost the lives of over a thousand of that country ’s inhabitants .
That did n’t stop the McCainiacs from attacking Obama as a tool of the Kremlin .
Sunday the news talk shows were abuzz with rumors of Democratic discontent over Obama ’s seeming inability to hit back at McCain ’s viciously negative campaign , yet it ’s much worse than that  it ’s not an unwillingness , but an inherent inability to do so .
I hate to cite Andrew Sullivan favorably , but he was one of the first to note the convergence of the Obama camp and the McCain campaign on such central issues as Iran , and the process continues with this confluence of opinion on the Russian question .
While the Obama people have dutifully pointed out that Randy Scheunemann , McCain ’s foreign policy guru , earned hundreds of thousands of dollars for his public relations firm as a paid lobbyist for the Georgians , their own candidate ’s position on the matter differs little from McCain ’s , except , as the New York Times notes , in terms of “ style . ”
GWB recently assured Saakashvili that he would do his best to get the Georgians into NATO , but the Europeans  particularly the Germans  are balking , and this foray by the Georgian Napoleon into a direct conflict with the Russians seems to confirm their initial reluctance .
The Euros are no dummies : they know Saakashvili ’s recklessness could plunge the entire region into an armed conflict that would resemble World War I in its utter stupidity .
I ’ve written at length about the economic and political interests that stand to profit from a war in the Caucasus , and I wo n’t repeat myself here except to note that the timing of this  with attacking Iran on the War Party ’s agenda  should alert us to the importance of what is happening .
Russia has not only been opposed to Iran ’s victimization at the hands of the West , but Putin and his successor have taken up Tehran ’s cause , selling arms and technology to the Iranians and running diplomatic interference on their behalf .
This is Washington ’s counterattack by proxy .
Please do n’t tell me Saakashvili just woke up one day and decided to attack Ossetia , and that the Americans were n’t notified well in advance .
Georgia depends on U.S. military and economic aid , and Saakashvili is a savvy operator : he is pulling a Lebanon , having learned from the Israeli example , and the Bush administration is more than glad to oblige him .
Georgian tanks would never have rolled into South Ossetia without being given a green light by Washington .
Georgia has embarked on a very dangerous course , and it ’s important to realize it has n’t done so alone .
Saakashvili has the implicit backing of Washington in his quest to re-conquer the “ lost ” provinces of Ossetia and Abkhazia ( and do n’t forget Adjaria ! )  or else what are 1,000 U.S. troops doing engaged in “ joint military exercises ” with the Georgian military , just as the crisis reaches a crescendo of violence ?
( The Brits , to their credit , have thought better of getting dragged into this one )
It ’s too bad Obama is going along with the game plan , but then again , he was never good on the Russian question to begin with , so I ca n’t say I ’m disappointed .
South Ossetia is not now a part of “ sovereign Georgian territory , ” and it has n’t been for nearly two decades , no matter what McCain and Obama would have us believe .
If they , along with GWB , are going to stand by Saakashvili ’s side as he mows down civilians and imposes martial law on a war - torn , dirt - poor , and much - abused people , then may they all be damned to hell  that is , if we can find a rung low enough for them .
It ’s funny  if you like your humor black  but when Slobodan Milosevic was supposedly doing to Kosovo what Saakashvili is now doing to South Ossetia , the U.S. launched bombing raids and “ liberated ” the Kosovars from what we were told was to be a gruesome fate .
There are many reasons to doubt that this attempted “ genocide ” ever took place , but given that something very bad was going on in the former Yugoslavia , one has to ask : why do n’t the same standards apply to South Ossetia ?
I ’ll tell you why : because the victims , this time , are Russians , Slavs who have n’t achieved official victim status in the lexicon of Western “ humanitarians . ”
Imagine if , say , Colombia invaded Panama , and rained bombs down on the many U.S. citizens currently living there .
Would the U.S. act to ensure their safety ?
You betcha !
So somebody please tell me why Russia has n’t the right to defend its own citizens , and even to deter and punish Georgian aggression .
The War Party has been running on some pretty low energy lately , and this revival of the Cold War will no doubt recharge its batteries .
The warmongers need a new enemy , a fresh face in their rogues ’ gallery , to get the masses excited again , and Putin ’s Russia fits the bill .
I ’ve been warning of this possibility for what seems like years , and now the moment is upon us .
What ’s interesting is how many left - liberal “ peaceniks ” are falling for the War Party ’s guff and lining up behind McCain , their hero Obama , and the neocons in the march to confrontation with the Kremlin .
Sounds like someone is getting tired .
A Wall Street Journal reporter backs him up .
It ’s a longer article in Rolling Stone , and is n’t online .
This is just a snippet – you can find the entire article at the news stand .
The rest of the article reveals that McCain is no longer talking to the press at all on his bus .

After years of marriage , mind numbing 9 - 5s , and the same boring food , fun , and sex , even the best marriage can become stale .
By designing our lives from a place of endless possibilities we can literally blow the socks off our relationships and create a world of fun .
When boringness is so prevalent that you hit the snooze button 4 times before dragging yourself out of bed , you know you are n’t living the life you love .
You cultivate a new love for love and for the sweetheart in your life , and here ’s how …
Public Display of Team Effort
When the two of you are in front of other people , make it a rule to not contradict each other .
Even when you know your partner is dead wrong , you can still reserve the option to take them aside and discuss the subject with them or wait until later .
In this way you are avoiding causing embarrassment to them or undermining them .
Cheerleading Unit
Whenever you talk to people about your spouse make sure you tell them every little thing that you adore and admire about your spouse .
When that person talks to your spouse in the future they will be sure to mention all the amazing things you have said and about how much love you have for them .
Date Your Wife
Instead of falling back into the same week - to - week rut , go out on a fun , spontaneous , and easy - going date .
No picking fights , no arguing , just taking pleasure in what you have and loving each other .
Be young and sexy again !
Create Bucket Lists
A bucket list is a goal setting tool used strictly for fun activities .
That ’s basically what you do , create a future of fun , dining , entertainment , adventure and exploration together on paper .
This future will determine who you are being in the present , as well as the anticipation and teamwork that will be produced as you work towards achieving this together .
Give It To Them
Find out what your partner likes , such as you bringing them dinner while they watch the game ( for him ) , or pouring a glass of wine and just listening attentively ( for her ) [ you get the point ] , and just being fully giving .
It is within your giving that your own love grows for that person .
You ca n’t make them love you more , but you can both make yourselves love each other more .
Do n’t Make Them Wrong
This is probably the hardest one of all .
It means a total acceptance of both who they are and the decisions they make .
What makes this hard is when your spouse is doing something that is killing themselves , like smoking for example , and you have to completely allow them to decide on their own and let them be .
Share The Landmark Forum
When Marina and I did the landmark forum together , it brought our extraordinary relationship to new heights that I did n’t expect .
At the point I could n’t even imagine getting any closer to her , despite the fact that we were getting closer each day .
As an example , if our relationship was at a 15 out of 10 already , it hit 30 over the course of a weekend .
I would say that we got our money ’s worth .

In the United States today , a worker is fired or discriminated against for trying to form a union every 23 minutes .
This is a major reason that every worker should support the Employee Free Choice Act .
According to a survey from Peter D. Hart Research Associates 57 million people say they would join a union if they had a chance .
But in today 's America , employers routinely fire , harass , intimidate and coerce workers who try to exercise their right to form a union at work .
Why anti-union .

This site is dedicated to Lawyer / PR man , Rick Berman , who works as a lobbyist for the corporate war against unions and the working class .
His MO is to start websites who falsely claim to be factual and through truth , half truth and out right lies , he misinforms the public .
Unions are not his first campaign and I 'm sure it will not be his last .

Johnny goes to his dad and asks , " What is politics ? "
Dad says , " Well son , let me try to explain it this way .
I 'm the breadwinner of the family , so let 's call me Capitalism .
Mommy is the administrator of the money , so we 'll call her the Government .
We 're here to take care of your needs , so we 'll call you The People .
The nanny , well , consider her The Working Class .
Your baby brother , we 'll call him The Future .
Now go think about this and see if it makes sense .
" So the little boy goes off to bed thinking about what Dad has said .
Later that night , he hears his baby brother crying and runs to his room only to find that his diapers are very soiled .
So the little boy goes to his parents ' room .
Mom is sound asleep .
Not wanting to wake her , he goes to the nanny 's room .
Finding the door locked , he looks through the peephole and sees his father in bed with the nanny .
He gives up and goes back to bed .
The next morning , the little boy says to his father , " Dad , I think I understand what politics is now . " " Good son , tell me in your own words then what politics are .
" The little boy replies , " Well , while Capitalism is screwing the Working Class , the Government is sound asleep , the People are being ignored and the Future is in deep shit . "
With food riots in some countries focusing attention on how the world will feed itself , biotechnology proponents see their chance .
They argue that while genetic engineering might have been deemed unnecessary when food was abundant , it will be essential for helping the world cope with the demand for food and biofuels in the decades ahead .
Through gene splicing , the modified crops now grown  mainly canola , corn , cotton and soybeans  typically contain bacterial genes that help the plants resist insects or tolerate a herbicide that can be sprayed to kill weeds while leaving the crop unscathed .
Biotechnology companies are also working on crops that might need less water or fertilizer , which could have a bigger impact on improving yield .
Certainly any new receptivity to genetically modified crops would be a boon to American exporters .
The United States accounted for half the world ’s acreage of biotech crops last year .
But substantial amounts of corn , soy or canola are grown in Argentina , Brazil and Canada .
China has developed insect - resistant rice that is awaiting regulatory approval in that country .
The pressure to re-evaluate biotech comes as prices of some staples like rice and wheat have doubled in the last few months , provoking violent protests in several countries including Cameroon , Egypt , Haiti and Thailand .
Factors behind the price spikes include the diversion of crops to make biofuel , rising energy prices , growing prosperity in India and China , and droughts in some regions  including Australia , a major grain producer .
Biotechnology still certainly faces obstacles .
Polls in Europe do not yet show a decisive shift in consumer sentiment , and the industry has had some recent setbacks .
Since the beginning of the year France has banned the planting of genetically modified corn while Germany has enacted a law allowing for foods to be labeled as “ G.M. free . ”
And a new international assessment of the future of agriculture , released last Tuesday , gave such tepid support to the role genetic engineering could play in easing hunger that biotechnology industry representatives withdrew from the project in protest .
The report was a collaboration of more than 60 governments , with participation from companies and nonprofit groups , under the auspices of the World Bank and the United Nations .

Nintendo's
Wii game console once again outsold Sony 's PlayStation 3 in Japan in June , but its lead is fading , a game magazine publisher said .

TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Nintendo Co Ltd's 7974.OS
Wii game console once again outsold Sony Corp 's 6758 .
T PlayStation 3 in Japan in June , but its lead is fading , a game magazine publisher said .
Wii outsold the rival console by 1.7 - to - 1 , making it the No.1 game console for a seventh consecutive month , Enterbrain said , but that was well short of the 6 - to - 1 lead the Wii had in May .
The launch in June of Konami Corp 's 9766 .
T highly anticipated " Metal Gear Solid 4 " for the PS3 helped stir demand for the Sony machine , the magazine said .
Nintendo sold 235,990 units of its
Wii console in the five weeks ended June 29 , while sales of the PS3 came to 139,494 units , Enterbrain said .
Microsoft Corp's MSFT.O Xbox 360 trails the pack , with sales of 10,964 units .
Despite its strong performance in June , the PS3 has a lot of catching up to do in total sales around the world .
Sony has sold 12.85 million units of its latest console worldwide by the end of March , or just half the Wiis sold since the rival consoles were both launched in late 2006 .
For handheld game players , Sony sold 274,131 of its PlayStation Portable during the five - week period , surpassing Nintendo , which sold 195,714 of its DS gear , the publisher said .
Prior to the announcement , shares in Sony closed up 0.9 percent at 4,600 yen while Nintendo gained 0.2 percent to 60,900 yen .
The Nikkei average . N225 was down 0.2 percent .

According to state media , Olympic specialists at Beijing set up a sex identification laboratory in order to check female Olympic athletes who are suspected to be males .
Xinhua news agency stated that professionals , working at the lab , which is located at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital , will analyze doubtful cases based on their external features and observe sex hormones , genes and chromosomes from blood samples .
It is worth mentioning that sex testing has been practiced at the Olympic Games for many years .
The reason to launch the procedure was the fears that male athletes might cheat pretending to be females .
In 2006 Asian Games officials retracted silver medal from an Indian athlete , Santhi Soundarajan , who failed a sex verification test .

What is Graphite ?
Graphite is a highly scalable real - time graphing system .
As a user , you write an application that collects numeric time - series data that you are interested in graphing , and send it to Graphite 's processing backend , carbon , which stores the data in Graphite 's specialized database .
The data can then be visualized through graphite 's web interfaces .
Who should use Graphite ?
Graphite is actually a bit of a niche application .
Specifically , it is designed to handle numeric time - series data .
For example , Graphite would be good at graphing stock prices because they are numbers that change over time .
However Graphite is a complex system , and if you only have a few hundred distinct things you want to graph ( stocks prices in the S&P 500 ) then Graphite is probably overkill .
But if you need to graph a lot of different things ( like dozens of performance metrics from thousands of servers ) and you do n't necessarily know the names of those things in advance ( who wants to maintain such huge configuration ? ) then Graphite is for you .
How scalable is Graphite ?
From a CPU perspective , Graphite scales horizontally on both the frontend and the backend , meaning you can simply add more machines to the mix to get more throughput .
It is also fault tolerant in the sense that losing a backend machine will cause a minimal amount of data loss ( whatever that machine had cached in memory ) and will not disrupt the system if you have sufficient capacity remaining to handle the load .
From an I/O perspective , under load Graphite performs lots of tiny I/O operations on lots of different files very rapidly .
This is because each distinct metric sent to Graphite is stored in its own database file , similar to how many tools ( drraw , Cacti , Centreon , etc ) built on top of RRD work .
In fact , Graphite originally did use RRD for storage until fundamental limitations arose that required a new storage engine .
High volume ( a few thousand distinct metrics updating minutely ) pretty much requires a good RAID array .
Graphite 's backend caches incoming data if the disks cannot keep up with the large number of small write operations that occur ( each data point is only a few bytes , but most disks cannot do more than a few thousand I / O operations per second , even if they are tiny ) .
When this occurs , Graphite 's database engine , whisper , allows carbon to write multiple data points at once , thus increasing overall throughput only at the cost of keeping excess data cached in memory until it can be written .
How real - time are the graphs ?
Very .
Even under heavy load , where the number of metrics coming in each time interval is much greater than the rate at which your storage system can perform I/O operations and lots of data points are being cached in the storage pipeline ( see previous question for explanation ) , Graphite still draws real - time graphs .
The trick is that when the Graphite webapp receives a request to draw a graph , it simultaneously retrieves data off the disk as well as from the pre-storage cache ( which may be distributed if you have multiple backend servers ) and combines the two sources of data to create a real - time graph .
Who already uses Graphite ?
Graphite was internally developed by Orbitz.com where it is used to visualize a variety of operations - critical data including application metrics , database metrics , sales , etc .
At the time of this writing , the production system at Orbitz can handle approximately 160,000 distinct metrics per minute running on two niagra - 2 Sun servers on a very fast SAN .
What is Graphite written in ?
Python .
The Graphite webapp is built on the Django web framework and uses the ExtJS javascript GUI toolkit .
The graph rendering is done using the Cairo graphics library .
The backend and database are written in pure Python .
Who writes and maintains Graphite ?
Graphite was initially developed by Chris Davis at Orbitz.com .
Orbitz has long been a part of the open source community and has published several other internally developed products .
Orbitz is still actively developing Graphite and will continue to provide enhancements to the community .
What license is Graphite released under ?
The Apache 2.0 License .
See the details here .
Does Graphite use RRDtool ?
No , not since Graphite was first written in 2006 at least .
Graphite has its own specialized database library called whisper , which is very similar in design to RRD , but has a subtle yet fundamentally important difference that Graphite requires .
There are two reasons whisper was created .
The first reason is that RRD is designed under the assumption that data will always be inserted into the database on a regular basis , and this assumption causes RRD behave undesirably when given irregularly occurring data .
Graphite was built to facilitate visualization of various application metrics that do not always occur regularly , like when an uncommon request is handled and the latency is measured and sent to Graphite .
Using RRD , the data gets put into a temporary area inside the database where it is not accessible until the current time interval has passed _and_ another value is inserted into the database for the following interval .
If that does not happen within an allotted period of time , the original data point will get overwritten and is lost .
Now for some metrics , the lack of a value can be correctly interpreted as a value of zero , however this is not the case for metrics like latency because a zero indicates that work was done in zero time , which is different than saying no work was done .
Assuming a zero value for latency also screws up analysis like calculating the average latency , etc .
The second reason whisper was written is performance .
RRDtool is very fast , in fact it is much faster than whisper .
But the problem with RRD ( at the time whisper was written ) was that RRD only allows you to insert a single value into a database at a time , while whisper was written to allow the insertion of multiple data points at once , compacting them into a single write operation .
The reason this improves performance drastically under high load is because Graphite operates on many many files , and with such small operations being done ( write a few bytes here , a few over there , etc ) the bottleneck is caused by the * number of I /O operations *.
Consider the scenario where Graphite is receiving 100,000 distinct metric values each minute , in order to sustain that load Graphite must be able to write that many data points to disk each minute .
But assume that you 're underlying storage can only handle 20,000 I/O operations per minute .
With RRD ( at the time whisper was written ) , there was no chance of keeping up .
But with whisper , we can keep caching the incoming data until we accumulate say 10 minutes worth of data for a given metric , then instead of doing 10 I/O operations to write those 10 data points , whisper can do it in 1 operation .
The reason I have kept mentioning " at the time whisper was written " is because RRD now supports this behavior .
However Graphite will continue to use whisper as long as the first issue still exists .

When it comes to LSD , I have to confess : I inhaled .
But I inhaled like so many other denizens of the 1960s and early ’ 70s , whether they actually took the drug or not .
I inhaled because you could n’t fail to inhale .
LSD  its aura if not its substance  was a component of the air we breathed .
This hallucinogen infused the exhalations of musicians , philosophers , advertisers and activists .
There seemed nothing “ counter ” about this culture ; it was prevalent .
At the time there seemed to be as many head shops in New York as there are Starbucks now ; acid rock played in those darkened spaces to acid heads , as beams of black light caused DayGlo Op - Art images to shimmer dizzyingly .
Typefaces ballooned and swooped , melting across posters and album jackets in drug - induced swoons .
Lucy was in the sky with diamonds , the Byrds were eight miles high , the Magical Mystery Tour was overbooked ; Carlos Castaneda played out his fantasies .
The era ’s hallmark drug was championed with as much messianic fervor as the era ’s countercultural politics .
And I , and seemingly everyone else I knew , ingested that culture even if not the drug itself , not even realizing how strange that culture was .
It seems even stranger with the passing of time .
So while the death at 102 last week of Albert Hofmann may have tempted some to resurrect tales of spiritual adventures under the influence , or to invoke the now familiar quip that if you can remember the ’60s you were n’t there , there are other flashbacks  LSD - induced or not  to consider .

FDA 's War on Dr. Burzynski and His Patients : Physician and Pations Win !
Sue A. Blevins , RN , MPH
For many Americans , their fight against cancer is nothing compared to their battles with the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) .
Just ask the many patients of Dr. Stanislaw Burzynski .
They 'll tell you about their 14 - year war with the FDA and that they won !
Yet , They Still Implore Congress to Reign in the FDA
Here 's how their long battle evolved .
Since 1977 , more than 2,500 cancer patients have sought out an experimental drug named Antineoplaston ( meaning anti-cancer ) developed by Dr. Burzynski , a polish - born physician and biochemist .
Many of the patients had been diagnosed with terminal cancer after chemotherapy and radiation failed to reduce their tumors .
Others opted for Antineoplaston treatment as their first choice .
Either way , patients ( including patients who received Antineoplaston therapy only ) and their physicians report that tumors were reduced following the experimental treatment .
Some of the patients have even gone into complete remission and none report serious side - effects from the drug .
Still , skeptics discount those claims , arguing that Dr. Burzynski's patients would have gone into remission anyway .
In 1983 , the American Cancer Society placed Dr. Burzynski's therapy on its " unproven methods " list .
That same year , the FDA sought an injunction to stop Dr. Burzynski from treating cancer patients because it had not approved the drug .
Federal Judge Gabrielle McDonald denied the FDA 's request .
Instead , she ruled that Dr. Burzynski could continue to treat patients in Texas , but she prohibited him from shipping the unapproved drug across state lines .
What were the out - of - state cancer patients to do ?
They had two choices : Move to Texas or resort to their previously failed treatments .
Most patients could not afford the move to Texas for Antineoplaston treatment .
So they sought out Dr. Burzynski's initial treatment in Texas , and then shipped the drug across state lines themselves , according to Steve Siegel who heads an organization called " The Burzynski Patient Group . "
His wife , Mary Jo , opted for Antineoplaston therapy as her first choice for cancer treatment .
She stresses " What 's wrong with this picture ?
In the United States , the federal government would allow me to cross state lines to get an abortion , but I was not allowed to ship a life - saving treatment across state lines ! "
Dr. Burzynski faced numerous battles with the federal government over the years .
Between 1986 and 1994 , he was subjected to three federal grand jury investigations .
No indictments were ever handed down .
However , during that time federal officials raided his research clinic and confiscated his patients ' medical records .
Then in March 1995 , Dr. Burzynski appeared on the CBS television show " This Morning , " accompanied by three of his patients .
That very afternoon , the FDA raided his clinic again .
A fourth federal grand jury investigation got underway .
By November 1995 , the fourth grand jury charged Dr. Burzynski with 40 counts of distributing a non-FDA approved drug in interstate commerce , 34 counts of mail fraud , and one count of contempt of court for violating the order against interstate delivery of Antineoplastons .
Rep. Joe Barton ( R - TX ) questioned whether the FDA used its power to retaliate against Dr. Burzynski .
" It is extraordinarily rare for a grand jury to fail to indict at the request of a U.S. Attorney , " Barton told The Washington Times .
He noted that a grand jury 's failure to indict someone after three attempts is " virtually unprecedented . "
A federal trial got underway in January 1997 .
The trial ended with a hung jury on March 3 , 1997 .
U.S. District Judge Sim Lake declared a mistrial and dropped the mail charges , ruling the federal government failed to prove mail fraud .
Then federal prosecutors dropped the 40 counts of interstate commerce .
However , a second federal trial got underway May 19 , 1997 to try Dr. Burzynski on the contempt of court charge .
The federal government claimed Dr. Burzynski violated the previous court order because he continued to treat patients who lived out of state , knowing they might ship the drug across state lines .
The defense , however , argued that Dr. Burzynski treated patients who lived outside Texas , but that he did n't ship the drug to other states .
A federal jury acquitted Dr. Burzynski on May 27 , 1997 .
Dr. Burzynski and his patients may have won this 14 - year war with the FDA , but how many future doctors and patients are going to face similar battles ?
Any doctor who develops an experimental treatment would likely face similar battles .
That is why Dr. Burzynski's patients continue to ask Congress to reign in the FDA .
For example , the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight recently held hearings about FDA abuses ( February 4 , 1998 ) .
Jack Kunnari , the father of 6 - year - old Dustin Kunnari , told the Committee " From the time we went to Dr. Burzynski [ for Antineoplaston treatment ] , the biggest threat to Dustin 's life was not cancer , it was the FDA .
In February 1996 , with cold disregard for the life of my son and Dr. Burzynski's other terminal cancer patients , FDA used legal maneuvers to stop them [ cancer patients ] from receiving Antineoplastons .
If not for quick and compassionate action by Congressman Joe Barton and his Investigations and Oversight Subcommittee , FDA would have succeeded .
And Dustin would not be here today , " said Kunnari .
" FDA claims it is protecting cancer patients , " he said .
" We do not want your protection , " Kunnari told the Committee .
" Under your protection , cancer deaths climb every year .
In my opinion , the actions of your [ FDA ] agency are un-American and unconstitutional ...
As members of Congress it is your duty to uphold the system of checks and balances .
It is up to you to reign in this FDA . "

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) -
One of three U.S. adults already suffers from some degree of hearing loss and the use of personal stereos and an aging population may create a hearing impairment epidemic , researchers said on Monday .
A team at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore estimated that 55 million Americans have hearing loss in one or both ears , with men , whites and the least - educated most affected .
One out of six , or 29 million adults , have some trouble discerning speech , more than previous estimates , they reported in the Archives of Internal Medicine .
“ The prevalence of hearing loss in the United States is predicted to rise significantly because of an aging population and the growing use of personal listening devices .
Indeed , there is concern that we may be facing an epidemic of hearing impairment , ” Dr. Yuri Agrawal of the Baltimore hospital wrote .
It is common for people to ignore or disavow hearing loss , the researchers said , leading to difficulty communicating that can result in productivity problems at work , depression , and less access to health care that ultimately raises the risk of sickness and death .
Hearing loss is common among people 70 and older , according to the report .
But hearing loss also affected 8.5 percent of those in their 20s and 17 percent of people in their 30s .
Exposure to workplace noise , firearms , and loud music were all risk factors .
Assessing health information collected from 5,700 Americans aged 20 to 69 years between 1999 and 2004 in the federal National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey , Agrawal and colleagues found men were twice as likely as women ( 21 percent versus 11 percent ) to have speech - frequency hearing loss in one or both ears .
Whites were more than twice as prone to hearing loss than blacks , and those with less education were more at risk than those who completed high school or beyond .
Also dramatically increasing the chances of hearing loss were smoking , high blood pressure and diabetes .
Screening for hearing loss should begin in young adulthood , particularly for vulnerable groups , Agrawal concluded .

Your goal is to rescue your beloved princess from the enemy dungeon .
There 's a catch though : your adversary has been stuffing her with food to fatten her up and it's going to take most of your army working together to carry her back across the battlefield .
Dear Sony :
My friend Erica emailed me about the hottt new PlayStation game you 've got in production , Fat Princess .
It looks and sounds just adorable — — but the only thing I can't figure out is why anyone would want to rescue a fat princess in the first place , since everyone knows that fat girls are unlovable human garbage at whom any sensible bloke would sooner hurl invective than cast a longing glance .
I sure hope there 's a clever dénouement like the Fat Princess magically becoming thin once she 's rescued !
' Cuz that would rock , yo !
Anyway , congrats on your awesome new game , Sony .
I 'm positively thrilled to see such unyielding dedication to creating a new generation of fat - hating , heteronormative assholes .
It 's not often I have the opportunity to congratulate a cutting - edge tech company on such splendiferous retrofuck jackholery .
Way to go !

Veterans for Peace in a dramatic confrontation with Chairman Conyers over his indecision on impeachment .
Scientists have found that the compound resveratrol -- found in red wine and grape skin -- slows age - related deterioration and functional decline of mice on a standard diet , but does not increase longevity when started at middle age .
This study , conducted and supported in part by the National Institute on Aging ( NIA ) , part of the National Institutes of Health , is a follow - up to 2006 findings that resveratrol improves health and longevity of overweight , aged mice .
The report confirms previous results suggesting the compound , found naturally in foods like grapes and nuts , may mimic , in mice , some of the effects of dietary or calorie restriction , the most effective and reproducible way found to date to alleviate age - associated disease in mammals .
The findings , published July 3 , 2008 , in Cell Metabolism , may increase interest in resveratrol as a possible intervention for age - related declines , said NIA scientists .
The authors emphasized , however , that their findings are based on research in mice , not in humans , and have no immediate and direct application to people , whose health is influenced by a variety of factors beyond those which may be represented in the animal models .
The study is a collaborative effort between the laboratories of Rafael de Cabo , Ph.D. , of the Laboratory of Experimental Gerontology at the NIA ; David A. Sinclair , Ph.D. , of the Glenn Laboratories for Molecular Biology of Aging at Harvard Medical School ; and an international group of researchers .
The investigators compared mice fed a standard diet , a high - calorie diet , or an every - other - day feeding regimen with or without high - or low - dose resveratrol to study the impact of resveratrol on aging and health .
In previous studies , different forms of dietary restriction , including every - other - day feeding , have been shown to improve markers of health .
" Research is attempting to understand the process of aging and to determine how interventions can influence this process .
Dietary restriction has well - documented health benefits in mammals , and the study of possible mimetics of it , such as resveratrol , are of great interest , " said NIA Director Richard J. Hodes , M.D. " Resveratrol has produced significant effects in animal models , now including mice , where it mimics some , but not all , consequences of caloric restriction .
Its effects in humans remain to be studied . "
A major finding of the study reported today is that resveratrol prevented age - related and obesity - related cardiovascular functional decline in the mice as determined by several parameters .
Total cholesterol was significantly reduced in 22 - month - old non - obese mice after 10 months of resveratrol treatment , although triglyceride levels had only a slight , non-significant trend toward a decrease .
Further , the aortas of 18 - month - old obese and non -obese mice treated with resveratrol functioned significantly better than untreated mice .
Resveratrol also moderated inflammation in the heart .

In addition to cardiovascular function , the scientists found resveratrol to have a variety of positive effects on other age - related problems in mice :
Treated mice tended to have better bone health , as measured by thickness , volume , mineral content and density , and bending stiffness compared to the non-treated control group .
At 30 months of age , resveratrol - treated mice were found to have reduced cataract formation , a condition found to increase with age in control - group mice .
Resveratrol enhanced balance and motor coordination in aged animals .
Scientists found significant improvement in performance at 21 and 24 months versus 15 months in the resveratrol - treated mice but not in the untreated mice .
Resveratrol partially mimicked the effects of dietary restriction on the gene expression profiles of liver , skeletal muscle and adipose ( fatty ) tissue in mice .
Along with determining the effect of resveratrol on the health of mice , scientists also studied the effect of resveratrol on longevity .
" We found that while quality of life improved with resveratrol , the compound did not significantly affect overall survival or maximum lifespan for mice on a standard diet , compared to mice on the same diet without resveratrol , " said de Cabo .
Resveratrol did not have a significant effect on lifespan in animals fed standard chow , suggesting that the intervention did not affect all aspects of the basic aging process .
Mice on a high - calorie diet without resveratrol lived the shortest length of time and mice on an every - other - day regimen lived the longest , regardless of resveratrol treatment .
However , for mice on a high - calorie diet , mean and maximum lifespan increased for mice on resveratrol when compared with the control mice .
Researchers found that resveratrol 's effects on longevity could be completely uncoupled from changes in body weight , meaning that mice on a high - calorie diet with resveratrol did not necessarily lose weight but did experience a longer ( and healthier ) life than mice on the same high - calorie diet not taking resveratrol .
They speculate that improved cardiovascular health and reduced fatty changes in the liver may have contributed to the increased lifespan of resveratrol - treated mice .
Researchers still have much to learn before resveratrol can be recommended for human use .
Basic questions of safety and biological effect in humans remain to be studied experimentally .
" We are learning a great deal about how resveratrol affects the health and survival of mammals , " said Sinclair .
" Continued study of calorie restriction mimetics such as resveratrol may eventually point the way to new medicines to treat diseases of aging . "
In addition to scientists from the NIA and Harvard Medical School , researchers from the following institutions collaborated in this study : New York Medical College , Valhalla , N.Y. ; University of Michigan , Ann Arbor ; University of Sydney in Australia ; Thomas Jefferson University , Philadelphia ; University of California , San Diego , La Jolla ; Hospital for Special Surgery , New York , N.Y. ; University of Cincinnati , Ohio ; University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio and Audie Murphy VA Hospital , San Antonio , Texas ; Universidad Pablo de Olavide , Sevilla , Spain ; Pennington Biomedical Research Center , Baton Rouge , La. ; University of Washington , Seattle ; and Sirtris Pharmaceuticals of Cambridge , Mass. , a company founded by Harvard University co-lead author Sinclair .
De Cabo is a scientist in the NIA 's Intramural Research Program .
In addition , the research was funded by grants from the NIA , the primary supporter of the work , as well as grants from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences ; the National Heart , Lung , and Blood Institute ; the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ; the National Eye Institute ; and the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases of the NIH .
The Ellison Medical Research Foundation , the American Heart Association , the Australian and Spanish governments and Paul F. Glenn and The Paul F. Glenn Laboratories for the Biological Mechanisms of Aging also provided support to members of the research team .

The Nebraska Supreme Court denied a pro se parole bid by Ed Poindexter in a decision many expected was a foregone conclusion .
However , in denying a request for parole eligibility the state high court signaled the difficulty Poindexter faces later this year when his request for a new trial is argued by Lincoln attorney Robert Bartle .
Poindexter was convicted in 1971 for the bombing murder of an Omaha policeman , Larry Minard , in a controversial trial marred by conflicting police testimony , withheld evidence , and tainted assistance by the Federal Bureau of Investigation .
Poindexter and co-defendant Mondo we Langa ( formerly David Rice ) both deny any involvement in the crime and were both targets of FBI director J. Edgar Hoover under the infamous Operation COINTELPRO which targeted the Black Panthers for " no holds barred " treatment .
Poindexter 's request for a new trial comes after sophisticated vocal analysis by voice analyst Tom Owen in 2006 revealed that the confessed bomber , 15 year - old Duane Peak , did not make the emergency call that lured Minard to his death .
Peak implicated Poindexter and Mondo we Langa making his credibility critical …and leaving an unknown caller at large .
Retired Omaha detective Robert Pheffer also contradicted his own trial testimony about finding dynamite that was allegedly used in the fatal bomb in a dramatic and emotion - charged hearing in Douglas County District Court last year before Judge Russell Bowie .
At the time of the trial Omaha was gripped by racial tension .
Former Nebraska governor Frank Morrison was Poindexter 's court - appointed public defender .
Morrison described Omaha in a 2003 deposition .
" There was tremendous racial feeling .
North Omaha was one of the hottest spots in the whole United States for racial violence .
In fact , when in 1966 we had to call out the National Guard , they set fire to North Omaha and we had to bring in the National Guard and take over to preserve order .
There was terrible racial feeling ….
I do n't have words to describe it , but there was terrible discrimination and hatred of African - Americans , terrible . "
The " terrible racial feeling " Morrison described was fueled in part by COINTELPRO dirty tricks initiated by the FBI to disrupt the Black Panthers .
Both Ed Pointdexter and Mondo we Langa had been secret targets of Hoover 's clandestine operation but the compromised role of the FBI was unknown by Omaha police who were assisted by the federal agents in the search for Minard 's killers and unknown by jurors who convicted Poindexter unaware of Hoover 's secret directives against the Black Panthers .
The FBI , in cooperation with Omaha Assistant Chief of Police Glenn Gates , kept the recording of the emergency call from defense attorneys while the jurors who decided the fate of the two Black Panther leaders never heard the voice of the anonymous caller .
A secret COINTELPRO memo obtained after the 1971 trial under the Freedom of Information
Act revealed that release of the emergency tape recording would be " prejudicial to the police murder trial " case against Poindexter and Langa .
The jurors also never knew that Peak , the confessed bomber , brokered a deal where he served 33 months of juvenile detention and then walked free in exchange for his testimony against Poindexter and Langa .
Nor did the jurors know that Raleigh House , the supplier of the dynamite , would never be formally charged and only spent one night in jail before being released on his own signature because the police wanted to claim Langa supplied the dynamite .
In fact , Omaha Police Captain Murdock Platner did indeed make such a claim in sworn testimony to a Congressional committee contradicting actual trial testimony about the dynamite .
Details about the compromised FBI role in the case did not come until years after the trial and only judges , not jurors , have since been told about the withheld evidence , conflicting and contradictory police testimony , about the deal with Peak , and about the voice analysis that contradicts the story of the state 's chief murderous witness against Poindexter .
The Nebraska Supreme Court ruled that Poindexter 's bid for parole must fail because the Board of Pardons has not commuted his life sentence to a term of years thus depriving the Board of Parole the ability to grant a parole request .
In responding to Poindexter 's arguments that numerous other prisoners serving life sentences have been released on parole after serving less time than he has the court said that a commutation of sentence was a " discretionary state privilege " and that even if " granted generously in the past " Poindexter had no legal entitlement to similar consideration .
While the expected ruling against parole for Poindexter does not presage the outcome of his pending new trial request some of the language in the decision does suggest that attorney Robert Bartle will have his work cut out for him during oral arguments scheduled for this fall .
In the ten - page decision there were three references to the underlying crime , the murder of Larry Minard .
In the opening summary of the decision the Nebraska Supreme Court properly noted , " In 1971 , a jury convicted Edward Poindexter of first degree murder . "
However , two later references were less neutral and potentially betray a bias of the court to the prosecution case .
The court discussed sentencing statutes , " in 1970 when Poindexter committed his offense . "
In the conclusion of the decision the court repeated the bias and used the statement " when Poindexter committed his crime " to describe the killing of Minard .
Nebraska newspapers , which have not reported on the COINTELPRO manipulation of the case against Poindexter , brandished headlines about Cop - Killer Poindexter Denied Parole following the language of the court decision .

Google has announced the availability of the first Android SDK beta and also disclosed the roadmap for the upcoming 1.0 release .
The platform has improved significantly since the early prereleases , and the API is now richer and more complete .
Android applications and user interface
The user interface has been completely redesigned , with a strong focus on attractiveness and usability .
The new home screen provides a loose grid for placing icons and small widgets , such as a digital clock and search bar .
Users can drag application launchers to the home screen directly from the main menu .
The widgets and icons are organized across three separate home screen panes that the user can flip between with a dragging gesture .
The main application menu flies up from a tab at the bottom of the screen and displays launchers for all of the installed programs .
The home screen background image is now configurable through a wallpaper selector that is activated from the hardware menu button .
The top row of the screen has a status bar with a clock and notification icons .
Dragging down that bar will provide access to the notification pane , which shows information about missed calls , recent messages , and other application - specific notices .
The applications included with the platform have been improved , too .
The entire set of software exhibits a uniformly high level of usability .
The dialer and address book are pretty much what one would expect , but everything is a lot more polished now .
The mapping software got some new features , including support for Google Streetview , but still has a few bugs .
For instance , switching between modes on the map will clear an active search , and there is no way to have street view and satellite view enabled at once .
The application with the most impressive improvements is the web browser .
I recently gave Opera Mobile 9.5 a rave review , and I consider it a pretty strong mobile browser .
Android 's built - in browser delivers all of the same features but with a cleaner and less clunky user interface .
Android offers a flawlessly desktop - like browsing experience with excellent support for JavaScript and modern web applications .
When the user zooms in and out of the page , the text automatically rewraps to fit the screen .
The fonts are beautifully crisp at most zoom levels and the text is very readable .
Users can open multiple pages at once and switch between them using a thumbnail grid view .
Android provides a browsing experience that is easily comparable to that of the iPhone , which is unsurprising — both use the WebKit rendering engine .
Application porting
The SDK is still extremely easy to install and configure .
The user just has to download and decompress the SDK , install the Eclipse plugin , and then provide the plugin with the path of the SDK .
If you already have Eclipse installed , it 's really a five - minute operation .
Keep in mind that you have to have at least Eclipse 3.3 in order to use the plugin ( Ubuntu is being lame and still does n't have it ) .
One of the biggest improvements in the Eclipse plugin is the new visual preview feature for XML user interface files .
This displays a graphical representation of the UI so that developers do n't have to run their program to see how the layout looks .
It still has some limitations and does n't properly display some of the more complex widgets , but it 's good enough for basic forms .
The API has changed significantly since the early prereleases .
The simple Twitter test program that I wrote with the first SDK release and then updated for the second release could n't easily be ported to the new version .
Some of the packages I was using ( DateUtil , for instance ) are no longer included , and I have n't been able to figure out yet exactly what I 'm supposed to be using instead .
Google has published extensive documentation to describe the differences between this version and the previous one , so it 's really just a matter of investing some time and doing the research .
I suspect that some of the more sophisticated programs will have to undergo major refactoring and rewrites .
Unfortunately , the API changes were not publicly documented incrementally , and Google declined to make new SDK releases available to the general developer community until now , so developers will have to make a big adjustment all at once .
The API is very rich and it provides a very diverse selection of controls .
In addition to the conventional buttons , checkboxes , combo-boxes , and toggle switches , the toolkit also includes some nice extras , like controls for an embedded WebKit renderer and an image selector .
There is also a comprehensive notification API for displaying application - specific notices to the user and for adding icons to the status bar .
Some nice aesthetic features are available , too , like support for 3D transitions , blurring an application when displaying modal dialogs , and other similar visual flourishes .
Media playback controls and OpenGL support are also included in the SDK .
To see a bunch of the supported controls and other API features in action , check out the API Demos program that is included in the emulator .
One pretty major disappointment is that there is no API for creating home screen widgets .
Some comments posted by Google engineers in the Android Google Group seem to indicate that they are still working on addressing widget security issues and could add an API for it later , after the 1.0 release .
Openness still in question
Google has repeatedly touted the inclusiveness of an open platform as the primary quality that differentiates Android from competing mobile operating systems .
Unfortunately , mismanagement and market pressures have largely undermined that advantage and disenfranchised some of the Linux enthusiasts in the third - party developer community .
Although the availability of an updated SDK will satisfy some of the critics , it does n't undo the mistakes that Google made during the development process .
Android is still an insular stack , created through a closed development process in a complete vacuum , with input only from the carriers , handset makers , and a small group of handpicked developers .
So far , there has been no evidence of the transparency and inclusiveness that Google promised when the platform was announced .
The abandonment of this commitment during the development process is frustrating , but will likely be forgiven in the long term if Google gets it right after the hardware hits shelves .
Ultimately , the most important test will come later this year when Google finally opens the source code .
At that time , Google will have the opportunity to restore its credibility as an open platform provider by adopting a participatory governance model , accepting third - party patches , and allowing the community — and not just the carriers and handset makers — to influence the future of the platform .
If Google just does a code drop and then continues ignoring a majority of third - party developers , it 's not going to help much .
Google has already taken some important steps to improve the transparency of Android development .
A developer roadmap has been published with a schedule of upcoming releases and some details about naming conventions and compatibility .
Google aims to have release candidates ready next month and will do the official 1.0 release in the third quarter of 2008 .
Devices will supposedly be available by the fourth quarter , which is when Google will open the code base .
Coming soon
The most significant area where Android has an advantage over the iPhone right now is in the potential for hardware diversity .
Users who want a mobile device with a hardware keyboard , full Bluetooth support , a microSD slot , and any number of other similar features that have n't been blessed by His Steveness , will not be inclined to buy an iPhone .
The iPhone 's one - size - fits - all approach is conducive to a great user experience , but necessarily locks the product out of large segments of the market .
Android , on the other hand , can be shipped on a wide range of hardware devices that are designed to cater to the needs of specific audiences .
That alone will give Android a big boost in the competitive mobile phone market .
During the months leading up to this release , the lack of public information about Android progress significantly deflated my own enthusiasm for the platform and left me with the impression that it was falling into the vaporware trap .
The latest release has renewed my interest and demonstrated forcefully that Android is not vaporware .
We also have word that an Android - based handset from T - Mobile is going to be coming soon .
For more information , check out the official announcement at the Android web site .
Three Chinese beers
Now that I 've passed 2000 beers I figured it would be interesting to go back and look at which of these beers were the absolute worst beers .
Many craft beer lovers think the worst possible beers are the mass market brands like Budweiser or the local national giant , and pour scorn on any industrial beer that is low on taste .
I 'm no fan of these beers myself , but there are things that are worse than having no taste , or some hints of off - tastes .
The first category of worse beers is the infected ones .
These are beers where other sugar - eating micro-organisms besides the yeast added by the brewer have gotten into the beer and run riot on the sugar in it .
This can happen easily , as the air around us is full of organisms of this type .
The exact result of such an infection will depend on which specific organism got into the beer , but very often it will give the beer an acidic , vinegary character .
How strong this is varies a lot , from barely detectable to so overpowering it makes the beer undrinkable .
This happens now and then , and the resulting beers often make crap industrial beers seem fantastic by comparison .
However , this is just a production error , and other batches of the same beer most likely will not have this problem , and so I 'm skipping these beers .
What I 'm after here is the worst beers that are , as far as one knows , roughly the same from batch to batch , and yet still taste truly awful .
And , as I said above , being bland and boring is not the same as being awful .
To qualify , a beer has to really taste worse than , say , water .
One would think that such beers would n't exist , since nobody would buy them , but actually they can be found , if you search long enough , and here 's my collection of five worst beers so far .
5. Yanjing Alcoholfree
Yanjing is a local industrial Beijing brewery .
I 've tried 6 of their beers , and given them 2.2-1.0 on a 5.0 - 0.5 scale .
The 2.2 rating was a local version of the Münchner Hofbräu pils .
Not very impressive .
The worst of their beers , at 1.0 , was definitely their alcohol free beer .
1.0 Aroma Appearance Flavour Palate Overall 2/10 2/5 2/10 2/5 2/20
Small white lasting head .
Pale yellow body with ongoing carbonation .
So at least the apperance is OK , even if it is a little pale .
Very faint aroma , what little there is is rubbery and chemical .
The taste is flat and empty , followed by watery rice and cardboard .
The mouthfeel is chalky , as if they stirred chalk into the beer .
A stale taste lingers , with a touch of maize .
Also feels a bit sourish .
Dreadful !
A real drain - pour .
( 0.355l can , rated 2006 - 06 - 07 in Beijing . )
4. Castel Beer ( Senegal )
Groupe Castel is a French drinks company producing wine , soft drinks , and beer , with interests in most of the world .
One of their brands in " Castel Beer " , which is produced in parts of Africa , central Asia , and so on .
This particular beer is one of the three commercial ones produced in Senegal ( all by the same brewery ) .
It 's probably made under a license from Groupe Castel , but could n't really be described as a terribly successful effort .
I guess the rating speaks for itself .
0.9 Aroma Appearance Flavour Palate Overall 2/10 3/5 1/10 1/5 2/20
Medium white head , mostly big bubbles .
Yellow body .
Intense aroma of rubber and sweaty dried - in socks .
Imagine walking around the Sahara for two weeks in the same woolen socks and same rubber boots ; at the end of it they would smell like this .
Dry chemical intensely rubbery taste , densely chalky , with powerful cardboard notes .
As if they dissolved the cardboard box the rubber boots came in , and used that as well .
This is seriously unpleasant .
It grates on me in a major way .
I do n't think I would ever finish a bottle of this .
I could , but I would n't , unless I were dying of thirst .
( 0.33 l bottle from PeterA , via KnutAlbert . )
I got hold of this bottle via an American RateBeerian living in Senegal , who was on a visit to Oslo .
Knut Albert had somehow discovered that he was coming , and since Knut Albert was out of town , I met Peter in the lobby of his hotel , exchanging plastic bags full of bottles .
Peter got quality Norwegian microbrew , and we got ... well ... we got three beers like this one .
( That was the deal all along , of course . )
3. Stary Melnik Bezalkogolnoe
Another alcohol - free beer , this time from Russia .
Stariy Melnik ( which means " old mill " ) is a brand made by Pivovar Moskva ( that is , Moscow Brewery ) , which is owned by the Turkish Efes Group .
I 've also tried their pale lager , which is well below average , but certainly drinkable .
The same cannot be said for their alcohol - free product .
0.8 Aroma Appearance Flavour Palate Overall 2/10 2/5 2/10 1/5 1/20
Big white head quickly shrinks into a thin ring .
Pale yellow body with some carbonation .
Vaguely sulphurous chalky aroma with something I wo n't bother to identify , because this smells horrible anyway .
Taste is chalky watery bitterness initially .
Aftertaste is watery bitterness .
Very unpleasant .
I can't imagine that anyone would enjoy this .
It reminds me of what you vomit when you have only water in your stomach .
( 0.5 l bottle , rated in Moscow , September 2006 . )
2. Grans Bare Fotball
This is from Norwegian low - cost brewer Grans .
The name translates to " Only Soccer " in English , and is typical of how Norwegian brewers try to differentiate their products from each other : by means of the label .
Inside the can , the stuff is usually mostly the same cheap pale lager .
Except for this one , which was unusually horrible .
I notice that nobody on RateBeer hated it as much as I did , so I may just have been out of luck with the can I had .
They 've stopped making it now , I 'm happy to say , so there 's no way to verify this .
0.7 Aroma Appearance Flavour Palate Overall 2/10 2/5 1/10 1/5 1/20
The small white head quickly disappears , leaving only a thin ring round the edge of the glass .
Copper body , with some ongoing carbonation .
Aroma is watery and unbalanced , but brings up many associations .
Strong butter odour with roasty caramel notes and maybe a touch of wood and metal .
It 's really bad , but I 'm saving the 1 in the hope that something worse will show up one day .
Watery roasty caramel flavour with aftertaste of watery burnt wood and metal .
Notes of butter , too .
Some hops and bitterness are detectable .
A really disgusting salty buttery metal taste lingers .
Palate is buttery , and it feels like the beer leaves a metal butter film in your mouth .
Overall , this is astonishingly bad .
This is the first beer that has made me want to rinse my mouth afterwards .
The initial taste is n't really as bad as the aroma , but the aftertaste is dreadful .
Well .
What can I say ?
It 's kind of fun to rate , since the taste is so complex , but I would rather drink fermented well - used soccer socks .
( 0.5l can , rated June 2006 . )
1. Mongozo Banana
The world 's worst beer
Mongozo is a series of beers with exotic fair - trade ingredients ( banana , coconut , palmnut , quinoa ) by Belgian brewer Huyghe .
Huyghe are perhaps best known for their Delirium Tremens and Delirium Nocturnum beers , and while these are respectable , the same cannot be said for the Mongozo series .
I 'm happy to say I 've only tried the coconut beer in addition to this , and that 's enough for me .
0.7 Aroma Appearance Flavour Palate Overall 2/10 2/5 1/10 1/5 1/20
Small white head over hazy yellow body .
Sweet banana aroma , initially fine , then followed by a disgusting papery , milky background with faint notes of licorice .
The taste also starts out well with sweet banana , then lurches into a violent taste of wet toilet paper , licorice , metal , rotten banana , and , I swear , a whiff of shit .
This is just absolutely dreadful .
It fails to be boring in the same way that axe murders fail to be boring .
I 've only taken two sips , so I can't analyze the taste very well , but there is no way I am drinking any more of this .
The aftertaste is long and horrifying , lasting several minutes before it gradually fades into blissful relief , kind of like the pain from a cigarette burn eventually wears off .
This sets a new low for me .
It 's a shame it looked OK , since giving it a 1 for appearance would have made me happy .
( 0.33 l bottle .
Rated October 2006 and retasted today . )
It sounds incredible that something could be so bad , yet be sold for years on end , and even exported to other countries , does n't it ?
I thought so , too , so I bought it again for this blog posting , so I could recheck , and also take a photo of it .
The aroma is bad , but bearable , just as the review says .
The taste is horrifyingly awful .
Bad enough , actually , to make me cry out loud .
I only had one sip , and rinsed my mouth afterwards .
Do n't buy this beer , that 's all I can say .
" Jeff " ( the brother of the editor of Photoshop Insider ) is pretty sure that the " plain - clothes security - guard " who approached him in a store in Italy to enforce the store 's no-photography rule was a petty con-man who just wanted to steal the memory - card out of Jeff 's camera .
As they were walking around , Jeff saw some interesting looking produce and pulled out his Canon G - 9 Point - and - Shoot and took a few pictures .
Within a few minutes a man came up dressed in plain clothes , flashed a badge , and told him he could n't take photos in the store .
My brother said " no problem " ( after all , it 's a private store , right ? ) , but then the guy demanded my brother 's memory card .
My brother gave him that " Are you outta your mind " look and said , " No way ! "
Can you guess what happened next ?
The guy simply shrugged his shoulders and walked away .
My brother saw him in the store a little later , and the guy had a bag and was shopping .
My brother made eye contact with him , and the guy turned away as though he did n't want Jeff looking at him .
Jeff feels like this was n't " official store security , " but instead some guy collecting ( and then reselling ) memory cards from unsuspecting tourists ( many of whom might have just surrendered that card immediately ) .
1 Cannibalistic Restaurant ( JAPAN )
“ Nyotaimori ” ( which literally means “ female body plate ” ) is the name of the japanese restaurant that serves sushi and sashimi on a naked woman ’s body .
The body is made from food and placed on an operating table , much as though in a hospital .
You can “ operate ” anyway and anywhere you want by cutting open the body and eating what you find inside .
The body will actually bleed as you cut it and the intestines and organs inside are completely editable .
It ’s a banquet of Cannibalism .
2 Toilet Restaurant ( TAIWAN )
Have you ever heard of people eating out of a bathroom toilet and having great fun ?
A restaurant named Marton Theme Restaurant , in Kaohsiung ( Taiwan ) has a toilet theme and is a great hit among people .
The restaurant has a bathroom decor , with colorful toilet seat being the standard chairs at the restaurant .
It also serves food in plates and bowls shaped like western loo seats and Japanese “ squat ” toilets .
Customers sits by a tables converted from a bathtub with a glass cover while looking at a wall decorated with neon - lit faucets and urinals turned into lamps .
The restaurant is named after the Chinese word “ Matong ” for toilet and is doing really well .
The owner Eric Wang says “ We not only sell food but also laughter .
The food is just as good as any restaurant but we offer additional fun .
Most customers think the more disgusting and exaggerated ( the restaurant is ) , the funnier the dining experience is .
” The meals are cheaply priced with a meal set including soup and ice cream costs from 150 to 250 Taiwan dollars ( $ 6 – $ 10 ) .
3 Restaurant in the Sky ( BELGIUM )
“ Dinner in the Sky ” is a Brussels based restaurant that serves dinner for up to 22 people … 150 feet in the air !
The specially - designed table and chairs are lifted by a crane .
Dinner anywhere in Belgium will set you back almost 8 thousand euros ; other locations are also available .
Remember , you must wear your seat belt , and do n’t drop your fork !
4 Dark Restaurant ( CHINA )
The first dark restaurant in Asia is officially opened on the 23 December 2006 .
This restaurant , located in Beijing , China , has its interior painted completely black .
Customers are greeted by a brightly lit entrance hall and will be escorted by waiters wearing night vision goggles into the pitch dark dining room to help them find their seats .
Flashlights , mobile phones and even luminous watches are prohibited while in this area .
The meal will be taken in this environment with the complete loss of vision .
By starving one ’s sense , your other senses are stimulated to full alert “ all so the theory goes ” and your food will taste like it ’s never tasted before .
In case you are wondering about the washrooms , they are all brightly lit .
5 Graveyard Restaurant ( INDIA )
The bustling “ New Lucky Restaurant ” in Ahmadabad is famous for its milky tea , its buttery rolls , and the graves between the tables .
Krishan Kutti Nair has helped run the restaurant built over a centuries - old Muslim cemetery for close to four decades , but he does n’t know who is buried in the cafe floor .
Customers seem to like the graves , which resemble small cement coffins , and that ’s enough for him .
“ The graveyard is good luck , ” Nair said one recent afternoon after the lunch rush .
“ Our business is better because of the graveyard .
” The graves are painted green , stand about shin high , and every day the manager decorates each of them with a single dried flower .
They ’re scattered randomly across the restaurant – one up front next to the cash register , three in the middle next to a table for two , four along the wall near the kitchen .
6 Restaurant in a Prison ( ITALY )
A restaurant situated inside the top security prison Fortezza Medicea in Italy is so popular that officials have since opened more branches .
Serenaded by Bruno , a pianist doing life for murder , the clientele eat inside a deconsecrated chapel set behind the 60ft high walls , watch towers , searchlights and security cameras of the daunting 500 - year - old Fortezza Medicea , at Volterra near Pisa .
Under the watchful eye of armed prison warders , a 20 - strong team of chefs , kitchen hands and waiters prepares 120 covers for diners who have all undergone strict security checks .
Tables are booked up weeks in advance .
7 Robot Restaurant : run by two identical couples ( CHINA )
People are confused how a Chinese couple managed to run a busy restaurant 21 hours a day without getting tired .
Turns out the restaurant is run by two couples … both the men and women are identical twins !
Locals had nicknamed the eatery the “ robot couple restaurant ” as they could n’t understand how the same couple seemed to be on duty from 6 am through to 3 am .
However , a journalist from Today Morning Post interviewed the restaurant owner and found out the truth .
It turned out that the twin brothers , 32 , married a set of twin sisters from the same township three years ago and moved to Yiwu to run the restaurant together .
“ Many diners thought we worked too hard and are like robots , but they do n’t know that we are actually four people , ” said Mao Zhanghua , 32 , the elder brother .
8 Undersea Restaurant ( MALDIVES )
The first - ever undersea restaurant in the world has been introduced at the Hilton Maldives Resort & Spa in April 2007 .
Ithaa ( which is pronounced “ eet - ha ” and means “ pearl ” in the language of the Maldives , Dhivehi ) sits five meters below the waves of the Indian Ocean , surrounded by a vibrant coral reef and encased in clear acrylic , offering diners 270 degrees of panoramic underwater views .
This innovative restaurant is the first of its kind in the world , and is part of a US $ 5 million re-build of Rangalifinolhu Island , one of the twin islands that make up Hilton Maldives Resort & Spa .
This re-build includes the construction of 79 of the most luxurious beach villas in the country as well as the Spa Village , a self - contained , over - water “ resort - within - a - resort ” consisting of a spa , restaurant and 21 villas .
9 Condom Restaurant ( THAILAND )
“ Cabbages and Condoms ” is a chain of restaurants in Thailand .
There are condoms on the walls and pictures of condoms printed on the carpets .
Instead of after - dinner mints , patrons are offered a bowl of condoms at the counter .
Profits from the restaurants go to support the Population and Community Development Association ( PDA ) .
10 Medical Restaurant ( TAIPEI )
D.S. Music Restaurant in Taipei , Taiwan is a medical - themed restaurant with crutches on the wall , waitresses dressed a nurses , and drinks served from an IV drip bottle !
The owner came up with the idea to express his gratitude for care he received at a local hospital .
Let us now imagine something truly absurd .
Let us presume that the game of football , as we know it , is in fact in the early stages of its evolution , and that in 100 years the games we watch on our virtual - reality headsets while riding in our Chinese - made hovercars will bear no resemblance to the slogging mass of oversized bodies and three - car pileups we witness on the football field today .
Let us now imagine a world with two quarterbacks on the field at once .
Courtesy of Piedmont High School Piedmont is playing an offense unlike anything you 've ever seen .
Several months ago , Steve Humphries dared to envision such a thing .
Humphries is the director of football operations at Piedmont ( Calif . ) High School .
Along with the school 's head coach , Kurt Bryan , he was in the process of designing an offense that would allow Piedmont to compete against the other schools in its division , most of which have much larger enrollments , and are therefore much larger , period .
Their first thought was to design an offense that consisted entirely of trick plays .
They called it the Pluto Offense .
It was ridiculously complex -- which is not surprising , given that Humphries is a Cal - Berkeley graduate , the type of guy who diagrammed every single play in the 2007 BCS National Championship game between Florida and Ohio State because he was obsessed with Urban Meyer 's play - calling strategies .
In the midst of all this planning , Humphries thought :
Why not play two quarterbacks at the same time ?
And so the A - 11 offense was born .
I am the farthest thing from an expert on football strategy , but here is what I can tell you about the A - 11 :
It is one of the weirdest things I have ever seen .
What 's weird about it is that it violates all of our basic instincts about the game , those noble truths we gleaned from John Facenda about the game being won in the trenches by men the size of water buffaloes .
It should n't work , and yet it does .
The A - 11 is the spread offense , evolved to its most advanced stage .
On film , the A - 11 often resembles a hybrid of the spread and an elementary - school fire drill gone wrong .
Here 's how it works :
On every play in the A - 11 , there are two quarterbacks in the backfield at one time , both set up seven yards behind the line of scrimmage .
Every man on the field wears a number that potentially makes him an eligible receiver .
Potential receivers set up in " pods " at each end of the field .
The line , in the base set , consists of two tight ends and a center .
Once the ball is snapped , up to six players ( including both quarterbacks ) become eligible receivers .
All of this is legal because technically , according to the rules of high - school football , the Piedmont players are lined up in what is known as a " scrimmage kick " formation ( hence , the quarterbacks placed seven yards behind the line , so as to comply with the rules ) , and therefore , normal eligibility issues do not apply .
[+]
Enlarge Piedmont High School
In this diagram , let 's say ( X , R , U , C , Y , E , Z ) step onto the line of scrimmage .
This gives you seven players on the line of scrimmage , making it a legal formation .
On every play , the possibilities are virtually limitless .
Draws , wedge plays , screen passes , the run-and - shoot , the option -- all of them can be employed , depending on how the defense reacts and on how your own players execute blocks in the open field .
Of course , this also means that the field is spread precariously thin , and you'd think this would allow several extremely angry linemen and linebackers to respond to such cuteness by blowing through and decapitating one or both quarterbacks .
But when Piedmont implemented the A - 11 last season , that did n't happen .
It is true that they lost their first game of the season , 31 - 2 , and it 's true that they lost their second game , 15 - 7 .
But they then won seven straight before losing in the first round of the playoffs , and they did all of this while facing nine different defensive looks meant to counter them .
The central notion of the A - 11 , according to Bryan , is that the ball is always faster than the man -- therefore , spreading the field negates the speed and size of opposing defenses .
If they send the house , you can even lateral from QB1 to QB2 ( and QB2 , if still behind the line of scrimmage , could throw downfield ) .
It confuses defenses , and it makes them think , and we all know there has never been a defensive coordinator anywhere who has advocated thinking .
It 's not that Humphries and Bryan have abandoned the fundamentals altogether ; it 's just that they 've stretched the notion of what the fundamentals are .
" There 's an incredible amount of method to our madness , " says Humphries , who has been careful to emphasize the importance of utilizing not just the edges of the field , but the middle , between the hashmarks , as well .
On staff is a martial - arts coach , who has taught Piedmont players the difficult skill of blocking in open space , using pressure - points and other hand - to - hand combat techniques .
It is , of course , too early to say whether the A - 11 will change football as we know it at the college and pro levels , or if it will soon be relegated to some dank graveyard of absurdist football innovations , alongside Mouse Davis and He Hate Me .
On certain Internet message boards , among officials and coaches , skepticism is rampant .

There are 10 different types of options in the A - 11 offense ( triple , crack , fly , jab , yo - yo , etc ) .
In this play the A - 11 staggers the QBs , short snaps and runs a quick hitting " speed " option on the end .
" Those people are part of a loud minority that believe the game of football should not change anymore , " says Bryan , who claims that he used the shotgun formation once in the previous two decades before converting to the A - 11 .
" And that 's not being true to the long history of the game .
The game must change , or it's doing a disservice to the founding fathers of history . "
It should be noted that Bryan has a vested interest in spreading such lofty hyperbole .
He and Humphries have a deal with American Football Monthly magazine to market videotapes ( $ 39.95 each ) and an installation manual ( $ 199 ) .
And while both insist they 're not making enough money to quit their day jobs ( Humphries is a mortgage consultant , Bryan an insurance broker ) , the attention has clearly delighted them .
( For the record , Humphries says he would not turn down a job offer if Urban Meyer called . )
But there remain questions of both will and practicality .
At the moment , thanks to the NFL 's neo -Fascist rulebook , it would be almost impossible to implement the A - 11 on the professional level .
But on the college level , there is a loophole -- a rule permits a scrimmage - kick formation if " it is obvious that a kick may be attempted , " opening up the A - 11 for use on certain situations , such as 4th - and - short or in goal - line sets -- up to , say , 10 - 12 times per game .
Bryan said he expects up to 70 college programs ( and up to a couple thousand high schools ) to implement some form of the A - 11 into their offense this season .
Among those who have contacted him was " an extremely well - known coach in Texas , " which I 'm assuming was either Texas Tech 's mad genius , Mike Leach , or Eric Taylor from " Friday Night Lights . "
" If teams use it , then it 's going to be at an important moment in the game , " Humphries says .
" And if we start seeing it on ' SportsCenter ' highlights , then a couple weeks down the road , you might see more of it happening . "
Of course , there is also a larger philosophical question here , one that goes back to our inherent notions about the game of football itself .
The dominant paradigm has always tended toward conservatism ; in the previous century , it took several decades for the forward pass to gain acceptance .
Change is frowned upon , even as it is surreptitiously embraced by coaches , who will plagiarize almost any scheme that might potentially save their jobs .
Even now , the spread offense is viewed by many as a fad , a temporary hiccup in a game that has always been governed by Lombardi- esque mantras involving clouds of dust and defense winning championships .
But here 's a striking thought :
What if this is truly , inevitably the future of football we are witnessing ( albeit in a still - imperfect package ) ?
Is this acceptable to the masses ?
Or is part of the beauty of football in its inherent stodginess , in the image of a 240 - pound fullback plowing into a pile of bodies while trying to move the spheroid forward by 12 inches ?

The A - 11 does n't just have pods of three players on every play .
The Piedmont A - 11 has over 30 formations in its playbook , including this " 43 " formation below .
This play takes advantage of numbers and runs a QB flare pass behind a wall of players .
" A lot of fans are bored by the NFL , " said Humphries .
" There 's such a conservative and rigid set of rules that you have n't seen a lot of innovation in pro football , at least since Bill Walsh .
So if this is creating a new strategy that makes the game more fun , that 's a great thing .
And even if this eliminates that situation of 4th - and - 1 on the other team 's 40 , when you punt the ball into the other team 's end zone -- where there 's no innovation or imagination -- then hallelujah . "
At one point , Humphries compared the A - 11 to a chess strategy , which reminded me of a different sort of mad genius .
In the 1990's , Bobby Fischer invented something called Fischer Random Chess , in which the pieces are essentially set up at random at the beginning of each game , so as to emphasize creativity rather than rote memorization .
Fischer was undeniably insane , but his idea has been embraced by some as the future of chess .
It has also been condemned by others as the ravings of a lunatic .
And while I do not know if the A - 11 can challenge all our assumptions , or if it is merely a lark , I do know that it accomplishes one very important thing :
It reminds us that nothing in the universe can ever remain static .
Not even football .

NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) -
In an animal study of osteoporosis , researchers have shown that low - dose aspirin can decrease the activity of cells that breakdown bone , while increasing the activity of cell that build up bone , according to research published online in the journal PLoS One .
Increased activity of cells that breakdown bone is typically cited as the cause of osteoporosis , but recent evidence suggests that a drop in bone - forming cells may also play a role , Dr. Songtao Shi from University of Southern California School of Dentistry , Los Angeles , and colleagues note .
In lab studies , the team found that aspirin reduced the destruction of bone - forming cells in mice .
They further showed that adding low - dose aspirin makes bone - forming cells more active and bone - degrading cells less active , resulting in thicker and stronger bones .
“ Aspirin may offer a new approach ” for treating the osteoporosis commonly seen in postmenopausal women , the researchers conclude .
Although human studies have suggested that regular use of aspirin may have a moderate beneficial effect on bone thickness in postmenopausal women , “ more detailed studies are necessary to ( clarify ) the underlying mechanism by which aspirin may prevent and treat osteoporosis , ” Shi added in comments to Reuters Health .

PROJECT LONGSHOT
This report presents a preliminary design for an unmanned probe to Alpha Centauri with a planned launch early in the 21st century .
This mission was based upon a requirement stated in the report by the National Commission on Space , Pioneering the Space Frontier .
The probe would be assembled at the space station and take approximately 100 years to reach the nearest star .
Several technologies must be developed in order for this mission to be possible .
A pulsed fusion microexplosion drive with 1,000,000 seconds of specific impulse is the primary enabling technology .
A large , long - life fission reactor with 300 kilowatts power output is also required .
Communications lasers would use 0.532 micron wavelength since there is minimal power output by the starts in that frequency band .
A laser with an inupt power of 250 kilowatts would alow for a data rate of 1000 bits per second at maximum range .
There are three types of information to be gathered by the probe : properties of the interstellar medium , characteristics of the three - star Alpha Centauri system , and astrometry ( finding distances to starts using parallax measurements ) .

1.0 MISSION MODEL
1.1 General Mission
The subject of this report is the design of an unmanned probe to Alpha Centauri .
This mission is called for in the report by the National Commission on Space , Pioneering the Space Frontier .
On pages 38 through 40 the commission outlines a program for solar and space physics which is planned for the period " beyond the initial operation of the space station , " and includes " a long life high - velocity spacecraft to be sent out of the Solar System on a trajectory to the nearest star . "
Our probe will be a completely autonomous design based upon a combination of current technology and technological advances which can be reasonably expected to be developed over the next 20 to 30 years .
The expected launch date is in the beginning of the next century with a transit time of 100 years .
The mission profile will be as follows :
1. Assembly of modular components on the ground .
2. Launch of components to LEO .
3. Assembly of components at Space Station .
4. Boost assembled and fueled spacecraft to injection point for interstellar trajectory using chemical upper stage .
5 . Start main fusion drive and begin interstellar flight which will last approximately 100 years .
6 . During this period will be returned on the interstellar medium and magnetic fields .
7. Enter elliptical orbit around Beta Centauri and begin transmission of data .
1.2 Technology
Using purely current technologies , a mission to another star system would be impossible to complete .
There are basically three main areas where advances are needed : propulsion , data processing for command and control functions , and reliability .
In order to reduce transit time to an acceptable length , specific impulses on the order of 10E6 seconds are required .
This represents an increase of several orders of magnitude over chemical rockets and nuclear rocket models which can be implemented using only present technology .
To achieve the required levels of impulse , a pulsed fusion reactor based rocket engine is proposed .
Based on the current level of technology in the field of microbomb fusion it is reasonable to assume that in 20 to 30 years such a system will be possible .
Due to the great distance at which the probe will operate , positive control from earch will be impossible due to the great time delays involved .
This fact necessitates that the probe be able to think for itself .
In order to accomplish this , advances will be required in two related but separate fields , artificial intelligence and computer hardware .
IA research is advancing at a tremendous rate .
Progress during the last decade has been phenomenal and there is no reason to expect it to slow any time soon .
Therefore , it should possible to design a system with the required intelligence by the time that this mission is expected to be launched .
The problem with basing the design on current hardware is one of weight and speed .
Producing a system with the required intelligence and speed , while including the needed redundancy using current technology , would result in a huge unit requiring a cooling system as large as a nuclear power plant's .
Current advances have shrunk a Cray 2 from a room sized system needing a huge cooling plant to two chips , and with the advent of high temperature super - conductor technology there is every reason to assume that many more such quantum leaps in computer technology may be expected in the next 20 to 30 years .
Since no one has ever designed a dynamic system to last for more than a century , it is impossible to guess just how much the reliability of current systems will have to be improved .
However , many satellites which were designed with mission lives of only a few years have operated for much longer periods of time , often failing merely because they ran out of expendables .
The Transit family is a good example : they were designed to last for only 18 months and there are some still operating after 18 years or more .
Other examples include Pioneer , Mariner , Voyager , and Viking .
With successes in reliability such as these , and the improvements in simulation technology which will come with the improvements in computer technology ( discussed in the previous paragraph ) , there should be no difficulty in designing in the required reliability .
1.3 Infrastructure
A very strong effort towards space exploration will be required to complete this mission and this commitment will have to begin in order to ensure that those systems essential for the production of the probe and its initial boost phase will be in place when the enabling technologies are realized .
These systems include a heavy - lift launch vehicle , a large space station and an advanced , high energy upper stage .
These requirements represent merely the technological infrastructure ; also required is a very large initial human infrastructure , as well as a long term human commitment .
The heavy - lift launcher is needed since current weight estimates for the spacecraft are in excess of 350 metric tons .
Even after taking into account the assumption that the ship will be launched to LEO as a series of modular components , the size ofmany of the modules precludes their launch on the Shuttle .
Additionally , some units will be too massive and complex to be launched by available launch vehicles .
Since a basic assumption in this analysis is that the probe will be launched in a modular form and assembled in orbit , it is necessary to provide an orbiting base of operations for the personnel assembling the components of the spacecraft .
This base will be the Space Station .
Requirements for the station will include :
- Capability to house a large work force to include assemble technicians and test engineers .
- A number of large manipulator arms and sufficient mechanical support structure to allow attachment of all required assembly jigs .
- Adequate data processing capability to perform systems checks during assembly and thefinal system check - out following assembly .
Due to the nature of the main drive , it is both inadvisable and impossible to complete the mission by igniting the fusion drive in LEO .
This fact leads to the requirement for the advanced upper stage .
The planned in - solar system mission profile calls for a series of three burns using these upper stages to escape the solar system from which the interstellar injection may be made .
This report will assume that the upper stage will have twice the impulse and similar weight characteristics to a Space Shuttle SRB .
The human side of the infrastructure will be a much greater challenge than the technical side because the required commitment spans such a long period of time .
The time between the initial authorization for the mission until the return of the first data from the Alpha Centauri system will be well in excess of one century .
In fact it will probably be on the order of two centuries when the time needed for hardware design , procurement , in - orbit assembly , and transit are considered .
The effort required to design , build and launch the probe would be on the order of the Apollo project or much larger .
The commitment at the other end of the mission should be an easy one to fulfill since scientists will be eager to analyze the incoming data .
Thus , the greatest challenge coming with the caretaker portion of the mission - the century of travel time when very little data will be transmitted .
The problem here is not the number of people required , since it will be small , but rather the time involved .
There has never been a similar project in modern history carried out over such a long time scale .
However , there have been organizations which have lasted for such a time .
In fact , some have lasted longer !
Some examples include : the militaries of nations such as the U.S. and U.K. , various research institutions like the National Geographic Society and the Smithsonian Institution , and private organizations such as the Red Cross and the Explorer 's Club .
The precedent exists for organizations continuing for the required time frame .
Therefore it can be assumed that the required support structure can be established .
2.0 MISSION PROFILE
2.1 Objective Star System
The star system chosen as our objective system for this mission is the Alpha Centauri system .
There are three main reasons for choosing this system as the destination of the probe : ( 1 ) the system 's proximity to our solar system ; ( 2 ) the scientific interest of a trinary system ; ( 3 ) sending a probe to this star system provides an opportunity to make great advances in the field of astrometry .
One of the main concerns regarding the success of the mission is the ability of the probe to be in good working order when it reaches the objective system .
While any interstellar mission will require transit time in excess of a century , the Alpha Centauri system is the closest to our own , and thus provides the best opportunity to deliver a functional probe to another star system .
While it would be a great achievement to do a close - up study of any other star system , the Alpha Centauri system promises to be a particularly interesting objective .
Alpha and Beta Centauri , which are type G2V and dK1 stars , respectively , orbit each other with a separation of 11 to 35 AU .
The third star of the system , Proxima Centauri , orbits the other pair at a distance of about 1/6 of a light year .
Proxima Centauri is a type dM5e red dwarf , which exhibits sudden changes in magnitude .
It is also one of the smallest known stellar masses .
Proxima 's position should provide an opportunity for the probe to pass relatively close by on its way to its final destination , a close orbit around Beta Centauri .
There is also the possibility that this star system contains planets .
Advances in astronomy before the probe is launched should provide much more information about the system to help plan the probe 's exploration .
Perhaps the greatest contribution that the mission will make to the scientific community will be in the field of astrometry .
Sending a spacecraft to the Alpha Centauri system provides an opportunity to make parallax measurements with a baseline of 4.34 light years ( see Fig 2.1a ) .
This is over 63,000 times longer than the present method , which uses the semi-major axis of the Earth 's orbit as a baseline ( see Fig 2.1 b ) .
At this time , parallax measurements are only accurate to about 20 parsecs from the Sun .
The longer baseline would allow accurate measurements of stellar distances of more than 1.2 million parsecs .
If the probe lasts long enough , it has the potential to accurately determine the distance to hundreds of trillions of stars .
Knowing the distance to a star is vital in determining its properties .
Such an accomplishment would keep astronomers busy for quite some time .

2.2 Operations
Assembly of the probe will occur in two phases : major components and subsystems will be assembled and tested on the ground , and then sent to LEO for final assembly and integration into the spacecraft .
Transfer to orbit will require multiple launches with initial estimates indicating that launches will be carried out in the following manner , ( based on current projections ) :
Fusion engine - one launch on an ALS - class vehicle .
Main structure - one launch on a Shuttle - class vehicle .
Fuel tanks - one launch on an ALS - class vehicle .
Fuel - one launch on a Growth ALS - class vehicle .
Payload - one launch on an ALS - class vehicle .
Upper stages for the initial phase of the mission will be launched as required based upon advances in upper stage technology .
The fusion drive will be launched as a finished unit due to its complexity .
It will be equipped with a plug - in type interface for integration with the remainder of the ship .
The main structure will be a collapsible space frame , which will be erected from its stored configuration by personnel at the space station .
Additional structure will also be orbited in collapsed form for erection at Space Station .
The fuel tanks will be built of sheet aluminum with formed end caps .
The end caps will be launched in a completed and stacked configuration and the sheeting for the bodies will be rolled into a solid cylinder for launch .
Assembly will occur in orbit using advanced adhesives technology .
The fuel for the fusion engine will consist of He3 and deuterium .
The He3 will probably be manufactured on earth using particle accelerators , and then both components of the fuel will be launched in liquid form to orbit for processing into pelletized reactor fuel .
The payload , like the fusion drive , will be launched fully - assembled , and have a simple plug - in interface to the rest of the system .
By the time that this mission will be flown , the experience gained through the assembly of Space Station , and the ongoing orbital operations which it is expected to support , will provide an adequate base of technology for personnel to assemble the probe .
During assembly , systems checks will be run as each component is integrated into the spacecraft , to prevent failures which could necessitate disassembly of components assembled in orbit .
Following assembly , a comprehensive system check - out will be made prior to ignition of the upper stages .
The fission reactor will be used to provide the initial power required to start the fusion reactor .
Once the drive is ignited it will become self - sustaining and provide enough excess power to operate the system in use during the transit .
During this phase , fuel will be drawn from symmetrically located pairs of fuel tanks to avoid instability caused by non-homogeneous mass distribution .
As each pair of tanks is emptied , they will be discarded .
Tank volume has been calculated so that four of the ship 's six tanks will have been jettisoned by the time it reaches the turn around point ( see Figs 2.2a and 2.2 b ) .
This point has been chosen so that reversal of the spacecraft and reignition of the main drive will result in arrival at the target at proper insertion speed .
When the turn around point is reached , the drive will be shut down , and the probe rotated 180 degrees with respect to its velocity vector using the attitude control system .
Following the turn around maneuver , the fission reactor will again be used to provide power at restart the drive .
These activities will occur at the 71.27 year point in the mission ( see Figs. 2.2c and 2.2d for graphs and appendix for calculations ) .
Throughout this phase of the flight , data from experiments on interstellar space will be returned to earth at low data rates .
This will serve two purposed , providing scientific data , and ensuring that contact will be maintained with the probe .
Since the probe will be fully autonomous , any problems with the communications system , due to degradation of the transmitting equipment or faulty link analysis will have to be corrected by making improvements to the receiving equipment .
Maintaining constant contact will allow the required lead time to implement any necessary corrective measures in the receiving equipment .
After deceleration is completed , the two remaining fuel tanks and the fusion drive will be discarded and the instruments deployed .
The attitude control system which was used to rotate the entire spacecraft will be used as necessary to place the probe into an elliptical orbit around Beta Centauri and to maintain this orbit .
Once in orbit , high data rate collection and transfer will begin based on both a preprogrammed series of studies and a set of prioritized experiments ( determined by what is found in the system ) .
This will continue until the spacecraft 's nuclear plant ceases to produce enough power to operate the communications lasers , which will constitute the end of the mission .

2.3 OrbitsOnce the probe is assembled in orbit at the space station , it will be nudged into an indpendent but similar orbit to prevent damage to the station due to the exhaust from the first upper - stage burn ( see Fig. 2.3a ) .
This burn will be made to increase the inclination of the probe orbit from 28.5 degrees to 37.5 degrees so that it will sum with the obliquity and result in an orbit inclined 61 degrees relative to the ecliptic .
This stage will be jettisoned , and the spacecraft will then escape Earth with a second burn which occurs at the ascending node of the probe 's orbit about the earth ( see Fig. 2.3 b ) .
This point then becomes the ascending node of the probe 's heliocentric orbit , which is a circular orbit at 1 AU and at an inclination of 61 degrees .
The second stage will then separate , and three months ( i.e. one - fourth of an orbit ) later , the third and final upper - stage will burn .
This will send the spacecraft on an escape trajectory toward the Centauri system ( see Fig. 2.3 c ) , which is located at a declination of - 61 degrees to the ecliptic .
Upon completion of the interstellar phase of the mission the probe will be inserted into an eccentric orbit about Beta ( see Figs. 2.3d and 2.3e ) .

AT PERIGEE : 32.9 km/secAssuming a space station orbit of 300 kilometers at an inclination of 28.5 degrees , the following values were determined for required velocity changes for the probe .
The Alpha Centauri star system is at a declination of - 61 degrees relative to the ecliptic of our solar system .
At the optimum launch position , the obliquity ( 23.5 degrees from the eliptic ) will sum with the inclination angle of the spacecraft 's orbit ( 28.5 degrees from the equator ) .
This will make the probe 's orbit 52 degrees from the ecliptic .
Thus , a 9 degree plane change is required to put the probe into a 61 degree orbit around the earth ( relative to the ecliptic ) .
From this orbit , another velocity change is necessary to escape the earth 's gravity and inject the probe into a circular orbit around the sun at 1 AU and a 61 degree inclination .
At this point , there are two options to be considered , depending on the fuel source , Earth or Jupiter .
For the first option , the probe will leave from this orbit directly for Alpha Centauri , in which case it will change velocity at the perihelion of the transfer orbit between our solar system and Alpha Centauri .
For the second option the spacecraft will transfer to a Jupiter - distanced heliocentric orbit , using a velocity change at the perihelion of the Earth to Jupiter transfer orbit , and inject into an orbit around Jupiter at a 61 degree inclination ( to take on fuel ) .
The probe will then escape back into a Jupiter - distanced heliocentric orbit at 61 degrees relative to the ecliptic ) .
Finally , it will escape the solar system and head for Alpha Centauri , with a burn at perihelion of the Sol - Centauri transfer orbit . ( see appendix for actual number calculations ) 1. Delta - V for plane change of 9 degrees : 1.2123 km /s2 .
Delta-V to escape earth : 3.2002 km/s3 .
Delta -V to escape solar system : 12.4273 km /s4 . Total Delta - V for Option # 1 : 16.8398 km / sFor Option # 2 , the first two numbers are the same .
5. Delta -V to enter Earth - Jupiter transfer : 8.8223 km/s6 . Delta-V to orbit around Jupiter : 7.4814 km/s7 . Delta -V to escape Jupiter : 6.1705 km /s8 .
Delta -V to escape solar system 5.4087 km/s9 .
Total Delta - V for Option # 2 : 32.2954 km /sObviously , the option of picking up fuel mined from the atmosphere of Jupiter would be impractical because of high cost and complication .
For the objective orbit within the Centauri system , Beta was chosen as the target star because it is a dK type star , about which we have very little data , while Alpha is a G2 type star like our own , which we have studied extensively .
The orbit chosen is based on an assumption that Alpha and Beta ( which vary in distance between 11 and 35 AU ) will be at the lesser of the two distances .
The orbit chosen is an elliptical orbit around Beta for which the aphelion lies on the line between Alpha and Beta .
The perihelion radius was set at 1 AU .
The aphelion was determined based on a requirement that the gravitational effect of Alpha would not exceed 5 % of the gravitational effect of Beta .
Accordingly , an aphelion of 2.5 AU was chosen .
At this aphelion the gravitational force on the probe due to Alpha will be equal to 3.3 % of the gravitational force due to Beta .
Based on the chosen perihelion and aphelion radii , the orbital parameters were determined : a = 1.75 AUe = 0.428572E = -216.95 kmE2/secE2T

sThe perihelion velocity will be the velocity to which the probe must be slowed for proper insertion into this orbit .3.0 SPACECRAFT SYSTEMS3.1 PowerPower for the instruments , computer , communication lasers , and star trackers will be supplied by a 300 kilowatt nuclear reactor .
This reactor will be compact - sized , have a low specific mass , long life , high reliability , and a variable power output .
Different systems were compared , and a design published by Jones , MacPherson , and Nichols , of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory was chosen and scaled down to suit the needs of the Centauri mission .
This power system concept defines a nuclear reactor with ceramic fuel , clad with refractory metal , and cooled by liquid potassium ( 1365 K ) .
Also described is a direct , closed Rankine power conversion cycle , and a large tetraxial flywheel energy storage system featuring graphite composite materials and magnetic bearings .
The fuel is enriched uranium nitride pellets .
The reactor and flywheel systems will be constructed as separate modules designed to fit in the shuttle cargo bay .
The reactor will boil potassium which will then be piped through a turbine that will convert the thermal energy to mechanical energy .
The potassium is further cooled by flowing through the heat radiators and is then recycled back into the reactor .
The electrical current produced by the spinning turbine is directed to the two ( for redundancy ) energy storage systems located at either end of the main structural truss .
The modules contain flywheels which story the energy in their spin rate , and also provide attitude control by absorbing external torques .

3.2 Propulsion
3.2.1 In Solar System
Since it will not be practical ( or safe ! ) to ignite the fusion drive while in earth orbit , another propulsion system will need to be used for the plane change and to escape the Earth and the solar system ( see Orbits ) .
Advanced solid rockets will be employed to accomplish these velocity changes .
It is assumed that they will be similar in size and fuel to the Space Shuttle 's SRB's with twice the specific impulse ( near 600 seconds ) .
Based on this assumption , the following parameters for the various upper stages were calculated :

Interstellar TransitDeveloping a Propulsion system capable of meeting the 100 - year interstellar travel time is the most difficult part of the mission design .
4.3 light years is an easily misinterpreted distance .
It is equivalent to 41,000 terra meters ( 41E15 km ) which would take the space shuttle just over 190,000 years ( assuming it had escaped the solar system at the speed of Low Earth Orbit ) .
Although 100 years is a long time , this requirement expects a three - order - of - magnitude leap over current propulsion technology .
3.2.2.1 Choosing the SystemAfter the initial inspection of potential Interstellar Drive candidates , it was decided that chemical fuels would not be able to produce a three order af magnitude over current systems in the near future .
Five alternate technologies were compared for their potential as Interstellar Drive candidates : Pulsed Fusion Microexplosions , Laser - pumped Light Sails , Ion Drive , High Temperature Thermal Expansion of Gas , and Matter Anti-matter Annihilation ( see Fig. 3.2a for a summary table ) .
After a thorough inspection of each of the five candidates it was decided that only the Pulsed Fusion Microexplosion was adequately capable of carrying out the mission requirements .

LASERThe Matter Anti-matter Annihilation could potentially be capable of producing the necessary specific impulse of a million seconds , but it was not considered to be feasible to creat a system adequate for storing the anti-matter for 100 years under the limited power constraints of a spacecraft .
The ideal rocket equation was used to determine the potential specific impulse of an extremely high temperature expansion of gas through a nozzle .
( See calculations and assumptions in appendix . )
Using the critical temperature for sustained Deuterium fusion ( 3.9E8 degrees Kelvin ) a specific impulse of 39000 seconds was calculated ( 1/300th the specific impulse desired ) .
Since this specific impulse is insufficient for the mission requirements ( using an extremely optimistic temperature under ideal conditions ) , this candidate was dropped .
Advances in technology for an accelerated ion drive ( using a magnitec / electric field to fire charged particles out of a nozzle ) have brought the specific impulse to 3500 seconds .
Although this is a current technology that could be implemented now at relatively low cost , it is felt that the two remaining orders of magnitude will remain out of reach in the near future .
Therefore , this candidate was also discarded .
In determining the feasability of a Laser - pumped Light Sail , another method besides comparing specific impulse becomes necessary , since the drive is external .
The single impulse required to reach the designated system in 100 years was determined to be 13,500 km / sec .
The size of a laser with continuous output , to accelerate the payload to 13,500 km / sec in a year , is 3.75 Terra Watts .
Since a micropulsed 1 Terra Watt laser has been developed , it is conceivable ( although extremely unlikely ) that the necessary laser could be invented within the next 20 years .
The low feasability , coupled with the lack of a system for decceleration into the Centauri System , led to the cancellation of this system 's candidacy ) see appendix for calculations ) .
3.2.2.2 Pulsed Fusion Microexplosion DriveThe Pulsed Fusion Microexplosion
Drive is not a current , but rather an enabling technology .
The system concept , modeled after the British Interplanetary Society 's project DAEDALUS , is to fire high energy particle beams at small fusionable pellets that will implode and be magnetically channeled out the nozzle ( see Figs. 3.2 b and 3.2c ) .
The expected specific impulse is 1.02E6 seconds .
The specific mass breakdown for separate sections ( including fusion chamber , particle beam igniter system , and magnetic nozzle / inductor system ) is included in the structures section ( 2.3.2 ) .
Finally , the entire system is expected to gimble a full degree in two axes to enable navigational corrections in three dimensions .
Text : PULSED FUSION CONCEPT1 .
THE PELLET IS LOADED AND FIRED UPON BY SEVERAL HIGH POWER PARTICLE / LASER BEAMS.2. THE FUSION EXPLOSION IS DIRECTED OUT OF THE EXIT VIA THE MAGNETIC " NOZZLE " .
Text : PULSED FUSION CONCEPT3 .
THE HIGH VELOCITY PULSE ( ~10000 KM/S ) INDUCES A CURRENT IN THE COILS THAT SURROUND THE EXIT PORT .
THIS ENERGY IS USED TO RE - CHARGE THE PARTICLE / LASER BEAMS AND THE MAGNETIC FIELD .
The type of fuel used in the pellets is of critical importance .
Due to the extremes of temperature ad duress inherent in fusion reactions , a magnetic field is required to supplant the casing around the fusion chamber .
The problem involved with using such a field ( besides the obvious requirement for immense quantities of energy ) is that only charged particles will be channeled out the nozzle .
Although the extreme temperatures will instantly ionize all of the atoms and molecules , any neutrons produced in thefusion reaction will not be affected by the magnetic field .
Instead , they will irradiate the drive and the entire spacecraft over the 100 year transit , and reduce the drive efficiency .
Since this is a highly undesirable result , a reaction which produces few to no neutrons is required ( see appendix ) .
He3 + H2 yields no neutrons ( although realistically some of the deuterium will react with itself producing a limited number of neutrons in each implosion ) .
The problem is not solved , however , since there is not enough He3 on our planet to fuel the spacecraft !
Three methods of gaining the necessary He3 have been compared : mining the planet Jupiter ; creating He3 through the bombardment of Lithium in nuclear accelerators ; and capturing He3 from the Solar Wing .
Another possibility is for a further technological breakthrough to enable using higher threshold - energy fusion reactions ( higher than H , He ) which use more abundant elements in a no-neutron reaction .
None of the options seem very reasonable , and each should be explored and further developed to determine the best method for collecting the necessary fusionable material .
The pellet size , in order to obtain the proper mass flow through the nozzle , depends upon the pulse frequency .
Smaller pellet size could potentially lower the coil mass as well as the igniter mass , although the higher frequency would complicate fuel injection in a system that must run for 100 years continuously , without repair .
The appendix shows the spectrum available between the DAEDALUS pellet size and frequency ( since DAEDALUS required a higher mass flow ) .
After the final upper stage separation , the nuclear reactor will be increased to full power in order to charge the interstellar drive capacitors for initial ignition .
The Interstellar drive will then be used for both acceleration and deceleration .
The system is to be turned off at the appropriate time ( determined through an internal navigational calculation ) , rotated 180 degrees , and restarted , all while staying on course .
The payload contains a 300 kw nuclear power reactor which must be also capable of starting and restarting .
The nuclear power will have to be ignited , and rechanneled to repower the slowly draining capacitors of the Interstellar Driver igniter system , after the spacecraft has fully rotated and stabilized in the proper alignment .
3.2.2.3 Feasability
The entire Interstellar Drive is highly dependent upon enabling technology .
Building an actual scale model that is capable of running continuously for 100 years will be a challenge by itself !
Barring further significant technological breakthroughs , the collection of fuel will be the most difficult and time consuming portion of the building .
Never the less , within 20 years , these projects should be possible with the proper funding .
Current technology is already capable of creating singular microexplosions in the laboratory .
3.3 Instrumentation3.3.1 Instruments
The instruments to be carried on board the probe head are as follows : IR ImagersVisual ImagersUV TelescopesHigh - Energy Particle DetectorsAstrometrical TelescopesWide - Band SpectrophotometersMagnetometersSolar
Wind Plasma AnalyzersCommunications LasersThree of each item will be carried on the spacecraft for triple redundancy .
The total weight of the instrumentation package ( including everything listed , except the communications lasers ) is estimated at not more than 3 metric tons .
The estimated weight of the communications lasers is 2 metric tons .
The peak power requirement of the instruments is estimated at 300 kW .
The justification for the visual imagers is obvious .
Everyone will want to " see " what another star system looks like .
In addition to providing important scientific information , a picture will be worth a thousand words or a thousand pages of numbers when it comes to obtaining funding for follow - up missions to other star systems .
IR Imagers and UV Telescopes will provide the first exact data on the characteristics of stars other than our own .
Also , one must not forget the possibility that the Alpha Centauri system contains planets .
These instruments could also provide data on the radiation and thermal environment of any planets in the system .
The High - Energy Particle Detectors are one of the few types of instruments which will be active during the transit to the objective system .
Hard data on the energy level and density of such particles could provide insight into the origin and eventual fate of the universe .
The Astrometrical Telescopes will be the backbone of the mission .
By providing the data to accurately determine the distance to the further stars , these instruments will advance the study of stellar characteristics immeasurably .
The only limit to this aspect of the mission will be the endurance of the spacecraft .
( The section on the objective system contains an explanation of how this will be accomplished . )
The Wide - Band Spectro - photometers will determine the composition of the stars and any planet sized bodies which the system may contain .
The Magnetometers will also be in use during the entire life of the probe .
These instruments will provide extensive data on what should prove to be the very interesting magnetic field of a trinary star system .
Also , they will provide the first hard data on the galactic magnetic field and how it interacts with the magnetic fields of our own solar system and the Alpha Centauri system .
The Solar Wind Plasma Analyzers will also provide some scientific " firsts " .
While the composition of the Sun 's solar wind is already known , these instruments will accurately determine how far the wind extends into inter-stellar space .
This will also be done for the Centauri wind , as well as determining its composition .
Also , the close binary pair of Alpha and Beta Centauri should exhibit a very interesting pattern where their solar winds interact .
The communications lasers , in addition to performing their obvious function , will at the same time provide data on extremely long - range laser communication and the extent of spreading losses caused by the interstellar medium .
3.3.2 Instrumentation ConfigurationTwo possible configurations for the mounting of the instruments were considered .
Both consisted of three booms attached to the probe body spaced at 120 degree intervals with each boom supportinga complete instrument package , but one was dynamic and the other static .
The dynamic boom configuration was designed with the intent of retaining the forward particle shield as a structural and operational part of the probe body after orbit is achieved in the target system .
The particle shield was to be infused with pipes to provide additional radiating area for waste heat .
The shield could also be used to house elements of the probe 's central processing units .
The major advantages of the dynamic boom configuration are its additional cooling capability and the additional shielding which would be provided in - system for the body of the probe .
The major disadvantage is that the mobility of the booms would have to be maintained for the length of the mission .
This configuration would require movable mounts at the base of each boom capable of handling the large torques caused by moving the boom .
These torques would also pose an additional problem for the probe 's attitude control system .
Furthermore , the advantage of a larger cooling surface would be offset by the added thermal control complications .
The static boom configuration , ( see Fig. 3.3a ) was designed to discard the front particle shield upon approach to the target system .
The instrument booms will be firmly attached to the probe body and the only movable parts will be the individual instrument mountings .
The major advantages of the static boom configuration are the lower number of parts expected to move after the long interstellar transit , and the lower final mass of the probe in - system .
The major disadvantage of this design is the need for pyrotechnics to eject the shield after transit .
All things considered , the static boom design was adopted , mostly due to its greater reliability .
Text : STATIC BOOM PROBE CONFIGURATIONINSTRUMENT
BOOMSUPPORT PILLARFig. 3.3a3.4 Communications System Design
The major challenges for the communications system of the interstellar probe both occur when the probe enters the target system at a range of 4.3 light - years , or 4.109 x 10 ^16 meters .
This is the maximum transmission range ; a fairly high data rate must be maintained , since all probe instrumentation is returning data .
The only type of communications system capable of the necessary directivity and data rate is a high - power laser using pulse code modulation ( PCM ) .
Low background noise from the target system is necessary for a low power level , so a laser wavelength of 0.532 microns was chosen .
Radiation of this wavelength is almost totally absorbed by the outer atmospheres of K and G type stars , leaving a hole in the absorption spectrum ( no transmitted radiation ) .
Laser radiation of this wavelength can be produced by a frequency - doubled diode - pumped YAg laser with an optical attachment to provide a large initial aperture .
The transmitter aperture is 2 meters in diameter with receiving mirrors of 24 meters diameter .
The spreading angle is 1.22 * lambda divided by the aperture diameter , or 3.25 x 10 ^ - 7 radians ( 0.67 arcseconds ) .
At 4.34 light - years , the spreading results in a footprint radius of 13.4 million kilometers , 8.9 % of an Astronomical Unit ( AU ) .
Both the pointing accuracy of the laser mount and the attitude determination capability of the probe must be within 0.067 arcseconds , so very low error laser mounts and star trackers will be used .
A total input power of 250 kilowatts is needed for each laser that is transmitting .
With an assumption of a 20 % lasing efficiency , the transmitted power is 50 kilowatts .
If the power is distributed isotropically over an area of 5.64 x 10^20 square meters ( the area subtended by the laser bean when it reached Earth ) , the power density is 8.87 x 10 ^ - 17 watts per square meter , or 222 photons per square meter per second .
For a 12 meter radius receiving mirror ( area of 452.4 square meters ) , the received power level is 4.01 x 10 ^ - 14 watts , or 100,000 photons per second .
Using the assumption that a digital pulse ' on ' level is 100 photons , the receiver sees 1000 pulses per second .
A data rate of 1000 bits per second is low .
Note that this rate is the minimum because the transmitter would be at maximum range .
If extremely reliable lasers are used , each transmitter can operate at a slightly different wavelength , so the data rate would be up to six times greater depending upon the number of lasers used .
The communications system would use six 250 kilowatt lasers .
Three would be placed on the outside of the fuel tanks with the star trackers for communications during the acceleration phase .
Three more lasers would be attached to the probe head for communications during the deceleration and in - system phases of the mission .
The receiving mirrors would be in geosynchronous orbit about the earth in a constellation of several mirrors with a central node serving as a relay station to TDRSS and the ground .
3.5 Data Processing
One of the significant " enabling technologies " required to perform the interstellar probe mission is that of advanced processing .
When the spacecraft reaches its target , the probe will be 4.3 light - years away from command and control facilities on Earth , and will thus have to be completely autonomous and self - repairing .
The processing system will ideally have low power consumption to reduce heat dissipation requirements .
It will be multiply redundant with advanced shielding and survivability features , and also be able to control all facets of probe operations , including high level decision - making .
As shown in the sectional appendix , the probe must evaluate given mission objectives to control the scientific instruments in order to explore the Alpha Centauri system most effectively .
If the system can integrate high - accuracy attitude determination and scientific data instantaneously , the attitude control requirement can be relaxed to a level easily maintained by such a large structure .
Finally , the data must be taken out of processor 's memory and sent to earth via laser .
The communications lasers must be pointed with an accuracy of .067 arc - seconds , and a hard file of the position of the earth relative to Sol must be retained in memory to govern the pointing of the laser .
Once the target system is reached , the processing unit must be able to achieve and maintain an acceptable orbit , and maneuver to investigate high priority phenomena , such as evidence of intelligent life .
For a block diagram of the data processing system , see appendix .
3.6 Guidance
A system of star trackers will be used for both navigation and attitude determination .
This system has been chosen for its high accuracy ( 4 arc sec ) and adaptability , and for its low weight ( 7 kg ) and power requirements ( 18 watts ) .
Star scanners were not chosen since the spacecraft is not rotating , and they are less accurate .
The trackers will be coupled to a computer system which will have a star catalogue of 200 - 300 stars ' locations .
" Adaptability " refers to this catalogue , because a " best guess " of star locations that the probe will " see " on the trip and in orbit in the Centauri system can be programmed into the computer before launch , thus increasing the accuracy of position / attitude determination .
This best guess could even be updated enroute or in Centauri - orbit by the astrometry calculations that the computer will make .
Initially , during the transit between Earth and the point where the probe - head separates from the propulsion system , trackers located on the last fuel tanks will be used .
These trackers will be oriented in different directions in order to gain a nearly complete field of view .
18 trackers will be used , 3 in each of the 6 axis directions to get the greatest field of view and triple redundancy .
The power for these trackers will come from generators drawing energy from the propulsion system waste heat .
In the final mission phase , 9 trackers located on the instrument booms will be used , 3 on each boom instrument head .
( This will require a very accurate position determination of the boom rotation angles . )
Three 3 - axis rate - gyro assemblies will determine the rate of change of any two pointing angles and the spacecraft roll rate .
This data will supplement the trackers ' information and increase the attitude determination accuracy .
Star tracker parameters :
Solid state ( vice photomultiplier tube )
4 arcsecond accuracy ( future improvement is expected )
Magnitude range - 1 to +6
Field of view 6x6 degrees

1.2 seconds to search field in 1 x 1 degree search mode

Total weight - 189 kg
Total power in transit - 324 watts
Total power after probe separation - 162 watts
A summary of the attitude control systems available to choose from are listed in Fig. 3.6a .
The probe 's attitude control will be accomplished using two sets of flywheels arranged on 4 axes ( described in section 3.3 Power System ) , and an auxiliary system of hydrazine thrusters .
These flywheels will serve as momentum wheels , controlled by the computer using the attitude / rate information , providing torque to maintain spacecraft stability .
The 4 - axis configuration will enable the reaction wheels to absorb external torques from any direction .
The magnitude of this reaction torque is easily modulated by electronic control of the reaction wheel motor current .
One disadvantage of this system is the need to control wheel speeds in order to limit vibrational effects .
" Unloading " the energy of the wheels is done by transferring momentum to the second set of wheels , discharging energy through the power system , and using the hydrazine thrusters .
The hydrazine tanks are located within the main truss between the flywheels , encircled by the main fuel tanks ( so they may be cooled by the same refrigeration units ) .
The nozzles are located on the circumference of the spacecraft pointed in each axis direction .
The flywheels will be used for attitude control in the solar system phase of the mission , and in the Centauri system .
The hydrazine system is primarily used as a backup .

3.7 Thermal ControlThere are two significant problems to consider in the thermal design :
There is a huge amount of waste heat from the propulsion system and the nuclear reactor ( both fission and fusion reactions )
;
The fuel will be stored in large tanks at near - absolute temperatures , and must be shielded from the waste heat of the nuclear reactions .
The spacecraft will require highly efficient radiators to dissipate the thermal energy released by the interstellar drive , namely the inductors , particle beams , and fusion reaction .
The radiation from this dissipation process will be reflected away from the rest of the spacecraft by a mirror specifically engineered to reflect infra-red energy .
Additionally , conduction will be buffered by special ceramic materials between the power and propulsion units .
The nuclear reactor will dump its waste heat to the same radiators used by the propulsion unit .
Ceramic buffers will also be located between the power unit and the fuel tanks .
The fuel tanks will contain pelletized helium and deuterium which must be shielded from conductive and radiative heat energy .
During th einitial phase of the mission the tanks will be shielded from the sun by a shroud which will be blow off at a sufficient distance from the sun where the solar radiation becomes negligible .
The mirrors and ceramic buffers will keep the spacecraft 's waste heat away from the tanks , while refrigeration units will keep the fuel vapor pressure low enough to remain in pelletized form for the duration of the mission .
The tanks will be painted black to emit as much radiation as possible in deep space .
The probe head will be protected from the radiation from Beta in the Centauri system by a thermal blanket .
Heat from the computer , instruments , and lasers will be convected through heat pipes to the radiators at the rear of the spacecraft .
4.0 SPACECRAFT DESIGNThe general structure of the probe consists of five main components .
The probe head , fuel tanks , central truss , fission power reactor and fusion drive system .
The actual probe will house all of the necessary instruments and data processing equipment .
There will also be a particle shield in front to protect the spacecraft during the interstellar flight phase .
The particles may not be all that large , but the spacecraft will be traveling and velocities near 5 percent of the speed of light ; therefore , they will have a tremendous amount of energy .
The fuel tanks were designed to be cylinders .
This shape was picked for its ease in construction .
The calculations on the sizing of the fuel tanks are in the appendix .
The tanks are connected to a central framework using explosive bolts which will permit their jetisioning when empty .
A detailed structural analysis on the sizing of the tanks may be found in the Appendix .
The central truss will be a collapsable space frame and fulfill several functions .
Its primary role is to connect the probe head with its power source while providing adequate separation for thermal and radiation protection .
Additionally , it will house the attitude determination and control systems and support the fuel tanks during the interstellar transit phase of the mission .
The fission power reactor will be attached to the aft end of the main truss behind a thermal reflector .
This shield will protect the cryogenic fuel from the heat generated by the drive as well as the reactor .
The rear end of the reactor will incorporate a flange for mounting the fusion drive .
This connector will contain pyrotechnic elements to separate the drive system once the spacecraft reaches Alpha Centauri .
The fusion drive system was described in the Propulsion section .
It will serve the additional function of providing attach points for the after particle shield and the chemical upper stages .
The rear shield is needed during the decceleration phase of the flight when the spacecraft is flying backwards .
A weight table is included in the appendix as well as a diagram of the structure .

This fact , along with the difficulties involved in mining the atmosphere of Jupiter , getting the fuel to a million kilometr orbit around the planet , etc. , has made it obvious that obtaining fuel from Jupiter is not feasible .
Acceleration and Velocity Profiles1 .
Accelerations .
The accelerations for the mission were found using the equation F=ma .
Since it is a constant thrust , the acceleration will increase at a constant rate .
The acceleration was found by dividing the thrust by the mass left at the time .
This gives the acceleration chart on page .
2. Velocity .
Since the acceleration changed at such a small rate , it was assumed that an average value for the acceleration could be used for computing the velocity .
The acceleration at the beginning of a phase and at the end of a phase were averaged .
This acceleration was then multiplied by the time interval for which it pertained .
This delta V was then added to the previous velocity .
The turning point for the mission was found with the computer program on the next page .
Different turnig points were tried until one was found that gave a final velocity of about 32.935 km/s.DESII 07 Apr 88 17:23100 REM

OBJECTIVESLASERSSizing of the Fuel Tanks1 .
Tank Volume
The storage density for the fuel is .0708 tons per cubic meter .
Therefore , the total volume needed is : Vol = ( 264.276 mt ) *( 1/.0708 mt/m^3 ) = 3732.71 m^3
The radius of the fuel tanks is set at 2.5 meters and the length is then computed .
length = ( Vol/6 ) / ( pi*r ^2 ) = ( 3732.71 m^3/6 ) / ( pi*( 2.5 ) ^2 ) = 31.68 meters
The total volume is divided by six , because six fuel tanks are used .
2. Tank ThicknessA .
Interstellar cruise phaseNewton 's equation , F=ma , is used to find the forces on the fuel tanks during flight .
The maximum force will occur when the acceleration is a maximum .
This is when the mass is a minimum for a constant thrust problem .
In our case , the minimum mass is : Mmin = 2 fuel tanks + 6 straps + center section + engine + payload= 89.345 metric tonsTherefore , Amax = Thrust / m= 1.838e3 N / 89.345e3 kg= .021 m/s^2
The maximum force possible on the tanks could then be : Fmax = ( mass of fuel in tanks ) * a= 44.05e3 kg * .021 m/s^2= 924.97 NA safety factor of 5 is now applied to find the design load .
Fdes = 5 * F= 4.62 kNNext , the tank area that the force is acting on is found .
Area = pi * r^ 2= pi * 2.5^2= 19.635 m ^2So , the pressure will be : p=F/A= 4.62 kN / 19.635 m^2= 235.54 N/m
^2 The thickness of the tanks is now determined .t = ( P * r ) / ( 2 * yield stress )
If we assume that we will use A1 1100 - 0 , the yield stress is 3.45e7 N/m^2 .
This gives a thickness of :t = ( 235.54 N/m^2*2.5 m ) /( 2*3.45e7 N/m^2 ) = 8.53e - 6 m or .00853 mmTherefore , the fuel tanks can be made from 2 mm A1 1100 - 0 sheets .
B. Orbital ManeuversSince the upper stages will require advanced upper stages , the forces on the spacecraft are not known .
Through the use of staging , multiple burns per maneuver , and the use of a stronger aluminum alloy , the thickness of the fuel tanks can be kept at 2 mm .
Nouriel Roubini says the coming global recession will drive down energy prices 30 % .
That 's good news , in a way .
Lower energy prices will help calm spiraling inflation .
But of course , amid the global recession , it will be hard to see that silver lining .
Before we get to the energy price decline , here 's a reminder of why Nouriel thinks we 're headed for the worst global recession since the Depression :
the collapse of housing bubbles in the US , the United Kingdom , Spain , Ireland and other euro - zone members
punctured credit bubbles
severe credit and liquidity crunch following the US mortgage crisis
negative wealth and investment effects of falling stock and housing markets ( already down by more than 20 % globally )
the global impact of the recession in the US ( which still counts for about 30 % of global GDP ) and the weak dollar
high oil and commodity prices
Nouriel thinks these factors will drive the G7 ( Canada , France , Germany , Italy , Japan , United Kingdom , and United States of America ) into a deep recession .
This global slowdown will reduce demand for energy and commodities , and , as a result , their prices will drop by as much as 30 % .
But before you celebrate declining prices , note the cause and effect here : Global recessions are n't good news .
So what does all this mean for inflation ?
Will our current stagflation continue , taking us right back to the 70s ?
Nouriel 's actually suprisingly optimistic here -- with respect to the US .
He 's still gloomy as hell about the rest of the world :
Falling oil and commodity prices – already down 15 % from their peaks – will somewhat reduce stagflationary forces in the global economy , yet inflation is becoming more entrenched via a vicious circle of rising prices , wages , and costs .
This will constrain the ability of central banks to respond to the downside risks to growth .
In advanced economies , however , inflation will become less of a problem for central banks by the end of this year , as slack in product markets reduces firms ’ pricing power and higher unemployment constrains wage growth .
If inflation drops , more central banks will eventually be able to cut interest rates to spur economic activity .
Unfortunately , especially outside the US , Roubini believes the recession will hit too hard for the central banks to see the correct course of action in time :
... the policy response will be too little , and will come too late , to prevent it .

Apple is trying to make friends and influence people who have been disappointed over the latest issues with the iPhone 3G .
Apple is offering MobileMe users 60 days of service for free .
The company ’s wireless syncing service was supposed to replace its .
Mac service and provide nearly instant data syncing between a user ’s home computer and an iPhone 3G .
But MobileMe has been beset with difficulties since its launch in July .
“ The transition from .
Mac to MobileMe was rockier than we had hoped , ” read a note on Apple ’s support site .
“ While we are making a lot of improvements , the MobileMe service is still not up to our standards .
We are extending subscriptions 60 - days free of charge to express appreciation for our members ’ patience as we continue to improve the service . ”
The free 60 days will be available for MobileMe subscribers with an active account as of Aug. 19 , the company said .
The latest freebie comes in addition to a previous free 30 days of service Apple doled out to subscribers .
This does n’t fix the ongoing issues , and will only act as a gesture of good faith on Apple ’s part .
Will have to see what the Apple camp has next for its loyal users of the iPhone 3G .
Altruism or Exploitation ?

Microloans were invented to help the poorest of the poor help themselves .
Now major banks and pension funds are getting into the business , as they discover that the interest paid by the poor can produce high returns .
Is it aid or exploitation ?

Upon learning that my new book on Alexander Hamilton ( Hamilton ’s Curse : How Jefferson ’s Archenemy Betrayed the American Revolution — And What It Means for Americans Today ) will be published in October , a law student from New York University emailed to say how excited he was to hear of it .
He wrote of how sick and tired he was listening to one of his NYU law professors , Nadine Strossen , constantly invoking Hamilton ’s judicial philosophy ( and that of his political descendants ) to promote bigger and bigger government , day in and day out , in class .
Being schooled in the classical liberal tradition , this student understood that bigger and bigger government always means less and less individual liberty .
Hamilton was indeed the founding father of constitutional subversion through what we now call " judicial activism . "
That ’s why leftist law professors like Strossen lionize him in their classrooms while barely mentioning opposing viewpoints .
Hamilton was the leading advocate of a constitutional convention to " amend " the nation ’s first constitution , the Articles of Confederation .
He lobbied for seven years to have such a convention convened , constantly complaining to George Washington and anyone else who would listen that " we need a government of more energy . "
Patrick Henry opposed Hamilton by sagely pointing out that the Articles of Confederation had created a government powerful enough to raise and equip an army that defeated the British empire , and that that seemed sufficient to him .
At the convention , which scrapped rather than amended the Articles of Confederation , as had been promised , Hamilton laid out his grand plan :
A permanent president who would appoint the governors of each state , and who would , through his state - level puppets , have veto power over all state legislation .
A national government with the president given essentially the powers of a king is what he advocated .
It was all rejected , of course , when the convention spurned Hamilton ’s nationalism and adopted a federal system of government instead , with only a few powers delegated to the central government by the sovereign states , mostly for foreign affairs .
Hamilton subsequently denounced the new constitution as " a frail and worthless fabric . "
He and his political compatriots , such as Senator Rufus King of Massachusetts , and John Marshall of Virginia , then set about to sabotage the new Constitution by " reinterpreting " the document as something very different from what was clearly written in black and white .
His purpose , wrote Cornell University historian Clinton Rossiter in his book , Alexander Hamilton and the Constitution , was to build " the foundations of a new empire . "
Jefferson and most other founders viewed the Constitution as a set of constraints on the powers of government .
Hamilton thought of it in exactly the opposite way — as a grant of powers rather than as a set of limitations — a potential rubber stamp on anything and everything the federal government ever wanted to do .
He and his fellow nationalists ( the Federalists ) set about to use the lawyerly manipulation of words to " amend " the Constitution without utilizing the formal amendment process .
" Having failed to persuade his colleagues at Philadelphia of the beauties of a truly national plan of government , " Rossiter wrote , " and having thereafter recognized the futility of persuading the legislatures of three - fourths of the states to surrender even a jot of their privileges , he set out to remold the Constitution into an instrument of national supremacy . "
And how did he " remold " the Constitution ?
He began by inventing a number of myths ( i.e. , lies ) about the American founding .
On June 29 , 1787 , before the Constitution was even ratified , he said that the sovereign states were merely " artificial beings " that had nothing to do with creating the union — despite the fact that the Constitution itself ( in Article 7 ) declared that the document would be ratified ( if it was to be ratified ) by the citizens of at least nine of the thirteen states .
He told the New York State Assembly in that same year that the " nation , " and not the states , had " full power of sovereignty , " clearly contradicting the written Constitution and actual history .
This lie would be repeated by nationalist politicians from Clay , Webster and Story , to Lincoln .
It is still repeated to this day by various apologists for the American empire .
When President Washington asked Hamilton his opinion on the constitutionality of a national bank , Hamilton responded with a long - winded report that argued that if one reads between the lines of the Constitution , one discovers " implied powers " that are not specifically delegated to the central government by the states .
Like the creation of a central bank , for instance .
Secretary of State Jefferson was also asked his opinion on the matter , and essentially said that all he saw " between the lines " of the Constitution was blank space .
Hamilton prevailed , setting the template for the eventual destruction of the Constitution .
" With the aid of the doctrine of implied powers , " Rossiter wrote approvingly , Hamilton " converted the . . . powers enumerated in Article I , Section 8 into firm foundations for whatever prodigious feats of legislation any future Congress might contemplate . "
He established the foundations for unlimited government , in other words .
Hamilton also invented the " doctrine " of " resulting powers . "
If the united States ever conquered one of their neighboring countries , he wrote , " they would possess sovereign jurisdiction over the conquered territory .
This would be rather the result from the whole mass of government . . . than a consequence of . . . powers specially enumerated . "
Thus , if government engages in an unconstitutional act , such as an undeclared war of conquest , then according to Hamilton , the fact that the conquest occurred would create a new constitutional right .
It was Hamilton who first advocated the broadest possible interpretation of the General Welfare Clause of the Constitution so that he could make his case for corporate welfare in his 1791 Report on Manufactures .
" It is . . . of necessity left to the discretion of the National Legislature , to pronounce upon the objects , which concern the general Welfare , " he wrote .
Naturally , the legislature would be eager to define every piece of special - interest legislation to be serving " the general welfare . "
Again celebrating the political trickery of his hero Hamilton , Rossiter wrote that " Thus with a flourish did Hamilton convert the fuzzy words about the u2018general Welfare ’ from a u2018 sort of caption , ’ as Madison described them , into a grant of almost unlimited authority " of the federal government .
Hamilton was also likely to be the first to twist the meaning of the Commerce Clause of the Constitution , which gave the central government the ability to regulate interstate commerce , supposedly to promote free trade between the states .
Hamilton argued that the Clause was really a license for the government to regulate all commerce , intrastate as well as interstate .
For " What regulation of [ interstate ] commerce does not extend to the internal commerce of every State ? " he asked .
His political compatriots were all too happy to carry this argument forward in order to give themselves the ability to regulate all commerce in America .
Hamilton also invented the notion of special " war powers " that are not specifically delegated to the federal government by the states .
He subsequently argued for a standing army , funding of the army " without limitation , " and the nationalization of all industries that supplied goods to the army .
Jefferson opposed Hamilton on this and all of his other constitutional subversions .
In his first annual message to Congress as president , he said that it is neither " needful or safe that a standing army should be kept in time of peace . "
In a September 9 , 1792 letter to President Washington , Jefferson wrote that he " utterly . . . disapproved of the system of the Secretary of the Treasury [ Hamilton ] . . . .
His system [ of a national bank , protectionist tariffs , and corporate welfare ] flowed from principles averse to liberty , & was calculated to undermine and demolish the republic . . . "
Clinton Rossiter ’s book on Hamilton and the Constitution is a masterwork of scholarship , but when Rossiter editorializes he sounds quite giddy in his celebration of Hamilton ’s subversion of the Constitution .
" Hamilton had no equal among the men who chose to interpret the Constitution as a reservoir of national energy , " he wrote .
All of the nationalist politicians and jurists of early America , from John Jay to Rufus King to Joseph Story and John Marshall , owed Hamilton a debt of thanks for " having taught his friends how to read the Constitution . "
Senator Rufus King of Massachusetts was so impressed by Hamilton ’s conniving slickness , and its potential to cause government to grow vastly larger than what the Constitution called for , that he promised him " assistance to whatever measures and maxims he would pursue . "
Justice Joseph Story became " the most Hamiltonian of judges , " according to Rossiter , faithfully reproducing the lie that the states were never sovereign ; he " construed the powers of Congress liberally " ; and " even found the Alien and Sedition Acts constitutional in retrospect . "
( The Sedition Act outlawed criticism of the federal government , a crystal - clear repudiation of the First Amendment ) .
Story ’s book , Commentaries on the Constitution , published in 1833 , was a roadmap for nationalists who wished to further destroy constitutional limitations on government .
It could just as well have been entitled " Commentaries on Alexander Hamilton ’s Commentaries on the Constitution , " says Rossiter .
The book was essentially a political training manual for " the legal profession ’s elite — or at least among the part of it educated in the North — during the middle years of the nineteenth century . "
The Jeffersonian interpretation of the Constitution , based on actual historical reality as opposed to the lies , myths and superstitions of Hamilton , Marshall and Story , was more popular in the South .
( Perhaps the best exposition of this tradition is St. George Tucker ’s A View of the Constitution of the United States . )
The Jeffersonian interpretation of the Constitution was all but wiped out by Lincoln ’s war , after which Hamiltonian hegemony prevailed for decades .
Slowly but surely , virtually all vestiges of Jefferson ’s strict constructionism were swept away so that by the 1930s the " principles of nationalism and broad construction expounded by Hamilton and his disciples " finally monopolized constitutional law in America , wrote Rossiter .
Between 1937 and 1995 , not a single federal law was ruled unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court .
Hamilton ’s " rubber stamp " constitution was firmly in place .
It is little wonder that a law student like our NYU correspondent , who is familiar with the Jeffersonian and classical liberal traditions , would be disgusted by his pontificating professor ’s expositions of Hamilton ’s subversive constitutional trickery .

A very good summary of how hard - line neo- conservatives see the world â€ ” and especially Israelâ€™s place in it â€ ” can be found in an interview at the National Review Onlineâ€™s ( NROâ€™s ) website by Kathryn Jean Lopez of Caroline Glick , the deputy managing editor of The Jerusalem Post who also serves as the Senior Fellow for Middle Eastern Affairs at Frank Gaffneyâ€™s Center for Security Policy ( CSP ) .
What comes through the interview is how hard - liners like Glick see the relationship between the U.S. and Israel ( â€ the war against Israel and the war against the U.S. are one and the sameâ€ ) ; the Manichean nature of the world ( â€freedomâ€ versus â€ œthe forces of slavery and jihad , â€ â€œgoodâ€ versus â€œevilâ€ ) ; how they conflate different threats ( â€al Qaeda and Iranâ€  as a single â€œenemyâ€  whose â€œultimate aim â€¦is global domination and the destruction of the U.S.â€ ) ; their contempt for Europe ( its â€œrefusal to accept the true lessons of the Holocaustâ€ ) ; their Islamophobia ( â€genocidal anti-Semitism â€ ¦has taken over the Islamic worldâ€ ) ; and their need for an â€œenemyâ€ to give order to their world ( Obama â€œrefuses to acknowledge that there is such a thing as an â€˜enemyâ€™ in international affairs .
And as a consequence , he is unable to understand what an ally is.â€ )
Glick is also furious with Condoleezza Rice and the State Department for their presumed influence over Bush and efforts to force Israel to make concessions to the Palestinians .
The title of the interview is â€ œShackled Warrior : Israel in Bondage.â€ 
Itâ€™s worth repeating : Glick is the senior fellow for Middle Eastern Affairs at CSP , an organization whose board of advisers have included over the years , among many other senior Bush foreign - policy officials , the current deputy national security adviser charged with Middle East policy , Elliott Abrams .
Now I donâ€™t think Abrams is quite as radical as Glick or Gaffney , but the association is not one heâ€™s ever renounced or distance himself from ) .
Douglas Feith , the former undersecretary of defense for policy and protege of Richard Perle ( another member of CSPâ€™s board of advisers ) , has rejoined the board , and John Lehman , an adviser to John McCain , has long served on it .
( Gaffney , Abrams , Feith , Perle and Lehman all worked in the office of former Washington State Sen .
Henry â€ œScoopâ€ Jacksonâ€ at one time or another during the 1970s . )
There is one other document that I have cited before which I think summarizes the hard - line neo-con worldview particularly succinctly .
Itâ€™s by Dennis Prager , a California talk - show host who has stood by John Hagee despite McCainâ€™s repudiation , and it can be found here .

Just thought I 'd weigh in here , even though this post is old .
I somehow found it via Google .
I went to PCC until 1993 and am now a 37yo homeschooling mom myself of four ( ages 5 - 13 ) .
I still live in the vicinity of the college , so although we do n't visit it much , we do have a little contact , and I can say with certainty that it has not changed in these 15 years !
What was posted about PCC is true .
All of it .
However , what is absolutely different between she and I , I think , is the attitude .
PCC is strict , is unbending , is rather military - like in many ways , yet you can go there and enjoy the other 3,000 + kids who are in the same boat as you , you can find ways to look cute even in those conservative clothes , and , why yes , you can enjoy the beach ( it is quite accessible and popular enough that finding 5 girls - a rule they create for safety , and as a mama , I 'm not sorry for that - is not difficult ) .
My husband and I ( whom I met there ) came out of it 100 % scar - free .
We did n't take the doctrine classes as what we must believe ourselves ; rather , we took that as yet another person 's opinion .
So ?
It 's good to get other opinions to mull over .
It made for great discussions , past and present .
Yes , there were many annoyances ( the tattle - tales are one ) , but there were also some great things ( the non - tattle - tales who became such great friends that we 're driving from FL to Chicago next week to see 4 of them ) .
You just take things with a grain of salt and keep your own opinions .
Would we let our 4 children go there ?
If they want to !
We are raising them to know their own minds ( and make their own decisions ) .
PCC was unable to change my mind or my husband 's or our friends , and we intend to raise these kids well enough that they will know right from wrong for themselves .
It is a VERY safe place , especially for girls .
Yes , I was put in the most horrid job on campus - the kitchen - and it is true , there was no interview to place me there .
Because of this , and because the low wages is true , and because working so much made studying very difficult for me , I would NOT have our girls work there ( unless they could get a library job , lucky gal ! ) .
So , in summary , it is strict , yes , but if you think of it as " military - strict " and just accept those rules and go along with it ; if you listen to the teachers / preachers / evangelists ( my , there are many ! ) but mull it over in your heart and alone with God until you realize your own views , you 'll come out of it unscathed .
p.s. It is absolutely true that the PCC degree causes problems going further .
Not in every case , but many .
My husband was turned down from the Air Force officers training school ( degree not accepted ) and my brother , who has a masters from PCC , cannot get a regular teaching job at a public school .
We 're going to let our children decide where they go to college , if they even do go , but we 'll make sure they know about this problem in some majors , if they go to PCC .
Oh , by the way , the nursing program IS accredited , and very accepted in hospitals and in further education .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - California ’s attorney general is reviewing a request by former employees of IndyMac Bancorp Inc to investigate whether a New York senator triggered the bank ’s collapse by releasing confidential information .
An IndyMac Bank branch is seen in Glendale , California July 17 , 2008 .

At issue is a much - publicized letter that Chuck Schumer , a Democrat , sent in June to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp ( FDIC ) and Office of Thrift Supervision ( OTS ) questioning the company ’s ability to survive .
The FDIC took control of IndyMac on July 11 after depositors withdrew more than $ 1.3 billion over 11 days .
It was the third - largest bank failure in U.S. history .
At the time , OTS Director John Reich blamed Schumer ’s letter for causing the run on the bank .
In a letter to Attorney General Jerry Brown last week , 51 former IndyMac workers wrote : “ From the day ( Schumer ’s ) letter was made public on June 26 until the closure of the bank , a run on the bank took place and the failure became inevitable . ”
Brown ’s spokeswoman Christine Gasparac said on Wednesday that his office was reviewing the letter and that a decision on whether to act on it could be made as early as next week .
IndyMac is based in Pasadena , California .
After IndyMac ’s collapse , Schumer accused the OTS of allowing IndyMac ’s lending practices to slip .
IndyMac specialized in a type of mortgage that often required minimal documents from borrowers .
Copies of the employee letter were distributed to the press by CRC Public Relations whose clients include the National Republican Congressional Committee , National Republican Senatorial Committee and the Republican National Committee .
CRC , based in Alexandria , Virginia , was also linked to a company that published a book questioning 2004 Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry ’s Vietnam service on a swift boat .
Schumer spokesman Brian Fallon questioned the motivation behind the letter .
“ It certainly raises eyebrows that the firm promoting this letter is the same outfit that fueled the Swift Boat attacks and does work for the RNC , ” Fallon said .
Schumer chairs the Joint Economic Committee , which has members from the Senate and House of Representatives .
Schumer and other senior Democrats , such as Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd , have been highly critical of Republicans and the Bush White House for not doing enough to help distressed homeowners .
When Congress returns next month , the banking committee is expected to hold a hearing to examine IndyMac ’s failure .

But on Monday , China ’s official English - language newspaper , China Daily , ran a front - page story under a boldfaced headline : “ Emergency green plan for Games . ”
The article warned that officials might force far more vehicles off city streets  possibly 90 percent of the city ’s total  and temporarily close more factories .

No timetable was announced , but a senior city engineer told China Daily that officials would inform the public as early as possible about the details of the plan .
The Olympics ’ opening ceremony is on Friday of next week , Aug. 8 .
Pollution has been a pressing concern for the Games .
Local organizers have promised to hold a Green Olympics , despite air that often ranks among the most polluted in the world .
Some Olympic teams , including that of the United States , are providing optional breathing masks for their athletes to protect them from respiratory problems .
Before Monday , Beijing officials had taken a determinedly upbeat approach to the pollution situation .
At various news conferences , Beijing officials said pollution levels in July had fallen 20 percent compared with the same period a year ago .
They blamed the problems on recent weeks of unusually heavy rains that left behind a humid summer haze .
Even though emissions have fallen , pollution was still being trapped in the haze because of a lack of dispersing winds , they said .
“ We are very confident about the effectiveness , ” Du Shaozhong , a deputy director of Beijing ’s environmental bureau , said of the traffic and industrial restrictions during a news conference on Sunday at the new Olympic media center .
“ We are going to ensure a good air quality during the Games . ”

Making carbon fullerenes with 100 percent efficiency
August 15th , 2008
Abstract :
Carbon fullerenes — specifically C60 , the spherical " bucky ball " — have received their fair share of attention , even in the shadow of the more buzz - worthy developments with carbon nanotubes and graphene .
The bucky ball 's spherical shape could allow it to contain molecules , while other chemical groups to can be attached to the surface , making biomedical applications a natural fit .
Just like carbon nanotubes and graphene , however , bucky balls have proven difficult to synthesize reliably .
Researchers have now discovered a method that produces the bucky ball configuration of carbon with nearly 100 % conversion efficiency from precursor materials .
Current techniques for producing bucky balls are crude : graphite is vaporized and deposited , which may yield only fractions of a percentage of bucky ball fullerene .
The vast majority of the carbon ends up in the nanotechnology carnival side - show as a spectacle of misshapen fullerenes , each presumably with unique and mysterious talents but present in scales not suited to reputable science .
Not content with this injustice , scientists investigated catalyzing a decomposition reaction with the ever-useful ( and insanely expensive ) platinum .

The government can either sell the cars it buys to licensed recyclers for scrap , or refit them with new emissions controls and resell them .
But the government must not ship the cars to poor countries , where they would continue to belch pollutants .
Cash for Clunkers is not the pipe dream of some academic scribblers .
Local variants are either now in operation or have been tested in California , Colorado , Delaware , Illinois , Texas , Virginia and several Canadian provinces .
So there is no need for a “ proof of concept . ”
Rather , a national Cash for Clunkers program could learn from all this experience in building a better system .
THE big need to date has been money , which is why the scope of Cash for Clunkers programs has been limited .
And that , of course , is where the need for stimulus comes in .
We now want intelligent ways for the federal government to spend money .
Here ’s a high - end cost calculation for a national program .
Suppose we took two million cars off the road a year , at an average purchase price of $ 3,500 ( the top price in the Texas program today ) .
Including all the administrative costs of running the program , that would probably cost about $ 8 billion .
Compared with other nationwide income - transfer or environmental policies , that ’s a pretty small bill .
For stimulus purposes , it would , of course , be better to run the program on a larger scale , if possible .
There are over 250 million cars and light trucks on American roads , and some 30 percent are 15 years old or older .
That ’s at least 75 million clunkers .
At five million cars a year  an ambitious target , to be sure  the program would cost less than $ 20 billion , still cheap compared with the $ 168 billion stimulus enacted in February .
And what would all this money buy ?
First , less pollution .
The Texas program estimated that clunkers spew 10 to 30 times as much pollution as newer cars .
Second , the subsidy value ( the 20 percent premium in my example ) is a direct income transfer to the owners of clunkers , who are mostly low - income people .
Third , these folks would almost certainly spend the cash they receive  not just the subsidy , but the entire payment , giving the economy a much - needed boost .
Oh , and I left out a fourth possible goal .
By pulling millions of old cars off the road , Cash for Clunkers would stimulate the demand for new cars as people trade up .
It need hardly be pointed out that our ailing auto industry , like our ailing economy , could use a shot in the arm right now .
Scrapping two million or more clunkers a year should help .
With today ’s concerns over stimulus , inequality and greenhouse gases , as well as an aging vehicle fleet , Cash for Clunkers is an idea whose time may finally have come .
Write your congressman .
What a waste .
A report that could be the most significant piece of government work on the food system since the second world war has been thrown away with a bucket of Downing Street spin .
Whoever thought it a good idea to have Gordon Brown tell us to address the global food crisis by eating up our leftovers while he and other G8 leaders banqueted in Japan should surely have seen the lampooning coming .
The real waste is that an excellent analysis , commissioned by the prime minister , of today 's food economy and its structural failures has been buried in the slops .
Food Matters , the report from the No 10 Strategy Unit , represents a radical shift in government thinking .
There is a fault line running through it , but it is the first recognition since the 1947 Agriculture
Act that not only is a supply of good , affordable food vital to political stability in rich and poor countries , but also it can not be taken for granted .
The report formally admits to the enormous environmental damage and public - health harms associated with our current food system : nearly one fifth of the UK 's greenhouse gas emissions are caused by the way we produce and eat , making food 's contribution to climate change greater than that of our whole transport sector ; and the costs to the NHS of treating diet - related diseases that are largely preventable is £ 6bn a year and growing .
It also acknowledges the glaring social inequalities in the system .
The poor , who spend a greater proportion of their income on food , not only struggle more as prices rise but are worse hit by the health effects of bad food .
The report says that unless we reduce the dependence of agribusiness on crude oil and water - resources that are going to become ever more scarce - we will be exposed to future price shocks .
And , yes , it points to the obscene waste .
Brown spoke of the 4.1 m tonnes of edible food that consumers throw away each year .
However , the report also highlights the waste from commercial and industry sources , which account for more than half of what is thrown away .
This report is not just more of the usual digestible pap that ends up in the Whitehall policy bin once past its ideological sell - by date .
It envisages the creation of a food strategy taskforce chaired at the most senior level by a permanent secretary in the cabinet office , and made up of permanent secretaries from each of the key departments , all reporting to the prime minister - since a shift to a more economically , environmentally , and socially sustainable food system " will not happen of its own accord " .
The government has committed to taking the lead in providing a new kind of system fit for a low - carbon economy .
More than a billion meals are served by the public sector in England and Wales every year .
Nearly 6 million employees , 9 million schoolchildren and half a million people in care homes , hospitals and prisons are fed by state procurement daily .
The government estimates that its own workforce includes more than 3 million people who are obese or overweight .
It has the buying power to insist on a different food chain , which could bring about a huge cultural shift .
Yet there is an underlying tension throughout this report that may explain why the Downing Street soundbites threw the food crisis back to individuals and their waste .
It recognises that the agribusiness model of food production based on global competition has failed to deliver , but the government remains wedded to the idea that food markets , like all other markets , are best left to regulate themselves .
It wants the food chain reshaped but does not want to edit our choices .
It wants to run with the free market , yet trade in food has never been truly free .
Concentrations of corporate power in the global food system distort competition .
The government has no plan to address them .
The US and EU have retained trade barriers and agricultural protections as they urge poorer countries to liberalise food markets .
Britain can't wean the US off its farm bills , nor a biofuels policy that diverts a third of the corn crop to petrol tanks at the expense of global food prices .
Nor can it persuade the French to reform the common agricultural policy faster .
Moreover , the market has no effective mechanisms for putting a price on the things that matter most : the nutritional , environmental and social costs of production .
Brown says it is neither practical nor financially rational for the UK to pursue national food security in isolation from the global market .
The report concludes that there is no justification for increasing food production capacity unless we can be globally competitive .
Others are playing a different game .
While the US takes back its food surplus for ethanol , Arab states are buying up agricultural land in Africa to secure their own food needs .
They are looking beyond the market .
In a world of accelerating climate change , growing population and potential for conflict over diminishing resources , what counts as rational market economics one year may look like geopolitical myopia the next .

Despite denials , military still studying clandestine use of blogs Muriel Kane
Published : Friday April 4 , 2008

Print This Email This
It was revealed this week by Wired that a study written for the U.S. Special Operations Command in 2006 recommended " clandestinely recruiting or hiring prominent bloggers " in order to promote messages favorable to the military .
It also raised the possibility of altering an " enemy blog " by hacking to destroy its credibility or use it to spread false information .
The military has downplayed this study as an " academic exercise , " but its conclusions appear to match closely with a strong and growing focus by the Pentagon on what it calls " information warfare . "
Underlining this interest , this past January former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld resurfaced for the first time in over a year to address a conference on " Network Centric Warfare . "
He complained that Islamic radicals are winning the propaganda battle against the United States and proposed a " 21st - century agency for global communications " that would tell the American side of the story , using resources ranging " from blogs to online social - networking sites to talk radio . "
During the question session afterward , Rumsfeld suggested again that " a new agency has to be something that would take advantage of the wonderful opportunities that exist today .
There are multiple channels for information . . .
The Internet is there , blogs are there , talk radio is there , e-mails are there .
There are all kinds of opportunities . "
Until recently , the popular concept of information warfare primarily involved hacking or denial of service attacks deployed against blogs and websites in order to convey a political statement .
For example , at the time of the invasion of Iraq in 2003 , there were reports of widespread hacking of both military and commercial websites .
According to ZDNet , " most notably , the US Navy Web site was hacked by an activist called Apocalypse .
The message posted on the site read : ' No War , U.S. A think they can tell the world what to do . ' "
A few months later , several NASA sites were similarly hacked by Brazilian anti-war protesters .
In 2006 , a number of conservative blogs were disrupted by a denial of service attack against their hosting provider , said to have originated in Saudi Arabia and to have been triggered when one of the blogs posted a set of cartoons ridiculing the Prophet Mohammed .
However , by that time the understanding of possible forms of information warfare had already begun to grow more varied .
For example , it was reported that the Air Force was funding research into how it might carry out data - minining on blogs as " a kind of information radar to better understand the information battlespace . "
Also in 2006 , the Army hired a PR firm to offer " exclusive editorial content " to military blogs that were prepared to promote the " good news " from Iraq .
And in December of that year , one conservative blogger at Pajamas Media even suggested that " it was Israel 's 2006 war with Hezbollah that fully demonstrated how far the the virtual ' power of the airwaves ' could neutralize physical ' airpower ' ...
Hezbollah 's skillful use of the media during that war , especially in playing up and inflating casualties from an Israeli airstrike at Qana in Southern Lebanon , succeed in generating enough diplomatic pressure to ground the Israeli Airforce -- the strongest airforce in the Middle East -- while permitting Hezbollah to rain rockets down upon Israel .
It was a tremendous achievement . "
The recently revealed study would seem to be a result of that same 2006 enthusiasm , produced at a time when blogs were the hot new Internet form of the day and bloggers were perceived as potentially powerful and influential .
But while there is scant evidence that the study 's proposals have actually been put into effect , there are recurring hints that , at the very least , they remain on the table .
Last July , Noah Shachtman -- the author of the current Wired article describing the 2006 study -- noted that the Army was working on a new " information operations " field manual that would recognize " information as an element of power [ which ] ... has the potential to do to highly developed modern democracies what conventional and nuclear weapons could not : compel them to quit . "
This past November , Shachtman pointed out an active military effort to make use of blogs .
In a piece titled " U.S. Enlists Arab Bloggers for Info War , " Shachtman wrote , " It 's no secret that , for a long time , the jihadists were kicking American ass in the information war -- especially online .
Slowly , slowly , the U.S. government is starting to push back , just a little .
The new arsenal of the propaganda campaign : Arab - language bloggers , podcasts , ' webchats ' -- and maybe even Second Life and cell phone games , too . "
The pilot project described in that article consisted of just a handful of Arabic , Urdu , and Farsi speakers , deployed to post pro-U.S. comments on prominent mainstream blogs in those languages .
No original blogs were either initiated or co-opted by the " Digital Outreach Team . "
However , at least if Donald Rumsfeld 's advice is heeded , future projects are likely to be more ambitious .
AM - Friday , 4 July , 2008 08:22:00 Reporter : Michael Edwards TONY EASTLEY : Gay groups say police have begun questioning them about their planned activities during World Youth Day .
New regulations give police extra powers during the event in Sydney .
Civil libertarians say the new rules are over - the - top and inflammatory and gay groups planning events to coincide with World Youth Day say they ’re already being unnecessarily scrutinised by police .
Michael Edwards has this story .
MICHAEL EDWARDS : Luke Roberts is a lapsed Catholic as well as a homosexual activist and performer who goes by the stage name , Pope Alice .
Pope Alice is best described as a celestial being whose greatest claim is that she is the " Queen of Heaven " and along with Pope Benedict , Pope Alice will also be in Sydney during World Youth Day .
LUKE ROBERTS : I want to see Pope Alice express herself as a focal point for anybody , gays , lesbians , transgender , intergender , queers , bisexuals , anybody , heterosexuals - anyone who have an open mind and want to say we have had enough of these medieval religions that keep the world backward .
MICHAEL EDWARDS : Pope Alice will host a so - called “ kiss - in ” to be held along Oxford Street in Darlinghurst .
LUKE ROBERTS : You ’re having your thing .
We ’re having ours .
MICHAEL EDWARDS : Luke Roberts has made no secret of the proposed “ kiss in ” and yesterday it appeared the New South Wales Police also got wind of it .
He received a call in Brisbane from a policeman who identified himself as being from the World Youth Day Investigation Squad .
He was then asked him a series of questions .
LUKE ROBERTS :
He wanted to know how long I ’d be there , how many people would actually be with me , would there be music , what was the nature of the event .
MICHAEL EDWARDS : Mr Roberts says that despite the fact the policeman was respectful and polite , he still felt intimidated .
LUKE ROBERTS :
You do feel that you ’re not sure then , you know , whether your phones are going to be tapped , you know what I mean .
You feel , of course , a little vulnerable .
MICHAEL EDWARDS :
This week it was revealed New South Wales Police have been given the power to arrest anyone who in their view causes annoyance or inconvenience to pilgrims during World Youth Day .
Offenders risk fines of up to $ 5,500 .
Protest groups worry about the definition of “ annoying ” .
They fear it could lead to the confiscation of items such as placards and t- shirts bearing anti-World Youth Day slogans .
Paul Harris is the co-convenor of Acceptance , a group for gay and lesbian Catholics which is planning to run a forum on homosexuality to coincide with the event .
He also received a call from the New South Wales Police .
PAUL HARRIS : Initially , I thought it was the World Youth Day people .
I thought it was , you know , some kind of World Youth Day CSI .
Some secret police of the Catholic Church were trying to investigate what this gay group is on about .
I did n't know who it was really .
TONY EASTLEY : Paul Harris , the co-convenor of the gay Catholic group , Acceptance , ending Michael Edwards ' report .
A spokesman for New South Wales Police has told AM , the World Youth Day Investigation Squad is not about curtailing the rights of protesters - instead , its role is to ensure everyone ’s safety .
How Much Do Immediate Load Implants Cost in Costa Rica ?
There is a huge difference in the prices between Costa Rica and the US or Canada .
An immediate load implant costs approximately $ 750 – $ 1,000 in Costa Rica .
This is at least 4 times less , compared to a range of $ 3,000 – $ 6,000 in the US .
Note : Price comparison of ISI One Piece Immediate Load Implant
By getting immediate load dental implants at Costa Rica , you save more than $ 2,000 per implant .
That is more than 70 % off the price for the same treatment in the US or Canada .
The Captain of the Sea Shepherd anti-whaling ship , the Steve Irwin , claims he has been shot by Japanese whalers during a confrontation in the Southern Ocean .
Paul Watson says members of his crew threw stink bombs aboard the whaling ship , the Nisshin Maru , and the Japanese responded by returning flash grenades .
He says one of his crew was hit by a grenade and received minor injuries .
Mr Watson says he then felt a thud in his chest and found a bullet lodged in his bullet - proof vest .
" ... but it also came through and I have this badge and it hit the badge and bent that too so it just left a bruise really on my chest - so it could have - if I was n't wearing the vest it could have been pretty serious , " Mr Watson said .
He says even before shots were fired , the Japanese whalers were acting recklessly in their confrontation .
" We were doing what we usually do , which is putting stink bombs on deck , " he said .
" We go out of our way to make sure we do n't throw them near anybody , but they were throwing the flash grenades directly at us . "
Mr Watson says there is no justification for the whalers opening fire .
" These people are criminals , they 're down here killing whales illegally in a place they 're not supposed to be . "
" Why are there armed coast guard people attacking Australian citizens and other citizens in Australian Antarctic territory ? "
Japan 's Coast Guard Agency has told the ABC in Tokyo that it received a report earlier today from its officers on board the whaling fleet that the Sea Shepherd had been obstructing one of the Japanese ships .
The Coast Guard says it will release a statement shortly detailing the current situation .
The Federal Government says it has received assurances that crew members on the Japanese whaling ship fired warning balls at the protesters , not gunshots .
Foreign Affairs Minister Stephen Smith says Japanese officials have told the Australian embassy in Tokyo that warning balls or flashbangs were fired at the ship .
The devices are designed to make a loud noise but not to injure
Japan has also advised the Australian Embassy that a crew member on board the Japanese whaling boat fired a warning shot in the air .
Mr Smith has repeated his call for all parties in the Southern Ocean to exercise restraint .
He says he absolutely condemns actions by crew members of any boat that could injure anyone on the high seas .
Today at the OSCON open source software convention , the Apache Software Foundation ( ASF ) got an unexpected new sponsor : Microsoft .
The Redmond software giant , which will contribute $ 100,000 annually to the ASF , joins Google and Yahoo as a platinum sponsor of Apache development .
The ASF is a nonprofit group that exerts loose organizational guidance role over a sprawling ecosystem of autonomously managed software projects , including the Apache web server and a host of libraries , frameworks , toolkits , and programs .
The culture of the ASF is built upon what they call the " Apache Way , " a philosophy of consensus - based collaborative stewardship and volunteerism .
I spoke with Apache Software Foundation ( ASF ) president Justin Erenkrantz , who views Microsoft 's sponsorship of Apache as a step forward for interoperability .
He believes that this move is based on a legitimate desire by Microsoft to foster collaborative development of Apache technologies that implement Microsoft standards .
In particular , he points out an ASF project called Apache POI which offers native Java libraries for reading and writing Microsoft Office file formats .
I asked him if this could possibly be the beginning of a broader initiative by Microsoft to increase Apache compatibility with .NET web development technologies , but he says it 's still too early to guess Microsoft 's future plans for Apache participation .
He says that the Apache community , like the license it uses , tends to be pragmatic and naturally receptive to corporate involvement .
He does n't anticipate a confrontational response from the developers working on individual Apache projects because they are already accustomed to positive collaboration with the numerous companies that participate in Apache development .
The response of the broader open source software community , however , is harder to predict .
Microsoft 's interest in funding Apache projects is likely driven by consumer demand for interoperability .
A growing number of companies are deploying Apache - based technologies on top of Windows servers .
Microsoft 's understanding of enterprise open source adoption is evolving and the company has slowly been taking steps to foster its own community of Windows - based open source software developers .
Erenkrantz told me that Microsoft has been moving in this direction for quite some time .
The company recently invited several Apache contributors to visit its Redmond headquarters for informal interoperability talks .
Microsoft 's recognition of the role that open source software will play in enterprise infrastructure comes directly from the top , he says , and is n't just confined to rogue elements within the company .
Microsoft 's history of antagonism to and mixed messages on open source software will likely lead some critics to see the move as a potential trap .
Prudence and scrutiny are certainly justifiable wherever Microsoft is involved , but it seems unlikely that there is any possible mischief in this arrangement ; the governance model of the ASF just does n't leave room for abuse .
It is n't clear yet what level of involvement Microsoft will choose to have , but any level of involvement represents strong validation of the Apache ecosystem and the open source software model .
This will hopefully be the start of a mutually beneficial arrangement for Microsoft and the Apache community .
Update : Microsoft's Sam Ramji comments on the new partnership with the ASF and some other open source announcements in a blog entry
In a few years , your weekend hacking project will involve bits of DNA and a PCR machine instead of a soldering iron or glue .
With the help of the Open Wetware Project , and the Registry of Standard Biological Parts Wiki , you too can become an amateur synthetic biologist .
But this is n't about evil mad scientist stuff .
People using these new open - source biohacking tools are trying create helpful life forms , like insulin - producing bacteria or drought - tolerant crops .
Here 's a quick introduction to the biohacking tools everybody will be using tomorrow .

Registry of Standard Biological Parts [ a wiki ] .
Start with the tutorial , just to get a flavor of what it means to take standard biological parts from a registry and put them together into a new organism .
It 's actually a lot simpler than you might think .
This parts registry is a tool repository , but also a repository of information about biological parts that people have standarized , codified , and registered .
A " part " is n't something like an arm — it 's going to be something small , like an enzyme that affects a gene , or a protein that causes a particular biological state .
Or perhaps a gene that will make you grow an arm .
Open Wetware Project [ a community ] .
This is a clearinghouse community site for academics , students , and the public to share information about synthetic biology and biological engineering projects .
You 'll find classes , tutorials , and massive lists of laboratories working on biohacking .
It 's a great place to poke around and find out what people are really doing to create new life forms — and what their motivations are .
Also , if you 've got your own project or want to know more about an ongoing project , this the place to go to share ideas .

Programming DNA [ a lecture ]
As we 've mentioned before , MIT professor Drew Endy gave a smashing and fun introductory lecture about biohacking a couple of months ago at the Chaos Computer Congress in Berlin .
If you want a crash course in how hacking a biological system can be like hacking a machine , load this one into your portable media device of choice and watch it during your commute ( but only if you 're not driving ) .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
BioBricks Foundation [ a standards body ] .
This is a non-profit formed by people from Harvard , MIT and UCSF in order to create standards for what counts as a " biological part . "
They 're tackling legal and ethical issues , as well as strongly supporting the idea of making all information about biological parts and synthetic biology available for free to the public .
Open Biohacking Kit [ via Sourceforge ] .
Get started on your biohacking project with this free software package .
From the Sourceforge description :
This open , free synthetic biology kit contains all sorts of information from across the web on how to do it : how to extract and amplify DNA , cloning techniques , making DNA by what 's known as oligonucleotides , and all sorts of other tutorials and documents on techniques in genetic engineering , tissue engineering , synbio ( synthetic biology ) , stem cell research , SCNT , evolutionary engineering , bioinformatics , etc .

Once again , the Republicans have managed to take a nonsense issue and make rain .
Nancy Pelosi wants to save the planet , and she knows offshore drilling is a “ hoax , ” but the House speaker is under fire and she ’s starting to budge .
The Hill :
Republicans , reacting to high gas prices , have demanded a vote on additional oil exploration in the Outer Continental Shelf , where drilling is currently blocked by a moratorium .
Until now , Pelosi ( D - Calif. ) has resisted the idea as a “ hoax . ”
But in an interview on CNN ’s Larry King Live , she indicated that she was open to a vote .
“ They have this thing that says drill offshore in the protected areas , ” Pelosi said .
“ We can do that .
We can have a vote on that . ”
She indicated such a vote would have to be part of a larger package that included other policies , like releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve , which she said could bring down prices in a matter of days .

In 2004 , Yahoo turned over user information to the Chinese government that was used to track down a dissident journalist , Shi Tao , and send him to a labour camp .
It was the moment that the Internet knew sin .
Now , Judge Louis Stanton has decided to force Google / YouTube to disclose a complete set of data on all YouTube users .
As TechCrunch reports : “ That data includes every YouTube username , the associated IP address and the videos that user has watched on YouTube .
Google will also be required to hand over copies of every video removed from Youtube for any reason ( DMCA notices or user - initiated deletions ) .
Stanton dismissed Googleâ€™s argument that the order will violate user privacy , saying such privacy concerns are merely â€œspeculative.â€  ”
TechCrunch goes on to express concern that this throws open the opportunity for copyright holders to sue individuals for watching their materials on YouTube .
That , if you ’ll pardon my language , is the fucking least of anyone ’s concerns .
Over the past few years democrats and other “ subversives ” in places like Iran , Morocco , Egypt , Zimbabwe , China and other hell - holes of civil liberties have used their camera - phones to send broadcasts directly from the front - line of vicious conflicts .
Like this one :
The video may not appear subversive , but it clearly shows empty polling stations , empty streets and V signs all over spray - painted by protestors against Robert Mugabe ’s tyranny in Zimbabwe .
Mugabe was inaugurated on Sunday after claiming 85 % of a massive turnout voted for him .
Now imagine that Zimbabwe ’s secret police get their hands on the person who posted this video … he , or she , will get more than just a lawyer ’s letter .
They ’ll get killed .
Internet companies are more than just custodians of US civil liberties .
They are now also custodians of people ’s freedom all over the world .
And especially in places where it is most at risk .

Geez , is this WorldNetDaily or MoveOn.org ?
by Jeremy Hooper
You have to wonder who , exactly the conservative WorldNetDaily news site is targeting with their latest bumper sticker .
Because mixed in with the anti-Obama , " pro-life , " pro-offshore drilling , pro-homeschooling bumper stickers that the site has been selling for the past few months , they are now also selling this anti-McCain one :
An electe - reluctant sticker that 's not even made up of a benign , " well he 's not our perfect choice but we 'll still vote for him " type of slogan that one might assume would be touted by one of this nation 's most conservative news outlets .
Instead , this is an all out attack on the presumptive GOP nominee 's abilities , which implies that the Republican candidate wo n't be getting their endorsement this election year .
A standpoint that 's complimented by this campaign button , also now being sold by WND :
Now do n't get us wrong -- we 're totally okay with the idea of a conservative non-vote , if that 's the one WorldNet wishs to sell to their readers .
We just find it surprising that they , forceful names in these so - called " culture wars , " are pushing these lines so forcefully .
Their refusal to fall in line actually makes us respect them an eensy bit more .

The " McCain not ABLE " is probably just some left over inventory from when they thought Romney or Huckabee had a snowball 's chance in hell of gaining the nomination .
This all has to be very disheartening to them .
All of their " fasting " and " prayer " has really been met with what can be described as a " holy smackdown . "

[ UPDATE , May 15 – My original May 14 article reported that Mike Huckabee had in fact resumed actively campaigning for President .
The total lack of corroboration from any other media , or even Pastor Huckabee 's web page — and comments like some of those below — now lead me to believe that Mr. Horowitz made the original story up .
I have changed the article in light of this , to remove any false claims of fact . ]
May 14 — A few hours ago , the Wenatchee World Online posted an interesting scoop by syndicated columnist Rick Horowitz :
WASHINGTON ( Any Moment Now ) … former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee announced here today that he is re-entering the race for the White House .
Speaking at the National Press Club this afternoon , Huckabee … declared that the outcome of the Republican nomination battle remained very much in doubt … .
Huckabee , 52 , pointed to upcoming Republican primaries in Idaho ( May 27 ) and New Mexico ( June 3 ) as particular breakthrough opportunities , and vowed to remain in the contest until a nominee is officially selected .
When that time comes , he made clear , he expects to be that nominee .
“ Idaho is going to be the turning point .
The whole world will be watching Idaho . ” …
Spokesmen for McCain declined to comment on the record about this new pothole in what had seemed a smooth path to the nomination .
Sources close the campaign [ sic ] , however , were said to be flabbergasted by Huckabee 's sudden re-emergence as McCain was already well along in his pivot toward the general election … .
Said one GOP strategist , “ I 've never seen anything like it . ”
Huckabee suspended his campaign two months ago , on Mar. 4 . On Mar. 10 , he endorsed McCain and pledged “ to do anything I can to be of assistance . ”
On Apr. 25 , McCain and Huckabee campaigned together for the first time .
Last week , Huckabee began releasing his delegates .
On May 12 , U.S. News & World Report announced that “ Mike Huckabee , the former governor of Arkansas and defeated contender for the GOP presidential nomination , is currently at the top of John McCain 's short list for a running mate .
At least that 's the word from a top McCain fundraiser and longtime Republican moneyman who has spoken to McCain 's inner circle . ”
Just earlier today , blog Third Party Watch reported Huckabee telling SIRIUS - TV talk - show host Andrew Wilkow : “ My goal is to help John McCain get elected . ”
And now Pastor Huckabee is running for President again ?
What is going on ?
There are two obvious things that would prompt a Huckabee re-entry : ( 1 ) The sudden media boom for Ron Paul , and ( 2 ) the results of yesterday 's primaries .
(1) The ' anti-McCain narrative ' that I wrote about on Sunday continues to break open in the media .
Here is a typical example , from an ABC News story from today :
Sen .
John McCain , taking a victory lap as the presumptive Republican nominee , happily poked fun at his only remaining opponent .
Asked during an appearance on “ The Daily Show ” last week which of the two Democratic nominees he preferred to run against in the general election , McCain quipped , “ Ron Paul . ”
But Paul might get the last laugh during McCain 's coronation at the party 's convention in early September … .
In recent primaries , as many as 25 percent of Republican voters chose a different candidate , with many pulling levers for Paul and former GOP candidate Mike Huckabee , who snagged 27 percent of the vote in the Pennsylvania primary … .
Paul 's grass - roots movement of enthusiastic supporters is reportedly planning a minirebellion at the convention to push its anti-war , anti-tax agenda .
In state conventions in Maine and Nevada , Paul 's forces battled McCain 's delegates to the brink .
While they wo n't have the muscle to challenged McCain in the national convention , they can be an annoying sideshow when the spotlight is supposed to be solely on the candidate .
Huckabee has endorsed McCain , but some of his evangelical supporters remain skeptical about McCain 's claim to be a social conservative … .
And former GOP Rep . Bob Barr , who won acclaim in conservative circles for leading the drive to impeach President Clinton , just announced his run for the presidency on the Libertarian Party ticket .
The party commands few votes , but Barr has the potential to draw away Republican voters and be a spoiler in battleground states as Ralph Nader was accused of doing to Democrats in the 2000 election .
Suddenly , Ron Paul is major news .
Even NPR hopped on the bandwagon today , airing this story about his current # 1 bestseller , The Revolution : A Manifesto .
(2) Two Republican primaries were held yesterday , in West Virginia and Nebraska .
In the first , four of the Fox News Five — McCain , Huckabee , Romney , and Giuliani — were on the ballot , along with Paul of course .
The results : McCain 76 % , Huckabee 10 % , Paul 5 % , Romney 4 % , Giuliani 2 % .
Meanwhile , in the second — the first ballot that listed only Paul and McCain — McCain received 87 % , and Paul 13 % .
The Nebraska result is , on the surface , good news for McCain — the first time he has broken 80 % in a primary , ever — and that is how the Boston Globe spun the story .
But it is also fairly good news for Paul .
This is his second - highest vote , in fact only the second time he has broken double digits , in a primary .
Not the best result , but certainly a reason to press on .
Which gives reason for the McCain camp .
If Paul continues to get double - digits , stories like the ABC one will continue to circulate until the convention .
These stories can only increase doubts and uncertainties about McCain 's campaign — and if the result is an even higher percentage for Paul , they will only increase .
While the Paul boom comes too late to stop McCain from winning the primaries , it may , if it continues , be enough to spark the delegate revolt that ABC hints at above .
If Operation RonDemption works , and Paul beats McCain in Idaho , such a revolt would become likely .
( “ The whole world will be watching Idaho . ” )
In that context , it becomes reasonable for McCain to ask Huckabee to resume his suspended campaign , and for Huckabee to agree to be a good soldier and do his duty .
His duty , as I see it , would be ( 1 ' ) to take the media attention off of Paul , and even more importantly ( 2 ' ) as in WV , to keep anti-McCain votes from going to Paul .
Huckabee , in short , would be playing spoiler for McCain again .
The first time was in Iowa , where he beat Mitt Romney and by doing so kept McCain competitive in New Hampshire .
( After which , when Huckabee got too competitive and threatened to win SC , too , McCain had to use Fred Thompson as a spoiler against him . )
It only makes sense for the McCain camp to drag him out one more time , to use as a spoiler against Paul .
And it would only make sense for Huckabee to agree .
By drawing anti-McCain votes , and media attention , from Paul , he will be doing his duty and cementing his status as McCain 's running mate .
However , he would also be cementing his status as the candidate that , if the anticipated delegate revolt happens , the anti-McCain forces turn to and nominate .
Presidential candidate or running mate : either way he wins .
Which , to my mind , would fully explain Pastor Huckabee 's reappearance in the race .

" Digital preservation " sounds simple enough ; just slap that data onto increasingly cheap and spacious hard drives , keep some offsite backups , and you 're good to go , right ?
Not so fast , says the Library of Congress , and it points a crabbed and bony finger directly at US copyright law — and at DRM .
Libraries labor under most of the same rules that govern the rest of us , with a few key exceptions .
For instance , libraries can make three copies of unpublished works in their collections , and copyright holders have to provide the Library of Congress with two deposit copies of all books .
But copyright law also hampers important work being done at places like the Library of Congress , and a major new report on the issue from the Library points out the problems with the current rules .
One big issue is the exemption for published works in a library 's collection ; these can also be copied three times , but only to " replace a work in their collections that is damaged , deteriorating , lost or stolen or whose format has become obsolete . "
In other words , librarians can't backup or archive such works until destruction is well under way .
In addition , " obsolete " does n't mean what you or I might mean by the term ; the Library notes that LPs still can't be copied into digital archives because record players remain available on the open market and are therefore not " obsolete . "
In addition , the three - copy limit makes little sense in an all - digital world .
Making three photocopies of a book or magazine to replace a moth - eaten copy is straightforward , but how do you comply with the law when simply serving up the digital files to scholars creates a host of server and cache copies that exceed the limit ?
And what can libraries do about the massive amount of material that is " born digital " ?
Unlike print publishers , web publishers and bloggers operate without any mandatory deposit requirements , and the Library of Congress is overwhelmed by the prospect of trying to archive the web ( though its Web Capture project does grab some primary resources for use in its collections and exhibits ) .
Technological protection measures , better known as " DRM " in the US , are also an issue , thanks to the Digital Millenium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) .
That law famously prohibited circumvention of DRM , and it contained no exceptions for libraries and archives that want to preserve digital material .
Every three years , the Librarian of Congress gets to craft exemptions to this rule , but the report drily notes that this does n't solve the problem .
" Even though the Librarian is empowered to create additional exemptions , he cannot affect the ban on trafficking in circumvention devices , " says the report .
So , although circumvention could become legal for libraries , " the means to take advantage of the exception may not be available . "
The 200 - page report is remarkably thorough and includes analysis from several other countries on how their own copyright laws pose problems for libraries ' digital preservation efforts .
Suggestions are of course offered — much the same ones that were offered several months ago by another study group — but we have yet to hear of any momentum on Capitol Hill for this type of DMCA reform .
Certainly , nothing on the issue will be done this year .

McCain campaign bundler Harry Sargeant III , a Florida Republican , has bundled more than $ 140,000 in campaign contributions for John McCain , largely from individuals of modest means who have never contributed to a presidential candidate before .
While reading what follows , keep in mind that it is illegal for foreigners to contribute their own money to U.S. campaigns .
( In an earlier post Blog For Arizona : The Double Talk Express : McCain is a Fraud on Campaign Finance Reform I reported that the Rothschild family hosted a campaign fund raiser for McCain when he was in London , for which the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch filed a complaint with the FEC , which remains pending ) .
As reported by Matthew Mosk of the Washington Post Bundler Collects From Unlikely Donors - washingtonpost.com :
The bundle of $ 2,300 and $ 4,600 checks that poured into Sen .
John McCain 's presidential campaign on March 12 came from an unlikely group of California donors : a mechanic from D&D Auto Repair in Whittier , the manager of Taco Bell stores in Riverside , the owners of a liquor store in Colton .
* * *
Harry Sargeant III , a former naval officer and the owner of an oil - trading company that recently inked defense contracts potentially worth more than $ 1 billion , is the archetype of a modern presidential money man .
The law forbids high - level supporters from writing huge checks , but with help from friends in the Middle East and the former chief of the CIA 's bin Laden unit -- who now serves as a consultant to his company -- Sargeant has raised more than $ 100,000 for three presidential candidates from a collection of ordinary people , several of whom professed little interest in the outcome of the election .
* * *
The 2008 presidential campaign , which could see each side spend close to $ 500 million , has heightened the importance of " bundlers " such as Sargeant , who not only write checks themselves but also recruit scores of other donors to give the legal limit of $ 2,300 .
Questions about such donor networks have repeatedly emerged as points of stress for the campaigns .
* * *
Some of the most prolific givers in Sargeant 's network live in modest homes in Southern California 's Inland Empire .
Most had never given a political contribution before being contacted by Sargeant or his associates .
Most said they have never voiced much interest in politics .
And in several instances , they had never registered to vote .
And yet , records show , some families have ponied up as much as $ 18,400 for various candidates between December and March .
Both Sargeant and the donors were vague when asked to explain how Sargeant persuaded them to give away so much money .
" I have a lot of Arab business partners .
I do a lot of business in the Middle East .
I 've got a lot of friends , " Sargeant said in a telephone interview yesterday .
" I ask my friends to support candidates that I think are worthy of supporting .
They usually come through for me . "
Donors reached by phone or interviewed in person declined to explain who asked them to make the contributions .
Ibrahim Marabeh , who is listed in public records as a Rite Aid manager , at first denied that he wrote any political checks .
He then said he was asked by " a local person .
But I would like not to talk about it anymore . "
* * *
[ N]adia and Shawn Abdalla , who are not registered to vote , said in an interview that they recalled writing a check to an organization in Miami , because a person with that organization was a friend of their mother's .
They said they could not remember his name .
Nader , 39 , and Sahar Alhawash , 28 , of Colton , Calif ... declined to comment about the donations .
* * *
Abdullah Abdullah , a supervisor at several Taco Bell restaurants in the Riverside area , and his wife have donated $ 9,200 to McCain .
Reached at work , Abdullah said he knows little about the campaign .
" I have no idea .
I 'll be honest with you , " he said .
" I 'm involved in the restaurant business .
My brother Faisal recommended John McCain .
Whenever he makes a recommendation , we do it . "
Faisal Abdullah , 49 , said he helped organize all of the contributions from members of his family .
When he was asked who solicited the contributions from him , he said : " Why does it matter who ?
I 'm telling you we made the contribution .
We funneled it through the channel in Florida because that 's the contact we had .
I was responsible for collecting it . "
Water Fuel Cell ( WFC ) Researches
created on June 12 , 2008 - JLN Labs - June 26 , 2008

The WFC ( Water Fuel Cell ) based on the work of Stanley Meyer uses ordinary tap water or distilled water , this is not a common Faraday electrolysis process , the WFC uses the parametric resonance effect with High Voltage and Low Current to split the water molecule .
The purpose of this WFC project is trying to replicate the results obtained by Stanley Meyer ...
To understand the main principle of Stanley Meyer 's WFC , I suggest strongly to read this paper :
Preliminary tests of the 1st WFC v1.0 ( June 12 , 2008 ) :
Below , the video of the experimental WFC v1.0 working in resonance mode with distilled water .
A high flow of gases is produced at the WFC v1.0 resonance frequency .
You may notice that , in this case , the size of the bubbles produced are very tiny compared to a common electrolysis process .

Parametric resonance tests of the WFC at 2 * fo and at 0.5 * fo :
When the frequency of the pump is set to Fpump = 2 * fo = 1.110 MHz
the resonance of the WFC is fo= 0.687 Mhz
When the frequency of the pump is set to Fpump = 0.5 * fo = 0.329 MHz
the resonance of the WFC is fo= 0.560 Mhz

Principle of the parametric resonance
Test of WFC v1.1 with an insulated cathod
The center electrode of the WFC v1.0 has been covered with a thin adhesive plastic sheet so has to get a fully insulated cathod .
So , it is now possible to get the Voltage Intensification with an electrical step charging effect .
Below the measured specs of the new insulated WFC v1.1 .
Above :
The WFC 1.1 has been tested with 30V squared pulses at 105 Hz .
When the voltage is switched off , the WFC acting as a water capacitor , discharges on itself .
A 246 mH coil have been connected in parallel with the WFC v1.1 at the output of the VIC circuit .
The voltage can be stepped up to 1.4 kV peak - peak at 13 kHz
Above :
The WFC v1.1 is charged through a 9.89 k Ohms resistor with the DC power supply .
Now , the WFC v1.1 act as a true capacitor .
The calculated value from the curve ( 4.7 nF ) is nearly close to the measured value with the digital capacimeter ( 5.19 nF ) .
Above :
The WFC capacitor is disconnected from the DC power supply , its discharges on itself .
It is interesting to notice that the calculated value ( 196 k Ohms ) from the curve of the internal
resistance of the WFC v1.1 is less than the measured value with the digital multimeter ( 2.9 MOhms ) .
Above :
The WFC v1.1 is charged with the VIC , you see clearly the stepping charge effect .
The T1 transformer is a common 220v / 12v 60 VA transformer used in reverse mode .
The use of a toroïdal transformer with a ferrite core will be better to minimize the HF losses in the core .
The T2 transformer uses a bifilar coils as described below :
Above :
The VIC ( Voltage Intensifier Circuit ) is now working .
The WFC v1.1 is charged up to 1.1 KV in stepping charge .
Notes :
With the design v1.1 , I have n't yet got the same density of bubbles observed in the v1.0 , the WFC v1.1 has been designed so as to get a true capacitor , the stepping charge effect can be observed has Stanley Meyer as described in his technical notes and his patent .
The adiabatic charge effect of this water capacitor is very important because it minimizes de losses by Joules effect in the circuit during the charging process , so the energy transfert in the WFC is optimal .
I am currently building a new WFC v2 , I shall soon publish all the infos and the datas , stay tuned ...

PAHRUMP , NEV . --
Two Nevada delegations are packing their bags for the Republican National Convention Sept. 1 , and if the latest party ruling stands , neither of them will be seated .
A fiasco at the state convention spawned the dueling delegations -- one for John McCain and one for Ron Paul -- and their continued wrangling has exposed a split in the party that may spell trouble in a key state for the presumptive Republican presidential nominee .
Running ...
The future may not smell too rosy – it may lie in sewage .
As cities and industries suck up ever more of the world ’s scarce water resources , agriculture is destined to rely increasingly on recycling the contents of urban sewers , according to a new international study of “ wastewater agriculture ” .
The good news – for farmers at least – is that the irrigation water from sewers comes with free fertiliser in the form of the nitrates and phosphates bound up in human faeces .
The bad news is that this coprological cornucopia is filling vegetables sold in city markets with heavy metals , pathogenic bacteria and worms .
An estimated one fifth of the world ’s food is growing in urban areas , with perishables like vegetables to the fore .
But a 50 - city study by the International Water Management Institute ( IWMI ) – a World Bank - backed research agency based in Sri Lanka – finds that often the only source of the essential irrigation water to grow many of those crops is city sewage .
A market near you ?
Half of urban fields are irrigated with sewage , suggesting that a tenth of the world ’s food is already grown this way .
IWMI ’s director Colin Chartres warned this week : “ This figure is bound to increase as growing cities coincide with escalating food shortages to create a squeeze on agricultural water supply . ”

Theoretically , irrigating food crops with untreated wastewater is banned in many countries , one reason why there is virtually no research on the practice .
But “ while it may be theoretically forbidden , it is unofficially tolerated ” , says the report ’s authors , who found that city authorities in Faisalabad in Pakistan auction untreated sewage to farmers during droughts .
Some countries , including Israel , Mexico and Tunisia , treat sewage before delivering it to farmers , which removes bacteria and lumps , at least .
But this is rare .
In the Ghanaian capital Accra , 200,000 people buy vegetables grown on urban fields irrigated with tanker loads of wastewater that is untreated because the city ’s sewage treatment works long since ceased to function .
Toxic build - up
“ I am worried about the toxins , especially heavy metals , accumulating in foods like root crops , ” says Chartres .
“ But often there is simply no other water .
In many ways it is a great use of the waste and the nutrients it contains . ”
He says the best answer is not to ban the practice , but to improve it .
“ Even without expensive infrastructure , common sense measures can make wastewater irrigation safer . ”
Storing the wastewater in ponds allows solids to settle out , including the eggs of intestinal worms .
And farmers should wash vegetables in clean water before selling them to markets .
The bottom line is that increasing numbers of people will starve , and many more will lose their livelihoods , without the benefits of recycled sewage .
Dr. Richard N. Bergman , an expert on obesity and diabetes at the University of Southern California , said the drugs might prove to have serious side effects but , if safe , could become widely used .
“ It is possible that the couch potato segment of the population might find this to be a good regimen , and of course that is a large number of people . ”
The idea of a workout in a pill seems almost too good to be true , but Dr. Evans has impressive research credentials , including winning the Lasker Award , which often presages a Nobel Prize .
He is an expert on how hormones work in cells and on a powerful gene - controlling protein called PPAR - delta , which instructs fat cells to burn off fat .
Four years ago he found that PPAR - delta played a different role in muscle .
Muscle fibers exist in two main forms .
Type 1 fibers have copious numbers of mitochondria , which generate the cell ’s energy and are therefore resistant to fatigue .
Type 2 fibers have fewer mitochondria and tire easily .
Athletes have lots of Type 1 fibers .
People with obesity and diabetes have far fewer Type 1 and more Type 2 fibers .
Dr. Evans and his team found that the PPAR - delta protein remodeled the muscle , producing more of the high - endurance Type 1 fiber .
They genetically engineered a strain of mice whose muscles produced extra amounts of PPAR - delta .
These mice grew more
Type 1 fibers and could run twice as far as on a treadmill as ordinary mice before collapsing .
Given that people cannot be engineered in this way , Dr. Evans wondered whether levels of the PPAR - delta protein could be raised by drugs .
Pharmaceutical companies have long tried to manipulate PPAR - delta because of its role in fat metabolism , and Dr. Evans found several drugs were available , although they had been tested for different purposes .
In a report in the Friday issue of Cell , he described the two drugs that successfully activate the muscle - remodeling system in mice , generating more high - endurance Type 1 fiber .
The drug GW1516 activates the PPAR - delta protein but the mice must also exercise to show increased endurance .
It seems that PPAR - delta switches on one set of genes , and exercise another , and both are needed for endurance .
Aicar improves endurance without training .
Dr. Evans believes that it both activates the PPAR - delta protein and mimics the effects of exercise , thus switching on both sets of genes needed for the endurance signal .
IMAGINE what would happen if the price of gasoline remained the same , but instead of selling it by the gallon , gas stations knocked down the size a few ounces .
It might seem that you were paying the same amount  about $ 4 a gallon  but you would n’t be .
You would be getting , say , a mere 120 ounces instead of 128 , and you would be paying more for gas .
If gas stations labeled the change clearly , would there be riots in the street ?
Would weary consumers simply shrug and pay the same for less at the pump ?
We do n’t really know how people would react .
But something very much like this is already occurring at the supermarket , what Tod Marks , a senior editor at Consumer Reports , calls “ the incredibly shrinking package ” strategy .
It has been a big week for energy plans .
We have one proposed by a former politician and current alternative energy venture capitalist , one proposed by a former oil man who is lobbying for a Production Tax Credit ( PTC ) extension , and one from a former microprocessor supplier who was once an embarrassed sole supplier with insufficient capacity to meet customer demands .
All of the plans envision a need for more abundant and reliable electrical power , but all of the plans marginalize the potential for growth in nuclear fission power .
I am not rich , not powerful and not a public figure .
I have not spent my career drilling oil and gas wells , raiding companies , running for office , or building an industry dominating chip supplier .
Instead , I have been struggling for more than 15 years to try to share a vision for a cleaner , safer , more prosperous world made possible by moving away from carbon based fuels that put most of us into dependence on people that simply do not like or respect us .
At the risk of being accused of vanity for trying to play with the big boys , I would like to add my 1.76 cents worth to all of the proposed plans .
Take the ideas proposed by Gore , Pickens , and Grove to shift dependence from carbon based fuels to electrical power and add a couple more specific actions :
Empower nuclear regulators with enough resources to work their way through current traffic jams of license applications .
Revise rules to enable and encourage smaller , simpler plants instead of the current “ one size fits all ” .
Stabilize the carbon cost structure so that nuclear power development planners can include the competitive benefits in their business case presentations for investors .
Take a hard look at the plants operating on aircraft carriers , ice breakers and submarines to determine if , like modern jet engines developed initially for military use , they can be commercialized without sacrificing military advantages .
Enable the world ’s nuclear regulatory license organizations to share documentation , training and processes so that a plant licensed by one qualified regulatory body can be more easily licensed by all of them .
While serving as a nuclear submarine engineer officer , I had the opportunity to develop expert knowledge about an energy source that provided almost magical capabilities .
How many of you would like to have a power plant that allowed you to be completely divorced from the grid , with a small volume fuel supply that lasted for a decade and a half ?
How cool would it be to be able to operate that system in a sealed space , knowing that you were not spewing any pollutants at all ?
We – trained and educated engineers , technicians , and operators – know how to produce massive quantities of weather independent power without burning any carbon based fuels at all .
We know where to find the fuel , how to run training programs , how to build the components and how to safely store the used materials .
We know how reliable the plants can be , how safe they are and how little waste they produce .
We can compute to three decimal places the cost to operate the existing plants .
Note :
The 1.76 cents mentioned above is the 2007 average cost of operating a nuclear plant in the US .
That cost includes labor , material & supplies , contractor services , licensing fees , and miscellaneous costs such as employee expenses and regulatory fees .
It also includes fuel related costs like purchasing of uranium , conversion , enrichment , and fabrication services along with storage and shipment costs , and inventory ( including interest ) charges less any expected salvage value .
( Source : Nuclear Energy Institute Resources and Stats ) .
What you read about ever increasing costs for nuclear power is limited to projected costs for future systems – future cost estimates are always subject to a lot of guesswork .
That is especially true for systems whose construction start time is still four years – six years away .
Of course , there are plenty of reasons why some people do not like fission power .
It has successfully taken market share from coal , oil and gas in electrical power production .
It has the potential to push oil out of heating and ship propulsion and gas out of heating and electrical power .
It can push coal out of its last remaining market – why spend billions to figure out how to separate and sequester CO2 when you can simply prevent its production ?
It can reduce the threat of fuel interruptions as a political or economic bargaining chip since plants can run for at least 18 months without new fuel .
It can reduce support for spending large quantities of taxpayer dollars to subsidize less effective and less green energy sources on the pretense that they provide energy security or reduced emissions – it is hard to go below zero .
It can reduce the need to spend money supporting scientists to research silver bullet energy sources like nuclear fusion .
“ Greentech ” venture capitalists like Gore and oil and gas men like Pickens will continue to try to marginalize nuclear power and spread fear , uncertainty and doubt about its capabilities .
That is their job , but it is our job as citizens to ask hard questions , to seek facts , to recognize vested interests , and to make long term choices that will provide us with a better , more prosperous and more egalitarian world .
The choice to ignore the best tool in the box to address climate change , energy costs , and inequality of opportunity makes me believe that Gore , Pickens and Grove simply do not fully understand the technical nature of the challenges that we are facing .
They are expressing some good thoughts on the causes and extent of the ills that face us , but their solutions simply cannot work without more effective medicine .
The wealth concentrating flow of money from the pockets of billions of European , Asian , African , Australian and American ( north and south ) consumers and into the pockets of a few thousand oil and gas oligarchs in Houston , Caracas , Riyadh , Lagos , Moscow , Abu Dhabi and others simply cannot be allowed to continue .

July 11 , 2008  -- Attorney General Michael Mukasey has notified the House Judiciary Committee that he will not appoint special counsel to investigate the actions of CIA officers and agents who conducted detainee interrogations that included controversial methods such as waterboarding , which simulates drowning .
The controversial interrogation practices were authorized by lawyers from the Justice Department 's Office of Legal Counsel .
In a letter to House Judiciary Chairman Rep. John Conyers , D - Mich. , who had requested special counsel on the matter , Mukasey noted that " it would be unwise and unjust to expose to possible criminal penalties those who relied in good faith on those prior Justice Department opinions . "
Referencing " The Terror Presidency , " a book by Jack Goldsmith -- former head of the Office of Legal Counsel -- Mukasey said that the intelligence community was exposed to " cycles of timidity and aggression . "
Mukasey also noted in the letter that opening a criminal investigation of the interrogators " would not only , in my judgment , be unjust but would also have potentially grave national security consequences .
There could be no more certain way to usher in a new ' cycle of timidity ' in the intelligence community than to tell the government 's national security policymakers and lawyers that , if they support an aggressive counterterrorism policy based on their good - faith belief that such a policy is lawful , they may nevertheless one day be prosecuted for doing so . "
The issue of the interrogation practices gained renewed attention when the CIA acknowledged in December that interrogation video tapes of two Al Qaeda detainees who had been waterboarded had been destroyed .
The video tapes have become a critical point in the appeal of convicted terrorist Zacarias Moussaoui .
The main point of Moussaoui 's appeal is that government officials withheld evidence from his defense , and that the CIA had submitted inaccurate declarations to the U.S. District Court that no recordings of detainee interrogations existed .
Shortly after being sworn in as attorney general , Mukasey appointed John Durham to serve as acting U.S. attorney in the investigation of the tapes ' destruction .
A little noticed court filing in the litigation of the appeal of Moussaoui 's conviction noted in court papers filed last week that Durham had recently uncovered new information in the case : " The Acting United States Attorney and his staff have very recently uncovered new information that may be relevant to the issues that were addressed ... and have been raised again on appeal . "
The Justice Department has declined to elaborate on Durham 's new information from that filing but it indicates the investigation into the tapes ' destruction is ongoing .
Statement by the President -- McCain's VP Pick
Contact : White House , Office of the Press Secretary , 202-456-2580
WASHINGTON , Aug. 29 / Standard Newswire / --
The following text is a statement by President Bush :
Today , Senator McCain made an exciting decision in choosing Alaska Governor Sarah Palin to join him on his ticket as the Vice Presidential candidate .
Governor Palin is a proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government .
Governor Palin ’s success is due to her dedication to principle and her roll - up - your - sleeves work ethic and serves as a wonderful example of the spirit of America .
By selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done , Senator McCain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming Washington .
I applaud Senator McCain for selecting Governor Palin .
This decision is yet another example of why the American people can trust him to make wise decisions and to confidently lead this country .
EFF TURNS 30 THIS YEAR !

For the past year , some Lawrence bar owners unknowingly have been inviting concealed carry permit holders to bring loaded guns into their taverns .
Kansas legislators made changes to the state ’s concealed carry law during the 2007 session that significantly loosened restrictions on concealed carry holders bringing their weapons into drinking establishments .
That was news to local bar owners and hospitality industry leaders .
“ You ’re ( expletive ) me , ” said Rick Renfro , owner of Johnny ’s Tavern in North Lawrence .
Renfro , like the vast majority of bar owners in Lawrence , does not have a no - guns - allowed sign posted at his bar ’s entrances .
Renfro said he believed the state law made bars and taverns automatically prohibited places for concealed carry holders to enter with their weapons , regardless of whether a sign was posted .
That is how the law read when it originally passed in 2006 .
But during the 2007 session , legislators made several changes .
One was that bars – along with several other once automatically prohibited places – would have to post a no - guns sign if they wanted to prohibit concealed carry holders from bringing their guns on the premises .
Now the law is clear that concealed carry holders cannot be cited for breaking the law by entering a tavern unless the tavern has the state - approved sign posted , said Chuck Sexson , the director of the concealed carry program for the Kansas Attorney General ’s office .
The law took effect nearly a year ago , on July 1 , 2007 .
The law still does make it illegal for a concealed carry permit holder to have a weapon with a blood alcohol level of more than 0.08 , the same level for driving under the influence .
People without a concealed carry license also cannot bring a gun into a bar , or anywhere else .
Several bar owners , though , said they did n’t like the idea of any patron having a gun in their establishments .
“ I do n’t think anybody who is drinking alcohol should be carrying a gun .
It wo n’t do anything to help improve their decision making , ” said Brad Ziegler , who owns parts of three Lawrence bars and had not heard of the change until informed by a reporter .
Sexson , with the attorney general ’s office , said the intent of the law was not to encourage people to carry a weapon while drinking .
He said concealed carry instructors are told to stress that guns and alcohol do not mix .
Instead , Sexson said the change was designed to clear up confusion about when a concealed carry holder could legally enter an establishment that served alcohol .
Under the previous regulations , bars and taverns were automatically prohibited but restaurants that served alcohol were not .
“ We got a lot of questions about that , ” Sexson said .
There was not an easy answer to give to confused permit holders , he said .
That ’s because the law defined food - serving taverns and alcohol - serving restaurants based on the percentage of food sales the establishment made .
That ’s information not easily available to a permit holder .
Phil Bradley , executive director of the Lawrence - based Kansas Licensed Beverage Association , does n’t like the law change , but said he ’s equally concerned that no one seemed to make an effort to notify bar owners of the change .
He said he did not know of the change , even though he followed the Legislature closely .
He said he expected many bar owners across the state were n’t aware of the new rules .
“ I think all this is dangerous at best , ” Bradley said .
Sen .
Phil Journey , a Haysville Republican who supported the change , is making no apologies about how the process was handled .
The attorney general ’s office did post a summary of changes to the law on its Web site .
But Journey said it was mainly up to organizations such as Bradley ’s to inform their members of changes .
“ That ’s not my obligation , ” Journey said .
“ They are published in the statute book and published in the Kansas Register .
That ’s public notice , and there certainly was debate in the legislature . ”
Much of the media attention on H.B. 2528 focused on provisions prohibiting cities from taking action to exempt themselves from parts of the concealed carry act .
That ’s why a Lawrence law prohibiting guns within 200 feet of any drinking establishment does n’t apply to concealed carry permit holders .
But the most recent change in state law did surprise city leaders .
Scott Miller , a city attorney who provides legal advice to the Lawrence Police Department , was n’t aware of the changes made to bars and taverns .
He said he would be informing the police department of the changes .
And he said the law was written in a way that the city could not pass a local ordinance to exempt itself from the provision .
Bradley said he might lobby the Legislature to change the law in 2009 .
In the meantime , bar owners will be deciding whether to post signs .
Renfro said he almost certainly would , but wo n’t like the fact .
“ I feel like those signs almost encourage it and make it more of an issue , ” Renfro said .
“ I specifically did not put them up because I did not want to bring up the image of a knife and gun club . ”
The factory is not just quiet — it seems almost deserted .
The driveway , lined with thick pine forest , is a mile long and gives the place a muffled quality .
The two main buildings are large enough to be airplane hangars — tall - shouldered , with blank metal walls so high that the doorways look puny .
The inside of the far building is almost as still as the outside .
There is plenty of equipment — tool carts , platforms for working around large items , racks of parts .
But there is an air of work interrupted .
Only a handful of people are visible .

It is , however , instantly clear what kind of work gets done here .
Hanging from yellow overhead cranes are two of the largest jet engines in the world .
It takes no great aeronautical expertise to appreciate these engines :
Even unfinished , they look muscular .
They ’re also huge : Each one is bigger than a Lincoln Navigator .
Although engines go out the door of this plant at a rate of more than one per day , the air of calm is hardly its most unusual aspect .
The plant is General Electric ’s aircraft - engine assembly facility in Durham , North Carolina .
Even within Jack Welch ’s widely admired empire , the Durham facility is in its own league — a quiet corner of a global giant , a place where the radical has become routine .
GE / Durham has more than 170 employees but just one boss : the plant manager .
Everyone in the place reports to her .
Which means that on a day - to - day basis , the people who work here have no boss .
They essentially run themselves .
The jet engines are produced by nine teams of people — teams that are given just one basic directive : the day that their next engine must be loaded onto a truck .
All other decisions — who does what work ; how to balance training , vacations , overtime against work flow ; how to make the manufacturing process more efficient ; how to handle teammates who slack off — all of that stays within the team .
Everyone knows how much money everyone else makes , because employees are paid according to his or her skill .
There are three grades of jet - assembly technician at this plant — tech - 1 , tech - 2 , and tech - 3 — and there is one wage rate for each grade .
There is no conventional assembly line .
One team “ owns ” an engine from beginning to end — from the point when parts are uncrated and staged to the moment a team member climbs on a forklift to place the finished engine on a truck for shipment .
The members of the team do the jobs that interest them .
No one ever does the same job , shift after shift , day after day .
There is usually choice — and there is always variety .
This plant has no time clock .
Workers leave to go to their kids ’ band concerts and Little League games .
Every technician has an email address and Internet access , voice mail , business cards , and a desk shared with one teammate .
The plant manager — the boss — sits in an open cubicle that ’s located right on the factory floor : Engines float by , just 20 feet away .
And one more thing : Jet - engine assembly is rocket science — or , rather , something no less difficult than rocket science .
In an engine that weighs 8.5 tons and has 10,000 parts , even a nut that weighs less than an ounce must be installed to a very specific tightness .
Every part is put together with a torque wrench .
Some parts are so vital , and so sensitive , that a computer is used to tighten the nuts that attach them to the engine .
And after each step , a technician takes responsibility by entering his or her initials on a computer terminal .

The 170 - plus people who work at this plant try to make perfect jet engines .
And they come close .
On average , one - quarter of the engines that GE / Durham sends to Boeing have just a single defect — something cosmetic , such as a cable not lined up right , or a scratch on a fan case .
The other three - quarters are , in fact , perfect .
That is one big reason why Boeing , in an eloquent vote of confidence , recently chose a new version of the GE90 as the exclusive engine for its new , long - range 777 airplane .
For early versions of the breakthrough 777 , Boeing had used engines from GE and its two competitors , Rolls - Royce and Pratt & Whitney .
For the new 777s , which will be able to fly 10,000 miles without stopping , the GE90 will be the only engine — and only GE / Durham makes the GE90 .
At GE / Durham , there is no cynicism about the drive for perfection .
“ It matters , ” says Bill Lane , a 35 - year - old tech - 2 . “ I ’ve got a 3 - year - old daughter , and I figure that every plane we build engines for has someone with a 3 - year - old daughter riding on it . ”
Before Lane started putting together jet engines , he worked for Frito - Lay .
“ I ran the machinery that packaged Doritos , ” he says .
A bad Dorito , of course , only spoils someone ’s lunch .
A bad jet engine could destroy hundreds of lives — or alter the course of history .
The engines that keep Air Force One aloft came from this plant .
So how can something so complicated , so demanding , so fraught with risk , be trusted to people who answer only to themselves ?
Trust is a funny thing .
It is the mystery — and the genius — of what goes on at GE / Durham .
And it is the reason why the plant offers so many lessons about why people work , how teams succeed , and what workplace democracy really means .
Simplicity , by Design
The jet engine , like the telephone and antibiotics , is one of those wonders of modern technology that works so well that it has rendered itself mundane .
That someone who lives in Topeka can decide on a whim to go to Tokyo , and be there in less than a day , is truly miraculous .
Unlike the computer chip or the MRI scanner , whose underlying technology is impenetrable to the ordinary person , jet engines work so simply , so elegantly , that they can be understood by a precocious fifth - grader .
The principles of jet - engine design and operation are these : Suck .
Squeeze .
Bang .
And blow .
A jet engine moves itself along by sucking in air ; compressing that air ; mixing the compressed air with fuel and a spark to get a dramatic , controlled expansion of the air ( that is , an explosion ) ; and aiming that explosion out the back end of the jet .
advertisement
It ’s just that simple .
The simplicity of the modern jet engine makes its power all the more impressive .
GE ’s big jet engine — the GE90 , one of the most powerful commercial - jet engines in production — generates 92,000 pounds of thrust .
The Boeing 777 airplane , which is powered by the GE90 , weighs 300,000 pounds when it ’s empty .
Loaded with fuel , 350 people , their luggage , and food , the plane doubles in weight .
It requires only two GE90s to fire a fully loaded 777 through the air at 600 mph .
And the plane can fly safely on just one engine .
Although the engines made in Durham operate on principles that are easy to grasp , the specifics of engine design , assembly , and operation are anything but elementary .
Walk up to a group of three people working at GE / Durham and ask , “ So what are you working on ? ” and , likely as not , the answer will require a 20 - minute explanation , along with the aid of a hastily sketched diagram .
John “ Hoss ” Swain , 54 , Paul Bryan , 32 , and Pat Miller , 31 , are hunched over a stand that holds a metal ring about three feet across .
While it looks like a ring , it ’s actually a seal , designed to keep exhaust gases inside the GE90 engine at a critical point .
It works in much the same way that a washer in a garden hose does .
Swain , Bryan , and Miller are measuring the seal to see if it is perfectly round .
How round ?
“ It ca n’t be more than four 1,000ths of an inch out of round , ” says Miller .
That ’s about half as thick as a human hair .
In other words , this three - foot - wide ring must be round within the tolerance of a single hair .
If it is n’t exactly that round , gaps will develop between sealing surfaces .
With the parts turning at 10,400 RPMs , even a small gap can cause a decrease in performance .
So these guys measure every single seal on every single engine .
“ This has never been four 1,000ths of an inch out of true in the four years I ’ve been measuring these , ” says Miller .
“ Never . ” Money alone can’t motivate people to perform this well .
At GE / Durham , people strive for perfection , expecting no reward other than their own satisfaction .
This place has no performance incentives .
And so , as impressive as the technology of the jet engine is , as demanding and precise as the assembly process must be , as unforgiving as the engines and the airlines are of even the slightest flaw , the human technology by which GE / Durham organizes its work is no less impressive .
In some ways , in fact , the management of the Durham plant is more impressive than its products .
High - performance turbo - fan jet engines can be found at every major airport .
But a place where workers are given real responsibility is about as common in the world of work as an out - of - round aft - shaft seal is at this plant .

Pat Miller knows that as vividly as anyone .
His last job was as technically advanced as any in the aviation - mechanics world .
“ I came from Northrop Grumman , in Palmdale , California , where I was working on the B - 2 bomber , ” says Miller .
“ That plane , which used Stealth technology , was as high - tech as you can get .
But someone else wrote the assembly process .
Here , I write the process — at the mechanic level .
There , I was on a ‘ team , ’ but I also had a supervisor .
He had a boss .
And there were other bosses above him .
In two years of working there , I never saw the plant manager .
Every day , my boss would just hand me my job .
I had no input at all — none .
I ’m much happier here .
I can change what goes on . ”
From Shipyard Laborer to Jet Mechanic
In a plant that has been open only since 1993 , Duane Williams is a veteran .
Williams , 33 , started at GE / Durham in February 1994 .
He ’s a tech - 3 , certified to do any task that ’s necessary to make a GE90 engine for Team Raven .
He ’s standing at a big table , starting work on the “ stage 5 ” disk of an engine ’s low - pressure turbine .
This is the back end of the engine , where power is generated not to fly the airplane but to run the engine itself .
This back - end turbine creates the spin that turns the big fan up front .
When it ’s done , the stage - 5 disk — made of polished metal , lying flat on the table — will look like a very large version of a child ’s pinwheel .
“ It ’s just 20 minutes out of the box , ” says Williams .
This is not the glamour work of turbo - jet assembly .
It ’s one of those parts of the job that is reminiscent of long and lazy childhood Saturday afternoons spent gluing together plastic model airplanes and ships .
The stage - 5 disk has 120 identical curved blades around its perimeter .
Each blade needs to be checked , by hand , for nicks or roughness .
It is then greased with something like Vaseline , and its dove - tailed ends are slotted into place .
Although the technicians do the same routines over and over , every stage of an engine ’s assembly is laid out in detail in an encyclopedia of three - ring binders .
Each task is broken down into steps , and every step is illustrated with a color photo of that part of the engine being assembled correctly .
Like every other technician at GE / Durham , Duane Williams has his FAA ticket as a power - plant and airframe mechanic , and he went through two years of school and a certification test to get it .
That ’s an unusual prerequisite for building engines :
No other GE jet plant requires job candidates to be FAA - certified mechanics .
But the need for an FAA license is one of the founding principles of GE / Durham .
Back in the early 1990s , that license was n’t doing Williams much good .
After getting it , he could n’t find an aviation job in Norfolk , Virginia , so he took a job doing maintenance for a McDonald ’s franchiser who owned 16 restaurants .
Eventually , he got a job at a navy facility , beefing up F - 14 fighter jets to handle more powerful engines .
When he was laid off about two years later , Williams returned to what he calls “ my old faithful : working as a laborer at a shipyard . ”
When he heard about the possibility of jet - engine – assembly jobs in North Carolina , Williams hustled down to GE / Durham for an information session .
“ They mentioned the team concept , ” says Williams , “ but I never even gave it any thought .
I did n’t know if I was up for it .
But a job — I was up for that . ”

Williams is a cheerful man who conveys an innate optimism .
Starting with his interview , the hiring process at GE / Durham introduced him to a work culture that he had never imagined — one that would change his life .
“ The interview , now that was one heck of an experience , ” he says .
“ It lasted eight hours .
I talked to five different people .
I participated in three group activities with other job candidates .
I even had to do a presentation : I had 15 minutes to prepare a 5 - minute presentation . ”
For Williams , the respectful , demanding interviewing process turned out to be the beginning of an eye - opening experience .
“ My first six months at the plant were something I was n’t prepared for , ” he says .
He was part of Delta team — the startup team charged with building the CF6 engine .
The CF6 is the Honda Accord of GE jet engines .
It is in its 28th year of service and in its fifth evolution of jet - engine technology .
It ’s a super - reliable workhorse , flying everything from ups cargo jets to Philippine Airlines A320s to Air Force One .
Back in 1994 , GE / Durham started making the CF6 engine , in addition to the GE90 .
“ We had to come up with a schedule .
We had the chance to order tools , tool carts , and so on .
We had to figure out how the assembly line to make the engine should flow .
We were put on councils for every part of the business , ” says Williams .
It was his first taste of an environment in which there really are no bosses :
The technicians not only build the engines ; they also take responsibility for the work that middle management would normally do .
“ I was never valued that much as an employee in my life , ” says Williams .
“ I had never been at the point where I could n’t wait to get to work .
But here , I could n’t wait to get to work every day .
That ’s no BS ! ”
The visible joy that Williams gets from his work , and from his participation in his work , remains as palpable as his recollection of those early days , when he was helping to start up the first CF6 team .
Part of his education at GE / Durham has involved something that many teams stumble over : how to get around the truism that committees do n’t make decisions , people do .
At GE / Durham , virtually every decision is made by a team , by consensus .
Consensus is another of the founding principles of GE / Durham .
It is so ingrained that technicians have turned consensus into a verb :
The people at the plant routinely talk about “ consensing ” on something .
The average group of 15 or 16 people can’t reach consensus on where to go for lunch — let alone how to run a factory .
How to organize a production line , whether to hire someone , how to assess someone ’s skills for promotion , even how to pick who will work over the weekend — those kinds of issues inspire strong disagreement .
“ Everybody does n’t see things in the same way , ” says Williams .
“ But we ’ve had training on how to reach consensus .
We ’ve had training on how to live with ideas that we might not necessarily agree with . ”
And the team members always have the power to change things that do n’t work out .
Says Williams : “ All the things you normally fuss and moan about to yourself and your buddies — well , we have a chance to do something about them .
I ca n’t say , ‘ They ’ do n’t know what ’s going on , or , ‘ They ’ made a bad decision .
I am ‘ they . ’ “ From Teams to Tribes “ Teams , ” “ teamwork , ” “ teaming ” — these are such overused words , such overworked concepts , that they have been all but drained of meaning .
GE / Durham is n’t so much a team environment as it is a tribal community .
There are rules , rituals , and folklore ; there is tribal loyalty and tribal accountability .
There is a connection to a wider world , beyond the tribe .
advertisement
Some of these routines are big things .
Everyone at the plant belongs to a team , and every team meets every day at 2:30 pm .
The team meeting is the pivot of GE / Durham .
There are two shifts , and they overlap to allow everyone either to start or to end the day at the team meeting .
More than a simple update of the day ’s progress and problems , this meeting is a place to hip - check morale , conflict , overtime , hiring , technical snags , and planning for the future .
Also , everyone learns to assemble different parts of the engine .
“ Multiskilling is how the place is kept together , ” says Derrick McCoy , 32 , a tech - 3 and a buddy of Duane Williams ’s on Team Raven .
“ You do n’t hoard your skills .
That way , when I ’m on vacation , the low - pressure turbine can still be built without me . ”
In addition to building engines , everyone serves at one time or another on one of several work councils that cut across team lines .
The councils handle hr issues , supplier problems , engineering challenges , computer systems , discipline , and rewards .
And everyone participates in training — from sessions in how to give and receive feedback to advanced classes on cost accounting .
Some of the routines seem smaller , but they are no less essential .
Everyone cleans up .
Despite the plant ’s almost operating - room cleanliness , there is no cleaning crew .
The plant ’s tools are not locked up .
People trusted to make important decisions have to be trusted not to take home a socket set .
No one smokes in the plant .
And every day , everyone at GE / Durham wears the same outfit : blue jeans or blue slacks , and a gray pullover that has the GE / Durham logo on the left breast .
The uniform sends a quiet message .
Says Dave Hyde , 41 , a program - improvement leader who has been at the plant almost since it opened : “ There should be no reason for barriers between people here . ”
Paula Sims , 38 , was plant manager at GE / Durham for four of its first six years of existence .
( She left GE last June to pursue other opportunities in the Raleigh - Durham area . )
Ask her what the basic principles are , and she does n’t hesitate .
“ There are four , ” she says .
“ One , we have a layerless organization :
There is just one classification of worker .
Two , people are paid according to their skills .
Three , everyone is an FAA power - plant mechanic — meaning that he or she comes highly skilled .
And four , this is a team environment that requires a highly involved workforce . ”
advertisement
Clearly , not everyone has the temperament , skills , or intellect needed to work in an environment like that of GE / Durham .
So who , in particular , does n’t fit in ?
“ People who expect to take orders , ” offers Dave Hyde wryly .
The first encounter employees have with the GE / Durham principles occurs during the hiring process .
At most jet - engine facilities , an FAA mechanic ’s rating and a bit of experience would be enough to get a job .
At GE / Durham , candidates are rated in 11 areas .
“ Only one of those involves technical competence or experience , ” says Keith McKee , 27 , a tech - 3 on Team Raven .
“ You have to be above the bar in all 11 of the areas : helping skills , team skills , communication skills , diversity , flexibility , coaching ability , work ethic , and so forth .
Even if just one thing out of the 11 knocks you down , you do n’t come to work here . ”
To see how candidates cooperate , they are interviewed in groups and given group tasks .
Each team includes technicians who have been trained as “ assessors , ” and they do the interviewing .
Both the team and the plant manager have to agree — to “ consense ” — on the hiring of a new team member .
“ We ask , for instance , ‘ If there were something in your past that you could change , what would it be ? ’ ” says Derrick McCoy .
“ If you say , ‘ Well , I wish I could play “ Stairway to Heaven ” on the guitar , ’ well , I ’m not sure you ’re going to get hired .
You are on a team , a group , and you have to voice your opinion , but you also have to know when to hold back your opinion — when to offer an idea , and when to consent to an idea .
You ’ve got to be able to give a little and to take a little .
You ’ve got to be able to listen .
You ’ve got to be able to change .
That process is how we get the best people to work here . ”
Tom Mitchell , 29 , a program - improvement leader , is listening to McCoy .
“ It ’s a fit issue , ” Mitchell offers .
“ We would n’t hire Donald Trump here .
But that does n’t mean he is n’t good at what he does . ”
Keith McKee knows firsthand how stringent the screening is .
One of the people who applied for a job at the same time he did , in April 1995 , was a GE technician who had built CF6 engines at another facility .
“ I thought he was a shoo - in , ” says McKee .
“ But he did n’t get the job . ”
The Durham plant is not a setting that tolerates muttering , resentment , or unresolved disputes .
“ When I got here , ” says Derrick McCoy , “ I was skeptical .
I had n’t been on a team yet .
What happens if someone is not performing ?
If you ’ve got an issue — a problem with someone ’s work ethic , for instance — you ’ve got to bring it up .
Like , why is the day shift not getting its work done ?
Maybe the computer is down , or the parts are not in .
Either way , we have to discuss it .
Recently , Keith [ McKee ] was expecting me to get further along on building the BEA - 92 ( that ’s the system of cooling tubes near the fan hub ) than I did .
And I said to Keith , ‘ Well , I ’m working with a guy who has been here only eight months . ’
“ They expected me to get to a certain point , ” McCoy adds , “ but when you put someone with the new guy , you ca n’t expect that person to get as far as he would if you put him with an experienced guy .
As the materials - council rep , Keith did the right thing by confronting me .
And I did the right thing by confronting him back — by explaining .
It was friendly . ”
GE / Durham ’s continuous - feedback culture —
“ We call this the feedback capital of the world , ” says Paula Sims — means that while in one sense it ’s true that no one here has a boss , the opposite is also true : “ I have 15 bosses , ” says Keith McKee .
“ All of my teammates are my bosses . ”
No one is exempt .
“ Not long after I started here , ” says Sims , “ an employee came to me and said , ‘ Paula , you realize that you do n’t need to follow up with us to make sure we ’re doing what we agreed to do .
If we say we ’ll do something , we ’ll do it .
You do n’t need to micromanage us . ’
I sat back and thought , ‘ Wow .
That ’s so simple .
I ’m sending the message that I do n’t trust people , because I always follow up . ’
I took that to heart .
This was a technician , and I had been at the plant less than 30 days .
I appreciated that he felt comfortable enough to tell me this .
And I thought , ‘ This really is a different place . ' ”

The ABCs of Decisions
When it all comes together , GE / Durham can accomplish things that are almost unheard of — even in the world of sophisticated manufacturing .
Early this year , for example , GE offered the Durham facility the chance to start building another kind of engine : the CFM56 , for which demand is rising .
The CFM56 is one of the most widely used commercial engines in the world .
GE says that 40 % of all passenger planes carrying more than 100 passengers use CFM56s — including the most common commercial jet , the 737 .
GE / Durham had never built the CFM56 , but getting a new engine line , and more work , is good for morale in the plant , for expanding skills , and for job security .
“ Also , it reinforced the job we were doing , ” says Paula Sims .
The question was simple : “ How do we do that engine , which we ’ve never done before , and do it fast ?
We were going to do it with just one new team — and with no new hires . ”
After interviewing some tech - 3s , Sims picked the first two members of the CFM56 team , along with a tech - support person .
Those three people posted the rest of the jobs for the team , and then started interviewing and building a group .
GE ’s Evendale , Ohio facility — where the bulk of CFMs get built and where GE Aircraft Engines ( the parent division of GE / Durham ) is headquartered — sent engineers to Durham to help design the line and to provide details on how the engine would be put together .
Meanwhile , Sims went to GE / Durham ’s hr council and asked , “ What ’s the best way to support this new team ? ”
The hr council — with representatives from every team at the plant — came up with a rotation plan that involved lending one member of each team to the new CFM56 team , as well as maintaining a list of volunteers who were willing to work overtime on the weekends .
Pit - crew time , in other words : Everyone over the wall with a wrench .
In the end , GE / Durham got off to what Sims politely calls “ a very aggressive ” start .
“ We announced that we would do this work , ” she says , “ and nine weeks later , we shipped our first engine . ”
Two months later , Sims ’s boss sat in his Of_ce in Evendale , just outside Cincinnati , and offered a slightly different perspective on GE / Durham ’s performance .
“ They have been producing the CFM engine for eight weeks , ” said Bob McEwan , 46 , general manager of Evendale assembly operations .
“ In Evendale , we have been producing it for years and years .
And in Durham , they are already producing it for 12 % to 13 % less cost than we are here . ”
In the case of the new engine , Paula Sims did one thing that was potentially controversial :
She made a decision .
She made the decision to take on the work — without consulting people in the plant , or reaching consensus , or forming a council to consider the options .
“ That was a no - brainer , ” says Sims .
But not quite .
“ I made that decision , ” she says , “ and we call it an ‘ A decision . ’
It was a unilateral decision .
I do n’t make very many of those , and when I do make one , everyone at the plant knows it . ”
When she says she does n’t make that many A decisions — the kind that managers of her rank at other workplaces probably make several times a week , dozens of times a year — she is n’t kidding .
“ I make maybe 10 or 12 of those a year . ”
Sims has spent several hours over three days explaining the way that GE / Durham does its work and what her role is .
It is a measure of how acclimated people at GE / Durham have become to their unusual environment that it has taken this long for any of them to mention one of the fundamental rules of the place .
advertisement
At GE / Durham , every decision is either an A decision , or a B decision , or a C decision .
An A decision is one that the plant manager makes herself , without consulting anyone .
B decisions are also made by the plant manager , but with input from the people affected .
C decisions — which make up the most common type — are made by consensus , by the people directly involved , with plenty of discussion .
With C decisions , the view of the plant manager does n’t necessarily carry more weight than the views of those affected .
That decision - making taxonomy perfectly captures one of the most nagging questions about a place like GE / Durham :
What is the role of a plant manager in a place that manages itself ?
If the plant needs a manager like Sims to make just 10 decisions a year , what does she do with the bulk of her time ?
She does the kinds of things that most managers talk about a lot but that they actually spend very little time on .
At the operational level , her job is to keep everyone ’s attention focused on the goals of the plant :
Make perfect engines , quickly , cheaply , safely .
“ The marketplace for jet engines is very , very competitive , ” says Sims .
“ They sell for less this year than last year , and that has been true for the past five years in a row .
To sustain our business , we have to reduce our costs every year .
The nice thing is that here , instead of one person saying , ‘ Mush harder , ’ everyone has 15 people looking at them — 15 peers to whom they are accountable . ”
Strategically , the plant manager ’s job is to make sure that the plant as a whole is making smart decisions about talent , about time , and about opportunities for growth .
Says Sims : “ Each team , or group of teams , may be optimizing itself , but what ’s the right way to optimize the plant ?
If we ’ve optimized each engine program , how do I free up resources for growth and for process improvement ? ”
Because there are no financial incentives for technicians to improve either their productivity or the quality of their work ( Sims says simply , “ They [ financial incentives ] are not part of the culture at GE Aircraft Engines ” ) , job security is something that people at the plant think about a lot .
So it ’s the plant manager ’s job to make GE / Durham the assembly facility of choice — the place where senior GE executives , and GE customers , turn first whenever they need a new jet engine built .
“ Then , as new work becomes available , we have the potential to bid on it internally — and to get it , ” says Sims .
That approach should help cushion GE / Durham during an economic downturn , when senior management will want to make engines at the most efficient plant available .
The plant manager , in other words , has to manage up — to make sure that her bosses understand how well the plant does its work .
Sims would be easy to underestimate .
She ’s a small woman , and she ’s watchful .
She does n’t need to be the first person to express an opinion .
She has braces on her teeth and wears wire - rim glasses , and her bearing is no different from that of anyone else at the plant .
Although she has two engineering degrees , along with an MBA from UNC ’s Kenan - Flagler Business School , she has the approachable air of a junior - high soccer coach .
Every day , she wears the same outfit ( blue slacks , gray pullover ) that everyone else wears .
“ The idea of being ‘ The Boss ’ — having a big office or whatever — does n’t turn me on , ” says Sims .
“ It never really has .
I ’ve had a nice , big office , and I felt uncomfortable — removed from what was going on .
But I know I ’m the boss here .
It comes out in funny ways .
I had n’t been here long before I started hearing the phrase , ‘ Paula says . . .’
After awhile , it became a joke . ”

During her tenure at the plant , Sims was almost never at rest over the course of a day .
Any person wearing a gray GE / Durham pullover had a potential claim on her attention .
“ I had never worked in this kind of environment before , ” she says .
“ The workforce is highly skilled and highly motivated — and highly demanding as well .
It is demanding of information , time , resources , results .
I consider that a good thing — because a lot of managers I ’ve talked to are lulled to sleep by the layers of insulation around them .
But with 170 people reporting to you , you really have to balance face time with getting your work done . ”
The job , says Sims , “ has been the most challenging four years of my life — and also the most rewarding .
To do it well requires a different level of listening skills .
Significantly different . ”
In a place with no layer of middle managers to muffle the noise from below , a manager like Sims is exposed to the daily twang of worry , conflict , and tension that filters through a plant that produces roughly 400 high - performance jet engines a year .
“ More and more of what I do involves listening to people , to teams , to councils , to ideas , trying to find common themes . ”
The goals for GE / Durham this year that did n’t have to do with productivity or quality included things like reviewing compensation ; working to make more satisfying the jobs of the people who maintain each teams ’ workstations and parts kits ; and revising how technical skills are assessed for purposes of promotion .
All three of those were areas of dissatisfaction that Sims heard about during 1998 .
“ The beauty of this job is that there are very few limits that you ’d associate with its structure or its responsibilities .
The difficulty is that there is a lot of stress .
I ’m always wondering , ‘ What do I do next ?
How can I simplify things and make everybody ’s job easier ? ’ “ Training and information are key to making the plant manager ’s job manageable — not for her , but for the rest of the plant .
“ I had n’t been here more than six months , ” says Sims , “ when there were some big budget challenges .
We wanted to reduce costs at this facility by $ 1.2 million .
And we wanted a plan to do it in a few days .
I ’d been through this kind of thing many times in many different places , but I ’d never been through it here before . ”
Sims quickly and silently developed her own plan and sent it to her boss .
“ At the time , this plant was n’t very cost - conscious .
So I formed an expense council to educate people at the facility about why keeping track of expenses is important and how expenses fit into the total scheme of things . ”
The council moved fast .
Although the full “ cost education ” process took six months , the expense council took less than three weeks to grasp the basics and to develop a plan to trim costs by $ 1.2 million .
“ It was a real rudder change –to get the plant to focus on expenses , ” sasy Sims .
“ That was the year when everyone decided that I was a cheap skate .
But in a place like this , you have to trust people to a degree that you never would have before .

“ When I had a new plan , I called my boss back and said , ‘ Take that first plan I sent you and throw it in the trash .
We ’ve got a new plan , a better plan . ’
And I explained the process that we ’d gone through .
This job requires realizing that the rest of GE does n’t work the way we work .
You ca n’t say to GE , ‘ Let me geat a council together , and we ’ll get back to you in a couple weeks . ’
But the plan we came up with in that case was better than what I had come up woith on my own .
My boss chuckled and said , ‘ I guess you ’re learning the process down there . ' ”
Working to Get Better
The snazziest thing about GE ’s Durham facility is the look of the jet engines themselves .
Hanging from an overhead hoist , a CF6 engine has the allure of a big toy .
You ca n’t help wondering where the “ on ” switch is .
The nose cone in front has a white spiral on it that looks very familiar : Riding on an airplane , you ’ve twisted your head around , looked out the window , and seen the black nose cone with its white hieroglyph .
( The white design functions as a safety mechanism , revealing to the ground crew whether or not the engine is spinning . )
The sides of the engine look like a schematic of vessels , cables , and pipes .
All of the parts and textures beckon the touch–yet the care required to build these engines makes it seem like even touching them in the wrong place could cause disaster .
At GE / Durham , the jets are not just the main stage show–they are the only act .
And the stage set is nothing special .
The building is a former steam - generator plant , with corrugated metal walls and concrete floors that are 18 inches thick .
Each of the two main assembly buildigns has 3.5 acres of floor space .
Building 1 is open 6 stories high ; Building 2 is open 11 stories high .
They are cavernous enough to have their own weather .
The pinkish mercury - vapor lighting gives the factory floor an odd , underwater feel .
There is no well - equipped gym .
Thre are no offices–corner , nice , or otherwise .
There are no windows .
There are no well - stocked break rooms , Ping - Pong tables , or video games to provide relief from stress .
The cafeteria is a small room where a couple of sweet ladies prepare food that ’s reminiscent of the kind you would get in an elementary - school lunchroom .
The service is outsourced , the meals are cheap , and the food is served in Styrofoam containers .
There are no stock options for technicians .
The only way to get a promotion is to do the studying and training necessary to score well enough on an exam to become a tech - 2 or a tech - 3 .
And yet , the external turnover rate at GE / Durham is less than 5 % per year .
( The plant loses between 10 % and 15 % of its staff each year to other GE facilities . )
At a place where the morale is high and the performance is extraordinary , something is going on that is often overlooked in an economy obsessed with fringe benefits , gratuitious flattery , and today ’s closing stock price .
At GE / Durham , the work itself is the thing .
The techs at GE / Durham have challenging jobs that matter , they have a degree of control over their work that is almost unprecedented , they adhere to demanding performance standards , they receive the training and support that they need to do the best work they can–and , as a result , they do just that .
There is somethng so extraordinary about this place that you wish you could walk through it with Karl Marx and Max Weber–just to hear them explain how its revolutionary culture squares with their theories about the dehumanization of work in modern society .

How good is GE / Durham ?
Since Paula
Sims arrived in 1995 , when the plant was two years old , GE / Durham has reduced the number of defects per engine delivered to Boeing by 75 % .
The defect rate used to be about one defect per engine ( and remember , such defects are mostly cosmetic ) .
Today , defects occur at the rate of one for every fourth engine .
And GE / Durham considers even that rate to be too high .
The plant still holds a weekly conference call with Beoing to discuss defects on the latest delivery –as well as techniques for eliminating future defects .
The plant has not missed a delivery date on the CF6 engine in 38 straight months .
Or , to put it another way , GE / Durham has consecutively delivered more than 500 CF6 engines on schedule .
( The GE90 , a brand - new engine , does n’t have such a fine record .
Th GE90 teams are only in their fifth straight month of one - time deliveries . )
The cost of producing jet engines dropped by 10 % or more every single year of Paula Sim ’s tenure at GE / Durham .
Today , manufacturing a GE90 costs less than half of what it did in 1995 .
Given that the GE90 is a never - before - made engine , initial savings were to be expected still , the degree of savings was remarkably high .
What is even more revealing , GE / Durham has reduced the cost of producing the CF6 – an engine in production for two decadwes–by 30 % since 1995 .
“ We are very close to producing twice the output of CF6s from this plant with the same number of employees as when I came here , ” says Sims .
Although comparisons between GE plants are difficult–no two plants do exactly the same kind of work , with exactly the same kind of overhead to support it –Bob McEwan , who has authority over GE / Durham says simply , “ They are the best in the GE Aircraft Engines division . ”
The most interesting measure may be one that the people at GE / Durham talk about themselves .
They do n’t really think that their main job it so make jet engines .
They think that their main job is to make jet engines better .
Now , for instance , when the GE90 is in final assembly , the huge engine sits in a scaffold that consists fo two - story - high yellow metal platforms .
The platforms form a kind of pier , giving easy acces to the flanks and top of an engine that is as big around as a passenger liner .
“ They used to go up on ladders to work on those engines , ” says Sims .
“ The GE90 teams said , ‘ Could we build some platforms ? ’
I said , ‘ That ’s a great idea . ’
Once we decided on a design , it took a month to build the first one , and now we have two .
Not having to climb up and down the ladder , or to move it each time you need to reach something new , has reduced the assembly time of the engine by eight hours . ”
GE / Durham ’s culture of constant improvement offers a completely different way of looking at work .
“ Here in Evendale , ” says Bob McEwan , “ we have method engineers and process engineers , and you give them a job , and they hem and haw for a year , and then they come up with something .
Then you have to get the techs on the floor to buy into it .
It ’s all very structured , and it takes a while to get done .
Every once in a while , you get a ‘ Wow ! ’
“ Now , down in Durham , you do n’t hear about process improvement .
They are constantly swinging away at it .
Every time I go down there , I ’m amazed .
They have their washers all sorted into holders , like poker chips sorted into trays .
You can easily get the washer you want .
It ’s things like that .
They do n’t ask anybody –they just go and do it .
Down there , you can get more going in a week ’s time than you can here in a year . ”
McEwan ’s office is in the basement of the Evendale factory , a sprawling facility that was used to make bombers during the second World War .
Today , the giant facility employs about 8,000 people .
Directly above McEwan ’s office is a shop floor where GE technicians assemble jet engines .
“ I think what they ’ve discovered in Durham is the value of the human being , ” says McEwan .
He points to the ceiling .
“ Upstairs , you ’ve got wrench turners .
In Durham , you ’ve got people who think . ”
Put this in the category of “ you gotta be kidding me . ”

Method and system for navigating paginated content in page - based increments
A method and system in a document viewer for scrolling a substantially exact increment in a document , such as one page , regardless of whether the zoom is such that some , all or one page is currently being viewed .
In one implementation , pressing a Page Down or Page Up keyboard key / button allows a user to begin at any starting vertical location within a page , and navigate to that same location on the next or previous page .
For example , if a user is viewing a page starting in a viewing area from the middle of that page and ending at the bottom , a Page Down command will cause the next page to be shown in the viewing area starting at the middle of the next page and ending at the bottom of the next page .
Similar behavior occurs when there is more than one column of pages being displayed in a row .

In 2001 , Arizona crime laboratory analyst Kathryn Troyer was running tests on the state 's DNA database when she stumbled across two felons with remarkably similar genetic profiles .
The men matched at nine of the 13 locations on chromosomes , or loci , commonly used to distinguish people .
The FBI estimated the odds of unrelated people sharing those genetic markers to be 1 in 113 billion .
But the mug shots of the two felons suggested that they were not related :
One was black , the other white .
In the years after her discovery , Troyer found dozens of similar matches - each defying impossible odds .
As word spread , Troyer 's findings raised questions about the accuracy of the FBI 's DNA statistics and ignited a legal fight over whether the nation 's genetic databases ought to be opened to wider scrutiny .
The laboratory of the Federal Bureau of Investigation , which administers the national DNA database , tried to stop distribution of Troyer 's results and began to block similar searches elsewhere , even those ordered by courts , according to an investigation by the Los Angeles Times .
At stake is the credibility of the compelling odds often cited in DNA cases , which suggests an all - but - certain link between a suspect and a crime scene .
When DNA from blood or skin cells matches a suspect 's genetic profile , it can seal the suspect 's fate with a jury , even in the absence of other evidence .
As questions arise about the reliability of ballistic , bite - mark and fingerprint analysis , genetic evidence has emerged as the forensic gold standard .
But DNA " matches " are not always what they appear to be .
Although a person 's genetic makeup is unique , his " genetic profile " - a sliver of the full genome - may not be .
Siblings often share genetic markers , and unrelated people can share some by coincidence .
No one knows how rare DNA profiles are .
The odds presented in court are best estimates from the FBI .
The Arizona search was a first test of those estimates in a large state database , and the results were surprising .
Defense attorneys seized on the Arizona discoveries as evidence that genetic profiles match more often than statistics imply and are not unique .
Now , lawyers around the country are asking for searches of their own state databases .
Scientists and legal experts want to test the accuracy of statistics using the nearly 6 million profiles in the Combined DNA Index System ( CODIS ) , the national network that includes state and local databases .
" DNA is terrific and nobody doubts it , but because it is so powerful , any chinks in its armor ought to be made as salient and clear as possible so jurors will not be overwhelmed by the seeming certainty of it , " said David Faigman , a professor at the UC's Hastings College of the Law who specializes in scientific evidence .
FBI officials argue that the use of CODIS is limited to criminal justice agencies .
Defense attorneys are allowed access to information about specific cases , not the databases in general .
Bureau officials say critics have exaggerated or misunderstood Troyer 's discoveries .
Indeed , experts agree that many - but not all - of the Arizona matches were to be expected statistically because of the unusual way Troyer searched for them .
In a typical criminal case , investigators look for matches to a specific profile .
But Troyer looked for any matches among all the thousands of profiles in the database , greatly increasing the odds of finding them .
As a result , Thomas Callaghan , head of the FBI 's CODIS unit , has dismissed Troyer 's findings as misleading and meaningless .
Callaghan urged authorities in several states to object to " Arizona searches , " as they came to be known , advising them that the probes could violate the privacy of convicted offenders , tie up databases and lead the FBI to expel offending states from CODIS - a penalty that could seriously hamper states ' ability to solve crimes .
The FBI 's arguments have persuaded courts in several states to block the searches .
But in two states , judges overruled the objections .
The resulting searches found nearly 1,000 more pairs that matched at nine or more loci .
" I can appreciate why the FBI is worried about this , " said David Kaye , an expert on science and the law at Arizona State University and former member of a national committee that studied forensic DNA .
But " people 's lives do ride on this evidence , " he said .
" It has got to be explained . "
After her discovery , Troyer and colleagues in the Arizona Department of Public Safety 's Phoenix DNA lab were intrigued .
At the time , states looked at nine or fewer loci when searching for suspects .
( States now compare 13 loci , though often fewer are available from old or contaminated crime scene evidence . )
Based on Troyer 's results , colleagues believed that a nine - locus match could point investigators to the wrong person .
" If you 're going to search at nine loci , you need to be aware of what it means , " said Todd Griffith , director of the Phoenix lab .
" It 's not necessarily absolutely the guy . "
Troyer made a poster for a national conference of DNA analysts .
It showed photos of the white man and the younger black man next to their remarkably similar genetic profiles .
Some conferees had seen similar matches in their own labs .
Three years later , Bicka Barlow , a San Francisco defense attorney , came across Troyer 's poster information on the Internet as she prepared to defend a client accused of a 20 - year - old rape and murder .
A database search had found a nine - locus match between her client 's DNA profile and semen found in the victim 's body .
Based on FBI estimates , the odds of a coincidental match were 1 in 108 trillion .
Barlow wondered if there might be similar coincidental matches in California 's database - the world 's third - largest , with 360,000 DNA profiles .
She called Troyer .
Barlow learned that Troyer had searched the growing Arizona database and found more pairs of profiles matching at nine and even 10 loci .
Encouraged , Barlow subpoenaed a new search of the Arizona database .
Among about 65,000 felons were 122 pairs that matched at nine of 13 loci .
Twenty pairs matched at 10 loci .
One matched at 11 and one at 12 , though both belonged to relatives .
Barlow was stunned .
Such matches were almost unheard of .
After Barlow received the search results , Callaghan reprimanded Troyer 's lab in Phoenix , saying it should have sought FBI permission before complying with the court order .
Asked later whether Callaghan had threatened her lab , Troyer testified , " I would n't say it 's been threatened , but we have been reminded . "
Dwight Adams , then director of the FBI lab , faxed a letter to Griffith , Troyer 's supervisor , saying the lab was " under review " for releasing search results .
Arizona officials obtained a court order to prevent Barlow from sharing the results .
But it was too late .
Barlow had e-mailed the results to colleagues and DNA experts around the country .
Soon , defense lawyers in other states were seeking " Arizona searches . "
In January 2006 , not long after Barlow distributed the results of the court - ordered search in Arizona , the FBI sent out a nationwide alert to crime labs warning of similar defense requests .
Soon after , the bureau 's arguments against Arizona searches were being made in courtrooms around the country .
In California , Michael Chamberlain , a state Department of Justice official , persuaded judges that such a search could have " dire consequences " - violating the privacy of convicted offenders , shutting down the database and risking the state 's expulsion from the DNA system .
When similar arguments were made in an Arizona case , the judge ruled that the search would be " nothing more than an interesting deep sea fishing expedition . "
But in Illinois and Maryland , courts ordered the searches to proceed , despite opposition from the FBI and state officials .
In July 2006 , after Chicago - area defense attorneys sought a database search on behalf of a murder suspect , Callaghan held a telephone conference with Illinois crime lab officials .
The topic was " how to fight this , " according to lab officials ' summary of the conversation , which became part of the court record .
Callaghan suggested they tell the judge that Illinois could be disconnected from the database system , the summary shows .
Callaghan then told lab officials that " it would in fact be unlikely that IL would be disconnected , " according to the summary .
" I did n't say it was unlikely to happen , " Callaghan said in an interview .
" I was asked specifically , what 's the likelihood here ?
I said , I do n't know , but it takes a lot for a state to be cut off from the national database . "
A week later , the judge ordered the search .
Lawyers for the lab then took the matter to the Illinois Supreme Court , arguing in part that Illinois could lose access to the federal database .
The court refused to block the search .
The result : 903 pairs of profiles matching at nine or more loci in a database of about 220,000 .
State officials obtained a court order to prevent distribution of the results .
The Times obtained them from a scientist who works closely with the FBI .
A similar fight occurred in a death penalty case in Maryland during the summer and fall of 2006 .
The prosecutor saw a DNA match between a baseball cap at the crime scene and the suspect as so definitive that he did n't plan to tell the jury about the chance of a coincidental match , records show .
Seeking to cast doubt on the evidence , the defense persuaded the judge to order an " Arizona search " of the Maryland database .
The state did not comply .
After the defense filed a contempt - of - court motion , Michelle Groves , the state 's DNA administrator , argued in court and in an affidavit that , based on conversations with Callaghan , she believed the request was burdensome and possibly illegal .
According to Groves , Callaghan had told her that complying with the court order could lead Maryland to be disconnected from CODIS - a result Groves ' lawyer said would be catastrophic .
Groves ' affidavit was edited by FBI officials and the technology contractor that designed CODIS , court records show .
Before submitting the affidavit , Groves wrote the group an e-mail saying , " Let 's see if this will work , " court records show .
It did n't .
After Judge Steven Platt rejected her arguments , Groves returned to court , saying the search was too risky .
FBI officials had now warned her that it could corrupt the entire state database , something they would not help fix , she said .
Platt reaffirmed his earlier order , decrying Callaghan 's " unilateral " decision to block the search .
" The court will not accept the notion that the extent of a person 's due process rights hinges solely on whether some employee of the FBI chooses to authorize the use of the ( database ) software , " Platt wrote .
The search went ahead in January 2007 .
The system did not go down , nor was Maryland expelled from the system .
In a database of fewer than 30,000 profiles , 32 pairs matched at nine or more loci .
Three of those pairs were identical at 13 out of 13 loci .
Experts say they most likely are duplicates or belong to identical twins or brothers .
It 's also possible that one of the matches is between unrelated people - defying odds of 1 in 1 quadrillion .
Maryland officials never did the research to find out .
Each 250 ml can of Red Bull contains about 80mg of caffeine
The 15 - year - old , a pupil at Hummersknott Comprehensive School , suffered heart palpitations , according to paramedics .
He was treated at the Memorial Hospital following the 14 February incident , details of which have just emerged .
A Red Bull spokesman recommended only one to two cans of the energy drink for " optimum effect " .
' Weak coffee '
Each 250 ml can of Red Bull contains 80 mg of caffeine - the equivalent , says the company , to a weak cup of filter coffee .
The spokesman added : " Red Bull energy drink is a functional product which has been developed specifically for periods of mental or physical exertion .
" We have always recommended drinking one to two cans of Red Bull to have the optimum effect on performance in times of need . "
Red Bull has come under fire in the past for being linked with health problems .
Norway , France , Uruguay and Iceland have all banned the energy drink because of concerns over high levels of caffeine .
Nintendo of Europe ’s managing director of marketing Laurent Fischer was approached about the current storage situation on Wii at a recent NoE outing .
Fischer made a surprising and fairly insulting comment , expressing that “ ‘ otaku and geeks ” are the only types of Wii gamers who are cramming for a hard drive .

Due to the effects of global warming and deforestation , more than half of the Amazon rainforest may be destroyed or severely damaged by the year 2030 , according to a report released by the World Wildlife Fund ( WWF ) .
The report , " Amazon 's Vicious Cycles : Drought and Fire , " concludes that 55 percent of the world 's largest rainforest stands to be severely damaged from agriculture , drought , fire , logging and livestock ranching in the next 22 years .
Another 4 percent may be damaged by reduced rainfall caused by global warming .
This is anticipated to destroy up to 80 percent of wildlife habitat in the region .
By 2100 , the report adds , global warming may cause rainfall in the Amazon to drop by 20 percent and temperatures to increase by 2 degrees Celsius ( 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit ) .
This combination will increase the occurrence of forest fires , further accelerating the pace of deforestation .
The Amazon contains more than half of the planet 's surviving rainforest and is a key stabilizer of global climate .
The report notes that losing 60 percent of it would accelerate the pace of global warming , affecting rainfall as far away as India .
WWF warned that the " point of no return " for the Amazon rainforest , from which ecological recovery will be impossible , is only 15 - 25 years in the future , much sooner than has previously been supposed .
" The Amazon is on a knife - edge , " said WWF - UK forests head Beatrix Richards , " due to the dual threats of deforestation and climate change .
" She called for the countries discussing global climate change at an international conference in Bali to take the importance of forests into account .
" At the international negotiations currently underway in Bali , governments must agree a process which results in ambitious global emission reduction targets beyond the current phase of Kyoto , " she said .
" Crucially , this must include a strategy to reduce emissions from forests and help break the cycle of deforestation . "

Scientists have stopped the ageing process in an entire organ for the first time , a study released today says .
Published in today ’s online edition of Nature Medicine , researchers at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine at Yeshiva University in New York City also say the older organs function as well as they did when the host animal was younger .
The researchers , led by Associate Professor Ana Maria Cuervo , blocked the ageing process in mice livers by stopping the build - up of harmful proteins inside the organ ’s cells .
As people age their cells become less efficient at getting rid of damaged protein resulting in a build - up of toxic material that is especially pronounced in Alzheimer ’s , Parkinson ’s and other neurodegenerative disorders .
The researchers say the findings suggest that therapies for boosting protein clearance might help stave off some of the declines in function that accompanies old age .
In experiments , livers in genetically modified mice 22 to 26 months old , the equivalent of octogenarians in human years , cleaned blood as efficiently as those in animals a quarter their age .
By contrast , the livers of normal mice in a control group began to fail .
The benefits of restoring the cleaning mechanisms found inside all cells could extend far beyond a single organ , says Cuervo .
“ Our findings are particularly relevant for neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson ’s and Alzheimer ’s , ” she says .
HOUSTON , July 16 ( UPI ) -- HIV researchers at the University of Texas Medical School in Houston said they think they 've found the chink in armor of the virus linked to AIDS .
The vulnerable spot is hidden in a protein essential for the Human Immunodeficiency Virus , the virus that causes Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome , to attach to host cells , the university said in a release .

An HIV vaccine does n't exist because HIV is a mutating virus .
The scientists said they are focusing on a stretch of amino acids on HIV 's envelope protein gp120 .
" Unlike the changeable regions of its envelope , HIV needs at least one region that must remain constant to attach to cells .
If this region changes , HIV cannot infect cells , " said Sudhir Paul , a pathology professor at the UT Medical School .
Paul 's group engineered antibodies with enzymatic activity , called abzymes , that can attack the virus 's weakness .
" The abzymes recognize essentially all of the diverse HIV forms found across the world .
This solves the problem of HIV changeability , " Paul said .
" The next step is to confirm our theory in human clinical trials . "
The theory was in a recent issue of Autoimmunity Reviews and will be presented during the International AIDS Conference Aug. 3 - 8 in Mexico City .

I shudder to think how bad it is at Chrysler , now in the hands of private - equity investor Cerberus Capital , but note that Chrysler Financial could n't renew all of its $ 30 billion in short - term debt .
Now we see the results of the myopia that has afflicted Detroit auto executives .
These are the people who staked their companies ' futures on gas - guzzling , heavyweight ...

We are slowly getting more information about the FBI ’s lack of a case against Bruce Ivins .
When we first learned of his suicide , we were told that he was the anthrax killer .
Period .
Then we got a statement that there was some technology developed by the FBI for the purpose of this case .
Is this why nearly 7 years passed before an arrest was made ?
The full briefing was still skimpy on the details , and not very convincing .
But what we were told is that the anthrax was traced to a single flask that was in Bruce Ivins ' possession at Ft. Detrick .
Then , Science Magazine reported on a " close reading " of the four relevant paragraphs in the 25 - page written brief .
We now had a better idea of what exactly this new technology was , although the FBI refused press access to its staff scientists .
The surviving anthrax victims were recently briefed with four hours of " circumstantial , " but " compelling , " evidence .
Now the FBI scientists have given a briefing of their own , and they have given more details about the scientific evidence .
We still have n't heard anything convincing about Ivins ' guilt , but the case is closed .
So I guess that 's it .
( As an aside , we learn in this scientific briefing that the mailed anthrax was not processed with silicon , as originally reported by the FBI . )
Two things strike me about this forensic evidence .
Rather than make you read this whole column , I 'll skip to the good part — these two things combine to make it clear that the " single flask " evidence was an exaggeration , to put it kindly .
First , some background on the new technology .
The Ames strain of anthrax is a naturally - occurring strain of Anthrax that is being used in US biodefense research .
In order to identify a source of the mailed anthrax and differentiate it from Ames strain anthrax that is found in the wild or at any of the many labs that also conduct research on Ames strain anthrax , sophisticated forensic techniques were needed .
Very similar techniques have been used for things such as The Human Genome Project .
Indeed , the contractor used for the forensics is The Institute for Genomic Research — a leader in the field of genome sequencing .
Ultimately , as Science Magazine pointed out , the main innovation was combining the technologies to solve a crime .
Science Magazine also raised some technical questions about the data since they only had four paragraphs of explanation to work with .
I wo n't re-iterate those questions here , and focus instead on the question of whether the data , as they are reported , actually point to a single , unique flask .
The scientists compared the mailed anthrax to samples of anthrax that are used in research , specifically , those identified as being the Ames strain .
Each sample of anthrax could be classified as biologically identical or biologically non-identical to the mailed anthrax based on a sort of DNA fingerprint .
This is because the anthrax bacterium replicates asexually : a single cell duplicates its DNA and splits into two new cells which have identical DNA sequences to each other .
Thus , they are biologically identical .
We found out in the original written brief that the scientists tested more than 1000 samples from labs around the world .
This is presumably an exhaustive sampling of all known samples of Ames strain anthrax .
Problem # 1 : They could necessarily only test samples of Ames strain anthrax that they already knew existed .
What if there are samples of Ames strain anthrax that the scientists did not test because they did not know they existed ?
Aside from Saddam 's non-existent WMD anthrax research , I could easily imagine any number of other governments ( including our own ) with highly secretive bioweapons programs hiding this information from the FBI 's anthrax investigators .
All the FBI can say is that the flask in Ivins ’ possession is one possible source .
They ca n’t prove that it is the only source .
Problem # 2 : To allay these concerns , the FBI can claim that it is likely that it is the source since , out of 1000 samples tested , all of the ones that matched could be traced to Ivins ’ flask .
What ?!
More than one sample matched ?!
Yes — a total of 8 samples matched .
" B - but , b-but , they could all be traced to Ivins , " stutters the FBI .
We already know that Ivins was not the only person with access to " his " flask .
But now we learn that , in addition to the 100 other people who had access to Ivins ’ flask , there are at least 7 other people ( and probably many , many more ) who had access to anthrax that is biologically identical to the mailed anthrax .
These 7 other samples were not located at AMRIID .
So , although we were initially told by the FBI – parroting media that sophisticated scientific techniques could uniquely identify Ivins ’ flask as the smoking gun , we learn that even this flimsy piece of evidence is n’t true : there are 8 known smoking guns and a theoretically infinite number of unknown smoking guns .

The Best of Kathryn Muratore
Percentages might make news stories stand out , but without a connection to the human experience , can become meaningless .
Would n't it be good to have the mental agility to separate the wheat from the chaff ?
In his third lesson of a weekly series , author Michael Blastland gives some hints for percentages .
Lesson Three : Percentages
The story : Vitamin E can kill .
Supplements cause a 14 % increase in mortality , said the man on telly , standing in front of a huge " 14 % " , propped up on a number like the bar of the local .
The flaw : Funny , but was n't my risk of mortality quite high already ?
Like , 100 % ?
But no , it 's even worse than that .
Vitamin E supplements apparently make the end more than certain .
For death has become like a footballer , giving it 114 % out there today , Brian .
The lesson : Journalists and percentages mix like ball bearings in souffle .
They say their preference is for real life over boring , abstract figures .
Not with percentages , it 's not .
Often these digits become no more than that : digits , fetishised , but separate from human meaning and , in the case of risk , frequently reported only if they can be made to look big or scary .
We need to reconnect them with human experience .
Here are two ways .
First , we need to remember that not much in life is either / or .
According to the research , there 's something in the claim that Vitamin E supplements can be harmful .
But , as with the consumption of salt , or even water , much that can kill is also essential to good health .
The world does not divide easily into what 's toxic and what 's not , what 's safe and what is n't .
Risk is simply a way of measuring where we stand on the messy middle ground - which is almost everywhere .
A 100 % increase in the number of bullets in a revolver - if you are playing Russian roulette - well , that makes a difference
Lesson One : Surveys Lesson Two : Counting
What matters in that messy middle is the relevant human quantity : how much supplementary vitamin E ?
A little wo n't do any harm ( or , probably , much good ) .
A lot , especially if you are getting on in life , might .
So a 14 % increase in risk of death does mean something , but only if you say at what dose ( high ) , for which group ( the elderly ) , over what period ( a single year , not in a lifetime ) .
The second common problem with any percentage increase like this , also crying out for a dose of real life is : what 's it increased from ?
Because 14 % might be a lot if you start somewhere big , next to nothing if you start somewhere small .
A 100 % increase from one in a million becomes two in a million .
So what ?
A 100 % increase in the number of bullets in a revolver - if you are playing Russian roulette - well , that makes a difference .
How can supplements cause a 14 % increase in mortality ?
So let 's get human again and ask where we begin .
What is the risk of dying , this year , for a 75 - year - old man ?
And let 's keep percentages out of it , as far as we can .
The answer is that in every 100 men aged 75 , four or more will typically die in the next year .
If all 100 of them tuck heartily into Vitamin E , maybe five will .
That is , according to this research , there 'll be less than one ( actually 0.6 ) extra death per 100 people if all are on high doses of vitamin E .
At low doses , there 's almost no change .
That 's what 14 % turns out to mean : 0.6 of a death per 100 , or six deaths per 1,000 .
I wonder if a large daily dose of salt is any worse ?
For 60 - year - olds , the risk of death this year is so much smaller to begin with that even an extra 14 % risk ( from a high dose of Vitamin E ) makes almost no difference at all .
Junk rating : Four out of five .
There 's some salvation in the fact that this was part of a report on all kinds of teenage cancers , some of which are a real concern , but this was the one that had the attention .
Yet the human numbers are so small they might well be the result of nothing more than random variation .
A little context can make a lot of difference to a percentage .
Another simple example is the story that young Americans can't afford to move out and are all now stuck with the folks .
Since 1970 , when 12.5 million 18 - 34 year olds lived with their parents , the number has apparently risen by 48 % , to more than 18.6 million .
Except that the American population has also risen in that time - by about 32 % , or roughly 75 million people .
So , in figures easier to translate to real life , the number of 18 - 34 year olds still living with the folks has gone from a bit more than one in five to not quite one in four .
Still a real increase , but nothing like 48 % .
The biggest part ( though not all ) of the explanation for increasing numbers of Americans living with their parents is ... that there are increasing numbers of Americans .
Or take what it means to be 99.9 % effective .
In the NHS it might mean 135 botched operations and 13 babies given to the wrong parents , every week .
( Thanks to writer Anne Miller for that example ) .
A percentage is not really a number , it is a share .
The simple question to keep in mind is one that always strives to put it into a proper , human context : " A share of what ?
A share of a lot - or a share of a little ? "
Better still : " A share of who ? "
Keep it real .
Next week , Lesson Four : Averages Michael Blastland is the author , with Andrew Dilnot , of The Tiger That Is n't .

Excellent article .
I remember reading a short story in the Eighties where a computer selected a " Mr Average " from the electoral register , and everything that person said was taken as general public opinion .
And sometimes I wonder if we are n't getting very close to that situation now .
Steve Wehrle , Southampton , UK simple and clear .
The material each newsperson should keep at hand ...
Roman , Surbiton Brilliant - keep it coming !
The reporting of statistics , percentages and risks in the news is almost always the cause to groan as the presentations lack context and a sense of how this would meaningfully effect day to day life .
As a rule the larger the percentage the greater the need for context , usually as the base is very small , or the population is changing ... but that seldom makes a good story !
Charlie , London OK , you got me started .
Adverts for cosmetics , shampoos and skin treatments .
A fictional but representative example .
" A conditioner gives 80 % more shine . " small print " shampoo and our conditioner compared with shampoo alone .
more small print " 52 women responded " .
How is shine measured ????
Well , OF COURSE there is more shine !!!!
You have n't compared two of the same things .
52 ? Out of ( very conservatively ) 10 MILLION that wash their hair .
Statistically insignificant - meaningless .
So , a ' scientific ' measure that is not at all scientific .
And is therefore meaningless .
A comparison that has 2 variables and is therefore meaningless .
A TINY sample group whose response is therefore meaningless .
Sandy Fox , Derby , UK Quite right but I am afraid that you are just tilting at windmills as the population is innumerate from the top down .
It 's not just journalists but more importantly perhaps politicians who are unable to use numbers and you might care to note that the use of graphs and equations is banned from use in parliamentary debates , which I believe tends to explain the poor quality of decision making .

My favourite silly percentage is " washes 30 % brighter " 30 % brighter than what ?
Than washing you clothes with Mud for example ... that 's not much to brag about !
Jo Beale , Cambridge
My doctor recently told me that if I do n't reduce my cholesterol , I have a 20 % chance of having a heart attack in the next 10 years .
Sounds frightening !
Except , what she did n't tell me is what would my percentage chance be without reducing cholesterol ?
It is probably at least 10 % anyway ( aged 45 - 55 ) .
Plus , if I reverse it , I have an 80 % chance of NOT having a heart attack .
Do n't get me wrong , I am exercising , dieting and taking the pills .
I have never won anything and do n't want this to be my first win !
But it is interesting how random percentages ( I am sure she had checked her facts - did n't she ? ) can be used to frightening effect if you do n't think them through .
Great article Michael , by the way .
Nick , London UK
I once read that 25 % of smokers die early .
I was so pleased .
As a smoker myself , this logically means that I have a 75 % chance of living longer .
Fag anyone ?
( Fag=Cigarette for American readers )
James Rigby , Wickford , Essex I love this series of articles .
Very informative without being cynical .
I doubt many other media organisations would do this - their sensationalist headlines depend on big numbers !
Lee , London , UK
At last !
I 'm sick of hearing meaningless statistics on the news with absolutely no context and no means of providing insight .
Paul Daniel , Aberdeen I always like to see " 98 % fat - free " as a meaningless percentage on a food packet .
Surely something is fat - free or it is n't ?
At least " only 2 % fat " means something !
Stuart C , Cardiff , Wales 100 % of people surveyed said that this was a fascinating and true article .
Survey size 1 ( me )
Steve , Oxford Very good article .
I 'm going to tell my boss that I 'm going to give 110 % this week .
I was off sick yesterday , so maybe I should be giving 125 % for the rest of the week .
Or am I really giving only 80 % because I missed a day .
Now I 've confused myself .
That 's certainly going to knock a few percentage points off my performance now ;-)
I think I feel a sick day coming on ....
Colin Harrison , East Grinstead Remember also that the vitamin study was about huge doses of vitamins , many times more than you would ever find in ' supplements ' .
So the idea that taking supplements increases risk of death by any amount is completely bogus , as that is not what was studied .

What are these ?
Four Mexican army soldiers entered southern Arizona and pointed their rifles at a U.S. Border Patrol agent early this week , the Border Patrol said .
The incident Sunday was the Mexican military 's 43rd incursion across the U.S. border since October , the agency said .
However , it was unusual because firearms were involved .
The Border Patrol and the Mexican government are investigating , Border Patrol spokesman Mike Scioli said .
Details remain sketchy , but the incident occurred at 2 a.m. on the Tohono O'odham Indian Reservation about 50 miles southeast of Ajo .
The incident took place just north of the border in sight of the new border fence .
The soldiers held their weapons on the agent for several minutes until he identified himself in Spanish , whereupon they lowered their guns and walked back across a gap in the fence , Scioli said .
In Washington , D.C. , State Department spokesman Gonzalo Gallegos said the encounter " stemmed from a momentary misunderstanding as to the exact location of the U.S. - Mexican border . "
The Mexican army has told the Border Patrol it knew of an incident involving its soldiers , but it did not confirm the details .
In years past , the Border Patrol has arrested Mexican soldiers who crossed the border , then typically released them back to Mexico .

You have your fear , which might become reality ;
and then you have Godzilla , who is reality .
— from the movie “ Godzilla : King of the Monsters ”
As almost everyone knows by now , various major daily newspaper published , on July 10 , a photograph of four Iranian missiles streaking heavenward ; then Little Green Footballs ( significantly , a blog and not a daily newspaper ) provided evidence that the photograph had been faked .
Later , many of those same papers published a Whitman ’s sampler of retractions and apologies .
For me it raised a series of questions about images .
[ 1]
Do they provide illustration of a text or an idea of evidence of some underlying reality or both ?
And if they are evidence , do n’t we have to know that the evidence is reliable , that it can be trusted ?
Hany Farid , a Dartmouth professor and an expert on digital photography , has published a number of journal articles and a recent Scientific American article on digital photographic fraud .
He seemed to be a good person to start with .
If a photograph has been tampered with , he ’s the person to analyze how the tampering has been done .
I wanted to discuss with him the issue of the Iranian photograph starting with the issue of why we trust photographs in the first place .
HANY FARID :
The short answer is : I do n’t know .
The longer answer is : if you look at the neurological level , what ’s happening in our brain , roughly 30 to 50 percent of our brain is doing visual processing .
It ’s just processing the visual imagery that comes in , and if you think about it in terms of bandwidth , there is a remarkable amount of information entering into our eyes and being processed by the brain .
Now , the brain samples like a video camera , but 30 frames a second , high resolution , massive amounts of information .
Vision is a pretty unique sense for the brain .
It ’s incredibly powerful and is very valuable from an evolutionary point of view .
So it ’s not surprising that it has an emotional effect on us .
The Vietnam War , the war abroad and the war at home , has been reduced to a few iconic images — the Napalm girl , the girl at Kent State .
What seems to emerge from major events and eras are one or two images that effectively embody the emotion and rage , the happiness and anger .
The whole thing somehow is enfolded in there .
The brain is just very good at processing visual imageries and bringing in memories associated with images .
ERROL MORRIS : But text is often brought in visually as well .
HANY FARID : Sure , but processed in a different part of the brain .
So , yes , the visual system has to process it , but where it ’s actually being processed is not in the back of the brain where the visual processing is , it ’s on the side of the brain .
It ’s the language center , which is completely different .
And there are plenty of people out there , my girlfriend is a middle school teacher and she talks all the time about kids who are visual learners and kids who are language learners , and who are auditory .
So there ’s different ways of processing information .
But there ’s no doubt that it is remarkably powerful .
For example , when you put out a fake , like the Kerry / Fonda one .
[ 2 ]
And even like this missile one .
You start putting it out there and saying , “ Oh look , this picture ?
It ’s a fake .
This picture ?
It ’s a fake . ”
But you know what people remember ?
They do n’t remember , “ It ’s a fake . ”
They remember the picture .
And there are psychology studies , when you tell people that information is incorrect , they forget that it is incorrect .
They only remember the misinformation .
They forget the tag associated with it .
They did these great studies , especially with older people .
They give them information about health , Medicare , Medicaid , that kind of stuff .
And they say , “ this information that you heard ?
It ’s wrong . ”
And what ends up happening is , that information gets ingrained into their brains , and even if they are subsequently told it ’s wrong , they end up believing it . [ 3 ] [ 4 ]
ERROL MORRIS :
It occurred to me , just with respect to the missile photograph , that if the people who Photoshopped this photograph wanted to call additional attention to it , they could do no better than what they did .
HANY FARID : That ’s exactly right .
Look at how much attention is being brought to it .
At the end of the day , even though they doctored the photograph , it shows that these guys still fired three missiles , and they sure brought a lot of attention to it .
ERROL MORRIS : The threat remains .
What are we supposed to infer ?
It ’s a fake , so there is no need to worry ?
The real threat is only 75 percent of what we thought .
Three missiles instead of four .
HANY FARID :
It raises a whole other level of information warfare , right ?
You intentionally put things out there just to know that the controversy in and off itself will help you make your point .
ERROL MORRIS :
And since it is a version of chest thumping or saber rattling — whatever you want to call it — the thumping and the rattling linger on .
HANY FARID : Has there been a response from the Iranians ?
ERROL MORRIS : A variety of different responses — from bellicose to reassuring .
Ahmadinejad said that Iran had no intention of attacking Israel . [ 5 ]
HANY FARID : But no admission about doctoring the photograph ?
ERROL MORRIS : No .
Not that I ’m aware of .
But doctored photographs are the least of our worries .
If you want to trick someone with a photograph , there are lots of easy ways to do it .
You do n’t need Photoshop .
You do n’t need sophisticated digital photo - manipulation .
You do n’t need a computer .
All you need to do is change the caption .
[ The photographs presented by Colin Powell at the United Nations in 2003 provide several examples .
Photographs that were used to justify a war .
And yet , the actual photographs are low - res , muddy aerial surveillance photographs of buildings and vehicles on the ground in Iraq .
I ’m not an aerial intelligence expert .
I could be looking at anything .
It is the labels , the captions , and the surrounding text that turn the images from one thing into another . [ 6 ]
Powell was arguing that the Iraqis were doing something wrong , knew they were doing something wrong , and were trying to cover their tracks .
Later , it was revealed that the captions were wrong .
There was no evidence of chemical weapons and no evidence of concealment .
There is a larger point .
I do n’t know what these buildings were really used for .
I do n’t know whether they were used for chemical weapons at one time , and then transformed into something relatively innocuous , in order to hide the reality of what was going on from weapons inspectors .
But I do know that the yellow captions influence how we see the pictures .
“ Chemical Munitions Bunker ” is different from “ Empty Warehouse ” which is different from “ International House of Pancakes . ”
The image remains the same but we see it differently . [ 7 ]
Change the yellow labels , change the caption and you change the meaning of the photographs .
You do n’t need Photoshop .
That ’s the disturbing part .
Captions do the heavy lifting as far as deception is concerned .
The pictures merely provide the window - dressing .
The unending series of errors engendered by falsely captioned photographs are rarely remarked on .
– E.M. ]
HANY FARID :
You are absolutely right ; you do n’t need Photoshop to editorialize .
We can go back to Mao and Stalin and Castro and Mussolini , and all these guys .
All the dictators doctored photographs in order to effectively change history .
So why is this a big deal ?
Is it because of the power of visual imagery , the fact that it resonates so much ?
Maybe that will change with the next generation .
Maybe this new generation will be thinking about images differently .
There is a savviness about what technology can do .
Kids now are growing up in digital age where they routinely see doctored images in their mailboxes , in the media , on television , and so on and so forth .
ERROL MORRIS : But , as we become more and more sophisticated about images — about how images are processed — have n’t we become more sophisticated about detecting fraud ?
Photoshop manipulations are relatively easy to detect .
They fool the eye , but they do n’t necessarily fool the expert .
HANY FARID :
The answer is : yes and no .
It depends on the image source .
So , if we have the raw files [ 8 ] , if we have the original footage from someone ’s digital camera , you ca n’t fool us anymore .
We have enough technology today where , given the camera , the original images that came off the camera , we can tell if you ’ve manipulated them .
If , however , you are talking about an image that has been cropped and reduced and compressed and posted on the web , then we might be able to do it , but there ’s no guarantee .
The task is decidedly harder because a lot of information has been thrown away .
You ’ve compressed the image ; you ’ve resized it .
This is why all the Loch Ness monster and ghost images are always so tiny and grainy , because then you ca n’t see the signs of tampering .
With low - res images it ’s much harder to detect a fake .
Definitely , when we have a high - res original image , we are much better at it .
[ People often trust low - res images because they look more real .
But of course they are not more real , just easier to fake .
We look at picture of Nessie ( the Loch Ness Monster ) .
It ’s grainy , fuzzy .
It ’s hard to make anything out .
You never see a 10 - megapixel photograph of Big Foot or the Abominable Snowman or the Loch Ness Monster .
One explanation is : these monsters do n’t exist .
But if they did exist — so the thinking goes — they are probably unwilling to sit still for portraiture .
The grainy images are proof of how elusive Nessie can be .
This belief extends to documentary filmmaking , as well .
If it ’s badly shot , it ’s more authentic .
– E.M. ]
ERROL MORRIS : Well , finding evidence that someone has used the Photoshop clone - tool is relatively easy , is n’t it , if you have a raw file in front of you as a comparison ?
HANY FARID : Well , certainly if you have the original , but even without the original , we ’re actually pretty good at detecting cloning .
Now interestingly , in the Iranian missile image , I actually ran the clone detection software , and it did not detect it .
Here ’s the reason : they ’re not perfect clones .
They actually have been adjusted a little bit , and if you look carefully at the image , you will see this .
There are two things going on .
First of all , the image has been JPEG compressed , which changes the cloning a little bit , but we can still detect cloning in the present JPEG .
But what happened is it was altered after it was cloned .
Somebody went in and actually manipulated in small places to make it look less obvious .
The Iranian photograph was done much more carefully and much more subtly .
There were these four folds of smoke in the bottom right hand corner in one of the plumes .
If they had actually adjusted that a little bit , which is what I do when I clone , people would n’t have seen it .
That makes the fake even more impressive , because it was n’t just copy , paste .
We would have detected that .
And frankly , if we did n’t have the photo with the third missile not launching , and somebody asked me what do you think , I would have said , “ Well , I think it ’s suspicious , but I ’m not sure . ”
ERROL MORRIS : But here ’s a question .
First , there was one picture .
Then there were two .
When did the second picture become available ?
Did the Iranians post both photographs , the cloned and the uncloned original ?
If I ’m interested in deceiving you , and I have produced an altered photograph B based on photograph A , which has not been cloned , do n’t I suppress A ? Do n’t I suppress the unaltered photograph ?
HANY FARID : I do n’t know where it [ the three - missile photograph ] came from . [ 9 ]
Maybe there was just another photographer there .
And if you look , it is not the original photograph that was manipulated .
The photo with three missiles was taken just before , and from a slightly different vantage point .
So I think what was happening was that there was another photographer and that image got released also , and that ’s how we know that the third missile misfired .
By the way , it ’s not obvious , although everybody ’s saying it is , that this is only a clone job .
It could ’ve been that that fourth missile fired , just at a later time , so that they tested it afterwards .
It fired , they took a picture of it , and then they composited it , as opposed to cloned it , into the original picture .
That also would explain why they ’re not exact copies of each other .
So I ’m not exactly sure what happened .
ERROL MORRIS :
If you believe that it could not have been simple cloning , or they went in and they altered a pixel here and there , to muddy the waters , can you really say that with certainty ?
HANY FARID :
The reason why we ’re sure it was tampered with is because we have that other photograph .
That ’s why we know , right ?
That ’s what really locks it in .
ERROL MORRIS : But how do you know that that other photograph has n’t been altered ?
HANY FARID : That ’s a fair question .
How do we know that that one ’s not fake , as well ?
ERROL MORRIS : Yes .
There ’s a remarkable story about the forging of the Hitler diaries .
The forger was so prolific , he created so many forgeries — letters , watercolors , diaries , etc. — that handwriting analysts ( charged with the task of authenticating the diaries ) took writing examples done by the forger thinking they were genuine examples of Hitler ’s handwriting and compared them to the diaries .
They authenticated the diaries on that basis . [ 10 ]
Often we make a comparison between something that we believe is real and something that we believe is fake .
I guess the moral of the story is we should always consider the possibility that we may be comparing something fake with something else that is fake .
HANY FARID :
It ’s sort of like Rembrandt , right ?
His body of work has been shrinking for decades now , right ?
And so what ’s considered to be his body of work is completely different now , cause he was faked so heavily .
It ’s a good question .
The reason why we believe that the one with the four missiles is fake is that there is pretty strong , at least circumstantial , evidence that the cloning was there .
The plumes of smoke look very , very similar .
There are a lot of little pieces .
But also , when you clone with a standard clone tool , there ’s like a soft cloning , so it does a little bit of like alpha matting , so that it ’s not a hard edge .
And you see along the rocks , there ’s definitely some funny business going on .
Again , visually it ’s not a certainty .
But it certainly looks more suspicious .
ERROL MORRIS : But when we see something suspicious , are n’t we asking also asking the questions :
What are they up to ?
Why are they doing this ?
Why are there three missiles in one photograph and four in another ?
What is going on here ?
What were they thinking ?
The simple answer :
If my desire is to present a bellicose posture to the West , fine , clone a couple of those missiles .
We know it ’s a fake .
But what are we supposed to infer from the photograph ?
Is it that these Iranians are so unscrupulous they will stop at nothing ?

Looking at photography critically is also very much part of the agenda of Little Green Footballs .
I spoke with Charles Johnson , who created and manages the Web site , about the role that he has played in uncovering several photographic frauds .
He originated the term “ fauxtography ” and is something of a gadfly .
His method is often visual , using elegant visual comparisons — jumping back in forth between two images to highlight the similarity of certain details .
He has used this technique to challenge the authenticity of the Killian documents [ 11 ] , as well as several fauxtrographs from Lebanon and Iran . [ 12 ]
ERROL MORRIS : How did the controversy start ?
CHARLES JOHNSON : Someone emailed me and said , “ Go look at this photograph . ”
He said , “ This looks like there really are n’t four missiles here . ”
So I took a look at the photo , and there it was , repeating patterns in the smoke .
[ In Little Green Footballs , Charles Johnson graphically explains the similarities between specific areas of the fauxtograph . ] [ 13 ]
ERROL MORRIS : Did you subject it to any kind of test ?
CHARLES JOHNSON : Well , you can take the image into Photoshop and exaggerate the contrast , or do some other kinds of manipulations .
That can show you where areas were cut and pasted .
There is no need to really put it under the microscope when it ’s staring you in the face .
ERROL MORRIS : What I find puzzling about it is they now have shown two different photographs .
The photograph pre-Photoshop , and then of course the other one post -Photoshop .
CHARLES JOHNSON :
The pre-Photoshop shows that one of the missiles did n’t launch .
ERROL MORRIS : Yes .
But if you wanted to put out a fake story why would you release both photographs ?
CHARLES JOHNSON :
It ’s an odd thing , is n’t it ?
You could really go down the rabbit hole with that .
You can start concocting different theories , like maybe they wanted it to be discovered .
But , I ’ve learned that you should never attribute to cleverness what can be easily explained by stupidity .
And I think there ’s a lot of stupidity in those organizations .
It ’s not really surprising that one hand might not know what the other was doing .
They all came from Iran , I know that much .
If I check it out , I think it was Sepah .
The L.A. Times on their front page actually credit it to the Revolutionary Guard .
I thought that was pretty ironic .
ERROL MORRIS : Ironic ?
CHARLES JOHNSON : Well , it ’s just very odd to see a photo on the cover of a major American newspaper that ’s credited to one of our sworn mortal enemies .
And I do n’t think I ’m the only one who finds that a bit disturbing .
ERROL MORRIS : I guess the attribution tells you you ’re looking at a genuine Iranian photograph — the photograph really came from Iran — not that the photograph itself is genuine .
CHARLES JOHNSON :
It ’s important for a totalitarian regime to maintain control over information .
And when they have a failure and it ’s supposed to be one of their glorious weapons demonstrations , they want to cover it up .
That ’s the easiest and simplest explanation .
ERROL MORRIS : That seems entirely reasonable .
They want us to be impressed with the military might of Iran .
With their capacity to retaliate .
It says visually : if attacked , we are going to annihilate you .
CHARLES JOHNSON : Which is apparently what most of the editors of major newspapers in America thought .
Because they ran it on their front pages .
ERROL MORRIS : Do you think that ’s their reasoning ?
CHARLES JOHNSON : No , I think their reasoning is it was a sexy picture .
That ’s what I think .
I do n’t think it has anything to do with ideology .
ERROL MORRIS :
It just looks good ?
CHARLES JOHNSON : Right .
ERROL MORRIS : But it does convey , on some very basic level , military might even though you do n’t really know what the payload is .
You do n’t know what the range is .
You do n’t know anything about the missiles .
You just know that there are four of them , and they ’re streaking into the sky .
And presumably they ’re heading west .
But even in exposing the fraud , we ’re still left with the missiles , no ?
CHARLES JOHNSON : Right .
They were real missiles , yes .
ERROL MORRIS : Well , we presume they ’re real missiles .
CHARLES JOHNSON : As far as we know .
ERROL MORRIS : As far as we know .
So why is it so important to expose this kind of fraud ?
CHARLES JOHNSON : Well , one reason is because I do n’t think you should ever not expose fraud .
When you see a photo that ’s been faked , and it ’s on the cover of newspapers , and it came from a regime that ’s our enemy , you ’ve got to expose that , if you see it .
ERROL MORRIS : Does this fraud in any way change your view of the government of Iran ?
CHARLES JOHNSON : Probably not my view , but it might change other people ’s views .
* * *
Charles Johnson ’s term “ fauxtography , ” of course , suggests that there is something “ true ” about photography , at least photography that is n’t posed or Photoshopped .
And in recent years , the mainstream press has embraced this orthodox view .
The principle is straightforward .
Zero tolerance .
Allow no digital manipulation .
No posing .
If a photographer uses any one of a variety of Photoshop tools , fire him .
It ’s not that I disagree with these rules .
I do n’t , but the development of Photoshop ( 1 ) can heighten our awareness of how a photograph can be manipulated , and ( 2 ) may inure us to all the other ways in which an image ’s relationship to truth can be compromised .
It allows the false assumption : if we can just determine that this photograph was n’t Photoshopped , then it must be “ true . ” [
14 ]
But Photoshop serves as a reminder to us of something that we should have known all along : photographs can deceive .
The presumption behind a photograph is : “ Someone saw this . ”
It is supposedly presenting something that someone saw and wished for someone else to see .
What is it that angers us ?
Charles Johnson has it right .
We are angered because we have been the victims of fraud .
We have been tricked .
In essence , we have been lied to .
The problem is not that the photograph has been manipulated , but that we have been manipulated by the photograph .
Photoshop is not the culprit .
It is the intention to deceive . [ 15 ]
Of course , the manipulation of photographs is nothing new .
It is as old as photography itself .
And there are manipulated photographs that make no attempt to deceive .
John Heartfield , one of the creators of photomontage in the 1920’s and 30’s ( along with other representatives of Dada — Ernst , Hoch and Hausmann ) , employed the motto : “ Use Photography as a Weapon . ”
And sure enough , he juxtaposed familiar photographic images to create a bleak picture of Europe on the verge of war .
( The picture at left appeared in Prague on June 29 , 1938 .
By the end of September the Munich Agreement was signed and the Sudetenland ceded to Hitler . )
Text , particularly ironic text , was an essential element of almost all of Heartfield ’s pictures .
Here it reads : “ This is the Salvation They Bring . ”
Heartfield changed his name from Helmut Herzfeld because of his pacifist sympathies .
After World War I , he no longer wished to see himself as German .
Herzfeld , who was five - foot - two , used photomontage to take on the Third Reich .
He fled Berlin in April 1933 , just a step ahead of the Gestapo and went to Prague where he continued to work for almost six years .
In December , 1938 Germany was demanding Heartfield ’s extradition and just ahead of the Gestapo , he fled to London , where he remained for the rest of the war . [ 16 ]
Heartfield was asked in 1967 , the year before he died , how he got the idea of photomontage .
He replied , “ I started making photomontages during the First World War .
There are a lot of things that got me into working with photos .
The main thing is that I saw both what was being said and not being said with photos in the newspapers …
I found out how you can fool people with photos , really fool them …
You can lie and tell the truth by putting the wrong title or wrong captions under them , and that ’s roughly what was being done … ” [ 17 ]
He had become convinced that photographs were being used to sell a war that had already been lost .
For Heartfield , lurking around every image is manipulation .
The very real possibility that images can and will be used as propaganda even though no ( chemical or digital ) manipulation is involved .
Heartfield , in one of his most powerful images ( from 1930 ) , uses photomontage to challenge images and words .
The text accompanying the image [ 18 ] states : “ Whoever reads bourgeois newspapers becomes blind and deaf .
Away with these stultifying bandages . ”
Heartfield ’s point is that we should be suspicious of what we see and what we read — of what we are told .
The essence of his art is an attempt to take images — usurp them and use them to tell a different story .
He is asking us to think of images as images — to think of them ironically — and to make connections where connections were not made before .
It is not so much expropriation of images ­— to use a term that is currently fashionable — as a repurposing of them .
A similar thing is happening today .
Pop culture parodies of the Four - Missile Photograph emerged almost at once .
The blog Boing Boing sponsored a contest : “ Iran : You Suck at Photoshop ” and posted several of the winners . [ 19 ]
The Iranian - Godzilla image might be my favorite , if only because it raises the specter of atomic disaster .
Was n’t Godzilla ( according to the narrative ) accidentally awakened and mutated by the atomic bomb ?
The image ridicules the Iranians but at the same time reminds us of the possibility of an apocalypse in the Middle East ?
The possibility of World War III ?
Other blog postings include cartoon characters and others kinds of clones .
Uncle Sam clutching one missile and looking reprovingly at the Photoshopped missile , as if to say , “ You wo n’t get away with this . ”
A cloned storm - trooper army of rampaging Ahmadinejads .
For me , Godzilla and Wile E. Coyote are in the spirit of Heartfield .
The intention is not just to ridicule , but to make us think .
Godzilla , emerging from the smoke of three rockets , reminds us of the danger of nuclear war .
And Wile E. Coyote , reminds us of our vulnerability .
Did he order his shield from the Acme Anti-Ballistic Shield Corporation ?
Here he is , holding his pathetic orange umbrella as the world devolves into nuclear war — another scheme to catch the Roadrunner gone horribly awry .
Are we all Wile E. Coyotes ?
After Godzilla was first introduced to the public , there were some questions about whether Godzilla was a good monster or a bad monster .
Sure , he crushed people and created havoc in Tokyo , but did he have bad intentions ?
Several additional movies were needed in order to clarify this and other questions about his motivations .
New monsters were proposed , vetted and movie projects built around them .
First , Rodan , then Mothra .
If Godzilla was n’t so bad , who or what was worse ?
The answer was soon forthcoming .
Ghidrah ( sometimes spelled Ghidorah [ 20 ] ) , a particularly nasty three - headed monster , was introduced and revealed to be Godzilla ’s mortal enemy .
A new axis of evil .
Monsters fighting other monsters .
Presumably , we can’t even create fictional monsters without dividing them into good and evil .
Clearly , we are fascinated by the spectacle of a war fought by the monsters we conjure in our minds .
In the film Ghidrah : King of the Monsters , it is revealed that Godzilla is a good guy , not a villain — his hatred of humans is the product of a series of unprovoked attacks by humans against him .
We should remember that the power of photographs comes not only from their ability to copy reality , but also to alter reality .
Photographs can be used — to borrow Heartfield ’s phrase — as weapons .
They can be used to warn us about the dangers of impending war .
They can also be used to ratchet up the blind forces of rage and unreason that drag us into conflict .

[ 1 ] The images have been discussed in The Lede .

We believe things that we have been told are false .
We also “ remember ” things that never happened to us .
An image can make us think that we were present at events that we have no direct experience of .
When natural selection put our brains together , was there a set of pigeon - holes for information , e.g. , this piece of information came from The National Enquirer , this other piece of information came from The New York Times , this third piece of information came from direct experience .
Of course , we try to assess the reliability of information , but with the swirl of information around us , there if often little opportunity to sort it into reliable , less reliable and totally unreliable information .
It ’s just a sodden mass of information .
Years ago , I was watching “ Six O’Clock News , ” a documentary film by Ross McElwee .
In the movie , there is a scene of a television crew shooting ‘ Baywatch ’ from the Santa Monica pier .
A year later I was standing on the Santa Monica Pier telling a producer , “ The last time I was here I watched a television crew shooting ‘ Baywatch . ’ ”
The producer said , “ No , you were n’t .
You were watching Ross McElwee ’s film ‘ Six O’Clock News . ’ ” Of course , the producer was correct .
I was confused .
I had confabulated the experience of seeing something in a movie with real life .
Supposedly , Ronald Reagan often made this mistake , but how can you really remember which experiences were first - hand , which were seen in a movie ?
Or appeared on television or in a magazine ?
[ 4 ]
Freeman Dyson tells a story ( in The New York Review of Books ) about a childhood experience :
“ When I was a boy in England long ago , people who traveled on trains with dogs had to pay for a dog ticket .
The question arose whether I needed to buy a dog ticket when I was traveling with a tortoise .
The conductor on the train gave me the answer : ‘ Cats is dogs and rabbits is dogs but tortoises is insects and travel free according . ’”
Nicholas Humphrey in a letter to the editors pointed out that “ the very same encounter appeared as a cartoon in Punch in 1869 .
The caption of the cartoon reads :
Railway Porter ( to Old Lady traveling with a Menagerie of Pets ) .
“ ‘ STATION MASTER SAY , MUM , AS CATS IS ‘ DOGS , ’ AND RABBITS IS ‘ DOGS , ’ AND SO ’S PARROTS ; BUT THIS ‘ERE ‘ TORTIS ’ IS A INSECT , SO THERE AIN ’T NO CHARGE FOR IT ! ” [ Punch , 1869 , Vol. 57 , p. 96 ] ”
Freeman Dyson replied :
“ Thanks to Nicholas Humphrey and Michael Jackson for letters informing me of the 1869 Punch cartoon about tortoises and dogs on trains .
My memory of traveling with a tortoise has two possible explanations .
The first and more probable is that I heard of the conversation recorded in the Punch cartoon and transformed it over the years into a memory .
This would not be the first time that I remembered something that never happened .
Memories of childhood recollected in old age are notoriously unreliable .
The second possible explanation is that the memory is accurate .
In that case the conductor on the train knew the cartoon and said what he was supposed to say according to the script . ”
Here , Dyson essentially admits to having confabulated seeing a Punch cartoon with a real experience .
My friend Charles Silver has provided a thoughtful analysis .
“ Here are several ( overlapping ) definitions for ‘ confabulation ’ : inventing things that are n’t true ; making up something that ’s thought to be true for a variety of reasons , one being to fill in memory gaps ; inventing something that ’s hoped to be true ; imagining that something happened to you after hearing a report or reading a story about someone else ; manufacturing , deliberately or not , a portion of reality ; arriving at a fabricated story ; and just plain lying . ”

That Iran is interested in projecting a bellicose posture to Israel and the West is hardly arguable .
Globalsecurity.org has published a series of Iranian press releases .
This one might be called “ The Regretful Response , ” but more appropriately , it could be called , “ The Not - So Regretful Threat . ”
IRNA – Islamic Republic News Agency
Tehran , July 11 , IRNA – Iran - Prayers - Kashani — Substitute Friday prayers leader of Tehran Ayatollah Mohammad Emami Kashani said Friday that the Islamic Republic of Iran is not a threat but will give a regretful response to possible invasions . “…
So , Iran is not a threat .
That ’s what regional and even western states have said .
They say Iran is ready for talks .
Do n’t raise hue and cry against Iran .
Oh !
The world ’s liars !
Oh the liar Israel !
Oh the liar White House !
If you wish to attack Iran , we will give you a response that will make you regretful , ” said Ayatollah Kashani in his second Friday prayers sermon . ”

The Times a year later ruefully admitted that the “ intelligence ” was in error .
“ According to the interviews conducted by The New York Times , the administration ’s argument that Iraq was producing biological weapons was based almost entirely on human intelligence of unknown reliability .
When mobile trailers were found by American troops , the White House and C.I.A. rushed out a white paper reporting that the vehicles were used to make biological agents .
But later , an overwhelming majority of intelligence analysts concluded the vehicles were used to manufacture hydrogen for weather balloons or possibly to produce rocket fuel … ” Powell ’s Case , a Year Later : Gaps in Picture of Iraq Arms , by Douglas Jehl and David E. Sanger , The New York Times , Feb. 1 , 2004 .
[ 7 ] Powell ’s words before the United Nations provide little justification beyond various appeals to authority :
“ Let me say a word about satellite images before I show a couple .
The photos that I am about to show you are sometimes hard for the average person to interpret , hard for me .
The painstaking work of photo analysis takes experts with years and years of experience , poring for hours and hours over light tables .
But as I show you these images , I will try to capture and explain what they mean , what they indicate , to our imagery specialists .
Let ’s look at one .
This one is about a weapons munitions facility , a facility that holds ammunition at a place called Taji .
This is one of about 65 such facilities in Iraq .
We know that this one has housed chemical munitions .
In fact , this is where the Iraqis recently came up with the additional four chemical weapons shells …
Let me give you a closer look .
Look at the image on the left .
On the left is a close - up of one of the four chemical bunkers .
The two arrows indicate the presence of sure signs that the bunkers are storing chemical munitions .
The arrow at the top that says ‘ security ’ points to a facility that is a signature item for this kind of bunker .
Inside that facility are special guards and special equipment to monitor any leakage that might come out of the bunker .
The truck you also see is a signature item .
It ’s a decontamination vehicle in case something goes wrong .
This is characteristic of those four bunkers .
The special security facility and the decontamination vehicle will be in the area , if not at any one of them or one of the other , it is moving around those four and it moves as needed to move as people are working in the different bunkers . ”

Pictured : The South African who keeps his car ssssafe by placing two pythons on his dashboard
Forget immobilizers , trackers and alarms – this is car security South African style .
A car owner in Durban has found a way of combating spiralling vehicle crime : leave two deadly pythons on the dashboard .
The giant reptiles slither round inside his Audi TT while their faith healer owner , Dr Mbuso Makhathini , visits customers .
Sssstay away : Tiny and Naughty the pythons guard their owner 's car
Named Tiny and Naughty , the male snakes have become something of a tourist attraction in the coastal city with onlookers keeping a cautious distance .
Both are African Rock Pythons with four - and - a - half - year - old Tiny measuring an impressive 12ft and Naughty , three , not far behind at 10ft .
Dr Makhathini , 37 , who runs a traditional African healing clinic like his grandfather , says the snakes are pets as well as guards .
' I take them around with me but no one has dared break into my car .
They come up and look but do n’t get too close .
They can sense if someone is unfriendly and they hiss and start coiling .
' But with me and people they like , they are very friendly .
They have a cage at home but we let them travel about and we often wake up with them in our bed in the morning , ' said Zulu Dr Makhatini who is married with two young boys .
The snakes each eat a dead rabbit once a week and the doctor said he ensures they have enough water .
However the local Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals is not impressed .
Senior inspector Dougie du Plessis said he had been trying to locate the owner to check he had a permit for the African Rock Pythons which can grow up to 16ft and kill their prey by crushing them to death .
Mr du Plessis said : ' We are concerned for the snakes ’ welfare .
He should n’t be keeping them in his car all day because they can dehydrate , particularly in Durban where it gets so hot and humid .
' We ’ve tried to get in touch with him but it ’s proving a little difficult .
This is unacceptable behaviour .'
There were 82,000 hijackings and car thefts in South Africa last year .
Drivers are often targeted at traffic lights or pulling into their properties by thieves who work in gangs and are armed .
A number of days ago , on a website of a particularly enlightened economist , I came across an excerpt from a speech given by Sen. Robert F. Kennedy on March 18 , 1968 , at the University of Kansas .
He was on the campaign trail in the US 1968 presidential race , and that context makes these words even more amazing .
Less than three months later , he was shot and killed in California .
Embedded above is a video montage with words from the speech , and the text follows below .
" We will find neither national purpose nor personal satisfaction in a mere continuation of economic progress , in an endless amassing of worldly goods .
We cannot measure national spirit by the Dow Jones Average , nor national achievement by the Gross National Product .
For the Gross National Product includes air pollution , and ambulances to clear our highways from carnage .
It counts special locks for our doors and jails for the people who break them .
The Gross National Product includes the destruction of the redwoods and the death of Lake Superior .
It grows with the production of napalm and missles and nuclear warheads ....
It includes ... the broadcasting of television programs which glorify violence to sell goods to our children .
" And if the Gross National Product includes all this , there is much that it does not comprehend .
It does not allow for the health of our families , the quality of their education , or the joy of their play .
It is indifferent to the decency of our factories and the safety of our streets alike .
It does not include the beauty of our poetry , or the strength of our marriages , the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials ... the Gross National Product measures neither our wit nor our courage , neither our wisdom nor our learning , neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country .
It measures everything , in short , except that which makes life worthwhile , and it can tell us everything about America -- except whether we are proud to be Americans . "
Amongst those who acknowledge the reality of Peak Oil , a number believe that we can continue ( perhaps after a brief pause ) to increase the energy input into the economy .
Given the amount of solar energy available , this is certainly a theoretical possibility .
Others believe that , while energy use might decrease , economic growth can continue because of efficiency gains and changes in the nature of the economy ( from industrial to information ) .
Data such as that shown below lend credence to this idea :
There are two flaws in this line of reasoning , the first being that this is data only for the US .
Much of what is now consumed in the US is now manufactured in Asia .
Thus , the energy consumption associated with that manufacturing does n't show up on the US balance sheet .
The second flaw is the assumption that GDP ( Gross Domestic Product ) , while being a measure of economic activity , accurately reflects the worth of the economy for the humans which take part in it .
It certainly includes a number of things which provide questionable benefits for society .
In any event , Bobby Kennedy was shot and killed , my father voted for Nixon , and the rest is history .
Another speech by RFK , as read by his brother Ted , is presented below .
Finally , here in three parts is the speech given by RFK just before he was killed .
Those who are still emotionally affected by this tragedy , as I discovered that I am ( despite being only ten years of age when it happened ) , might stop watching when he concludes his victory speech .
Joe found this little tidbit in an article earlier today :
Mr. McCain plans to go to Jackson , Miss. , which is inland , with his wife , Cindy , and his newly - selected running mate , Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska , his campaign said .
Mr. McCain will take only a small pool of reporters , and will tour a hurricane center with Gov. Haley Barbour , the Mississippi governor .
Why did he take any ?
Would he take reporters to a funeral ?
No .
Why take reporters on a trip that supposedly is n’t political ?
A trip to a national disaster ?
And the fact that McCain is only taking a “ small pool of reporters ” means that McCain has control over how many reporters he takes – McCain CHOSE to take this small pool .
That means he could have chosen to take no reporters at all .
And , guess who was chosen to be in that “ small pool ” ?
Carl Cameron from FOX , of course .
When Barack Obama had planned to visit injured troops in Germany , he was n’t going to bring any reporters at all .
Obama canceled his trip to visit the troops because the Bush - McCain Pentagon tried to claim that the trip was political theater .
But John McCain apparently is n’t beyond political theater .
The media needs to ask John McCain why he is bringing reporters with him on a trip to this looming disaster .
It looks an awful lot like McCain is trying to take political advantage of human suffering .
Though I guess it ’s a step up from sharing a birthday cake with George Bush .
Here 's mud in your eye : Pigs raised without antibiotics in an effort to placate consumer fears over those chemicals carry more bacteria and parasites , which of course consumers fear in the wake of the tomato scare and beef , chicken and spinach contaminations of days gone by .
At least this is the conclusion of a study funded by the National Pork Board .
A comparison of pigs raised outdoors without antibiotics and swine reared in conventional pork production settings revealed that antibiotic - free creatures had higher rates of three food - borne pathogens compared with pigs on conventional farms , which remain indoors and receive preventive doses of antimicrobial drugs .
“ Animal - friendly , outdoor farms tend to have a higher occurrence of Salmonella , as well as higher rates of parasitic disease , ” said lead study author Wondwossen Gebreyes , associate professor of veterinary preventive medicine at Ohio State University .
Antibiotics are fed to pigs to prevent them from getting sick in enclosed environments .
But for the most part , the pigs could probably care less :
The pathogens generally do not cause illness in the animals .
The scientists tested the blood of pigs on farms in North Carolina , Ohio and Wisconsin .
Of the total studied , 324 were raised in antibiotic - free systems and 292 lived in indoor farms .
Nearly 7 percent of antibiotic - free pigs were infected with Toxoplasma gondii , compared to 1.1 percent of the conventional pigs .
Most people with a functioning immune system can resist symptoms associated with infection by Toxoplasma , which is considered most risky for pregnant women and those with compromised immune systems .
Salmonella was common in both groups : 39 percent of the conventional pigs were infected with it and 54 percent of the no-antibiotic swine had it .
It seems this is a lose - lose situation .
“ The advantage of using antibiotics is to prevent these infections from occurring .
The disadvantage is it appears to create a favorable environment for strains of the bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics , ” Gebreyes said .
“ On the other hand , when antibiotics are not used , the pigs tend to get less resistant bugs , but higher rates of the common bacteria of food safety concern . "
Of the three pathogens studied , the positive tests for the Trichinella roundworm surprised researchers the most .
Gebreyes said federal inspectors might expect to find one positive test for the parasite among more than 14,000 pigs , so the two positive tests among 600 antibiotic - free pigs were significant .
The infection resulting from this parasite , trichinellosis , has historically been associated with undercooked pork , but in the recent past , the parasite has been associated mostly with wild mammals .
People with this infection typically experience diarrhea , vomiting , fatigue and fever first , followed by headaches , cough , and aching joints and muscle pains .
The symptoms can last for months , and severe cases can be fatal , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
As long as pork is cooked thoroughly according to federal guidelines , the presence of these infectious agents in food animals should pose no risk to human health , the university notes in a statement .
The U.S. Department of Agriculture recommends that consumers cook fresh pork to an internal temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit .
The study is published in a recent issue of the journal Foodborne Pathogens and Disease .
The Death of Google 's Patents ( Patently - O )
If the PTO 's test is followed , the crucial question for the vitality of patents on computer implemented inventions is whether a general purpose computer qualifies as a ' particular ' machine within the meaning of the agency 's test .
In two recent decisions announced after the oral arguments in the Bilski case , Ex parte Langemyr ( May 28 , 2008 ) and Ex parte Wasynczuk ( June 2 , 2008 ) , the PTO Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences has now supplied an answer to that question : A general purpose computer is not a particular machine , and thus innovative software processes are unpatentable if they are tied only to a general purpose computer .
The Patently - O weblog has a detailed look at a couple of US Patent and Trade Office rulings which could change the software patent game significantly . " " ( Thanks to Duncan ) .

Bilal Hussein was seized in 2006
Iraqi judges have ordered the " immediate " release of an Associated Press news photographer who has been held by the US military for two years .
Bilal Hussein was detained on suspicion of helping Iraqi insurgents , but the panel dismissed the accusations .
The ruling said his case fell under a new amnesty law and ordered Iraqi courts to " cease legal proceedings " .
AP president Tom Curley has said officials must " finally do the right thing " and free Mr Hussein .
AP says Mr Hussein was taken into custody in April 2006 after sheltering strangers in his home following an explosion near his home in Falluja .
Mr Hussein , an Iraqi , has been in US military custody every since .

The four judges said Mr Hussein should be " immediately " released if no other charges were pending .
In November last year , the US military said it would recommend criminal charges against Mr Hussein .
The case was then passed to Iraqi judges who had to decide if he should be tried .
At the time , Mr Curley told the BBC he believed the US military simply wished to keep Mr Hussein in jail as long as possible .
He said the US did not want news coming out of Anbar province , which he called an " information black hole " .
Mr Hussein was part of an AP photo team that won a Pulitzer Prize in 2005 .
US officials say he had aroused suspicion because he was often at the scene of insurgent attacks as they occurred .
The US military has previously said Mr Hussein was detained for possessing materials for making roadside bombs , insurgent propaganda and a surveillance photo of a US military installation .
To build hype for the release of his big X - Files sequel , show creator Chris Carter picked the best eight episodes for a special DVD release highlighting the show ’s history .
If that set had been expanded to nine episodes — with room for one more of the most entertaining and effective tales from the adventures of Mulder and Scully — Carter ’s new big - screen entry , The X - Files : I Want to Believe , would n’t have made the list .
This follow - up to The X - Files : Fight the Future is , in essence , a two - hour episode of the original series .
Unfortunately , it ’s not a particularly compelling episode , offering too few thrills to feed a feature - length adventure and filling the time with stilted debates and a still - murky love story between the series ’ iconic pair of leads , David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson .
( Spoiler alert : Minor plot points follow . )
To his credit , Carter stays away from the elaborate uber - conspiracy that drove the later seasons of the series and the original film a decade ago .
In fact , the narrative of I Want to Believe , which opens Friday , takes a page from its lead characters — deliberately staying clear of past FBI transgressions and complications .
Mulder and Scully have moved on from their badge - carrying days : Scully embraced her career as a physician in a Catholic children ’s hospital , while Mulder drifted into bearded Unabomber mode — hiding from the feds while maintaining his clip files of bizarre events .
They ’re called out of retirement when a female FBI agent turns up missing out in the sticks .
A disgraced pedophile priest ( played with repressed self - loathing by Scottish stand - up Billy Connolly ) is reporting visions of the missing woman ’s fate , and Hoover ’s folks need a reluctant Mulder to make sense of it all .
Connolly ’s performance as a suffering , fallen soul who makes no denial of his downfall is an unexpected treat .
If we were dealing with an hour - long episode of the old show , all that set - up would be knocked down before the first commercial break .
On the big screen , it takes in excess of 30 minutes , and the film feels the weight of every second .
By the time Mulder is elbow - deep in the snowy search for another missing woman and the disappointingly anonymous villains are hard at work on their Jamie Gumm - esque body harvesting , we do n’t want to believe — we just want the movie to get on with it already .
As the investigation trudges through the wintry sludge , Mulder and Scully wrestle with many of the same issues they struggled with during the final season of the series .
Does their quest serve a purpose ?
Is their search for the truth worthwhile ?
Does Mulder really believe in the supernatural ?
Does Scully have faith in her God and her work as a healer ?
And , finally , do the two heroes belong together as lovers ?
The final question seems particularly tiresome , as fans have watched their relationship grow for more than 15 years .
Mulder and Scully have debated their compatibility longer than many couples stay married .
You ’d think they ’d have made a call by now .
Even the actors seem bored with the issue — especially in the case of Anderson , whose performance seems more perpetually exhausted than heroically agonized .
Those questions of belief and faith form the thematic core of the film , and it would be genuinely refreshing to see a summer blockbuster take on such weighty issues if the rest of the movie put enough narrative meat in the foreground .
There just is n’t enough of the cool , the spooky and the fun in a franchise that used to be able to pack in all of the above .
As it stands , The X - Files : I Want to Believe takes too long to bring anything genuinely suspenseful to the screen — leaving any would - be audience wanting more for its money .
In a summer of smash successes ( Iron Man ) , Oscar - worthy morality tales ( Wall - E ) and genre - defining masterpieces ( The Dark Knight ) , Carter ’s offering seems destined to fade quickly like the whistling opening tones of the old series ’ theme tune .
Rating :
Read Underwire ’s movie ratings guide .
Wired : Examination of fate and faith pushes genre movie beyond the realm of average summer thriller .
Tired : Lacks feature - film scope ; delivers too few chills ; basically a very average , generally forgettable episode of The X - Files .

The BBC ’s embarrassing attempt to dig itself out of a hole that keeps getting deeper was again exemplified during their latest yellow journalism hit piece on 9/11 truth , in which they played Larry Silverstein ’s “ pull it ” comment but edited out the most important part of the statement , and in doing so changed its context altogether .
An army of informed truth activists are almost tripping over each other to point out the gargantuan number of errors , ad hominem smear tactics , bias and shoddy investigative techniques displayed in the program which aired Sunday in the UK .
Just one such example concerns WTC complex leaseholder Larry Silverstein ’s infamous “ pull it ” comment which can be viewed in its entirety below with other clips included for context in confirming that the term “ pull it ” is industry jargon for deliberately demolishing a building .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Watch the clip .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
However , in the BBC ’s attempt to convince the viewer that “ pull it ” meant to withdraw firefighters from the building , despite the fact that according to NIST ’s WTC collapse lead investigator Shyam Sunder , “ There was no firefighting in WTC 7 , ” and additionally the FEMA report , which stated “ No manual firefighting actions were taken by FDNY , ” the editors carefully snipped out the last portion of Silverstein ’s comments where he states , “ and then we watched the building collapse . ”
Cycle through to 20 minutes into the clip to spot the edit .
By deliberately removing “ and then we watched the building collapse , ” the BBC has performed a hatchet job on the whole context of the statement by censoring the fact that the collapse of WTC 7 was a consequence of the decision to “ pull ” the building .
The BBC ’s zealous efforts to redeem its name by ceaselessly attacking the 9/11 truth movement accelerated after the broadcaster was shamed when footage from 9/11 emerged of their correspondent Jane Standley reporting that WTC 7 had collapsed even as it remained standing in the shot behind her head .
Questions as to how this could have happened and allegations that news corporations , whether wittingly or unwittingly , were being fed a script on the day of 9/11 as it unfolded were met with hostility , and the BBC claimed it had “ lost ” the tape .
The tape was miraculously “ discovered ” again on the eve of the broadcast of their latest hit piece but the footage was not shown in the program , presumably to avoid further embarrassment .
Below you can read articles concerning the mountain of other lies contained in the hit piece and watch a discussion about the program with Alex Jones and Jason Bermas .
We will be picking apart the BBC ’s latest atrocious effort to claim they have “ solved the final mystery of 9/11 ” over the course of this week with multiple investigative reports and as we did last time – debunk this latest hit piece as nothing more than the revolting stench of yellow journalism .

Comment on this article
In six hours this past January , all the good that Pól Brennan had ever done came unraveled .
The 56 - year - old Belfast - born carpenter and his American wife Joanna Volz were in their brand - new Sportsmobile camper van , heading from Volz 's parents ' home on South Padre Island to Austin to visit friends .
From Austin , they would start the long drive back to their home in the San Francisco Bay Area .
Brennan decided to drive the ­Harlingen - Austin leg of the trip .
He would never make it to Austin .
Volz napped as they whizzed up Highway 77 under the warm winter sun through the lonely brush of the King Ranch .
When Brennan eased up to the Border Patrol / Department of Homeland Security checkpoint in the tiny hamlet of Sarita , he woke Volz .
He knew they would be stopped and questioned , as the van still had temporary plates .
As it turned out , the van 's registration was the least of his worries .
The two cars ahead of the Sportsmobile were waved through .
The guard shoved an upraised palm at the Sportsmobile .
" You a U.S. citizen ? " the patrolman asked Brennan .
" No , " Brennan replied .
" I am Irish . "
The patrolman asked Brennan for his papers .
Brennan complied , handing over a valid California driver 's license and his yearly federal work permit .
" I did n't know anything was amiss , " he would say much later .
In fact , the Border Patrol would find very much to be amiss .
For starters , Brennan 's work permit had expired .
The patrolman told Brennan to park the van and come in the office for further ­questions .
Although he still held some hope , Brennan could already feel his life slipping away .
He had one card up his sleeve :
He dialed up his San Francisco lawyer , James Byrne , on his cell phone , and asked him to fax his papers to him — his pending applications for a new work permit , a green card and political asylum .
All were sent , and none was enough .
" I had thought that maybe the faxed paperwork would save me , " he would say later .
" When they hold you for six hours , you know it 's not good . "
Because at the same time the fax was humming with papers coming over from Byrne 's office , the Border Patrol 's computers were churning out other information , and it was exciting stuff .
The slight , ­scholarly - ­looking Irishman with the glasses , close - cropped , salt - and - pepper hair and the Mephistophelean beard was no mere tourist or snowbird .
Reams of information on Brennan 's past came humming over the transom — an old Interpol warrant detailed how one afternoon in Belfast in 1976 , Brennan and a companion had been caught with a gun and a 23 - pound bomb they were alleged to have been intending to plant in a shop , and how he had been sentenced to 16 years in Long Kesh Prison , or Maze , at it was also known .
And how , seven years later , he and 37 of his fellow Irish Republican Army cohorts had busted out of the Kesh in the largest jailbreak in the entire history of the United Kingdom .
For patrolmen accustomed to catching run -of - the - mill Mexican , Caribbean and Central American immigrants and the occasional drug - runner , this was a red - letter day .
The shark fishermen had netted something more exotic , even if it was probably no threat — a giant squid , ­perhaps .
In a posting to his Web site , Brennan would later write that the Border Patrol agents ' " little eyes were jiggling with excitement " as they downloaded Brennan 's picaresque adventures , " acting as if they had caught the terrorist ­Al - Zarqawi . "
Brennan tried to explain that those matters had been settled in federal courts in San Francisco , where he had been living openly since 2000 .
He argued that he had filed for the extension to his work permit on time , and that it was the government 's fault that he had n't received it .
He told them truthfully that he was no longer being actively sought by British authorities .
All to no avail .
They were more interested in that bomb he was caught with in Belfast in 1976 or that day 25 years ago when he broke out of jail .
Volz eventually headed to Austin alone .
Brennan went to jail , where he is now fighting to avoid deportation to a country he has n't seen in 25 years .
_____________________
Brennan 's current plight is unusual but not unique .
There are at least 15 former IRA prisoners living in America today .
Many or most of these people are married to Americans and / or have ­American - born children , and many have faced ­deportation .
As it stands now , former IRA prisoners in America cannot travel back to Ireland to visit friends and family , and must renew their work permits often at great expense and danger to their employment .
( Often , the applications are delayed ; in the interim , employers are at risk if they allow the immigrants to work . )
Additionally , a handful of former IRA members — an estimated five or so — are still hiding and now have no incentive to come in from the cold .
Earlier this year , two former IRA prisoners — Paul Harkin and Matt Morrison — announced the foundation of Thar Saile .
( Pronounced " Har Sail - ya , " the Gaelic name means " Overseas . " )
Thar Saile 's stated aim is " to end the uncertainty for these men and their families by providing them with a permanent legal status and the right to live , work and travel ­unencumbered . "
Reached at his home in St. Louis , where he has been living and working as a registered nurse for more than ten years , Morrison characterized the Bush Administration as negligent at best and , at worst , as apparently acting on the belief that the Troubles in Northern Ireland were still at their peak .
" The word I employ the most is ' anachronism . '
The reality is that there has been a peace dividend all around for almost everybody that was involved in the peace process , " says Morrison .
" And it would seem on the face of it that former Irish Republicans here in the United States are much further behind the starting line than everybody else . "
In the new Northern Ireland , former hardline IRA leader Martin McGuiness until quite recently shared power with virulently anti-Catholic leader the Reverend Ian Paisley .
( Paisley retired from his post earlier this year . )
Indeed , the two were photographed together in President George W. Bush 's office , looking almost downright chummy .
( Such a development once seemed as unthinkable in Northern Ireland as Michael Moore marrying Anne Coulter would be here . )
But that photo op was the exception to the rule with President Bush .
Morrison , Brennan and other former IRA prisoners in America believe the President 's neglect of the Irish question is a form of political payback : Unlike President Bill Clinton , who took a keen interest in Northern Irish matters , Bush did not owe any favors to blue states with significant Irish - ­American enclaves .
Morrison also believes that post - 9/11 realities are at play .
" In a post - 9/11 environment , the government wants to be seen to be pursuing a hard line , " he says .
Which , he believes , is counterproductive to the still - ongoing peace process in Northern Ireland .
" What you 're seeing is the unfinished business of the peace process , " he says .
" There 's a number of loose ends , and while they are not gonna stop the peace process dead in its tracks , they can fray the edge of the fabric .
" There is an irony here , " Morrison continues .
" And I 'll tell you what it is :
The irony is that guys like Pól Brennan , myself and the other guys that are involved in Thar Saile have been the very people who have been vociferously supporting the peace process throughout and have been keeping American supporters on board throughout the peace process . "

The federal Port Isabel Detention Center in Los Fresnos , where Brennan is incarcerated today , is a long way from Ireland in every way imaginable .
Saint Patrick famously drove the serpents out of Ireland , but he never made it to this or any other part of Texas .
A sign posted near the perimeter of the lockup warns of the presence of both venomous snakes and alligators , and green jays , Mexican eagles and ocelots patrol the brush .
Paradoxically , given these exotic surroundings , Brennan may be closer now to Belfast than he 's been at any time since he slipped past the huge British dragnet in 1983 .
Though he has bailed out of American jails before , this time around the judge has denied bond .
Unless there is a sea change in the drift of his case , Brennan could face deportation before the summer is out .
If you were to look for Pól Brennan 's literary precedent , you could do worse than Jean Valjean , the redeemed ­criminal - turned - philanthropist hero of Victor Hugo 's Les Misérables .
Of course , you could also do better , as Brennan has hardly been a saint since he came to America .
Nevertheless , at bottom , Brennan 's conversion from active member of the Irish Republican Army to American working stiff has been dramatic .
And this year , the United States government has proven itself every bit the doctrinaire pursuer that Valjean 's nemesis Inspector Javert was in Hugo 's masterwork .
Brennan has detailed his most recent incarceration on his Web site , www.polbrennan.com.
As the palest detainee in Port Isabel , he was subject at first to great suspicion from his Caribbean and South and Central American fellow detainees .
He reports that people got in his face and demanded to know where he was from .
Once he told them Ireland , they tended to become friendly .
More so than they are to each other :
He writes that there is frequent tension between the Hispanics and the English - speaking Caribbeans , which often boils over when debating whether to tune in Spanish - or English - language TV .
Before his dispatch to solitary confinement , Brennan shared a cell with a fellow English speaker , a Jamaican named Dave Clark .
The name reminded Brennan of the British Invasion pop group , and Brennan told him so .
" Yeah , I 've heard that before , " the Jamaican answered .
Brennan wrote that his conversations with Clark reminded him of similar scenes of Jamaican / Irish interaction in British jails from the Daniel Day - Lewis film In the Name of the Father .
But most of the time , life in the lockup is boring , Brennan writes .
Other than Bibles , there is no reading material , so Brennan 's supporters have set up a Web page to help supply him with the popular science books he loves — books like Longitude and Krakatoa : The Day the World Exploded .
Brennan writes , reads , talks on the phone and tries mainly to keep to himself while maintaining good relations with all the different ethnic groups .
On the off chance he gets control of the TV , he tunes in The Colbert Report , The Daily Show or BBC news .
But the S.H.U. ( Special Housing Unit , or solitary confinement ) made dorm life seem like a night on the Vegas Strip .
" Life in the S.H.U. is a mixture of pettiness and frustrations , " Brennan writes .
" The days are long and boring , interrupted by moments of drama usually in the form of other inmates acting out their own frustrations and the guards ' responses to these incidents . "
Brennan was told his transfer to the S.H.U. — which most often stems from bad behavior — was to protect him from gangs .
Brennan believes that it actually stemmed from prison officials ' paranoia that he would once again take part in a breakout .
In May , after four months in solitary , he was released back into the general population .
( Brennan 's supporters believe this came when his case started drawing publicity on the outside . )
Joanna Volz , his wife , has moved to the Rio Grande Valley to be near him and her family .
Brennan writes that her life has been thrown into chaos .
" Any time a spouse is left to cope on their own , the stress on them is tremendous — apart from the loss of a loved one there are the added financial and emotional burdens which such forced separations bring . "

Los Fresnos is indeed a long way from Ballymurphy , the staunchly Catholic and Nationalist district of Belfast where Brennan was born in 1953 .
In the harsh logic of that time and place , Brennan 's decision to cast his lot with the IRA was perhaps the only choice he could make .
Ballymurphy also produced IRA leader Gerry Adams and was the scene of a 1970 riot that lasted a full six months .
" The police and the soldiers were kickin ' in our doors every night , " he recalls .
" The Republican struggle was a new breath of life . "
In 1976 , when he was 23 , he was picked up on the bomb charge , for which he was sentenced to 16 years in Belfast 's ­maximum - security Maze prison .
To protest their status as common criminals rather than prisoners of war , Bobby Sands , a one - time cellmate of Brennan 's , embarked on a hunger strike .
This would eventually take his life and those of nine fellow hunger strikers , but not before Sands was elected to the British Parliament and had become an international cause célèbre .
At the same time , plans were afoot for what the Republican side would come to know as " the Great Escape . "
In 1983 , Brennan and 37 others busted out .
Brennan eventually made it to a safe house , where he was given a choice : return to active IRA duty or opt for a new identity in America .
Brennan chose the latter .
After slipping into America as " Pól Morgan , " Brennan took jobs in construction and met single mother Joanna Volz in an Oakland bar in 1984 .
They were married five years later .
They settled into a typical American domestic routine : Brennan worked in construction , Volz as a legal clerk in the San Francisco public defender 's office , and together they raised Volz 's daughter Molly and two whippets .
( Volz declined to be interviewed for this article , but she recently told New York City 's WBAI radio that she had no knowledge of Brennan 's past when they met . )
While still on the run , in a letter in the Irish People , a journal published by NorAid , an American fund - raising arm of the IRA , Brennan did his beat for peace :
He publicly and strongly disavowed some of the IRA 's more violent tactics .
At about the same time , Brennan made an ill - advised decision .
He purchased a pistol from a licensed dealer in California .
Earlier this year , he told the Irish Echo newspaper that the gun was for nothing more than target practice and that , at his wife 's behest , he soon sold it ( again , through proper channels ) to help finance his new hobby : astronomy .
Between 1992 and 1994 , Brennan and three other Maze escapees in America were unmasked by the FBI and jailed .
British authorities instituted extradition proceedings , which Brennan and his former ­comrades - in - arms fought for years .
By 2003 they had won at least a partial victory — the British government had withdrawn its extradition request and declared that while Brennan was still on the books as a fugitive , he was no longer being " actively pursued . "
But while the heat from Britain was diminishing , it would only increase in America .
As time passed , new political realities — namely , anti-immigrant fervor and 9/11 — saw to that .
And in part Brennan himself is to blame .
While he was detained on the extradition rap , the gun came to light .
That he no longer possessed it did not matter :
By purchasing a gun while still living under an alias , he had committed a felony , and he was convicted of using false identification with intent to deceive the gun dealer in 1995 .
In 1996 , get - tough federal legislation was passed dictating mandatory deportation for undocumented aliens convicted of many crimes .
While it was not retroactively applied in Brennan 's gun case — for which he was sentenced to six months time served — the conviction remains in his record .
Although it is not mandated that he be deported on the gun rap , judges can use the conviction at their discretion .
Still , in light of the peace process in Northern Ireland , in 2000 President Clinton placed Brennan and a handful of other former IRA prisoners in " deferred action " status that allowed them to get work permits and stay in America indefinitely .
While this was viewed at the time as a victory for former IRA prisoners , the celebration has proven short - lived .
Angelique Montaño is an attorney with Houston immigration and family law firm Tindall & Foster and , although she is not involved in Brennan 's case , is very experienced with cases involving deportation .
" Deferred action is not a green card , " she explains .
" It 's not intended to be a long - term benefit that you can eventually get citizenship through .
Basically , it 's a political tool . "
And two years ago , Brennan got in trouble again :
He was convicted of misdemeanor assault in California after a fight with a contractor over $ 1,000 in wages .
He was levied a $ 1,500 fine and sentenced to 500 hours of community service .
But if the Feds were so keen on deporting Brennan , why did n't they do so then ?
Why would they wait until he stumbled into the Sarita checkpoint ?
Montaño says that arrests like Brennan 's are not unusual today .
" All the databases are coming together and everyone 's criminal information is coming up everywhere , " she says .
It 's not uncommon , she says , for officials to wait for immigrants to come to them in airports or checkpoints or border crossings , rather than seek them out for arrest .
" Whether you have a work permit or green card or whatever , they do n't care that you 've been running around free , " she says .
" It 's not until those specific incidents that things get triggered . "
In June , in the Harlingen court of immigration Judge Howard E. Achtsam , prosecutors from Homeland Security reactivated the deportation case against Brennan based on his fraudulent entrance to America back in 1983 , and opposed bail .
Byrne , Brennan 's attorney , fired back that he had met bail twice in California and that he had a family and a job waiting for him in California .
Achtsam denied bail , ruling that Brennan was a flight risk based on his escape and a danger to society based on the assault .
Morrison , the Thar Saile activist , says the denial of bail is " really reprehensible . "
" They 're saying he 's a flight risk , " he fumes .
" For heaven 's sake , he was an extraditee .
Where 's he gonna flee to ?
And what is he gonna run from ?
His wife ?
His community ?
His source of income ? "
Brennan 's next court date comes in August .
Byrne has filed a request for an adjustment of status — he has moved for Brennan to receive a green card based on his marriage of 19 years .
He has also requested a change of venue to federal immigration court in northern California .
Montaño sees the wisdom in that maneuver .
" If it comes to a court challenge where he has to go through all his removal things to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals , it is the most pro-immigrant court circuit in the United States , if you can say that about any of them , " she says .
" The Fifth Circuit , which is Texas , is one of the most conservative . "
_____________________
Brennan is heartened by what is happening on his behalf on the outside .
About 600 people have signed an online petition in his support .
America 's largest Irish - American group , the Ancient Order of Hibernians , has come to his defense .
In contrast to his California incarceration in the 1990s , when only Irish ethnics and the likes of Noam Chomsky and Nation columnist Alexander Cockburn came to his aid , this time around Brennan also has support from the political right :
In June , Long Island Congressman Peter King , the ranking GOP member of the House Homeland Security Committee , told the Belfast Telegraph that Brennan should get bail .
Nevertheless , the wheels are still grinding toward deportation .
Brennan says that he was recently asked by a prison official , acting on orders from Judge Achtsam , whether he would prefer being sent to Ireland or Northern Ireland .
Brennan declined to answer .
Save for a few weeks hiding out back in his IRA days , he has never lived in the Irish Republic and would have to start from scratch there .
In Belfast , he possibly could have to pay some debts to a society he still believes is illegitimate , but he does have a large family there , including an aging father he has n't seen in years .
" If I go there , I might have to do some time , " he says .
" But I would get to see my family . "
His American wife would have to start over and Brennan would have to scrap his life in California .
His employer there has spoken highly of him .
So have his supervisors at Oakland 's Chabot Planetarium , where Brennan volunteers in order to indulge his love of the stars .

Once a terrorist , always a terrorist , and no matter if America was never your target .
Illegal immigrants who are convicted of crimes must be deported , no matter how minor the crime .
That 's the way Homeland Security sees cases like this .
Like Javert in Les Misérables , its goal is " not to be humane , not to be great , not to be sublime ; it [ is ] to be irreproachable . "
Still , all decent governments , Morrison maintains , allow themselves " wiggle room . "
" The [ American ] government wants to say , ' Well , these are the rules .
Period .
The end . '
But you do n't have to be a rocket scientist to see that even a cursory review of governmental activity in and around immigration issues previously will prove that they can do anything they want when they want to do it . "
Morrison cites the example of a famous world leader who was convicted of terrorist activities .
" If you want to strictly apply the law , Nelson Mandela does not meet the requirement for gaining access to the United States of America , " Morrison points out .
" Do they stop Nelson Mandela from coming to the United States ? "
Morrison wonders if there is even that much thought applied to Brennan 's case .
" I wonder sometimes if with all these agencies that have been subsumed under the general heading of Homeland Security , has a monolithic organization been created here ?
Where the individual organizations were dysfunctional enough to begin with , when you glue all that dysfunctionality together , it 's hard to actually distinguish between what 's actually a policy and what 's just a function of bureaucratic ineptitude .
And the real problem is , we do n't know .
It 's like a black hole in space . "
" I 'm not being flippant when I say this , but all of us that belong to Thar Saile have got histories that do n't look very good on paper , " Morrison continues .
As a teenager , Morrison was jailed for a decade for attempted murder of a policeman .
The incident came at the height of the Troubles and , in Morrison 's telling , was the result of a running gun battle .
" But the reality is that every single one of us have integrated into our communities in the United States .
We 've got American wives for the most part , we 've got American children and we 've been taxpaying , contributing members of our communities since the day and hour we 've come over here , and I think there 's been multiple proofs of that along the way .
It 's not like you 're dealing with some invader from outer space .
" I'm a nurse by profession , for God 's sake ! " Morrison continues .
" I 've taken care of sick American children and sick American adults , and I 've helped Americans to die when I worked for hospice .
It 's almost as if there 's nothing we can do that 's thrown into the balance .
It does n't matter what we do . "
Brennan has been convicted of both offenses large and small and remains a fugitive to boot .
The irreproachable thing to do would be to deport him .
Javert certainly would .
As for the humane thing , the sublime , the great , perhaps those are just the sort of gestures America used to make .

Let ’s call this one .
Tag it and bag it — the sport utility vehicle has passed on .
Might as well hold services right here in the driveway of the Thielke family of Aurora , where their hulking , 10.5 - mile - per - gallon Ford Excursion is on fire sale with few takers and is soon to be replaced by a less greedy minivan .
Killed by insanely high gas prices and a general cultural embarrassment , the SUV leaves lots of survivors but fewer and fewer friends .
“ We ’re kind of in a pickle .
We need a large car , but it ’s killing us , ” Erin Thielke , mother of eight , said of the family ’s $ 100 - plus weekly gas bill .
“ It stinks .
It ’s just like throwing money away . ”
And thus begins the requiem for the possession that defined America for nearly two decades : the box on wheels with more cup holders than seats , the gas - sucking , soccer - team - hauling , rollover - prone vehicle that was cooler than a minivan but more reviled than a coal - fired power plant .
It ’s only decent to hold services here in the West , as Colorado and Wyoming ranked at the top of per-capita SUV purchases .
Peter Brown of Automotive News in Detroit is already referring to the SUV as a dinosaur plodding through some distant , inexplicable past .
“ The cultural phenomenon of the early 1990s is almost certainly dead forever , ” he said .
Official SUV sales were off more than 25 percent in the first part of 2008 , and unofficial reports have them “ falling off a cliff ” since then .
The Big Three U.S. automakers are idling the plants that produced giant vehicles that until recently were synonymous with American freedom and bounty — the Liberty , the Excursion , the Tahoe .
Permanent changes
Economists and auto experts say that changes in consumer habits are permanent as gasoline settles into a $ 3 - to - $ 4 price range .
The federal Department of Transportation reported total vehicle miles driven in the Western region dropped nearly 3 percent in April from the year before , a lifestyle change economists call shocking when the U.S. populations of people and vehicles continue to rise .
“ You can say we ’re definitely in a different realm today than we were a year ago , in terms of the breadth of responses we see consumers making , ” said James Hamilton , a professor of economics at the University of California at San Diego .
A Kelley Blue Book study for June shows high gas prices have altered the choices of 72 percent of people looking for a new car .
Some have dropped out of the market entirely while more than half are checking out fuel - efficient , small hybrids .
New homes in far - flung exurbs — the terminus for so many of those SUV trips — are going unsold or going into foreclosure .
Hamilton reports that 15 percent of the homes in Temecula , Calif. , a distant bedroom community for San Diego , are now in foreclosure .
People can afford neither the house payments nor the gas payments to get them there .
Denver - area real - estate agent Mark Hodge agrees , saying central homes and apartments are holding value , while suburban homes ca n’t sell .
For himself , he likes having an SUV , but not two — the extra one in his driveway is for sale online .
Hodge ’s 2001 Eddie Bauer Ford Expedition is posted at $ 2,000 under blue - book value , and he ’s had no phone calls so far .
“ It ’s panic selling , ” he said of the severe price reductions in used SUVs .
Travis
Stahle saw an era pass with three swipes of his credit card — on the same trip to the gas station .
His Ford Excursion sported a 44 - gallon gas tank , so here ’s the math : Many gas stations have a $ 75 credit - card limit .
If he needed 40 gallons , the $ 160 bill would take three separate transactions .
Shift in vehicles
The cultural shift is getting Scott Carter reacquainted with his motorcycle .
His Highlands Ranch family ’s 2006 Toyota Sequoia is on the market while they look for a Honda Accord or Civic .
Having three competitive hockey players in the family means long drives to practice and tournaments , and a 16 - year - old son needs to learn to drive in something less than a street yacht .
“ If you do n’t really need it , you have to question if you really have to have it , ” Carter said .
“ It ’s getting away from the ‘ want ’ side of things a little bit . ”
The Carters ’ shift echoes another factor in the flight from SUVs : the maturing children of the primary SUV buyers .
The modern SUV era began in 1990 with the introduction of the populist Ford Explorer and peaked in 2005 when SUVs and light pickups reached 55 percent of the new - car market .
A generation of kids grew up surrounded by a dozen cup holders and overhead DVD players , and now they ’re leaving for college in Toyota Priuses .
Along the way came the square - house - on - wheels Hummer , designer models like the Eddie Bauer and endless ridicule from environmentalists and foreigners .
A Frenchman who analyzed American SUV mania likened us to reptiles seeking the most armor for instinctive combat .
Filling the supertankers was cheap ; buying oil took up only 3.5 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product in 2005 , while it will hit 6.9 percent this year if gas prices stay high .
Parents bought the SUVs because they were slightly cooler than minivans , Brown of Automotive News said .
They claimed to need the extra space to haul kids and friends and camping equipment , but more often , like the Clockner family of Parker , they used massive trucks like the Excursion to commute 2 miles to work .
“ Eleven miles to the gallon does n’t do anybody any good , ” said John Clockner , among those now trying to sell a used SUV at swallow - hard prices .
“ An Accord gets 28 or 29 , plus you can find a place to park it . ”
Eighteen years after the first Explorer , a nation of SUV lovers is now talking like a bunch of binge drinkers ready to sober up .
“ Gas prices are just too high , ” Thielke said .
“ People are getting slammed in the pocketbook . ”
Still ,
Thielke is evidence that while the SUV might get buried , it will not go entirely unmourned .
“ The kids are having a fit , ” she said , looking out at the Expedition she planned to chalk a “ For Sale ” sign on that very afternoon .
“ I have tall children .
And the big cars have lots of comfort . ”

President wo n't ask Americans to conserve gasoline , despite rising oil costs .
Bush wo n't demand conservation
President Bush said Tuesday that he will not call on Americans to conserve gasoline despite the rising price of oil , saying consumers are " smart enough " to figure out for themselves that they should drive less .
" They 're smart enough to figure out whether they 're going to drive less or not .
I mean , you know , it 's interesting what the price of gasoline has done , " Bush said at a news conference in the White House press room , " is it caused people to drive less .
That 's why they want smaller cars :
They want to conserve .
But the consumer 's plenty bright .
The marketplace works . "

" You noticed my statement yesterday , I talked about good conservation and — you know , people can figure out whether they need to drive more or less , " he said .
" They can balance their own checkbooks . "
" It 's a little presumptuous on my part to dictate how consumers live their own lives , " the president added .
" I 've got faith in the American people . "
Bush was asked about an earlier news conference in which he said he had not heard of forecasts that gasoline could reach $ 4 a gallon , a mark that was soon eclipsed .
“ I ’ve heard of it now , ” he quipped .
The president said the “ psychology ” of the oil markets must be considered in carrying out an effective energy policy .
“ It seems like it makes sense to me to say to the world at we ’re going to use , you know , new technologies to explore for oil and gas in the United States … to send a clear message that the supplies of oil will increase , ” he said .
“ The president does n’t have a magic wand , ” the president added .
“ You ca n’t just say : ‘ Low gas ! ’ ”
As the former oilman has throughout his administration , he referred to oil as “ product , ” in the industry lingo .
Bush was asked for the first time about " What Happened , " the blistering memoir by former White House press secretary Scott McClellan .
“ I have had — no comment now on Scott ’s book , ” he said .
Bush looked and sounded jaunty despite the weight of the issues , responding to a reporter ’s greeting by saying it ’s always a good morning when you ’re serving the country .
At one point he referred sardonically to “ your wonderful newspapers ” and “ your TV shows . ”
“ Is that what you call them – TV shows ? ” he teased .
“ Newscasts ! ”
This seemed to me to be an ideal opportunity to question her on two issues that she is clearly passionate about , but seem to me to be diametrically opposed : Tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserve ( SPR ) and reducing carbon emissions .
So , I submitted the following question , several hours prior to the chat :
Pelosi will discuss the current political scene heading into the conventions , the message of her new book and other questions submitted by readers .
Nancy Pelosi , Speaker of the House and Author of " Know Your Power : A Message to America 's Daughters " will answer questions in a live discussion on washingtonpost.com today ( Wednesday , Aug. 6 at 3 pm ET ) .
Dear Speaker Pelosi , Perhaps you could clarify an issue that is confusing to me .
On the one hand , you have spoken passionately for the need to combat global warming by reducing our carbon emissions .
This is clearly a priority for you , as well as for the Democratic Party .
On the other hand , you have also come out strongly in favor of tapping oil from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve in order to bring oil prices down .
Given that high prices are causing the public to abandon SUVs and to embrace fuel efficiency and mass transit - exactly the sorts of things that need to happen if we are to reduce carbon emissions - how is your position on the SPR not completely at odds with your position on global warming ?
If in fact you push through your proposal on the SPR , wo n't that lead to increased consumption and therefore increased carbon emissions ?
Had I been a bit more long - winded , I would have pointed to reports that gasoline demand is in fact down this year , breaking a multi - year trend of increasing demand .
Or I could have shown many news stories showing record demand for Priuses while SUVs are not moving .
Of course the reason demand is down is price - driven .
Price is the most practical handle we have on moderating demand .
Unfortunately , Speaker Pelosi ( or the person screening the questions ) decided not to answer my question .
Instead , they answered a question in which she could once more push for tapping the SPR !
Marietta , Georgia : Dear Madam Speaker ,
Although this forum is primarily focused on your book , I cannot help but bring up an issue that is affecting each and every American .
Why have the American people not seen energy legislation that lowers the price of gas ?
Thank you Nancy Pelosi :
Now let 's pivot from book questions to a topic many of you have raised : the high price of gasoline at the pump and what we can do about it .
Every American family is affected by the high price of oil and gas .
It is our responsibility in Congress to protect the consumer and increase the domestic supply of energy .
For the past 18 months , the Democrats in Congress have set forth an energy agenda .
Some has been passed into law - and some has been blocked by the Republicans .
House Democrats have put forward 13 major proposals that would increase supply , reduce prices , protect consumers and transition America to a clean , renewable energy - independent future .
Each time a majority of House Republicans have voted against these proposals .
Let me be very clear : drilling for oil in protected areas offshore will not bring down the price at the pump for 10 years - and then only 2 cents .
To say otherwise is a hoax on the American people .
Here 's what we can do : 1 . Free Our Oil
We can have immediate price relief at the pump .
Freeing our oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve will bring down the price of oil in 10 days .
President Bush refuses to take this step for immediate relief .
10 years or 10 days - the choice is clear .
2 . Use It or Lose It Democrats passed the Drill Bill which says to Big Oil " Use it or lose it ! " - drill in the 68 million acres in the lower 48 states or let someone else drill there .
Also , " use it or lose it in Alaska .
All of these areas have permits for drilling - and will produce oil sooner than drilling in protected areas offshore .
3 . End Excessive Speculation Which Raises the Price of Oil Democrats were part of a strong bipartisan vote was taken in the House but GOP leaders twisted arms to block passage .
4 . Repeal the subsidies for Big Oil With Big Oil making record profits , they do not need American taxpayers funding their drilling .
Instead we can invest in research , renewable energy , and tax credits for wind , solar and other renewables .
This passed the House but failed in the Senate by one vote - John McCain was absent that day but said he would have voted no .
5 . Increase Our Energy Supply With Increased Use of Natural Gas - a cleaner energy source .
There is immediate relief for the consumer - if only President Bush would free our oil .
I must say that Number 5 is a surprise .
I have long advocated that instead of recycling our natural gas into ethanol , it would be much more efficient to use it directly as fuel .
As I have pointed out before , Brazil - the poster child for ethanol production - also has 8 times the number of natural gas vehicles on the road as we do in the U.S .
They do n't waste their natural gas separating ethanol from water .
In addition to Brazil - Argentina , Pakistan , Italy , and India all have larger natural gas fleets than does the U.S.
So for those who suggest that we do n't have the infrastructure in place to manage this , maybe we can learn from India and Pakistan .
So I agree with Pelosi on this point :
As our supply of oil depletes , we can ease the decline with natural gas .
Number 1 on Pelosi 's list is the very contradiction I asked about , Number 2 promotes a myth ( there already is a 'use it or lose it ' provision in the law ) and is nothing more than pandering , Number 3 is again in contrast to her position on global warming ( higher prices equal lower carbon emissions ) , and Number 4 says that oil companies should not be entitled to the same sorts of tax deductions afforded every other industry .
I will let you all in on a little secret : Big Oil also deducts the salaries of their employees from their gross receipts , just like every other business .
Maybe that ' subsidy ' should be eliminated .
Maybe their deductions for capital spending should be disallowed .
More subsidies .
But I digress .
But can anyone explain to me why championing action on global warming while also championing tapping the SPR is not blatantly contradictory ?
Anyone ?
Or why nobody in the Democratic Party seems to have the guts to speak out on this contradiction ?
Instead , Barack Obama - long opposed to tapping the SPR - has now embraced the party line and is calling for the same .
Actually , I think I know the answer to the contradiction .
Proponents of tapping the SPR think that alternative fuels are going to rapidly scale up , displace petroleum with cheap ethanol , and the consumer wo n't have to suffer in order to bring fossil fuel consumption down .
To that , I would point out that the Energy Information Administration - the source of Pelosi 's claim that drilling in the OCS would only bring prices down by 2 cents a gallon - testified last year that they do n't foresee that cellulosic ethanol is going to scale up to even a billion gallons by 2030 .
The EIA also predicts that fossil fuels will continue to be the dominant source of our energy supply for decades to come .
So , the very agency Pelosi references in her argument for tapping the SPR is telling us in no uncertain terms that alternative fuels are n't going to ride to the rescue as petroleum supplies deplete .
With that in mind , I believe it is impossible to reconcile a position of tapping the SPR with a position that reducing our carbon emissions is a high priority .
It 's like saying " I propose that the nation needs to go on a diet .
And by the way , I also propose that we increase the supply of donuts to make them more affordable . "
I just wish a politician would have the guts to step forward and address this contradiction .
Military fires public affairs official for refusing to limit press at funerals David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday July 11 , 2008
Print This Email This The Department of Defense has attempted for years to manipulate popular opinion towards the war in Iraq by limiting press coverage of military funerals .
When Gina Gray , a media specialist with a long history of working with the military , became public affairs director at Arlington National Cemetery earlier this year , she found that officials there had started hampering media coverage even in cases where the families gave permission .
When she tried to uphold the existing regulations , she was harassed by her supervisor , demoted , and then fired .
Gray appeared on MSNBC's Verdict with David Shuster on Thursday for her first live interview , along with her attorney , Mark Zaid , who has a history of involvement in high - profile cases involving government secrecy .
" I had no idea I was going to be fired , " Gray explained , " but I certainly ... butted heads .
... I wanted there to be clear rules ... and cemetery officials felt like they were the exception to the rule , that they did n't have to play by the same rules . "
" It 's up to the families to decide how close or far away they want the media to be , " Gray continued .
" It is not up to Arlington Cemetery officials to do that . "
In the case that first brought Gray into conflict with her supervisors , the media area had been placed 50 yards away from the gravesite , obstructing the view of photographers and making the service inaudible .
Shuster next turned to Roy Sekoff of the Huffington Post , who stated , " This is part and parcel of the Bush administration 's policy of trying to keep the human toll of the Iraq War hidden .
...
They talk about sacrifice , they like to use it as an applause line in a stump speech , but they do n't want the American people to see that that sacrifice also includes grieving widows and kids who are never going to have a dad . "
Shuster then returned to Gray , asking about her termination notice , which complained , " You have failed to follow my instructions ... failed to provide me with complete details for your work assignments , been disrespectful to me as your supervisor and failed to act in an inappropriate [ sic ] manner . "
" I 'm guilty of not acting inappropriately , " Gray noted wryly .
She went on to explain , " Army public affairs did step in and did try to make the changes .
But you have a deputy director , Thurman Higginbotham , who has been there for over 30 years and is kind of running the show on his own .
He 's making up the rules as he goes along . "
Mark Zaid added that this was a matter of a " hostile work environment , not just for Gina but her two predecessors . "
" There is an administrative action pending under the Equal Employment Opportunity Office , " Zaid stated .
" You 're going to see some skeletons unearthed at Arlington . "

This story appeared on here a while ago in a slightly different form .
I ’m working on it to perform at The Moth , but figured it would go okay on here …
The keyboard players in my band were spacier than Sun Ra , more abstract than John Coltrane and brought more sheer , squalid anarchy to the stage than GG Allin and the Sex Pistols combined .
When they were n’t playing music they were either feeding , fighting , or shitting on the floor – and they managed to do a lot of that onstage , too .
But they did n’t just act like barnyard animals , they were barnyard animals : the keyboard players in my band were two chickens named Kitty Wells and Patsy Cline .
I played percussion on a modified vintage typewriter miked up loud enough to sound like the thunder of an angry God .
At that volume , the space bar and shift keys rumbled like a kick drum , and the letter keys snapped like a tight snare .
My friend Tim Gordon ( the band ’s other human being ) played the guitar and bass semi-simultaneously , wearing the guitar up by his collarbone and the bass slung low at his hips – he ’d loop the bass notes through a pedal and play rhythm guitar against himself while I thumped and cracked the typewriter .
Once we hit a stride of sorts , we ’d pull a blanket off the top of the cage where Kitty Wells and Patsy Cline sat with two little Casio Keyboards .
We ’d glue chicken feed to the keys we wanted them to hit the most , the ones in tune with Tim .
But really , whatever the chickens played was up to them – we just tried to follow along as best we could .
We told ourselves that we were influenced by classic country , John Cage , dub reggae and Gonzo the Great .
But really , we just tried to create listenable backing rhythms while two birds with brains the size of your pinkie nail took center stage .
A lot of people over the years have asked me “ but why ?
Why ’d you even DO this in the first place ? ”
Sometimes you fall in love with an idea and it just grips you tight and wo n’t let you go until you give birth to it .
Thomas Edison , it was the light bulb .
For George Mallory , it was Mount Everest .
For us , it was chickens playing keyboards .
And really , the only answer is because .
But you know , as fascinating as all of this may sound , it was IMPOSSIBLE to get shows .
Everyone loved hearing about the band , but nobody wanted to book us .
We ’d been handing tapes out all over town , but could n’t get any traction anywhere .
People would listen , and say “ yeah , you guys are alright , man … ” then just trail off .
It ’s true .
Richmond , VA is a rock and roll town through and through – home to Lamb of God , GWAR , Avail , and a disproportionate number of shitty punk bands .
It was the capitol of the Confederacy and it ’s doing the same thing with punk rock that it does with the Confederacy : sits around its carcass on life support just drinking and talking about the good old days , waiting for it to rise again .
No matter how funny or cool people said our idea was , when came down to it , none of the chain - wallet Mafia that ran that town wanted to let us open for them – we were , admittedly , a tough act to follow .
And I mean , as cool as the idea is , we were n’t exactly top - billing material , either .
Bars and restaurants were right out as venues , too .
Although it is fine for them to serve chicken piece - by - piece in a basket , two live ones on stage violate all manner of food and alcohol restrictions .
We started looking for farms to take Kitty Wells and Patsy Cline to , farms that probably would n’t butcher them .
Then one day , a show came through .
We met these guys who were huge Sun Ra fans and totally got what we did – and invited us to open for them at an art gallery in town a month later .
We kicked into gear , big time .
Me and Tim and the chickens started practicing twice a day .
When you ’re in a band with superstars like those two ladies , you kinda have to work around their schedule – feeding times , in this case .
Chickens are basically feather - coated solar - powered robots , and they wake up with the sun , crowing for food .
When it ’s dark for a few minutes , they power down .
Me and Tim got up every morning about an hour before sunrise and set up our amps , practiced a little together as the sun crept toward the ladies ’ cage .
They ’d wake up and crow , we ’d pop two keyboards and mikes in there , drop some feed on the keys and have a full band rehearsal until the chickens got full .
Then we ’d go off to work , come home , make some dinner , and have a sundown rehearsal .
The thing is , that was n’t enough for me .
I have far more ideas than actual skills , and I needed all the practice I could get .
We were already getting up at 5 am to practice and doing it again at night , but I was still panicking .
I was giving this thing everything I had and it just was n’t enough .
We were supposed to perform onstage with live chickens in a few weeks ’ time and I was terrified that we were going to look ridiculous .
Then Tim hit on it : we started putting the chickens to sleep .
If you put a chicken ’s head under your armpit and stroke it softly , it will think it ’s nighttime and go right to sleep .
We ’d done this when they got to fighting too much , and we started doing it during breakfast and dinner rehearsals .
It worked a treat , too :
The armpit trick performed a ctrl - alt - delete on the chickens ’ brains , and they woke up every time thinking it was a brand - new day .
They also forgot they ’d eaten , and came to with the breakfast instinct each time .
We stopped it once they started moving kinda slow , but we could eke out another 30 - 45 minutes each practice that way .
Practices were grueling .
It was hot in our little apartment , and the chickens had pecked each other up pretty good .
All they did was fight .
Tim and I were fighting too , exhausted from all the early rising .
Just because something is funny does n’t mean it ’s not serious , and we were exhausted and freaking out .
Then , disaster .
The day before the show , the gallery manager called me and tried to cancel it altogether .
She said the board had heard we were bringing barnyard animals in to perform and freaked out .
They were afraid the chickens would get loose and fly around and claw up the artwork or peck the sculptures or something .
So , sorry , better luck next time , she said , like we could just up and go play somewhere else .
I lost it a little bit .
I said “ Listen .
I have been keeping two chickens in a 2 bedroom apartment for over a month .
I have gotten up at 5 am for a month to rehearse with my bandmate and some chickens .
I am exhausted , and literally henpecked , and furthermore CHICKENS CAN ’T FLY , THAT ’S WHY WE ARE ABLE TO CATCH AND EAT THEM SO EASILY . ”
I ca n’t remember what all else I said , but I just kept hammering away at her until we were both silent , panting from a battle of wills .
She let us go on .
There ’s not but one or two cool things to do a month in Richmond , and that night we were IT .
The gallery was packed , and small towns being what they are , everybody had heard all about the drama already .
Folks showed up all gossipy and excited , just looking for a fight .
We came out in matching red , white , and blue tuxedoes with the chicken ’s cage wrapped in an American flag .
This was before 9/11 , when you were n’t such an asshole for doing that .
We warmed up and hit our stride , and when we saw the crowd look like they were grooving a little , I whipped that flag away and the chickens woke up and started crowing and pecking .
Tim threw some chicken feed in there and they went nuts – we ’d skipped morning rehearsal so the birds would be nice and hungry , and they played like hell .
Then , the crowd got the fight they were looking for .
Kitty Wells was standing with one foot on her keys , making this steady drone , all Velvet Underground style , pecking away at a piece of corn on one of the high notes .
And Patsy Cline decided she wanted that very same piece of corn .
They both pecked at it for a while , making this amazing drone , punctuated with staccato notes – then they just went for each other ’s eyes .
They crowed and puffed up , flapping their wings and howling as they jumped up and down on the piano keys .
It was like fucking Jerry Springer .
The crowd leapt to their feet and was like “ OOOOOooo ! ” and started chanting and whistling .
We kept playing until we saw a little chicken blood hit the keyboards , at which point we each grabbed a bird and jammed her head under our armpit and took a bow .
This may have been the crowning achievement of my musical career , and I was n’t even the star .
Patsy Cline and Kitty Wells stole the show , took their paychecks and vanished .
Like so many anonymous session musicians , they spent the remainder of their short , wretched lives scratching for food , having babies they ’d never meet and dying in the tremendous shadow of their own legend .
Now I ’m here in New York – and every year or so me and Tim talk about getting the band back together and playing on the subway platforms .
*******
The following recording is ripped from a tape of our first live performance , back in 1998 .
We refined some stuff — a LOT of stuff — before the story above took place .
You ’ll hear Tim playing the bass , me speaking and manipulating the vocals and drum machine , and Kitty Wells and Patsy Cline playing the keyboards .
We had n’t yet figured out that feeding time needed to be showtime , so their involvement ’s a little more spare than in later performances .
I can remember being enamored with Ministry , Sun Ra , King Tubby and Nation of Ulysses at the time , and I think those influences are pretty clear here .
I can also remember being fairly full of myself as an art student , and that ’s more than apparent .
To the best of my knowledge , this is our only existing recording , though I would really , really like to be wrong .
It ’s nothing you ’re going to pump in the club or listen to on your iPod while you ’re training for a marathon , but ten years later , I still find this to be a pretty interesting piece .
Here it is :
Royal Quiet Deluxe , April 1998
Some years later , my friend Eric Browne and I were rehearsing to rehydrate the long - dead Royal Quiet Deluxe .
It never happened .
But we did get this track out of all our hard work — something you may find much more listenable .
I am playing percussion and manipulating the whooping sounds .
I have NO idea how we did this , and we could probably never do it again .

All Things Pythonic
Origin of BDFL
by Guido van van Rossum
July 31 , 2008
Summary
I believe I 've tracked down the origin of the term Benevolent Dictator For Life ( BDFL ) to a Python meeting in 1995 .
It 's a blast from the past !
Advertisement
Occasionally people ask me about the origins of my nickname BDFL ( Benevolent Dictator For Life ) .
At some point , Wikipedia claimed it was from a Monty Python skit , which is patently false , although it has sometimes been called a Pythonesque title .
I recently trawled through an old mailbox of mine , and found a message from 1995 that pinpoints the origin exactly .
I 'm including the entire message here , to end any doubts that the term originated in the Python community .
Some background : On April 15 I had moved to the US to join CNRI for what would end up being a five - year stint .
One of the first things we wanted to do was establish some kind of ( semi - ) formal group overseeing Python development and workshops .
It was too early to think of conferences yet .
The idea was to call this the Python Software Association ( or perhaps the Python Software Activity ) , and to have it be a subsidiary of CNRI , which would give it many of the benefits of a non-profit ( CNRI being one ) without any of the hassle .
On April 18 a group of folks interested in setting this up met : besides myself , there were Ken Manheimer and Mike McLay from NIST , Barry Warsaw , Roger Masse and Ted Strollo from CNRI , Jim Fulton from USGS , and Paul Everitt from Creative Minds , an early precursor of Zope Corporation .
As you can read below , everyone present was bestowed a title starting with First Interim , but mine was the only jocular one .
While I can't prove my title ( with or without the First Interim prefix ) was never used before , I 'm pretty certain that it originated in this meeting .
Given what I know of how their minds work , it was most likely invented by Ken Manheimer or Barry Warsaw , though it may well have been a joint invention by all present .
I doubt that anyone remembers ( I certainly do n't recall anything specifically about this meeting , there were so many meetings those days ) .
Anyway , here 's the whole message , with all the headers .
I 've added some highlights to emphasize the most salient points .

Note that there are a few items that we all need to get moving - paul , you have to post an explanation of the recruitment - process for workshop session conductors , and then all of us have to send out our solicitations .
Barry and roger , i was supposed to report to you the address of the NIST time server - time .
bldrdoc.gov is the one i use .
I believe it supports a number of network - time protocols - i use ' rdate ' on the suns and ' netdate ' on my linux box with it .
I also understand that it is coupled pretty closely with a NIST time - standard atomic clock .
It is physically in boulder , but presumably the time synch mechanisms account for the distance .
And anyway , who of us cares about millisecond absolute accuracy ?

Attendees : Barry Warsaw , CNRI Guido van Rossum , CNRI Jim Fulton , USGS Ken Manheimer , NIST Michael McLay , NIST Paul Everitt , CMinds Inc. Roger Masse , CNRI +
Python workshop ( my notes for the first part are sparse ; after all , i was n't the official notetaker until later in the meeting ...)
Not clear whether or not USGS will have the necessary internet / mbone connectivity - jim is investigating Discussions about mbone at workshop flailed around finding a station to base an sbus video board that barry has available , i may have a sparcstation IPC to bring .
I was left with the impression that there are fundamental questions about whether the effort to set up an mbone broadcast is warranted .
* ** Marshalling the agenda ** action item !
Paul agreed to be the overall workshop - session coordinator Agreed , on guido's suggestion , each of us would take responsibility for recruiting people ( or taking it on ourselves ) to handle a workshop session , and / or pieces of it .
Division of labor : - Paul is going to post something explaining the overall scheme , - Administrative Topics and Introductions : paul - Distributed Computing : guido - Extension Modules and Basic Applications : mike , but jim 's emailing aaron waters - GUI : jim - Python Core : guido - Software Mgmt : ken ( Barry , roger : answer to incidental questions about reliable NIST time server , slaved to the atomic clock - time.bldrdoc.gov .
It apparently supports several time protocols , i use rdate on my sun , netdate on my linux system , just ' cause that 's what 's built in . ) +
Discussions re PSA - Some suggested purposes of the PSA : Give python credentials - " python is not just any old software off the net " , including visibility and formal contact point for python - related questions Coordination of python development and commercial activity Stability of python - branding , forum for fielding user issues , etc Network host making available python and PSA materials - Proposal we 're ( mike ? ) going to make at python workshop : PSA will be a user group , eventually have a network host , and there are efforts in the works for funding ( by cnri ) to make it a staffed organization .
- First Interim Board of Directors - a sundry collection of a motley crew : * First Interim Chairman : Mike McLay * First Interim Keepers of python.org : 1st interim board , @CNRI * First Interim Keeper of the Notes : Ken Manheimer * First Interim Keeper of the python.org Materials Index : Paul Everitt * First Interim Treasurer : decision postponed until there 's money * First Interim Workshop Coordinator : Paul Everitt * First Interim Benevolent Dicator for Life : Guido van Rossum - python.org ( see " 1st interim keeper of ... " , above ) : A claim on the address has been filed with the NIC , by roger masse it may ( ? ) informally be active , but will only be announced once cnri does or does not make some arrangement for funding
We will wait to redirect the python mailing list ( python-list@cwi.nl ) until cnri has officially established a place for python.org
We will relocate the steering - committed list ( python-sc@eeel.nist.gov ) to the python.org host asac ( As Soon As Convenient ) ( barry ? ) - Discussion of a procedure for conducting python development proposals
All agree that it would be nice to have a regular procedure for fielding and registering proposals for changes of and additions to python .
Discussion of jim's recent proposal for a generic object API poses a nice example of several components of such a procedure . .
Purposes of procedure :
To help coordinate the process , so independent groups are n't working separately on the same problem / issue Establish formal collection of proposals , so : people can find what 's already gone before , and how they went people working on implementation can have a central collection to focus upon .
Very preliminary draft of proposal - submission procedure : Champion submits initial proposal to mailing list : Champion fields comments , discussion :
If still interested , champion submits followup proposal , for inclusion in " PSA Notes " repository .
Notice ( who could help it ? ) that nothing is said so far about formalisms for getting the proposal implemented !
. jim , guido , and i agreed to discuss this further ken ken.manheimer@nist.gov , 301 975-3539

She says she was chilled by what she recalls her doctor saying : “ There was so much growing so fast in my abdomen and so much in my bowel , it was not a matter of maybe I would get a bowel obstruction .
It was when I would get a bowel obstruction , ” Ms. Reeh said .
“ And when I got it , there would be nothing anyone could do .
I would die . ”
To try to stave off such a horrible outcome , her oncologist , Dr. Eric Winer of Dana - Farber , offered to enroll her in a clinical trial comparing Avastin with another new biotech drug .
Ms. Reeh was assigned to the group that got Avastin in combination with the chemotherapy drug paclitaxel , also known as Taxol .
The study closed after six months , but Ms. Reeh continued with her drug regimen , and her insurer is paying .
After six months of treatment the fluid in her abdomen was down to just a trace , her tumors were stable or smaller and she felt like her former self again .
“ I ’m really , really excited , ” she said .
Was it the Avastin ?
Dr. Winer said he did not know , since Taxol can also shrink tumors .
It is impossible to draw conclusions from individual patients , he said .
Still , he said , “ I think it is quite likely that the combination of Taxol and Avastin improved her odds of having a better quality of life . ”
Dr. Winer says that when he is not sitting in front of a patient , he thinks about whether drugs like Avastin are worth it to society .
But when facing a seriously ill patient , who , based on clinical trial results , might benefit  even if only a little  from Avastin along with chemotherapy , he has to think about his patient ’s needs .
“ I ca n’t say , ‘ Let ’s not use Avastin ; it ’s a very expensive drug and I am worried about the cost to society , ’ ” Dr. Winer said .
And so , Dr. Winer said , the answer you get when you ask whether drugs like Avastin are worth it very much depends on whom you ask .
Photography for the Blind
August 19 , 2008 By Paul Wagorn
Sometimes the ideas that initially sound the most absurd are the most brilliant ones .
Suppose for a moment that someone told you that they were going design a camera for blind people .
Well , a design team at Samsung has done just that .
My first thought was “ Why ? ” …
My second thought was “ ok , but … How ? ”
The team , led by Designer Chueh Lee have developed what might be the worlds first camera for the blind .
It ’s called the “ Touch Sight Camera ” , and Mr Lee says this :
â€ œTouch Sight is a revolutionary digital camera designed for visually impaired people .
Simple features make it easy to use , including a unique feature which records sound for three seconds after pressing the shutter button .
The user can then use the sound as reference when reviewing and managing the photos .
Touch Sight does not have an LCD but instead has a lightweight , flexible Braille display sheet which displays a 3D image by embossing the surface , allowing the user to touch their photo .
The sound file and picture document combine to become a touchable photo that is saved in the device and can be uploaded to share with othersâ€ “ and downloaded to other Touch Sight cameras.â€ 
Incredible .
The camera actually works best when the Braille panel is held against the forehead as it also helps stabilize the camera .
Chueh mentioned that in instructor who teaches a photography course for the visually impaired found that “ the visually impaired have no problems estimating distances , since their sense of hearing is especially sharp .
Every rustle of wind in the trees catches their attention and can be used to judge distances . ”
“ A camera was something prohibited , I never dreamed I ’d hold one , ” says visually impaired photography student Karina Murninaks .
“ My parents told me that to take pictures you had to be able to see , that I could n’t touch the camera .
And I always loved hearing the click - click , and at last I can do the click myself .
At first it was like a toy , but now I ’m really taking photographs . ”
The 3 seconds of audio recording help convey distance and also impart the sense of “ being there ” that a normally - sighted person would feel when looking at the photograph .
This is n’t the first device that helps blind people “ see ” .
There is this device that uses sound , this device that uses touch sense on the forehead and even this device that helps people see with their tongue .
There are no definite plans to bring the device to the market yet , but I sincerely hope that Mr. Lee ’s collegues at Samsung decide to put the resources into this evolutionary device .
The rest of the design team includes Liqing Zou , Ning Xu , Saiyou Ma , Dan Hu , Fengshun Jiang and Zhenhui Sun .

Wow , this technology is so amazing .
I have an aunt who 's visually impaired so I have an affection for those who cannot see .
Before , braille was already technological breakthrough that is very helpful for the blind .
Years ago , there was already a braille - SMS , and now , Photography for the blind .
Let there be more aides for the visually impaired to help them live like normal .
Evidently there was at one time a talking camera , too .
Speaking as someone who can just about see the display on a digital camera but not the menus , I would welcome the return of this idea .
Computers can talk , phones can talk , even Christmas cards can talk , so let 's please have a talking camera !
The BAT !
I am a teacher at a school for the blind and would absolutely love the opportunity to try these cameras out with my students !
I 'd love to put this to the test !

As Philip Giraldi points out in his 12 August article “ America ’s Israeli - Occupied Media ” published on antiwar.com , the Israeli government is continuing its campaign to get the US military to attack Iran or at least give a “ green light ” for a massive Israeli bombing strike .
In pursuit of this reckless and ill - conceived plan Tel Aviv has a willing co-conspirator in the mainstream American media , who will present the Israeli world - view without criticism or qualification .
CBS recently re-aired a 60 Minutes segment entitled “ The Israeli Air Force ” that provides a rather startling example of how the American news media will permit the Israelis to present their point of view to the exclusion of any competing narrative .
The report , presented by correspondent Bob Simon , originally aired on 27 April and was rebroadcast on 10 August .
The message of “ The Israeli Air Force ” is clearly and succinctly communicated by 60 Minutes as : Iran is a threat to Israel ’s existence and to the rest of the world ; Iran will obtain a nuclear weapon soon ; when it does it will use it to destroy Israel .
Thus it is apparent that if Iran does not quickly agree with the demands of Western powers to cease its uranium enrichment program , the Israeli Air Force can and will attack and incapacitate the Iranian nuclear facilities .
In order to produce this segment , CBS , by its own admission , accepted the “ rigorous censorship ” requirements of the Israeli Air Force ( IAF ) .
The explanation Simon gives for this arrangement is to quote the IAF ’s dubious justification that “ [ i ] f the Israelis blow their secrets , they insist , they ’ll lose the next war . ”
Maybe Simon should have just confessed that because CBS believes that these Israeli pilots are such amazing men , 60 Minutes should let them tell their own story , in their own way , without network interference .
To further justify this approach Simon states that for the IAF , “ mistakes are ultimately unacceptable because the country is so small and the stakes are so high . ”
In “ The Israeli Air Force ” Simon interviews Israeli pilots who are the “ best and brightest . ”
We are told they are destined to become heroes and some even legends .
The report recounts the great IAF victory in the 1967 War and the difficult but “ necessary ” military air strikes in Gaza .
No mention is made of the two disastrous air campaigns in two wars on Lebanon .
We also hear interviews with the pilots who bombed and destroyed the Iraqi nuclear reactor at Osirak in 1981 .
Yiftach Spector , who participated in the Iraq bombing , humbly rejects Simon ’s compliment that he returned from the mission as a hero .
Spector claimed “ [ w ] e postponed a threat , a real threat . … I mean , the heroes were not us .
The decision makers were the heroes on this because they showed the world what ’s right and what ’s wrong . ”
Simon then asks , “ [ t ] oday , Israel ’s decision makers are faced with a similar choice , will they take out Iran ’s nuclear facilities ? ” and one really wonders if this little play was written by someone at CBS or rather was actually composed by an Israeli government press assistant or an official of the IAF censorship board .
In Bill Moyer ’s documentary about the news coverage leading up to the invasion of Iraq , Buying the War , Bob Simon correctly criticizes the media for only reporting the Bush - Cheney Administration ’s propaganda while ignoring all contradictory evidence .
Ironically , when it comes to Iran , it appears that Simon ’s reporting ignores all contradictory evidence while solely presenting the Israeli government line .
The 2007 US National Intelligence Estimate which states that there is a high probability that Iran discontinued its nuclear weapons program in 2003 , was never mentioned .
Neither were the findings of the International Atomic Energy Agency , which have contradicted Israeli claims .
In addition , the segment never addressed the fact that Israel views Iran as its main competitor in the region and as a financier and supporter of its enemies Syria , Hizballah and Hamas .
This may have as much to do with the Israeli bellicosity toward Iran as any fear of nuclear weapons .
Finally , numerous high ranking officials in the American government including Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Michael Mullen , are currently on the record as saying that any attack on Iran at the present time , whether it be American or Israeli , would be extremely harmful to US interests .
In addition to the lives lost due to a massive Israeli air attack on Iran , some of the likely consequences of an attack would be : a further endangering of US soldiers in Iraq , a skyrocketing price of oil and a wider US war in the region .
Bob Simon did not mention the opinions opposing an attack on Iran or any of these very relevant possibly disastrous consequences .
Any news program which deserves special citation for being produced from an Israeli perspective should follow these rules : never mention the word “ occupation , ” nor the conditions that Palestinians are forced to endure when speaking about the West Bank and Gaza ; if you address the issue of casualties suffered by innocent Palestinians as a result of Israeli military offenses , always give the Israelis time to appear “ aware and troubled ” and to claim they do everything possible to minimize “ collateral damage ” ; never mention anything negative or embarrassing about the Israeli armed forces which cannot be dismissed as an unfortunate mistake .
Finally , and this is key , always express that the targeted enemy is “ Hitler ” and that the military action under consideration will prevent another Holocaust .
Bob Simon ’s report more than adequately meets all these requirements .
The 60 Minutes segment is not a news report , but a paean to “ The Israeli Air Force ” which also explains , justifies and advocates the use of military force against Tehran .
Just as the mainstream media sold the Iraq war without reporting the complete story , CBS and 60 Minutes are producing thinly veiled propaganda disguised as investigative journalism to sell the idea of bombing Iran to the American people .
It is frightening that CBS could produce such a program which ignores any evidence that does not promote Tel Aviv ’s worldview .
What is even more terrifying is that even if the US decides against the military option and advises Israel to do likewise , the same power and influence which enables Israeli - occupied news coverage , can make it possible for Israel to ignore American wishes and proceed with their plan to bomb Iran .

There are no natural processes in Earth 's biosphere that make nylon or acrylics or PVC .
Nylon does n't exist out in the wild unless we throw it away .
If we build these bugs so they need to eat nylon , for example , in addition to whatever else they do for us , this cripples them in a key way .
If they escape , they 'll soon die out because the nylon is not being rapidly replenished by natural sources in the wild — aside from us that is .
You could also build these bugs in such a way that they can't reproduce .
We strip out their reproductive machinery .
We could could get quite clever with that one .
For example we build two species of bacteria that can't reproduce unless they are in close proximity to each other so bacterial genetic conjugation can take place .
If either species escapes , they are essentially sterile .
We could also build them to be extremophiles .
That they require high or low temperatures , very salty environments or high ambient radiation ( Like radiococcus durans ) to thrive .
That would limit their ability to spread .
Of course there is the jumping gene problem .
I do n't have an easy answer for that one but , I think if we think these things through there are lots of precautions we can take to reduce the likelihood of runaways .

TRANSCRIPT : I want to thank you for the support which you have given to my efforts to hold this administration accountable for taking us into a war based on lies and for the destruction of the rule of law and the destruction of cherished constitutional principles .
Because of your support , this Friday in Washington , DC , I will make a presentation before the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives at which time I will make the case that this president has violated his oath of office , violated United States law and international law , has separated our nation from our constitution , and has taken us on a course that has been so profoundly anti-democratic that it has threatened the core of our nation .
Because of your support , I have been able to advance this series of matters right to the table of the Judiciary Committee .
Because of your support , I have been able to create an opening so we ’re finally getting a chance in Washington to discuss the abuses of power , to discuss a war based on lies , to discuss the whole architecture of constitutional principles that have been taken down .
Every serious matter that faces the people of this country today can be linked to an administration which is not accountable .
For example , the price of gasoline .
You know that Vice President Cheney with the permission and blessing of President Bush held secret meetings with leaders of the oil industry where they laid out maps of Iraq far in advance of the attack on Iraq .
You know and I know the war was about oil , and if we can force the vice president of the United States to have to testify , we can get the information that is necessary to be able to prove that not only has US law been violated , but that the public trust has been under a continuous assault by an alliance between the White House and the oil companies .
You look at the sub - prime lending fiasco with millions of Americans having the dream of home ownership threatened , and you look at an administration that took the cops off the beat at the Securities and Exchange Commission that enabled the Fed to look the other way when they should have been disciplining the banks .
The American people had a right to expect the government would protect their interests .
When you look at the shakeout in the stock market and all these small investors who are losing their life savings , again the Bush administration and their alliance with interest groups , violating an oath of office , enabling these interest groups to steal from the American people , over and over and over again .
For the first time we are going to have a chance to raise these issues in the Judiciary Committee in the context of a hearing at which I am going to present the Articles of Impeachment so that the Committee cannot say , well , they just did n’t know .
We are going to force this issue because of you .
We are in danger of losing our country to war based on lies , to destruction of our civil liberties , but it is your commitment and your willingness to stand up and speak out that has enabled me to take a stand and to say not only are we going to save what is right and save what is dear to us , but we are going to hold this administration accountable so that it never happens again .
This is truly our moment .
Friday is the beginning .
Thank you for supporting this effort with signing petitions , with your emails and your letters and your phone calls .
I pledge to you that I will continue my efforts to defend a way of life that the American people have a right to expect “ “ to expect to have a government they can call their own “ “ to expect to have a government that will tell them the truth “ “ to expect to have a government that is worthy of the tradition of democracy .
Thank you .
Damien Katz recently caused a stir on a bunch of the blogs I read with his post entitled REST , I just do n't get it where he wrote
As the guy who created CouchDB , I should be a big cheerleader for RESTful architectures .
But the truth is , I just do n't get it .
For CouchDB , REST makes absolutely insanely perfect sense .
Read a document , edit , put the document back .
Beautiful .
But for most applications , enterprise or not , I do n't see what the big win is .
I know what is wrong with SOAP , and it has everything to do with unnecessary complexity and solving the same problems twice .
But what is the big advantage of making all your calls into GET PUT and DELETE ?
If POST can handle everything you need , then what 's the problem ?
I guess what I mean to say is just because SOAP is a disaster , does n't somehow make REST the answer .
Simpler is better , and REST is generally simpler than SOAP .
But there is nothing wrong with a plain old POST as an RPC call .
If its easy to make all your calls conform to the RESTful verb architecture , then that 's good , I guess .
His post made the rounds on the expected social news sites like programming .
reddit and Hacker News , where I was amused to note that my blog is now being used as an example of silly REST dogma by REST skeptics in such discussions .
From reading the Damien 's post and the various comments in response , it seems clear that there are several misconceptions as to what constitutes REST and what its benefits are from a practical perspective .
Background : The Origins of REST vs. SOAP
The Representational State Transfer ( REST ) architectural style was first described in Chapter 5 of Roy Fielding 's Ph.D dissertation published in 2000 .
It describes the architecture of the Web from the perspective of one of the authors of the HTTP 1.1 specification which was published the year before in 1999 .
Around the same time Don Box , Dave Winer and a bunch of folks at Microsoft came up with the Simple Object Access Protocol ( SOAP ) which they intended to be the standard protocol for building distributed applications on the Web .
Over the following years SOAP was embraced by pretty much every major enterprise software vendor and was being pushed hard by the W3C as the way to build distributed applications on the Web .
However a lot of these vendors were n't really interested in building software for the Web but instead were more interested in porting all of their technologies and scenarios from enterprise integration technologies like CORBA to using buzzword compliant XML .
This led to a bunch of additional specifications like XSD ( type system ) , WSDL ( IDL ) and UDDI ( naming / trading service ) .
Developers initially embraced these technologies enthusiastically which led to the enterprise software vendors pumping out dozens of WS -* specifications .
During this period not many thought or talked much about REST since no one talks about boring Ph.D dissertations .
In 2002 , a canary in the coal mine emerged in the form of Mark Baker .
On mailing lists frequented by Web services types such as xml - dev and xml - dist - app , Mark began to persistently point out that SOAP was built on a bad foundation because it fundamentally ignored the architecture of the Web as defined by Roy Fielding 's thesis .
At first a lot of people labeled mark as a kook or malcontent for questioning the trend of the moment .
By 2005 , the industry had enough experience with SOAP to start seeing real problems using at as a way to build distributed applications on the Web .
By that year many developers had started hearing stories like Nelson Minar 's presentation on the problems Google had seen with SOAP based Web services and sought a simpler alternative .
This is when the seeds of Mark Baker 's evangelism of Roy 's dissertation eventually bore fruit with the Web developer community .
However a Ph.D dissertation is hard to digest .
So the message of REST started getting repackaged into simpler , bite - sized chunks but the meat of the message started getting lost along the way .
Which led to several misconceptions about what REST actually is being propagated across the Web developer community .
Misconceptions About the REST Architectural Style
With that out of the way I can address the straw man argument presented in Damien 's post .
Damien states that building a RESTful Web Service is about using the HTTP PUT and DELETE methods instead of using HTTP POST when designing a Web API .
In fact , he goes further to describe it as " the RESTful verb architecture " implying that choice of HTTP verbs that your service supports is the essence of REST .
This is incorrect .
Q : What is the Essence of REST ?
A : The Uniform Interface
REST explains how the Web works by defining the set of constraints on the various components in the current Web architecture .
These constraints include
interaction is based on the client - server architectural style .
User agents like Web browsers , RSS readers , Twitter clients , etc are examples of Web clients which talk to various Web servers without having a tight coupling to the internal implementation of the server .
communication between the client and server is stateless .
The benefits of HTTP being a primarily stateless protocol is that statelessness increases scalability and reliability of services at the cost of introducing some complexity on the part of the client .
the Web architecture supports caching by requiring that requests that are cacheable or non-cacheable are labeled as such ( i.e. via HTTP method and various caching related headers ) .
there is a uniform interface between components which allows them to communicate in a standard way but may not be optimized for specific application scenarios .
There are four interface constraints : identification of resources ; manipulation of resources through representations ; self - descriptive messages ; and , hypermedia as the engine of application state .
there can be multiple layers between client and server which act as intermediaries ( e.g. proxies , gateways , load balancers , etc ) without this being obvious to the requesting client or accepting server .
When you read the above list , the first thing you will note is that it describes the architecture of the World Wide Web .
It does n't describe the architecture of " a typical enterprise " or the internals of a cloud computing application .
Building a RESTful Web Service simply means paying attention to these characteristics of the Web .
As you read them , some practical guidelines start becoming obvious .
For example , if you want to take advantage of all the caching infrastructure that is built into the Web infrastructure , then you should use HTTP GET for services that retrieve data .
This is just one of the many things Web Services built on SOAP got wrong .
The uniform interface constraints describe how a service built for the Web can be a good participant in the Web architecture .
These constraints are described briefly as follows
Identification of resources : A resource is any information item that can be named and represented ( e.g. a document , a stock price at a given point in time , the current weather in Las Vegas , etc ) .
Resources in your service should be identified using URIs .
Manipulation of resources via representations : A representation is the physical representation of a resource and should correspond to a valid media type .
Using standard media types as the data formats behind your service increases the reach of your service by making it accessible to a wide range of potential clients .
Interaction with the resource should be based on retrieval and manipulation of the representation of the resource identified by its URI .
Self - descriptive messages :
Following the principles of statelessness in your service 's interactions , using standard media types and correctly indicating the cacheability of messages via HTTP method usage and control headers ensures that messages are self descriptive .
Self descriptive messages make it possible for messages to be processed by intermediaries between the client and server without impacting either .
Hypermedia as the engine of application state : Application state should be expressed using URIs and hyperlinks to transition between states .
This is probably the most controversial and least understood of the architectural constraints set forth in Roy Fielding 's dissertation .
In fact , Fielding 's dissertation contains an explicit arguments against using HTTP cookies for representing application state to hammer this point home yet it is often ignored .
Benefits of Conforming to REST and the Uniform Interface to Web Developers
At this point , the benefits of building RESTful services for the Web should be self evident .
The Web has a particular architecture and it makes sense that if you are deploying a service or API on the Web then it should take advantage of this architecture instead of fighting against it .
There are millions of deployed clients , servers and intermediaries that support REST and it makes sense to be compatible with their expectations .
This does n't mean you have to use DELETE and PUT when POST might suffice .
It does mean understanding the difference between using POST versus using PUT to other participants in the Web architecture .
Specifically , that PUT is idempotent while POST is not so a client of your service can assume that performing the same PUT two or three times in a row has the same effect as doing it once but cannot assume that for POST .
Of course , it is up to you as a Web service developer to decide if you want your service to provide a more explicit contract with clients or not .
What is important to note is that there is a practical reason for making the distinction between which HTTP verbs you should support .
There are other practical things to be mindful of as well to ensure that your service is being a good participant in the Web ecosystem .
These include using GET instead of POST when retrieving a resource and properly utilizing the caching related headers as needed ( If - Modified - Since / Last - Modified , If - None - Match / ETag , Cache - Control ) , learning to utilize HTTP status codes correctly ( i.e. errors should n't return HTTP 200 OK ) , keeping your design stateless to enable it to scale more cheaply and so on .
The increased costs , scalability concerns and complexity that developers face when they ignore these principles is captured in blog posts and articles all over the Web such as Session State is Evil and Cache SOAP services on the client side .
You do n't have to look hard to find them .
What most developers do n't realize is that the problems they are facing are because they are n't keeping RESTful principles in mind .
Do n't fight the Web , embrace it .

Meet the cats which have sprouted wings
While most cats are renowned for having nine lives , these moggies are clearly living on a wing and a prayer .
The cute little devils began sprouting bumps on their backs , which later turned into wing - like growths , during a recent spell of hot weather in China 's Sichuan province .
Cat owner Feng says her Tom cat grew wings after becoming stressed during the recent mating season
One cat owner , known only as Feng , claims her cat 's wings are a result of stress after he was ' harassed ' by females looking to mate .
' At first , they were just two bumps , but they started to grow quickly , and after a month there were two wings , ' she told Huashang News .
' Many female cats in heat came to harass him , and then the wings started to grow . '
This moggie also has the wings which genetic experts say does not harm his quality of life
The harmless growths appeared during a recent spell of hot weather
And while she says her lovable Tom is no devil , his wings , which contain bones , make him look more like a ' cat angel ' .
But genetic experts claim there is nothing angelic or magical about the condition , which does n't hinder the cat 's quality of life .

As we reported yesterday , major transportation hubs like St. Pancras International , as well as libraries , big businesses , hospitals and other public outlets that offer wi-fi Internet , are blacklisting alternative news websites and making them completely inaccessible to their users .
Alex Jones talks about the Internet Censorship Contest Paul Watson on Alex Jones : England Censors Prison Planet and Infowars
Part 2 Part 3 Part 4
On weekly basis we receive e mails from across the US and the UK from people who have attempted to visit our websites yet found them to be blocked by filtration software that lists them as “ hate ” or “ violence ” .
This precedent is merely the first indication of what is planned for the Internet over the next 5 - 10 years , with the traditional web becoming little more than a vast spy database that catalogues people ’s every activity and bombards them with commercials , while those who comply with centralized control and regulation of content will be free to enjoy the new super - fast Internet 2 , where DVD quality movies can be downloaded in seconds , but at the cost of the Internet losing its role as the last true outpost of freedom of speech .
The necessity to warn people of this agenda is no more pressing than now , and this is why we are launching a contest to create the most powerful video presentation detailing the growing cancer of Internet censorship .
Using the audio of Alex ’s rant at approximately eight minutes into the second hour of the Alex Jones Show on Monday , August 4 , this contest requires you create a video documenting the censorship of Prison Planet , Infowars , TruthNews , the Jones Report and other non-corporatized , alternative media websites .
The video must be under 10 minutes and be posted on YouTube and a secondary video venue on the internet .
Contest deadline is the 19th of August .
Contest videos will also be cross-posted on Prison Planet and Infowars .
First Prize : $ 5,000 Second Prize : $ 1,000 Third Prize : $ 500
We are also running three other contests in a similar vein with additional prizes .
BEST TRUTH RISING TRAILER
Using video clips from Alex Jones ’ latest documentary , Truth Rising : The 9/11 Chronicles , remix a new trailer for the documentary .
This video must be posted by Sunday evening , August 10 , and the winner will be declared Monday , August 11 , during Alex ’s show .
Winner of Truth Rising trailer contest will receive $ 1,000 .
NEW DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE ESSAY CONTEST

CRIMES OF THE NWO BILL OF PARTICULARS ESSAY CONTEST
In the third section of the original Declaration of Independence , there is a bill of particulars against the rule of George III , such as the imposition of standing armies among the people , taxation without representation , and obstruction of justice , etc .

The bad news : Broadband adoption slipped to a seven - year low last quarter .
The worse news :
It could take a century for the United States to catch up to broadband speeds in Japan , given the rate at which services are improving here .
Those are the findings of two separate studies – both independently released this week – that point to a grim state of affairs in the broadband market .
One key holdup for broadband adoption last quarter , according to a Leichtman Research Group report , is that the telcos ' pushed higher - speed , premium services ( such as Verizon 's FiOS and AT&T's U - verse ) at a time when basic DSL was a financial stretch for many Americans .
" Net broadband additions in the quarter were the fewest of any quarter in the seven years [ Leichtman Research Group ] has been tracking the industry , " said Bruce Leichtman , LRG president and principal analyst , in a prepared statement .
" The decline in additions this quarter compared to the same period last year was exacerbated by Verizon and AT&T 's emphasis on selling higher speed FiOS and U - verse bundled services , often at the expense of traditional DSL service . "
The takeaway is that AT&T and Verizon might do well to drop basic broadband prices and try to pump up sales volume .
While the companies have room to play with pricing , it may be a last resort move , says BMO Capital Markets - Canada analyst Peter Rhamey .
" It 's easy to take prices down , but it 's very hard to bring them back up , " says Rhamey .
" It 's worth noting that [ the telcos ] stopped promoting their broadband plans in the second quarter because that 's when students are leaving school and disconnecting ... it 's a seasonal disconnect period .
It 's overly simplistic to say [ broadband subscriber growth slowed down ] because of this or that .
Just a few years ago [ the telecom providers ] were criticized for offering $ 15 DSL service , " says Rhamey .
Meanwhile , super - high - speed services still are n't widely available ( or affordable ) , according to the Communications Workers of America .
The trade group says the average U.S. internet speed was 2.3 - megabits per second , up just .4 mbps from last year .
Japan , by contrast , boasts average net speeds of roughly 63 - mbps range .
Of course , the CWA has an agenda – the group is pushing a piece of legislation called the Broadband Data Improvement Act , which would basically funnel government money into the hands of broadband providers , or in the words of the CWA , the legislation would create a " $ 40 million five - year matching grant program for organizations engaged in efforts to identify barriers to broadband adoption in their state .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- A policy memo by Sen. Hillary Clinton 's one - time chief strategist challenging Sen. Barack Obama 's " American roots " could make it difficult to close any remaining gaps between the former rivals , the magazine writer who revealed the memo said Tuesday .
Mark Penn was Sen. Hillary Clinton 's chief strategist until April .
In a March 2007 memo , Mark Penn , Clinton 's former chief strategist , wrote , " all of these articles about his boyhood in Indonesia and his life in Hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse , multicultural and putting that in a new light .
Save it for 2050 , " according to Atlantic magazine writer Joshua Green .
" It also exposes a very strong weakness for him -- his roots to basic American values and culture are at best limited .
I cannot imagine America electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally American in his thinking and in his values , " Penn wrote .
Penn was forced out of his position as chief strategist in April after revelations that he lobbied for a U.S. - Colombia trade deal on behalf of the Colombian government despite Clinton 's opposition to the measure .
Penn , however , never left the campaign entirely .
The magazine article was posted on The Atlantic 's Web site Monday evening .
It will also appear in the September edition of the magazine , which is expected to hit newsstands August 19 .
Watch Green explain why he got the Clinton documents »
" Her top adviser suggesting that angle is striking , " Jonathan Martin of Politico said .
" These are the kinds of things you see in e-mails that you see circulating about Obama in this sort of subterranean smear campaign against him .
You never see these things voiced by the candidates . "
Green noted that Clinton did not pursue the strategy Penn suggested during the contentious Democratic primary battle , which resulted in Obama winning more delegate than the former first lady and locking up their party 's presidential nomination .
" Had Sen . Clinton followed Mark Penn 's advice , it would have caused her more angst than good , " said James Carville , a Democratic strategist and a CNN contributor .
The revelations could keep any remaining animosity between the Obama and Clinton camps alive , Green said .
Watch how the Democrats are trying to unify »
" What 's going on right now is that a lot of Obama supporters and fundraisers are trying very hard to retire Sen.
Clinton 's debt .
One reason they 've had difficulty doing so is the dislike among Obama people for Mark Penn specifically , " Green told CNN on Tuesday .
" They tend to blame him for the nature of these negative attacks . "
In the Atlantic article , which is based on internal Clinton campaign memos and e-mail messages , Green highlighted bitter fighting among Clinton 's staff , writing that her advisers " could n't execute strategy ; they routinely attacked and undermined each other and Clinton never forced a resolution . "
Watch divisions sunk the Clinton campaign »
Frustrations over how the New York senator 's campaign ended drove many Clinton staffers to turn over the campaign 's internal communication , Green said .
" This was a historic campaign .
People thought it would be an easy march to the nomination and then an easy win in the fall .
And instead , we 've had this historic presidential election where she 's collapsed and a first - term senator has won the Democratic nomination , " Green said .
" So I think it 's just the nature of the defeat has made a lot of people frustrated , and there 's certainly people out there who really want the kind of full story to come to light so people can understand exactly what happened . "
The internal communication suggests that the lack of clear lines of authority within the campaign meant that issues that ultimately led to Clinton 's defeat -- her lack of support in the Iowa caucuses , the absence of a strategy to capture delegates after the Super Tuesday primaries and her failure to prepare for a protracted primary fight -- went unaddressed for months , Green wrote .
" What is clear from the internal documents is that Clinton 's loss derived not from specific decisions she made but rather from the preponderance of the many she did not make , " Green wrote .
" Her hesitancy and habit of avoiding hard choices exacted a price that eventually sank her chances at the presidency . "
The documents also suggest that Clinton 's staff remained divided throughout the campaign on whether she should run a positive campaign or attack Obama and her other rivals for the Democratic nomination as being untrustworthy and underqualified , Green wrote .
" Clinton 's top advisers never agreed on the answer .
Over the course of the campaign , they split into competing factions that drifted in and out of Clinton 's favor but always seemed to work at cross purposes .
And Clinton herself could never quite decide who was right , " he wrote .

Scroll for updates … “ non-partisan ” my you - know - what … Freedom ’s Watch responds …
As noted by See - Dubya last night , the oh - so - tolerant leftists have launched a campaign to send “ WARNING ” letters to potential GOP donors in a thuggish attempt to depress Republican fund - raising .
A reader sent me a copy of the actual letter from “ Accountable America ” – the brainchild of the same MoveOn miscreants who spearheaded the General Betray Us smear .
Look :
Ironies and hypocrisies abound .
Let us count the ways .
You ’ve got the nutroots brigade digging up the addresses of GOP donors to chill their political free speech while these same left - wing operatives and their followers label it “ stalking ” to publish public e-mail contact information for anti-war shills , or to Google Democrat donors , or to vet Democrat health care sob stories by actually reporting on their financial status .
When we do it , it ’s intimidation .
When they do , it ’s “ accountability . ”
Dan Riehl makes a related point about a liberal blogger who dug into the background of a McCain donor .
When we do it , it ’s bullying .
When they do it , it ’s journalism .
Can you imagine if a conservative group took it upon itself to send a “ WARNING ” letter to potential Democrat donors worded exactly like the MoveOn missive ?
Voter intimidation !
Speech suppression !
Politics of fear !
Climate of crushing dissent !
BushNazi tactics !
What do PFAW , the NAACP , the ACLU , and the rest of the purported champions of political free speech and intimidation - free elections have to say about the anti-GOP donor warning letters ?
How about you , Barry O , self - appointed crusader against the politics of fear ?
***
Update : Accountable America ’s website is here , describing itself as “ a non-partisan , non-profit corporation . ”
Now , Google “ Accountable America . ”
As of this moment , you ’ll see it described in the tagline as “ dedicated to electing Democrats to the state legislature across America . ”
Here ’s the screenshot :
That partisan tagline is also in the source code of the website ’s homepage ( hat tip : reader Kevin ) .

The latest book from The Washington Post 's Bob Woodward .is \ " The War Within . \ " | Courtesy Bob Woodward to reveal ' The War Within '
Bob Woodward ’s new book is shrouded in such mystery that even the title was a secret until now .
Publishing sources say the book , completed just three weeks ago and out Sept. 8 , is titled “ The War Within : A Secret White House History 2006 - 2008 . ”
Advertisement
The book 's revelations are likely to propel a re-examination of the Iraq war into the headlines just as the fall presidential campaign is taking off .
Woodward has had remarkable cooperation from all levels of the Bush administration , with National Security Adviser Stephen J. Hadley encouraging top officials to participate .
Administration officials tell Politico that Woodward spent two mornings with President Bush and interviewed Vice President Cheney , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and a host of other senior officials .
Woodward has regularly visited the White House , State Department , Pentagon , various intelligence agencies and the private homes of generals and other officials , high and low .
The Washington Post , where Woodward is an associate editor , will print juicy excerpts the day before the book ’s publication .
Under a rollout orchestrated by his literary representative , Washington super - lawyer Robert Barnett , Woodward will also appear on CBS ’s “ 60 Minutes ” the night before the book comes out .
On the Simon & Schuster and Amazon websites , the book is still listed as simply , “ Untitled on Bush , Volume IV . ”
The title was first reported by The Associated Press .
The cover art — consisting entirely of stately red , white , blue and gold lettering — is seen here for the first time .
“ Cover to be unveiled , ” the websites say .
The book , initially listed as 352 pages , wound up at 496 .
The first printing is 900,000 hardback copies , printed at heavy extra expense because of the late - breaking close , the publishing sources said .
White House officials say they are optimistic that the book , which the publisher says “ declassifies the secrets of America 's political and military involvement in Iraq , ” will reflect more favorably on Bush than Woodward ’s previous volume , “ State of Denial , ” which came out in September 2006 .
The president ’s surge strategy for Iraq , albeit late , has slowed the violence on the ground , and Bush aides believe the book will reflect that .
As usual , though , Woodward is holding his cards close .
Even officials who have discussed the project with him repeatedly are uncertain how Bush will look .
The title suggests a heavy dose of administration infighting .
Alice Mayhew , editorial director of Simon & Schuster and the book ’s editor , said in a statement : “ There has not been such an authoritative and intimate account of presidential decision making since the Nixon tapes and the Pentagon Papers .
This is the declassification of what went on in secret , behind the scenes . ”
The book is Woodward 's 15th .
Eleven have been No. 1 national nonfiction best - sellers , including the first three in this series — " Bush at War " ( 2002 ) , " Plan of Attack " ( 2004 ) and " State of Denial " ( 2006 ) .

, professional tennis player and reigning Wimbledon Women 's singles and doubles champion , was out and about in Los Angeles on Wednesday night .
She attended the ESPY after party at the Green Door in Hollywood .
The lovely athlete was immediately bombarded by paparazzi when she left the event at the end of the evening .
The photographers captured several photos showing more cleavage than the talented star cared to share so she took up the offer by another party goer and quickly donned a tan suit coat to cover her deeply plunging dress front , which appeared to be open to her waist .
This mega star looks so surprised to be attracting attention .
She may be savvy on the tennis court but can't figure out that an open to the waist dress will ALWAYS attract a great deal of attention .
Interesting .

( CNN ) -- As Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama battle over who has the best approach to national security , a new CNN poll finds Americans ' concerns about terrorism have hit an all - time low for the post - September 11 era .
A poll finds fewer Americans fear an imminent terror attack than at any time since September 11 , 2001 .
According to a CNN / Opinion Research Corp. survey released Wednesday , 35 percent of Americans believe a terrorist attack somewhere in the United States is likely over the next several weeks .
The figure is the lowest in a CNN poll since the September 11 , 2001 , al Qaeda attacks , which killed nearly 3,000 people .
Between 2002 and 2006 , summertime polls typically showed that a majority of Americans believed that a terrorist attack was likely .
Last summer , that figure dropped to 41 percent .
This summer , it dropped another 6 percentage points .
The latest CNN poll also indicates that the war in Iraq remains deeply unpopular .
Three in 10 voters favor the war , while 68 percent oppose it .
Similarly , a third of voters would like to see the next president keep the same number of troops in Iraq that are stationed there now .
See how the poll numbers stack up »
For McCain , who is seeking to highlight his national security credentials and has staunchly defended the U.S. presence in Iraq , the latest poll results may not be viewed in a positive light .
" Sen. McCain 's greatest strength is in foreign policy , particularly his reputation as the candidate best able to fight the war on terror , " said Keating Holland , CNN 's polling director .
" As the threat of a terrorist attack continues to recede in the mind of the American voter , the state of the economy and other domestic issues are likely to become even more important .
That would be good news for Sen.
Obama , since the Democrats currently beat or tie the Republicans on every issue except terrorism . "
Another potential problem for McCain may be found in President Bush 's latest job approval ratings .
According to the survey , 30 percent of Americans approve of how Bush is handling his job , while 68 percent disapprove of Bush 's job performance .
These numbers are roughly consistent with the president 's approval ratings over most of the last two years .
They also reinforce the need for the presumptive Republican nominee to create an impression of distance and distinction between himself and Bush .
Democrats , on the other hand , are eager to tie McCain to the unpopular outgoing president and portray his possible election as the equivalent of a third Bush term .
The poll , conducted Thursday through Sunday by phone , surveyed 1,026 adult Americans and carries a sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points .

Former White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan says he is hesitant about working as a pundit .
| John Shinkle / POLITICO
McClellan 's next step : Changing D.C .
There may not be second acts in America , but White House - press - secretary - turned - best - selling - memoirist Scott McClellan is looking for a third .
Since the release of “ What Happened ” in early June , McClellan has been in the whirlwind of a nationwide book tour .
Now that his publicity commitments have tapered off , and as he awaits some of that sweet royalty coin — he got a $ 75,000 advance for a book that has sold more than 175,000 copies — McClellan says the time has come for him to figure out what ’s next .
Advertisement
“ I ’d like to — whether it is a full - time commitment or something — continue working on some of the ways I talk about in the book to change the way Washington works , or so forth , improving governance in Washington , ” he said last week over lunch in Arlington , Va .
McClellan considers himself liberated , freed from the bonds of always speaking for somebody else .
But this freedom , 2 ½ years in the making , is not one McClellan has seized zealously .
He seems in no hurry to put any new cards on the table .
With the book , he ’s got the financial wherewithal to bide his time .
With his old job behind him , he ’s got the space to remain — like Colin Powell — undecided in the presidential race .
“ I ’m in some respects where he is , ” said McClellan , “ or he ’s where I am , thinking this through . ”
The Bush White House platitudes McClellan once trafficked in have been replaced by the bipartisan axioms that dot his book .
Where McClellan once muttered things like “ stay the course , ” these days he ’s all atwitter about the “ permanent campaign , ” the “ Washington game ” and the “ culture of deception . ”
They ’re time - worn clichés , to be sure , but McClellan utters them with a sense of sheer revelation .
Instead of ratcheting up his criticism , or even crystallizing his own positions on policy or politics , he has spent a great deal of effort in these intervening months diffusing it , being amorphous at times to the point of self - contradiction .
“ It can be difficult , even painful , to look back on our own mistakes , ” McClellan writes in the last paragraph of “ What Happened . ”
“ It ’s tempting to focus on the obvious triumphs or ignore history altogether in our constant quest for a better tomorrow .
But I ’m convinced there ’s much to be gained from thoughtful , candid and probing self - examination ... and that requires an honest look at what happened . ”
And yet , when asked what advice he would give to a President Barack Obama or Democratic Congress on the matter of handling former Bush officials , McClellan speaks now of the perils of probing the past .
“ If Obama were to win , ” he said last week , “ that would be an issue his administration would have to face early ... because he ’s pledging to be a uniter , not a divider — without saying those exact words we campaigned on in 2000 .
He ’s pledging to change the way Washington works , and if Congress were to pursue that , it would be very divisive . ”
He continued : “ That could be very problematic for his presidency right off the start . ”
McClellan found himself tap - dancing recently after making some unintended news on MSNBC ’s “ Hardball . ”
Chris Matthews pressed McClellan about a nexus between the Bush administration and Fox News , at which point it seemed that McClellan confirmed the host ’s suspicion that Bill O’Reilly was a partaker of White House talking points .
An infuriated O’Reilly pushed back on the air .
“ There are some of the media wars between the networks and I do n’t want to insert myself into that , ” McClellan said , “ and I told O’Reilly that when I went on to his radio program . ”
O’Reilly , in turn , railed against McClellan for being a puppet of NBC .
McClellan apologized and later clarified on O’Reilly ’s radio program that he had n’t meant to implicate him .
O’Reilly is “ leaving a false impression , ” McClellan said .
“ But I understand he ca n’t acknowledge a mistake , because there are plenty of critics out there who could jump all over it . ”
As for a future career in punditry — a natural choice for someone who has now seen both sides — McClellan said he spoke recently to an agent who was advocating it .
He ’s hesitant .
At the moment , he sits on the International Advisory Council of APCO Worldwide , the international communications consultancy .
He resigned his job as a senior vice president at HHB Inc. , a technology and consulting firm , before his book was published .
He mentioned an interest in an academic position , and he would n’t even rule out the possibility of being a political or campaign spokesman in the distant future .
“ If I did , ” he said , “ there would have to be some very clear understandings and expectations at the beginning . ”
Having floated , back in May , the idea that he could vote for Obama , McClellan says he ’s now no closer to deciding how he ’ll vote in November .
“ There is so much one person can do , and you do n’t even know if that person is fully committed to doing what he says he ’s going to do , ” McClellan said .
Still , he takes a notably harsher tone toward John McCain .
“ I do n’t like the direction his campaign is going right now , ” McClellan said .
“ I think it ’s become a mistake to accentuate the negative strategy .
It ’s this win - at - all - costs mentality , and in some ways it comes across as a little desperate to me . ”
McClellan said he still has n’t spoken with President Bush or any senior administration officials — current or former — since his book was released .
He said he hopes he ’s able to renew some of those friendships after the election .
He also said he would look forward to reading Powell ’s insider ’s account of the administration .
“ I do n’t know if he ’ll do it , ” McClellan said .
“ But ... I think you ’ll get the most candid look at things from him , and that ’s not to denigrate any other books that might be written .
... I think Powell is the kind of guy [ who ] would n’t do it unless he spoke candidly and honestly about what occurred without any political manipulation that might be seen in others . ”
The idea of writing another book is not off the table , and friends have joked that McClellan should write a sequel , something to the effect of “ What Happened Since ‘ What Happened . ’ ”
Short answer : Nothing in and of itself .
The problem occurs when conversations about women can’t happen on unmoderated blogs without someone showing up and saying , “ but [ x ] happens to men , too ! ” ( also known as a “ Patriarchy Hurts Men , Too ” or PHMT argument , or a “ What About The Mens ? ” or WATM argument ) .
When this happens , it becomes disruptive of the discussion that ’s trying to happen , and has the effect ( intended or otherwise ) of silencing women ’s voices on important issues such as rape and reproductive rights .
When and why PHMT arguments become inappropriate
No one is saying that discussions on men and masculinities should n’t go on .
It is absolutely important to have dialogue on men ’s issues , including discussions on violence done towards men .
The thing is , a feminist space — unless the topic is specifically men ’s issues — is not the place to have that discussion and neither are spaces ( feminist or otherwise ) in which the topic is specifically focused on women ’s issues .
What it boils down to is this :
Men , not women , need to be the ones creating the spaces to discuss men ’s issues .
There are a lot of feminist allies who do this , in fact , and there also a lot of non-feminist ( or anti-feminist , if you really want to go there ) spaces that are welcoming to this kind of discussion .
Thus , the appropriate response to a thread about women is not to post a comment on it about men , but rather to find ( or make ) a discussion about men .
Why PHMT arguments are so frustrating
For those new to feminist discussion the angry reaction to PHMT arguments is most likely shocking and more than a little off - putting .
Especially if , to all appearances , the question was innocuous .
While it would probably best if all bloggers / commenters could stick to the 3 - comment rule , having to deal with the same disruptive comments — even when they are made with the best of intentions — is enough to try the patience of even the most patient of educators ( which most feminist bloggers and commenters are not ) .
Consider this comment :
Why is it we cannot have even one single public conversation about rape without someone taking the whole thread over with cries of oh the poor mens !
what about the mens ?
[ Jessica ( Australian court :
If you suck , you must fuck ) : Comment by JaclynF ]
I can easily see why a newbie reading that , especially if said newbie is a man who got into feminism by examining masculinities , could see JacylnF as hostile towards men .
I can definitely see how a man reading that might feel unwelcome and that feminism might not be the movement for him .
But let ’s look at it from my perspective .
I have been an active participant in the feminist blogsphere since 2005 , but have been a reader since the early 2000s .
I have seen multiple threads on women ’s issues — especially ones that are trying to talk about the impact of rape and other sexual violence against women — devolve into nothing more than justifying to MRA ’s , trolls , and other ( generally male ) posters why the conversation should be allowed to remain about women ’s experiences .
It was to the point that on my ( heavily moderated ) blog , I still had to write a disclaimer on the top of my post on women and equality that the post was n’t about men because practically every other comment I was getting was saying how unfair it was that I did n’t talk about men .
The phenomenon is so common that I co-authored a jurisimprudence law called The “ What About the Mens ? ” Phallusy * because I felt like you could n’t even mention the word “ rape ” without attracting people demanding that you talk about men getting raped .
So I completely understand why JacylnF and other feminists have no patience for even the well intentioned WATM comments because , frankly , I do n’t have patience for them either .
One thing I always try to impress upon the curious non-feminists who find my blog is that it is n’t about just one comment , but rather about a long and continuing history of WATM comments preventing meaningful discussion on women ’s issues .
It ’s also worth mentioning that , because of how many concern trolls feminist sites get , it ’s really hard to tell who ’s trying to argue in good faith and who is n’t .
How to avoid getting zinged for a PHMT argument
So the question remains : what can be done to prevent arguments over PHMT issues ?
The first , and easiest , step is to be mindful of the venue .
In order to help facilitate this , it is useful to consider questions such as the following :
What conversation is happening ?
Will discussing a male perspective / experience add something , or will it be seen as disruptive ?
Is there a more appropriate place to discuss my issues ?
If you feel that the present discussion topic is broad enough so as to welcome discussions from a male - based perspective , then please consider the following advice [ emphasis mine ] :
1 ) Understand that if lots of women say something is important , it is .
Your opinion , as a man , about the extent and nature of the problem is not valuable when the specific problem pertains to women ’s experience . [ … ]
2 ) Always consider the distinction between a class and individual members of a class .
If you do n’t care about this , and when conversations about class - based oppression you come up with examples of weaker members of the dominant class and more powerful members of the subordinate class , you look an awful lot like someone who does n’t care about justice .
Michael Jordan is better off than me .
This indicates precisely nothing about the importance of racism in our society . [ … ]
3 ) When you tell us about the male perspective on the issue ( “ Men do n’t intend it this way ! ” “ Men feel weak in relation to women ! ” ) consider that we already understand .
And then consider that the reason it looks to you like the male perspective is being excluded or misunderstood is that we ’re actually talking about ourselves , and the effect your actions have on us .
Further , you function as part of a larger system , and your introspection about your intent does n’t tell you much about how .
4 ) Try to pay attention to what ’s actually being said .
Before you respond to something , think hard about what their actual point is and whether you understand it .
If you do n’t understand it , ask questions . [ … ]
5 ) Do not draw up a bunch of hierarchies about which form of oppression is worse than which other .
When you do this , you ’re not responding to a claim that what we experience is the worst thing ever ; you just show up and start talking about why what the women say they experience is not as big of a deal as X , Y , or Z . [ … ]
Being a woman , no matter what demographic you come from , is an overwhelmingly structuring and determining aspect of your life .
In some ways it functions differently depending on your demographic , and in other ways there are striking commonalities , but in no sense is it dominated by other inequalities .
Being a woman magnifies the effects of all those inequalities .

Lastly , I would highly recommend reading up on male privilege , with special attention paid to what the role is for a privilege person entering the space of a non-privileged group ( I recommend starting with these two posts : A Deeper Look at “ Minority Spaces ” and “ Check my what ? ”
On privilege and what we can do about it ) .

Ultimately it is possible for men to both participate in feminist discussion and have meaningful conversations with feminists about men ’s issues .
It just takes some understanding of the issues in order to be able to find the right times and places for those conversations to happen .

WATM arguments as being dismissive of women ’s issues :
6 ) Do n’t say , “ Men have problems too !
Women are always doing mean things to men ! [ stamps foot ]
And we do n’t complain about it as much ! ”
Feminists love to talk about the ways men are ill - served by the current arrangement .
But if you ’re one of the guys who Have Problems
Too , you sound an awful lot like you ’re talking about men ’s problems to say , oh well , we all have something to be upset about , I guess there ’s not much reason to think anything ’s that unfair .
We bring up men ’s problems because we want things to change .
You bring them up because you ’re invested in the current system , and you want to tell us we do n’t have that much to complain about .
And when you constantly bring up that “ men have problems too ! ” you often indicate that not only do you not understand women ’s experience , you do n’t really understand that you do n’t understand .
You minimize what women experience by describing them in terms that do n’t begin to be accurate .
I ’m not sure whether the differences are of degree or of kind ( I suspect the latter ) , but women ’s experience is different from men’s .
Unless you ’re one of the men who already follow these ten simple rules for respecting feminist women , you probably do n’t understand the extent to which women are conditioned to see ourselves through an abstracted male gaze or the real one that ’s often present .
You ca n’t understand how women react to male judgment solely by introspection about how you react to female judgment , or judgment of any kind .
Unless you ’ve reached a high plane of understanding , and if you need this post , you have n’t , your comparisons are likely to illuminate the way our culture treats women ’s bodies only by contrast .

The problem with the “ Patriarchy Hurts Men , Too ” arguments :
But what bothers me about the idea of PHMT — and the way in which it is being relentlessly promoted — is that it trivializes the fact that patriarchy hurts women .
Women are the victims of patriarchy , and the suffering of men occurs as a secondary consequence of their role as oppressor .
The fact that patriarchy hurts women should be sufficient justification for fighting it .
An additional component of this frustration is the fact that men are more likely to be listened to than women .
Feminist arguments often are n’t taken seriously when articulated by women .
We are still in the midst of a backlash , and women who advocate their liberation are termed “ feminazis , ” “ bra burners , ” and a host of other degrading terms .
But when pro-feminist men articulate the same critiques of patriarchy , their position is seen as legitimate .
[ Virginia Jordan ( NinerOnline.com ) : Patriarchy hurts men , too
More on the “ Patriarchy Hurts Men , Too ” arguments :
There have been discussions in various feminist spaces of “ patriarchy hurts men too , ” but this is a difficult subject to deal with seriously because it is so often used by MRAs , rape apologists and other distasteful characters to justify the status quo , attack people trying to address real wrongs , or undermine female victims of violence , especially sexual assault and rape .

On men taking responsibility for facilitating discussions on men ’s issues :
Whether or not a similar play addressing men ’s issues is a good idea is n’t the point here .
The point is that the forum and the style in which this issue was brought up was inappropriate .
Women get so few chances in which to share our stories with each other , to find out that we are n’t alone in our experiences , and to have venues in which to publicly tell our stories .
The fact that women are beginning to organize and bring these things to their communities is nothing short of amazing .
If women can do this in the face of all the pressure from institutionalized sexism , then what ’s stopping men from doing the same ?
Why is it women ’s responsibility to make sure that men feel included by a presentation that , by its very name , is supposed to be about women reaching out to women ?
[ tekanji ( Official Shrub.com Blog ) :
Who ’s responsible for facilitating discussion on men ’s issues ?
On why it is n’t necessary for posts on violence against women to mention violence against men :
Perhaps by not mentioning women ’s violence against men every time I talk about men ’s violence against men and women , I ’m somehow leaving out something fundamentally important .
I do n’t think so , and here ’s why : I think that these problems are big and complex enough that there is plenty of room for work on all fronts–and I think that pointing out , like TS is doing , that women do violence against men too every time somebody talks about violence men commit against men and women does less to draw attention to the violence women do to men and more to distract from the fact that men do a lot of violence against women , and against other men .
So , while I think the former is important and is worthy of discussion , and I think that it should be an important goal of feminist men to deal with the violence done by parents ( male and female ) against boys ( and girls ! and people of all genders ! ) , that does n’t mean that I think it should always be the topic of discussion , or always the most important facet of the subject of patriarchy and violence .

The Vatican has blamed a weak dollar for pushing it into its first loss in four years by undermining the value of dollar - denominated donations by the faithful .
Annual accounts published this week show the Holy See fell into the red last year , recording a loss of € 9.1 m ( £ 7.25 m ) .
The US currency has fallen sharply against the euro since the start of last year , hitting the Holy See in the pocket as its expenses are incurred in euros .
Much of the Vatican 's income comes from donations by Catholics around the world .
The US was the largest single contributor to Peter 's Pence - the collection used by the Pope for charitable donations - sending almost $ 19 m ( £ 9.5 m ) .
But the shortfall attributed mainly to the weak dollar was mitigated by a rise of € 4 m in property income .
The Holy See is a major owner of property all over Rome and was criticised last year for raising rents and threatening to evict tenants .
Earlier this year , the Vatican released a new list of mortal sins which included " accumulating excessive wealth " .
Estimates of its own wealth vary , with some reports putting it at £ 4bn .
Last year a political row broke out over the tax exemptions enjoyed by the Catholic church in Italy .
Under a deal first hammered out in 1929 , it does not pay property taxes .
The Holy See 's 2007 budget statement was finalised last week .
It showed an overall income of € 236.7 m , while expenses totalled € 245.8 m .
Before the dollar 's decline hammered its income , the Vatican had recorded three years of profits totalling over € 15 m .
Its media operations , which include Vatican Radio and the official newspaper , lost € 14.6 m last year .

US missile shield nothing to celebrate : Polish town 's mayor
by Staff Writers
Warsaw ( AFP ) Aug 14 , 2008
As Warsaw and Washington clinch a deal on basing part of a US missile shield in Poland , the mood of the mayor is grim in the northern town which is the planned home of the silos .
" This is a day of mourning for us , " Mariusz Chmiel , mayor of the small northern Polish community of Redzikowo , told AFP in a telephone interview .
" The shield is meant to defend the United States , not us .
On the contrary , all it will do is put us in danger , " Chmiel said after Polish and US negotiators inked a preliminary accord in Warsaw .
Washington plans to base 10 interceptor missiles in Poland plus a radar facility in the neighbouring Czech Republic by 2011 - 2013 to complete a system already in place in the United States , Greenland and Britain .
Washington insists the shield is meant to fend off potential missile attacks by " rogue states " , notably Iran .
The plan , however , has become a major source of tension with Moscow .
It considers it a security threat designed to undermine Russia 's nuclear deterrent , and has vowed a firm response if the Czechs and Poles go ahead .
The matter is all the more sensitive because the Czech Republic and Poland were Soviet satellites until 1989 , before transforming into staunch US allies when the communist bloc collapsed .
They joined NATO in 1999 and the European Union in 2004 .
Redzikowo , near the northern Polish town of Slupsk , was picked by US and Polish missile shield planners because it is home to a mothballed communist - era base .
The prospect of again becoming a military hub reminds locals of the Cold War , when Poland was part the Soviet - led Warsaw Pact military alliance -- and Redzikowo was among the likely targets for a NATO attack .
" Russia has already warned that if the shield 's set up , it will react .
The situation in Georgia shown perfectly well that you have to take Russian threats seriously , " said Chmiel .
Redzikowo's derelict 400 - hectare ( 988 - acre ) former Polish army and air force base , once hosted 2,500 servicemen and has a 2.3 - kilometre ( 1.4 mile ) runway -- " the longest in Poland , " Chmiel noted .
Before World War II , when the region was part of Germany , Redzikowo was also an air force base .
Luftwaffe bombers took off from there when Germany began the war by attacking Poland in September 1939 .
Besides the Polish military base , the Soviet Red Army was also stationed in this area of northern Poland perched on the Baltic coast , most notably at the top - security site at nearby Borne - Sulinowo .
Red Army bases across Poland were considered Soviet territory .
" We would have preferred the old runway to be used for a civilian airport so we could increase tourism on the beautiful Baltic beaches , " Chmiel said .
The sandy shores are just 10 kilometers ( six miles ) away .
Thick forests attract hunters , while anglers fish for trout in the area 's pristine rivers .
According to an opinion poll earlier this year , 60 percent of residents of the region oppose the shield and 30 percent are in favour .
Supporters argue that a US base would be a big economic boost for the area .
Some 300 US soldiers are expected to be posted in the area , along with their families -- a total of around 1,200 people .

CANBERRA ( Reuters ) - A plea for lovelorn female “ ugly ducklings ” to move to a remote Australian mining town to reverse a shortage of eligible women has landed the local mayor in hot water .
Mt Isa Mayor John Molony was refusing to apologize on Monday for angering local women with a suggestion that “ with five blokes to every girl , may I suggest that beauty - disadvantaged women should proceed to Mount Isa , ” in north - west Queensland state .
“ Quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face .
Whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening , there is a degree of happiness , ” Molony told the Townsville Bulletin newspaper last week .
“ Some , in other places in Australia , need to proceed to Mount Isa where happiness awaits .
Really , beauty is only skin deep .
Is n’t there a fairy tale about an ugly duckling that evolves into a beautiful swan , ” Molony said .
The mayor said he was “ telling it like it is ” in a testosterone - laden town more famous for cowboys and mining lead , silver , copper and zinc than for match - making , sitting atop one of the world ’s biggest underground mines .
“ I ’m a bloke who respects women .
I believe we should look after women .
I ’m told men outnumber women here by five to one .
If that ’s the case , then perhaps it ’s an opportunity for some lonely women , ” Molony said .
Fellow council members and the local chamber of commerce said they had been swamped with phone calls from both women and men complaining about the mayor ’s remarks .
“ It paints the women here as second rate and suggests the men will settle for anything .
I think it ’s quite disgusting , ” Mt Isa domestic violence worker Shirley Slann told the Courier Mail newspaper on Monday .

By now , nearly everyone ’s heard about Michael Phelps ’s Olympic medal quest .
But for those of us who have watched the swimming competitions thus far , there ’s one competitor you just can’t ignore : those black and gray , space - age looking suits that nearly every athlete is wearing .
The wetsuit - style Speedo LZR Racer ( here ’s a pic ) is one reason world records continue to be broken in swimming .
The science behind the suit includes “ ultrasonically welded ” seams and panels of drag - reducing fabric tested by NASA .
But the main benefit of the suit is how it fits : tightly .
So tightly that it acts as a sort of corset , helping swimmers maintain an aqua - dynamic form and supporting abdominal muscles when they tire at the end of the race .
Since the suit was introduced in February of 2008 , more than 50 world records have been broken by athletes wearing it .
American swimmer Ryan Lochte , who won a bronze this week in the individual medley , said wearing the suit makes it feel like you ’re “ swimming downhill . ”
Even Chinese athletes cannot resist the American - made suit , though they covered the Speedo logo with duct tape .
However , the super - suit has been seen as “ tech doping ” by some critics , and others say it ’s not fair to countries who ca n’t afford the suit .
After all , the suits ( which cost around $ 600 each ) must be thrown out after an athlete has used them 10 times , similar to the way baseballs are discarded after only a few pitches .
In the US , Nike was generous enough to allow the athletes it sponsored to wear the suits gratis .
But other companies , and countries , may not be as generous , or are effectively handicapped because their regulations do not allow sponsorship deals ( This year Japan changed its regulations to allow use of the LZR ) .
There ’s also the issue of how much tech help is too much .
The swimsuit ’s polyurethane layers give its users additional buoyancy .
Certainly the inordinate number of world records set by those using the suit are proof that it does give competitors that extra tenth or hundredth of a second .
What do you think : is the LZR unfair advantage , or just athletes using the best of what ’s available ?

The victory stance of a gold medalist and the slumped shoulders of a non-finalist are innate and biological rather than learned responses to success and failure , according to a University of British Columbia study using cross-cultural data gathered at the 2004 Olympic and Paralympic Games .
In the first study of its kind , UBC psychology researcher Jessica Tracy investigated how pride and shame are expressed across cultures , and among the congenitally blind .
She compared the non-verbal expressions and body language of sighted , blind , and congenitally blind judo competitors representing more than 30 countries , among them Algeria , Taiwan , North Korea , the Ukraine and the United States .
Asst. Prof . Tracy 's findings – published in this week 's online Early Edition of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences – show that the individuals displayed pride and shame behaviours in response to the same success and failure situations .
Pride , unlike fear , anger or joy – which are categorized as primary emotions – has received little research attention in the past , explains Tracy .
Her work explores how pride as an innate human biological response has evolved through time and shapes human social dynamics .
" Since congenitally blind individuals could not have learned pride and shame behaviors from watching others , these displays of victory or defeat are likely to be an innate biological propensity in humans , rather than learned behaviour , " says Tracy .
Tracy and co-author Psychology Prof. David Matsumoto of San Francisco State University analyzed photos taken by an official International Judo Federation photographer who was not told about the specific research goals .
The photographer shot the athletes during and immediately after each match , repeatedly for approximately 15 seconds , allowing for a series of moment - by moment images of each behavioural response .
The researchers coded the athletes ' head , arms and body positions .
They found that winning athletes , both sighted and blind and across all cultures , tended to raise their arms , tilt their head up and puff out their chest .
Also largely universal were the expressions of defeat , which include slumped shoulders and a narrowed chest .
The researchers found that , to some extent , culture moderated the shame response among sighted athletes .
It was less pronounced among individuals from highly individualistic , self - expression - valuing cultures , primarily in North America and West Eurasian countries .
However , congenitally blind athletes across cultures showed the shame response , suggesting that the cultural difference found among sighted athletes was due to the Western cultural norm of hiding one 's shame .
" These findings support evolutionary accounts that pride and shame would have been powerful mechanisms in enhancing or inhibiting an individual 's social status , " says Tracy .
" I was asked this question when signing up for a bank account , " wrote James .
" I was going to answer ' The ' , but was surprised to find this rather limited selection ... "
" My new cellphone came with a very special charger , " Jan commented , " I mean , I 've heard about just - in - time production , but this ? "
" I was looking for a Transformers ' Tooth Tunes ' Toothbrush for my nephew , " Trisha wrote , " and came across this .

Tech rigged S.F. computer meltdown , prosecutors say SAN FRANCISCO Prosecutors argue booby trap would cause files to disappear during routine maintenance
Terry Childs envisioned the ultimate revenge on his bosses , prosecutors say - the meltdown of the city 's computer network at the flick of a switch .
And it would come not directly at the hands of Childs , but during routine system maintenance at the building that houses the city 's Technology Department .
The alleged plot was discovered before the computer network that handles law enforcement documents , payroll records , officials ' e-mail and other sensitive city records was shut down for scheduled maintenance last Saturday , an action that would have vaporized numerous files because of a booby - trap Childs had installed , prosecutors said in court documents filed Wednesday .
Childs , 43 , has been jailed since July 13 on four felony counts of computer tampering after he allegedly locked his bosses at the Technology Department out of the system and refused to hand over the password he had created .
In arguing against a defense request to lower his $ 5 million bail , prosecutors said Childs had set up more than 1,000 computer modems in locked cabinets and other hiding places , including at least one in a room at the Hall of Justice that even police did n't know existed , to tinker with the system without his bosses knowing it .
Childs did n't hand over the access codes to the computer system until a jailhouse meeting with Mayor Gavin Newsom on Monday - two days after the network was to have been taken down for the routine maintenance .
" He had a malicious intent to destroy the entire network , " prosecutor Conrad del Rosario said .
Childs ' lawyer , Erin Crane , called the allegation " spurious " and said Childs is the victim of bosses who resent his expertise .
" When they could n't get rid of him , " they created a false image of a " rogue employee " out to terrorize the city , Crane said .
After a Superior Court hearing Wednesday , Judge Lucy Kelly McCabe refused to lower bail .
Childs remains in the city jail pending a hearing Sept. 24 .
Run-in with security chief
According to prosecutors ' court filing , Childs ' actions first came to authorities ' attention the evening of June 20 when the city 's new chief of network security , Jeana Pieralde , conducted an audit of the FiberWAN network housed at One Market Street Plaza .
His bosses were already worried that Childs was being increasingly hostile toward supervisors and had taken over a room and installed a bank of computers , prosecutors said .
They did n't know exactly what he was doing .
Childs was upset that no one had told him of the audit and used his cell phone to photograph Pieralde .
Frightened , she locked herself in an office and later reported the incident to police .
Crane said Childs was angry that Pieralde was " ( going ) through his things " and had photographed her because she was taking away a device that did n't belong to her .
A supervisor in the Technology Department , Rich Robinson , also filed a police report about the incident and quoted Childs as saying , " I 'm ready for you , Rich . "
Childs denies threatening anyone , Crane said .
Surprising find
On July 9 , after supplying his bosses with passwords to the system that turned out to be false , Childs was suspended .
The following week , with system administrators locked out of their network and Childs sitting in jail , a consultant advising the city discovered that Childs had rigged the network so that files would be erased if someone tried to figure out what the proper password was , prosecutors said .
Childs had created an ability to track anyone who tried to get into the system , kept his own e-mail server and had been using the modems locked in storage cabinets to create a private network , prosecutors said .
The consultant , Anthony Maupin , also found that because Childs had fashioned his makeshift system to run off temporary , short - term memory , a power outage - such as turning off the computer for maintenance - would mean full system failure , del Rosario said .
The system was rigged that way in May by a user named Maggot617 , a city computer analysis showed .
Prosecutors say " Maggot " was Childs .
" This setup or configuration is contrary to any logic of protecting the system , " del Rosario said .
Childs was well aware of the scheduled system shutdown last Saturday , he said .
" The defendant had a note on his desk reflecting this power outage . "
Secret room
On Monday , when Childs supplied three user names and an access code to Newsom , officials learned they could use them to get onto the system only at a computer in a room at the Hall of Justice that even police technology experts were unaware of .
Investigators say they are still worried about the modems hidden away in locked filing cabinets in public buildings around the city .
Maupin told prosecutors that city officials estimate there are 1,100 such modems .
Childs could still gain access to the network through any of them and create more mischief , prosecutors say .
In arguing that his bail not be lowered , prosecutors said a search of Childs '
Pittsburg home turned up a co-worker 's identification .
They said they fear he could impersonate other employees to obtain access to the network .
They also said he had $ 10,000 cash on him when he was arrested , supporting their fear he would be a flight risk if released .
Childs ' attorney maintains Childs is being scapegoated by incompetent officials resentful of his abilities in computer network management .
The modems he installed in locked cabinets , she said in a bail reduction motion , were for the " sole purpose of maintaining the system . "
Some of the protections , she said , were put in place after Childs concluded that a colleague inadvertently infected the city 's network with a virus two years ago .
It was Childs who put up the firewalls , with management approval , she said .

The 21 - year - old Jamaican , who won silver in the 200 m at last year 's World Championships , was running the 100 m for just the fifth time .
Bolt beats the previous best of 9.74 set by compatriot Asafa Powell .
" I was n't looking for a world record but it was there for the taking so I just went out there and ran my best race , " he said .
The record - breaking time was ratified by the International Association of Athletics Federations on 4 August .
Bolt beat Tyson Gay into second place , with the American running a personal best of 9.85 .
The 6ft 5in Bolt made the track world sit up and take notice on 3 May when he clocked the second - fastest 100 m time in history , 9.76 seconds .
Bolt has made no secret of the fact that he sees himself as a 200 m specialist and earlier in the week he was still undecided if he would even enter the 100 m Jamaican Olympic trials .

However , after becoming the fastest man on the planet he confirmed he would now double up in Beijing : " I 'm definitely going to run the 100 in the Olympics .
" I 've just got to concentrate now and work on my 200 some more , because I have n't been doing a lot of 200 work . "
And despite setting the world record , Bolt still considers the Olympics to be the big prize .
" I do n't think there 's any comparison between the two , " he said .
" You 've got to be Olympic champion or world champion to really count .
" Tomorrow if someone comes and runs faster than me I 'm no longer the fastest man in the world .
If you 're the Olympic champion then they have to wait four more years to get you again .
" I think the Olympics is the biggest thing , so I 'm looking for that , definitely . "
Bolt has primarily used the shorter distance to improve his start and admitted he was happy there had been a false start the first time he went into the blocks .

What happened with Fedora - and Red Hat too
From : " Paul W. Frields " < stickster - AT- gmail.com >
To : fedora - announce - list < fedora- announce - list - AT- redhat.com >
Subject : Infrastructure report , 2008-08-22 UTC 1200 Date : Fri , 22 Aug 2008 08:00:02 - 0400 Message -ID : < 1219406402.21605.24.camel@victoria >
Last week we discovered that some Fedora servers were illegally accessed .
The intrusion into the servers was quickly discovered , and the servers were taken offline .
Security specialists and administrators have been working since then to analyze the intrusion and the extent of the compromise as well as reinstall Fedora systems .
We are using the requisite outages as an opportunity to do other upgrades for the sake of functionality as well as security .
Work is ongoing , so please be patient .
Anyone with pertinent information relating to this event is asked to contact fedora-legal@redhat.com .
One of the compromised Fedora servers was a system used for signing Fedora packages .
However , based on our efforts , we have high confidence that the intruder was not able to capture the passphrase used to secure the Fedora package signing key .
Based on our review to date , the passphrase was not used during the time of the intrusion on the system and the passphrase is not stored on any of the Fedora servers .
While there is no definitive evidence that the Fedora key has been compromised , because Fedora packages are distributed via multiple third - party mirrors and repositories , we have decided to convert to new Fedora signing keys .
This may require affirmative steps from every Fedora system owner or administrator .
We will widely and clearly communicate any such steps to help users when available .
Among our other analyses , we have also done numerous checks of the Fedora package collection , and a significant amount of source verification as well , and have found no discrepancies that would indicate any loss of package integrity .
These efforts have also not resulted in the discovery of additional security vulnerabilities in packages provided by Fedora .
Our previous warnings against further package updates were based on an abundance of caution , out of respect for our users .
This is also why we are proceeding with plans to change the Fedora package signing key .
We have already started planning and implementing other additional safeguards for the future .
At this time we are confident there is little risk to Fedora users who wish to install or upgrade signed Fedora packages .
In connection with these events , Red Hat , Inc. detected an intrusion of certain of its computer systems and has issued a communication to Red Hat Enterprise Linux users which can be found at http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2008-0855.html.
This communication states in part , " Last week Red Hat detected an intrusion on certain of its computer systems and took immediate action .
While the investigation into the intrusion is on - going , our initial focus was to review and test the distribution channel we use with our customers , Red Hat Network ( RHN ) and its associated security measures .
Based on these efforts , we remain highly confident that our systems and processes prevented the intrusion from compromising RHN or the content distributed via RHN and accordingly believe that customers who keep their systems updated using Red Hat Network are not at risk .
We are issuing this alert primarily for those who may obtain Red Hat binary packages via channels other than those of official Red Hat subscribers . "
It is important to note that the effects of the intrusion on Fedora and Red Hat are * not* the same .
Accordingly , the Fedora package signing key is not connected to , and is different from , the one used to sign Red Hat Enterprise Linux packages .
Furthermore , the Fedora package signing key is also not connected to , and is different from , the one used to sign community Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux ( EPEL ) packages .
We will continue to keep the Fedora community notified of any updates .
Thank you again for your patience .

Wenn über Jugendarbeitslosigkeit , - gewalt , - alhoholkonsum usw .
usw .
gesprochen wird , heißt es häufig , die Jugendlichen hätten keine Werte , ihnen müssten Ziele vermittelt werden .
Stimmt nicht !
Die Jugend hat Ziele .
Woher ich das weiß ?
Ganz einfach .
Man muss der Jugend einfach nur mal zuhören .
Dann erzählt sie dir ganz von selbst von ihren Zielen .
So geschehen als ich neulich auf dem Heimweg vom Büro war .
Da kamen mir zwei Jungs entgegen .
Zugegeben , auf den ersten Blick hätte man sie leichtfertig in eine dieser Schubladen einordnen können .
Äußerlich passten sie auch in ein typisches Gangster - Rap - Video .
Die Cap des einen saß absurd schief auf seinem Kopf , weder modisch noch chic , eher lächerlich , aber das ist Geschmacksache .
Die Stimmen schon von fern laut zu hören , wenn auch nicht zu verstehen .
Auschweifende Gesten mit Armen und Händen , was wiederum an ein Rap - oder Hip - Hop - Video erinnerte .
Als wir uns einander näherten erwartete ich vielleicht ein rythmisches » Jo , Mann « oder » Digger « zu hören .
Doch mitnichten .
Im Vorbeigehen erwischte ich ein nur einen Satz in miserablem Deutsch : » Ich will den Typen kaltmachen , das ist mein Ziel , Alter . «
Mit einem leichten Schmunzeln und voller Zufriedenheit ging ich weiter meines Weges .
Die deutsche Jugend hat also doch noch Ziele .
Foo camp attendee Ben Black alerted me to Adhearsion , a framework for developing applications in the VoIP space .
Think of it as a Ruby on Rails for telephony .
Developed by Jay Philllps who got frustrated by the slow uptake of Asterisk .
Adhearsion is written in Ruby and lets those even without any VoIP experience write applications intuitively and productively or simply download and use a pre-written solution .
With the framework extension architecture , VoIP functionality can now be actually traded around – an issue the VoIP industry has always suffered from .
A fresh , standard Adhearsion system out of the box does what many companies spend thousands on .
It includes a wide – and growing – set of features that should not have to be rewritten for every business that wants to implement them .
And yes , this is open - source .
Considering Microsoft spent around $ 800 M on Tellme , I look forward to see what kind of applications this leads to , and what value they generate .
We often forget the enormous market for telephone based services .

I found a really exciting video lecture by Guy L. Steele that I 'd like to share with you .
The title of the lecture is " Growing a Language " .
The main thing Guy Steele asks during the lecture is " If I want to help other persons to write all sorts of programs , should I design a small programming language or a large one ? "
He answers that he should build neither a small , nor a big language .
He needs to design a language that can grow .
The main goal in designing a language should be to plan for growth .
The language must start small , and the language must grow as the set of users grows .
As an example , he compares APL and Lisp .
APL did not allow its users to grow the language in a " smooth " way .
Adding new primitives to the language did not look the same as built - in primitives , this made users the language hard to grow .
In Lisp , on the other hand , new words defined by the user look like language primitives , language primitives look like user defined words .
It made language users easily extend the language , share their code , and grow the language .
Mr. Steele also prepared a PDF of his talk .
Download it here ( mirror , just in case : here ) .
He currently works at Sun Microsystems and he is responsible for research in language design and implementation strategies .
His bio page on Sun Microsystems page says : " He has been praised for an especially clear and thorough writing style in explaining the details of programming languages . "
This lecture really shows it .
I understood what he was up to from the very beginning of the lecture .
Only after the first ten minutes
Guy revealed that " his firm rule for this talk is that if he needs to use a word of two or more syllables , he must define it . "
Another thing Guy Steele shows with this talk is how a small language restricts the expressiveness of your thoughts .
First you must define a lot of new words to be able to express yourself clearly and quickly .
? Should a programming language be small or large ?
A small programming language might take but a short time to learn .
A large programming language may take a long , long time to learn , but then it is less hard to use , for we then have a lot of words at hand — or , I should say , at the tips of our tongues — to use at the drop of a hat .
If we start with a small language , then in most cases we can not say much at the start .
We must first define more words ; then we can speak of the main thing that is on our mind . [...]
If you want to get far at all with a small language , you must first add to the small language to make a language that is more large .
He gives many more interesting points how languages should be grown .
Just watch the lecture !
He defined the following words during the lecture : woman , person , machine , other , other than , number , many , computer , vocabulary , language , define , program , definition , example , syllable , primitive , because , design , twenty , thirty , forty , hundred , million , eleven , thirteen , fourteen , sixteen , seven , fifty , ago , library , linux , operating system , cathedral , bazaar , pattern , datum , data , object , method , generic type , operator , overloaded , polymorphic , complex number , rational number , interval , vector , matrix , meta .

SPACE technology has been a sinew of military power ever since the Soviet Union shocked America into the space race when it launched Sputnik 1 into orbit 51 years ago .
The rivalry is about more than bragging rights .
The rockets that carry space - bound payloads are close relatives of the intercontinental missiles that carry enemy - bound warheads .
And satellites furnish information and communications to soldier and civilian alike .
So it is only natural for America , now the leader in space , to try to protect its dominance and prevent weapons proliferating by controlling the export of its space technology .
Yet rarely has such a reasonable aim been so self - defeating .
The system of export controls , known as the International Traffic in Arms Regulations ( ITAR ) , is managed with almost comic zeal by the State Department .
Anything that is part of a satellite assembly needs vetting — even if it is as common as a lithium - ion battery , as insignificant as a screw or as innocuous as a stand for a satellite ( see article ) .
The cost , delays and inconvenience of dealing with the American space industry are exasperating enough to send its foreign partners into orbit .
Which is exactly where they have been going — on their own .
The American space industry 's share of commercial - satellite manufacturing has fallen from over 80 % before 1999 to 50 % now .
The French are going great guns with an “ ITAR - free ” design .
The Canadians , who once looked to their allies across the border for their satellites , have found that they can buy everything they need elsewhere .
You might argue that keeping American technology out of foreign satellites was always the intention of the legislation , even if that harmed American firms .
Except that America 's export policy is harming both its industry and its security at the same time .
Much of the space technology that Europeans and others are now making poses no strategic threat .
It is just lost American business .
Foreign firms may not have bothered to develop their own technology if the American sort had been available .
And starved of revenues , the Pentagon fears , America 's space industry is now so vulnerable in places that national security is threatened — which is precisely the outcome the legislation sought to avoid .
High - handed
This week Barack Obama promised that , if elected , he would direct a review of ITAR with a special focus on space hardware .
Outdated restrictions , said his space - policy document , have cost American satellite and space - hardware makers billions of dollars in lost business .
If the space - export regime is typical , then similar mistakes are being made in other areas of defence technology , with similarly harmful consequences .
It makes sense for America to use trade restrictions to hamper foreign efforts in space .
But the country would be safer if parts of the industry were more profitable — otherwise firms are unlikely to innovate and may even go out of business .
ITAR needs reworking so that it concentrates on a few vital technologies that must not get into enemy hands , leaving the many commonplace technologies to commerce .
That is hard , admittedly , because space technology is complex and it is constantly evolving .
Moreover , bureaucrats would be expected to make judgments in favour of trade — in full knowledge that these could leave them open to the charge of allowing “ sensitive technology ” to leak to the enemy .
They will therefore need support from politicians .
People who work in the space business like to keep the motto per aspera ad astra close to their hearts .
It means “ through hardship to the stars ” .
It was never intended to be a bureaucrats ' charter .
“ Without minimizing the seriousness of the police officer ’s conduct or in any way condoning it , ” the Court of Appeal for Ontario ruled in Mr. Harrison ’s case in February , “ the exclusion of 77 pounds of cocaine , with a street value of several millions of dollars and the potential to cause serious grief and misery to many , would bring the administration of justice into greater disrepute than would its admission . ”
The case is now before the Canadian Supreme Court .
The United States is the only country to take the position that some police misconduct must automatically result in the suppression of physical evidence .
The rule applies whether the misconduct is slight or serious , and without regard to the gravity of the crime or the power of the evidence .
“ Foreign countries have flatly rejected our approach , ” said Craig M. Bradley , an expert in comparative criminal law at Indiana University .
“ In every other country , it ’s up to the trial judge to decide whether police misconduct has risen to the level of requiring the exclusion of evidence . ”
But there are signs that some justices on the United States Supreme Court may be ready to reconsider the American version of the exclusionary rule .
Writing for the majority two years ago , Justice Antonin Scalia said that at least some unconstitutional conduct ought not require “ resort to the massive remedy of suppressing evidence of guilt . ”
The court will soon have an opportunity to clarify matters .
The justices will hear arguments on Oct. 7 about whether methamphetamines and a gun belonging to Bennie Dean Herring , of Brundidge , Ala. , should be suppressed because the officers who conducted the search mistakenly believed he was subject to an outstanding arrest warrant as a result of careless record - keeping by another police department .
CHICAGO , July 23 ( Reuters ) - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke faces a potential mauling from three policy hawks in August that may test his apparent desire to keep interest rates steady until the smoke clears a bit more in financial markets .
Analysts sense that the outcome predicted by financial markets for the Aug. 5 meeting of the monetary policy - setting Federal Open Market Committee -- a steady federal funds rate -- will come only after a bruising debate .
“ Hawkish comments from Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser raise the odds that three FOMC members will dissent at the August meeting , ” said economists at Lehman Brothers .
“ It would be the first time since November 1992 . ”
Plosser this week said the Fed should start to reverse course “ sooner rather than later , ” echoing comments Minneapolis Fed President Gary Stern delivered on Friday .
“ We ca n’t wait until we clearly observe the financial markets at normal , the economy growing robustly , and so on , ” said Stern , the Fed ’s longest - serving regional president but one who has not joined this year ’s jamboree of dissenters .
Dallas Fed chief Richard Fisher is arguably the ring - leader among the inflation hawks .
Of Fed officials who get a vote this year on rates , Fisher has been the most outspoken and has already registered four dissents in favor of tighter policy .
Even with dissent in the air , financial markets see just a 10 percent chance for an increase in benchmark overnight rates in August from their current 2 percent .
By September , however , perceived prospects for a rate increase jump to 68 percent .
Dealers fully price a hike by October and a possible year - end federal funds rate of 2.5 percent .
BERNANKE RULES
Still , Bernanke last week seemed to imply that the Fed is still a ways from a rate increase .
If he prevails , the sense of his leadership of the Fed will be enhanced .
In contrast to the recent sharp rhetoric from Stern and Plosser , Bernanke suggested to Congress that greater stability in the financial system needs to be achieved before the Fed will act .
The global credit crunch , now approaching its first anniversary , has produced several false dawns , only to catch markets and policy - makers by surprise by taking a new and more damaging turn .
The assessment offered by the FOMC after its last meeting in late June that downside risks to growth had “ diminished somewhat ” was summarily ditched by Bernanke last week .
“ Chairman Bernanke is clearly first among equals .
Therefore , conflicts between his take on the world and those of other members should generally be resolved in his favor , ” Ed McKelvey , economist at Goldman Sachs , said in a research note .
Indeed , a study this week by the economic forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers showed that Bernanke now towers above the FOMC crowd in his ability to move markets , and presumably to telegraph the path of monetary policy .
More tolerance for open dissent seems to be a hallmark of the Fed under Bernanke ’s leadership , making the prospect of three dissents less of a crisis than it might appear .
Speaking in Tacoma , Washington in May on the Fed ’s inner workings , San Francisco Fed President Janet Yellen said a more direct interchange of views is encouraged by Bernanke .
“ Dissent and open discussion are important in the process of policy - making , but the chairman ’s vote carries more weight , ” said Asha Bangalore , economist at Northern Trust in Chicago .
BRAKES ON INFLATION ?
In the week since Bernanke acknowledged a heightened level of financial stress , jitters have subsided enough to pull the U.S. stock market out of bear market territory .
Even so , some pundits consider the still - wide spread of the London interbank offered rate to the expected federal funds rate as a sign that strains continue and could flare up .
A Deutsche Bank index using various measures to gauge financial conditions shows that despite a string of rate cuts since mid-September , conditions are still weak and are likely to keep economic growth depressed .
Third - quarter growth also presents a challenge for an economy that so far has avoided a clear recession .
As the impact of tax rebate checks fades away , stagnation -- or worse -- in retail spending is possible .
“ The absence of tax rebate money in the third quarter will create an air pocket in consumer outlays .
We expect an outright decline for third - quarter real GDP , ” said Robert Barbera , economist at investment firm ITG in Rye Brook , New York .
Slow growth , weak labor markets and falling energy prices suggest the inflation crisis the Fed is suiting up to fight could partially resolve itself .
Headline inflation , which cried out for urgent policy action in June , could look different in July if recent declines in crude oil and commodity prices continue .
Goldman Sachs ’
McKelvey said that the shift to tightening will require a high bar characterized by three conditions : signs of stabilization in the labor market , the housing market and the financial markets .
“ An economy that fails to meet these conditions is not only vulnerable to rate increases , but also unlikely to experience a broad - based pickup in inflation , ” he said .

The ability to spot venomous snakes may have played a major role in the evolution of monkeys , apes and humans , according to a new hypothesis by Lynne Isbell , professor of anthropology at UC Davis .
The work is published in the July issue of the Journal of Human Evolution .
Primates have good vision , enlarged brains , and grasping hands and feet , and use their vision to guide reaching and grasping .
Scientists have thought that these characteristics evolved together as early primates used their hands and eyes to grab insects and other small prey , or to handle and examine fruit and other foods .
Isbell suggests instead that primates developed good close - up eyesight to avoid a dangerous predator -- the snake .
" A snake is the only predator you really need to see close up .
If it 's a long way away it 's not dangerous , " Isbell said .
Neurological studies by others show that the structure of the brain 's visual system does not actually fit with the idea that vision evolved along with reaching and grasping , Isbell said .
But the visual system does seem to be well connected to the " fear module , " brain structures involved in vigilance , fear and learning .
Fossils and DNA evidence show that snakes were likely the first serious predators of modern mammals , which evolved about 100 million years ago .
Fossils of snakes with mouths big enough to eat those mammals appear at about the same time .
Other animals that could have eaten our ancestors , such as big cats , and hawks and eagles , evolved much later .
Venomous snakes evolved about 60 million years ago , raising the stakes and forcing primates to get better at detecting them .
" There 's an evolutionary arms race between the predators and prey .
Primates get better at spotting and avoiding snakes , so the snakes get better at concealment , or more venomous , and the primates respond , " Isbell said .
Some primate groups less threatened by snakes show fewer signs of evolutionary pressure to evolve better vision .
For example , the lemurs of Madagascar do not have any venomous snakes in their environment , and in evolutionary terms " have stayed where they are , " Isbell said .
In South America , monkeys arrived millions of years before venomous snakes , and show less specialization in their visual system compared with Old World monkeys and apes , which all have good vision , including color .
Having evolved for one purpose , a good eye for color , detail and movement later became useful for other purposes , such as social interactions in groups .
Isbell is currently working on a book about primate origins , including her snake hypothesis .
Pictured :
The dramatic moment a 15 - year - old Iraqi suicide bomber gave herself up
Tears streaming down her face , she is confronted by police - a teenage girl apparently planning to blow herself up in front of an Iraqi school .
The officers handcuffed her to a metal balustrade before moving in with extreme caution to uncover a vest full of explosives hidden under her colourful robe .
The dramatic scenes were captured on a video shot by the police .
Handcuffed : Police said the girl 's father had already blown himself up .
Officers have also arrested her mother and sister
Officers watch on as a man approaches the teenager
The girl - thought to be around 15 years old - later said that she was given the bomb and told to wait outside the school for further instructions .
In the footage , she denies trying to stage a suicide attack , and appears dazed , even drugged .
She gave her first name as Rania and said she was born in 1993 .
Her exchange with the police offered a rare glimpse at a teenager allegedly recruited by insurgents .
However , it was not clear to what extent her answers were given out of fear - of the police , or even of her own family .
Police later said the vest contained about 33lb of explosives
Police in Baqouba , where the girl was caught on Sunday , said she was fitted with the vest by female relatives of her husband , whom she married five months ago .
They also claimed that the girl 's father was a suicide bomber , and her mother and one of her sisters were later arrested .
However , U.S. sources said that the girl turned herself in after being hooked up to the explosives against her will .
The police footage begins with Rania standing on the street .
Her arms are already behind her back , where they have apparently been tied by an officer in an attempt to restrain her .
A policeman is shown opening her robe , and later frames show her wearing what appears to be a suicide vest , containing about 33lb of explosives .
The officer said the girl led the police back to where she was given the explosives and that they found a second bomb belt in an empty apartment in the Baqouba area .
Suspected bomber : Police move in on a girl , 15 , who appears to be wearing a suicide vest packed with explosives
He also said the girl 's mother and sister were arrested , but it was not clear why .
Some female bombers may have been motivated by revenge , and U.S. commanders believe al Qaeda in Iraq is increasingly seeking to exploit women unable to deal with the grief of losing husbands , parents , children and others to the violence .
The U.S. military said that in Diyala , some 200 female volunteers recruited by the U.S. - backed group Daughters of Iraq are helping search women at checkpoints .
Disarmed :
She appears dazed
Many Iraqi women wear long robes , ideal for covering bulky suicide vests , and Iraqi policemen hesitate to pat them down at checkpoints because of cultural taboos .
The police footage of the girl 's arrest begins with her standing on a Baqouba street , next to a metal structure .
Her arms are behind her back , apparently tied to the structure , as police surround her .
Later , a policeman is shown opening her robe , and subsequent frames show her wearing what appears to be the suicide vest .
Police later said the vest contained about 33 pounds of explosives .
The girl is then shown standing in a room , wrapped in a black cloak , her hair dishevelled and surrounded by police officers .
She insists she does n't know the women who gave her the vest .
' I swear to Allah that I do not know them .
They were strangers , ' she is heard saying , though she later says that 'one of the women 's names was maybe Fadhila and the other was called Widad . '
When pressed to say whether she knew the woman who put the vest on her , she replied : ' Yes . '
Police asked if she intended to blow herself up .
' No , no , they put it on me and told me to take it off at home , ' she said .
' They did not tell me to explode myself . '
A policeman then asks : ' If so , why did n't you disconnect " the detonator ?
The girl says : ' I did not disconnect it ( because ) maybe it fell from me . '
A policeman standing next to her could be heard saying that when she was picked up , she was initially unable to talk because she had been given drugs .
Explosives :
The vest that the girl was wearing at the time of her arrest
Interrogation : Police paraded the girl before reporters after her arrest
Footage from another interrogation session appears to contradict this testimony , with Rania saying she was shown the vest 's two detonators and told to press the second button if the first failed to work .
At one point , a policeman can be heard saying that when the girl was picked up , she was unable to talk because she had been given drugs .
The drama came as it was revealed that the number of women carrying out suicide attacks in Iraq has more than tripled in 12 months .
The number has gone from eight in 2007 to 29 this year , according to U.S. military officials .
They believe that Al Qaeda is increasingly exploiting women unable to deal with the grief of losing husbands , parents and children since the U.S. invasion in 2003 .
Baqouba , where the girl was arrested , is the capital of the volatile eastern Diyala province and an Al Qaeda stronghold in Iraq .
The area has seen some of the worst violence in the country .
The U.S. military said that in Diyala , some 200 female volunteers recruited by the U.S. - backed group Daughters of Iraq are now helping with checkpoint searches .
Someone had to say it .

" I think they are going to it way too many times .
It 's the original story that defined John McCain , that still when you read it in his book ' Faith of my Fathers , ' when you read about it in ' The Nightingale 's Song , ' you can't help but have admiration and respect for the guy .
And I think he wisely for many years stayed away from it as a political tool , he really did .
But now it not only defines him , it 's become a crutch in the campaign .
And I think he is in danger of trivializing it .
By the time they get to the convention in St. Paul , there might not be much of it left to use . "
This is just another sad chapter in the tragic descent of John McCain .
Sure McCain has used his powerful biography to help him throughout his political career , but I highly doubt he 's comfortable with the depths he's now forced to sink to in order to compete for the presidency .
Again .... tragic .

We had written in mid July that money supply in the US , as measured by M1 and M2 , had been contracting for several month s .
Eurozone M1 growth had also fallen to near zero growth levels , and M4 , the broadest measure of money in the UK , had actually dipped into negative growth territory .
As we noted then :
Many have criticized the Fed for “ printing money ” of late .
But the evidence suggests otherwise .
First , all of the cash injections that the central bank has undertaken via its alphabet soup of new lending facilities have been met with roughly equal withdrawals though open market operations .
Thus the new facilities themselves have not led to monetary expansion .
Second , critics like to point to the Fed ’s negative real interest rates as lax monetary policy .
In the dot - bomb environment , which was not a credit crisis , that charge is accurate , and that policy helped create our current mess .
But we now have credit contraction .
Deleveraging is deflationary .
Somewhat loose monetary policy is appropriate .
Unlike 2002 , banks or securities firms are not going out to create new debt , which is the mechanism by which low interest rates lead to inflation or asset bubbles .
Mortgage lending has become dependent on the Federal government via Freddie , Fannie , and the FHA ( and the future of that support is now in question ) .
Consumer credit of all sorts is being reined in .
Dow Chemical had to go to Warren Buffett to borrow to acquire Rohm & Haas because it could not get funding from banks .
Our credit intermediation system is barely functioning .
The Telegraph story that highlighted this development provided additional detail :
Paul Kasriel , chief economist at Northern Trust , says lending by US commercial banks contracted at an annual rate of 9.14 pc in the 13 weeks to June 18 , the most violent reversal since the data series began in 1973 .
M2 money fell at a rate of 0.37 pc …
Leigh Skene from Lombard Street Research said the lending conditions in the US were now the worst since the Great Depression .
“ Credit liquidation has begun , ” he said .
Note that the Federal Reserve gave up being interested in money supply in the early 1980s , when new banking products made the data behave differently .
But that hardly seemed a reason to abandon a useful tool , at least not without trying to understand how the new instruments affected monetary aggregates .
Instead , the Fed sets target interest rates in a not - terribly - scientific fashion .
Note that while the Fed still published M1 ( narrow money , currency plus demand deposits ) and M2 ( M1 plus time deposits , savings accounts , and non-institutional money market funds ) , it stopped reporting M3 ( M2 plus large time deposits , institutional money market accounts , and short - term repos ) in March 2006 .
However , some economists and services provide estimates ,
The Telegraph tells us today that those private calculations of M3 , like the publicly available monetary aggregates , show a sudden contraction , a deflationary signal .
From the Telegraph :
Nashville bluesman Von Johin learned the art of Mississippi Delta - style blues the old fashioned way : by playing small venues across the country .
But despite the traditional nature of his music , Von Johin plays weekly shows in Second Life , as you can see in the video to the right .
His determination has paid off handsomely , with a record deal believed to be the first ever given to a Second Life performer .
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .
Contact wiredlabs@wired.com to report an issue .
" Never before has a virtual character been signed to a worldwide recording contract , " stated Warren Croyle , CEO of Reality Entertainment , the company that signed him .
" Von Johin is legendary in the virtual community Second Life for his heart - pounding live shows . "
The deal was made in much the same way as its real - world counterparts .
Two scouts from Reality Entertainment spent several months looking for promising artists to sign throughout Second Life .
" It was a hard decision , but Von Johin is the real deal , he is original and plays from his heart , " said Pud Puchkina , one of the scouts .
" Just the man and his guitar , with just these two instruments and a virtual appeal like no other , he brings crowds to their feet daily . "
Von Johin plays each Wednesday at 8 p.m. EST at his own Second Lifevenue " in the Yudasin Sim , " Johin ’s Blue Note Club , named after hisreal - life recording studio on the outskirts of Nashville .
He says
he gets in the mood for his shows by " filling up on bbq , cornbread ,
greens and all the fixins , with aglass of Coca - Cola or some sweet honey ( nectar of the gods ) sweet icedtea by his side , " and then plays traditional blues standards likeElmore James ’s " It Hurt Me Too , " as seen in the video above .
Hisinstrumentation , consisting only of guitar and voice , comes acrossquite well as a live stream due to its simplicity , and the guyreally knows his way around these blues standards .
A publicist for Reality Entertainment told us about the company ’s plans for Johin via e-mail .
" Von , as an avatar , will play all his shows in Second Life , and they ’ll continue to be free , " he explained .
" As for touring , Von is already playing a fully booked schedule , but Reality is planning a big in - world event in addition to that . "
The best way to see the show is in Second Life , so that you can hang out with the other avatars at the venue , but First Life adherents can listen along via Shoutcast by opening this location within their media player : http://www.vonjohin.com:8888/.
( In iTunes , this involves clicking Advanced > Open Stream and pasting in the URL . )
Reality Entertainment , also home to KC and the SunshineBand , plans to release Von Johin ’s debut album digitally through theusual outlets — iTunes , Amazon , Rhapsody and so on .
Some of his musicis also available for free download on TheSixtyOne .

Scientists at Tufts University 's School of Engineering have demonstrated for the first time that it is possible to design an edible optical sensor that can be placed in produce bags to detect harmful levels of bacteria and consumed right along with the veggies .
This same technology could mean an implantable device that would monitor glucose in your blood for a year , then dissolve .
Such " living " optical elements that could enable an entirely new class of sensors .
These sensors would combine sophisticated nanoscale optics with biological readout functions , be biocompatible and biodegradable , and be manufactured and stored at room temperatures without use of toxic chemicals .
The Tufts team used fibers from silkworms to develop the platform devices .
Optics – the science of light and its interaction with matter – has fascinated generations of scientists .
Current optical device platforms are based primarily on glass , semiconductors , plastics or polymers .
But the harsh solvents and extreme temperatures needed for manufacture make it impossible to incorporate bioactive sensing components into the devices .
Chemical residues and lack of biodegradability also limit environmental and medical applications .
Furthermore , biological components typically need to be stored at controlled temperatures to retain their activity .
" Sophisticated optical devices that are mechanically robust yet fully biodegradable , biocompatible and implantable do n't exist today , " said principal investigator Fiorenzo Omenetto , associate professor of biomedical engineering and associate professor of physics .
" Such systems would greatly expand the use of current optical technologies in areas like human and livestock health , environmental monitoring and food quality . "
" For example , at a low cost , we could potentially put a bioactive silk film in every bag of spinach , and it could give the consumer a readout of whether or not E. coli bacteria were in the bag — before the food was consumed , " explained David Kaplan , professor and chair of the biomedical engineering department .
The possibility of integrating optical readout and biological function in a single biocompatible device unconstrained by these limitations is tantalizing .
Silk optics has captured the interest of the Defense Department , which has funded and been instrumental in enabling rapid progress on the topic .
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) awarded Tufts a research contract in 2007 and is funding Tufts and others on groundbreaking projects that could someday result in biodegradable optical sensing communications technology .
Silk a Natural for Biocompatible Optics
Silk proteins are , literally , a natural for integrating optical and biological functions .
They can be processed in water at ordinary temperatures and patterned on the nanoscale to generate a wide range of optical elements , including ultrathin films , thick films , and nanoscale and large - diameter fibers .
Silk proteins also offer excellent surface quality and transparency , which are perquisites for high - quality optics .
Equally important , they are mechanically robust .
" Silks spun by spiders and silkworms represent the strongest and toughest natural fibers known .
They offer many opportunities for functionalization , processing and biological integration when compared to conventional polymers , " said Kaplan , an expert on natural biomaterials like silk .
To form the devices , Tufts scientists boiled cocoons of the Bombyx mori silkworm in a water solution and extracted the glue - like sericin proteins .
The purified silk protein solution was ultimately poured onto negative molds of ruled and holographic diffraction gratings with spacing as fine as 3600 grooves / mm .
The cast silk solution was air dried to create solid fibroin silk films that were cured in water , dried and optically evaluated .
A similar process was followed to create lenses , microlens arrays and holograms .
Film thicknesses from 10 to 100 µm were characterized for transparency and optical quality .
The variety and quality of the optical elements compared favorably with conventional platforms and outperformed other commonly used biopolymers .
However , the most compelling feature of the platform , according to the Tufts researchers , is that the elements are prepared , processed and optimized in all - aqueous environments and at ambient temperature .
This makes possible the inclusion of sensitive biological ' receptors ' within the solution that stay active after the solution has hardened into a free - standing silk optical element .
No Refrigeration Needed
The Tufts team embedded three very different biological agents in the silk solution : a protein ( hemoglobin ) , an enzyme ( horseradish peroxidase ) and an organic pH indicator ( phenol red ) .
In the hardened silk optical element , all three agents maintained their activity for long periods when simply stored on a shelf .
" We have optical devices embedded with enzymes that are still active after almost a year of storage at room temperature .
This is amazing given that the same enzyme becomes inactive if forgotten and left unrefrigerated for a few days , " said Omenetto . "
Researchers also found that it was possible to alter the propagation of light through the silk optic as a function of the embedded dopant to create an optical signal of the biological activity .
The Tufts research was published in a recent paper in " Biomacromolecules " by Brian D. Lawrence , graduate student in biomedical engineering ; Mark Cronin - Golomb , associate professor , biomedical engineering ; Irene Georgakoudi , assistant professor , biomedical engineering ; Kaplan , and Omenetto .

The activists are accused of endangering the Kaiko Maru ( top ) Will three anti-whaling activists from the UK and US end up standing trial in Tokyo ?
Japan is attempting to press charges against activists for the first time since 2000 , when protesters started harassing the Japanese whaling fleet in earnest .
Earlier this week Tokyo's Metropolitan Police Department obtained arrest warrants for the three men : Daniel Bebawi from Nottingham , the UK , and Americans Jon Batchelor and Ralph Koo .
Police sources in Tokyo accuse the men - members of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society , an anti-whaling group - of approaching a Japanese whaling ship , the Kaiko Maru , and laying a rope in its path in an effort to foul its propeller in February last year .
The men are also alleged to have thrown smoke bombs onto the ship which started a fire .
' Red notice ' sought Unconfirmed reports here say Japan 's National Police Agency has now approached Interpol and asked them to place the men on their " wanted " list .
They want the international police agency to issue a " red notice " which would notify the authorities in Britain and the United States that a national arrest warrant had been issued for these men .
Only a very small proportion of Interpol 's " red notices " are made public .
The country making the request , in this case Japan , can ask for the matter to be kept out of the public eye .
The first Mr Bebawi might know of it might be when British police turn up to arrest him .
Interpol cannot insist that the British authorities use a " red notice " as a basis for a provisional arrest .
Some countries do , some do n't .
Whether or not they do depends on the links between the country seeking the arrest and the country required to carry it out .
It can also depend on the seriousness of the crime .
Japan 's strategies Japan and the UK do not have an extradition treaty .
But that does not necessarily preclude the prospect of extradition , according to a British Embassy spokesman in Tokyo .
The war between whalers and activists has heated up over recent years " Any extradition request received from a ' non- treaty ' partner would be considered on a case - by - case basis , " he said .
" For a case to be considered the offence ... must be an offence in the UK . "
The extradition treaty that exists between the US and Japan lists the offences which are extraditable .
These include offences related to disruption of shipping vessels .
They are also for the first time suggesting that the activists may have committed a crime under a UN convention , " The Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation " .
This could make the activists liable for arrest in countries that are signatories to the convention .
Japan appears to be taking a tougher line against those who seek to disrupt its whale hunt than it has in the past .
So what has changed ?
Public pressure First , there are those in the Japanese parliament and media who have accused the Japanese whaling fleet and its operator of being " wimps " in the face of the attacks by the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society .
Japan should not tolerate this kind of humiliation , they argue .
Japan may also feel more confident now that the group has alienated many in the anti-whaling camp with its direct action against the whalers .
Activists vow that the new tactics will not scare them off Professor Jeff Kingston from Temple University in Tokyo believes that Japan has been losing in the court of public opinion over its whaling programme .
" It clearly wants to persist with this programme and is seeking to deter other activists from disrupting its hunts , " he says .
" Sticking Interpol on the activists is unlikely to deter committed anti-whaling campaigners , " he adds .
" But it may lead to some shifts in tactics . "
Captain Paul Watson who has led the Sea Shepherd actions against the Japanese fleet has already described these legal moves by Japan as " absurd " and made clear it will not deter his organisation from stepping up its efforts against the whalers .
Others caution that increased publicity can only benefit the activists .
Japan has raised the stakes it seems - but can it afford to pay the price if its tactics go wrong ?

What are these ?
When watching a relay race , we will allocate more memory to key objects : the faces of the relay team we are supporting , the baton , etc .
Less important details , such as members of the other teams , will be allocated less memory .
Visually arresting details such as a runner 's pink hair will catch our attention and be allocated more memory .
You ’d probably remember seeing a man with pink hair more than you could recall the guy walking next to him with brown hair .
That ’s because our brains best remember attention - grabbing images , according to a new study .
Previous research has implied an upper limit to the number of visual images a person can store in short - term memory , but a new study found that memory capacity is much more flexible .
" Before people have had this idea that visual memory has a very simple limit : three or four items and that 's it , " said researcher Paul Bays , a neuroscientist at University College London .
" What my research shows is that there is n't that upper limit , but instead there 's a single resource that ’s shared out between items .
What happens is that the items that stand out get more of this resource , and so are remembered with greater precision . "
The study , funded by the British biomedical research fund Wellcome Trust , will be detailed in the Aug. 7 issue of the journal Science .
Bays and his University College London colleague Masud Husain showed subjects computer screens displaying colored squares or lines for one second .
After the screen went blank , one object would reappear , but slightly shifted in position .
The scientists then asked the participants what direction the object had moved in .
The researchers found that the more objects there were in the image , the harder it was for subjects to remember the original position of the changed item .
However , the scientists did not measure a sharp drop off in performance at a limit of three of four objects , as previous research would have predicted .
" To see whether attention was having an effect we had one item flash very briefly before they all disappeared , " Bays told LiveScience .
" We found that if the flashed item was then the one that was moved , subjects were better at remembering it . "
Bays said this experiment revealed a previously unknown aspect of working memory .
Rather than having a fixed limit on the number of visual items we can recall , we have a total memory capacity , which gets subdivided based on how much attention we pay each object , with the more striking and noteworthy taking up more of our working memory resources .
" It just seemed like something was lacking in the research that had been done so far , " Bays said .
" People had only looked at the question in terms of do you remember it or do n't you remember it .
You need to ask how accurately do you remember it ? "
He predicts that his discovery about visual memory may apply to other types of memory , including the number of digits or words we can recall .
Research in those fields has also generally found fixed ceilings on the number of items short - term memory can hold : generally about four things , with a capacity of about seven if certain tricks , such as chunking information in groups , are used .
" I suspect the same thing will apply — that in fact this limit does n’t really exist but it 's just because people have n’t been looking at this thing the right way , " Bays said .
" I think you 'll find our memory is more flexible than that . "
' I lost the best years of my life '
Mark Covell was left in a coma for two days Fifteen Italian officials have been convicted of mistreating protesters during the 2001 G8 summit in Genoa .
Mark Covell was one of five British anti-globalisation protesters who was injured and has been seeking justice ever since .
" This was not just giving a few hippies a slap around , this was systematic , " Mr Covell said .
A journalist with alternative media organisation Indymedia at the time , he was present when police raided a high school where protesters were camping during the summit .
He was left with eight broken ribs , a shredded lung , a broken hand , 16 missing teeth and was in a coma for two days .
While he was on a life - support machine in hospital , 81 others were arrested and taken to a temporary prison camp outside Genoa , at Bolzaneto .
The police chief tried , and failed , to take him too .
' Mixed result '
Here they were threatened , beaten and insulted .
The prosecution said they were tortured .
On Monday , after 11 hours of deliberations , judges convicted 15 people of charges ranging from assault to denial of basic human rights .
Thirty others were cleared .
Mr Covell now suffers from post traumatic stress disorder
The stiffest sentence was handed to camp commander Antonio Gugliotta who was given five years , while the others received between five to 28 months .
Speaking from Italy , Mr Covell told the BBC News website : " It 's a mixed result for us .
Obviously we would have liked a larger amount of police officers to be convicted .
" But when we started people said we had a one million to one chance of reaching today . "
The judge said there was " no doubt " a serious crime had taken place at Bolzaneto and there had clearly been mental and physical suffering inflicted without any justification .
" He said he wanted to impose much longer sentences of 10 years for some of the defendants and what they did .
But there is no law on torture here , " said Mr Covell .
' Condemned and disowned '
The victims will receive compensation , the judge ordered emergency payment of 10,000 euros to each victim and a total of 15 m euros will be paid to victims in the long term .
Now 40 , Mr Covell says that is small comfort .
" The money is good , but you can never recover from something like this .
I have lost the best years of my life with what happened on 21 July , " he said .
" We have spent seven years fighting these cases .
I will die 10 years younger than I should because of the physical damage to me .
All of us have huge issues with post - traumatic stress disorder .
" We have been forgotten about .
We were condemned and disowned by our own governments around Europe . "
The fight for justice continues .
A second trial over the police raid at the Diaz school is ongoing .
They also plan to take the case to the European Court of human rights , where the defendants can be prosecuted under torture law .
" We want the Italian government to bring in new torture law , and a public inquiry .
We want to cut the cancer of Fascism from the police , whether we achieve that , I do n't know . "
But he says he has no regrets about being in Genoa that day .
" I do n't think anyone would have realised the Italians would react in such a horrific way .
We can only hope something positive can come from it for us and the Italians , " he said .

Looting is an unfortunate and largely inevitable result of large - scale disasters .
Many property owners have to evacuate their homes and businesses ahead of the coming disaster ( or flee the area in its aftermath ) without leaving behind anyone to protect their property , and law enforcement and other emergency services are generally so overwhelmed dealing with life - and - death issues that they ca n’t spare the manpower to protect private property .
People who are caught unprepared ( or remain in the disaster area for other reasons ) often have to shift into survival mode and take whatever supplies they can get wherever they can find them , and there are always a few who will take advantage of confusion and chaos to make off with other people ’s property for their own enrichment .
The onslaught of Hurricane Katrina in the Gulf Coast in late August 2005 brought the phenomenon of looting into the national spotlight once again , including the two news service photographs shown above , both of which were carried by Yahoo !
News and other Internet news outlets and showed persons wading through chest - deep water in the New Orleans area with supplies taken from grocery stores .
Many viewers noticed the seeming disparity of the darker - skinned subject ’s being described in the accompanying caption as “ looting a grocery store , ” while the lighter - skinned subjects were described as “ finding bread and soda from a local grocery store ” :
Were these captions evidence of a subtle ( or overt ) racial prejudice in the news media ?
It ’s difficult to draw any substantiated conclusions from these photographs ’ captions .
Although they were both carried by many news outlets , they were taken by two different photographers and came from two different services , Associated Press ( AP ) and Getty Images via Agence France - Presse ( AFP ) .
These services may have different stylistic standards for how they caption photographs , or the dissimilar wordings may have been due to nothing more than the preferences of different photographers and editors , or the difference might be the coincidental result of a desire to avoid repetitive wording ( similar photographs from the same news services variously describe the depicted actions as “ looting , ” “ raiding , ” “ taking , ” “ finding , ” and “ making off ” ) .
The viewer also is n’t privy to the contexts in which the photographs were taken — it ’s possible that in one case the photographer actually saw his subject exiting an unattended grocery store with an armful of goods , while in the other case the photographer came upon his subjects with supplies in hand and could only make assumptions about how they obtained them .
A Salon article on the photographs by Aaron Kinney suggested the captions were a result of a combination of contextual and stylistic differences :
Jack Stokes , AP ’s director of media relations , confirmed today that [ photographer Dave ]
Martin says he witnessed the people in his images looting a grocery store .
“ He saw the person go into the shop and take the goods , ” Stokes said , “ and that ’s why he wrote ‘ looting ’ in the caption . ”
Regarding the AFP / Getty “ finding ” photo by [ photographer Chris ] Graythen , Getty spokeswoman Bridget Russel said , “ This is obviously a big tragedy down there , so we ’re being careful with how we credit these photos . ”
Russel said that Graythen had discussed the image in question with his editor and that if Graythen did n’t witness the two people in the image in the act of looting , then he could n’t say they were looting .
The photographer who took the Getty / AFP picture , Chris Graythen , also posted the reasons behind his caption :
“ Attack [ the enemy ] where he is unprepared , appear where you are not expected . ”
Whether it ’s IMF meetings , trade meetings , or political conventions , elites know demonstrators will be there , and elites are prepared .
Cops , tear gas , chain - link fences , and concrete barricades are just a few of the defenses they employ to keep demonstrators at bay — defenses backed up by media outlets that are only too happy to keep to the corporate storyline , rendering protests invisible .
It ’s natural for protesters to initially think demonstrating at such elite gatherings is thing to do .
After all , that ’s where the elites are ; that ’s where the action is .
But the high level of defensive preparation the rich and powerful bring to bear at such events argues for a different strategy .
“ [ T ] he victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won , whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory . ”
So , the next time a large demonstration is planned , I have a suggestion : Ignore ( physically , that is ) the event being protested .
Instead , pick softer targets : Media outlets .
Such a plan would address two problems :
It would bypass the cops and the barricades , and it would also make it incredibly difficult for the media to ignore protests .
And even if the police know such protests are coming , they ca n’t protect all media outlets .
Is there anyone on the left who does n’t agree the media is part of the problem ?
If virtually all of us believe this , then why do we keep giving them a free pass ?
Instead , we should directly target TV stations and newspapers .
There is no issue – war , health care , the economy , the environment – that could n’t accommodate such a strategy .
In fact , I would say such a strategy is demanded regardless of the underlying issue .
“ Opportunities multiply as they are seized . ”
Further , I believe such a strategy would yield a greater chance of success .
When , say , a political convention is targeted , what is the goal ?
To change policies under discussion ?
If that ’s the goal , how attainable is it ?
What would make it more attainable ?
I do n’t know what a sufficient condition for its attainability is , but I know what a necessary condition is : increased public awareness of the issues elites are discussing inside .
Now , suppose it ’s media outlets being targeted , as I am proposing .
Now what ’s the goal ?
I do n’t know , but if it ’s a left - wing goal , I ’m pretty sure it has the same necessary condition .
To put all this another way , no matter what the left hopes to accomplish , it ’s going to need massive public awareness and support to do it .
If the media wo n’t provide that awareness to the public , then we should make them .
Everything else is , I would suggest , wheel spinning .
Even if it ’s not , it ’s certainly rendered far less effective thanks to the anesthetizing power of the press .
So let ’s sap that power .
“ You can not stop innovation . ”

BEIJING ( Reuters ) - Addressing climate change head - on is in China ’s best interests , but it needs developed countries to do their fair share , President Hu Jintao said in a speech reported by the Xinhua news agency on Saturday .

Hu called on developed countries to step up efforts on emission reduction , and provide financial and technical support for developing countries .
China will participate in next month ’s Group of Eight meeting in Hokkaido , Japan , where climate change is top on the agenda .
Countries are trying to set new targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions that will take effect after the Kyoto Protocol expires in 2012 .
Although China is the world ’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases , on a per person basis it produces far less than many developed countries .
Chinese negotiators also point out that the country is only just catching up after two centuries of industrialization in the West .
But Chinese policy makers are increasingly worried about the impact on China of global warming , which could dry up rivers that water the arid north and intensify flooding in the south .
China also suffers from intensely polluted water and air .
“ How we cope with climate change is related to the country ’s economic development and people ’s practical benefits .
It ’s in line with the country ’s basic interests , ” Hu told a study session on climate change .
The meeting was held on Friday by the political bureau of the central committee of China ’s ruling communist party .
“ Our task is tough , and our time is limited .
Party organizations and governments at all levels must give priority to emission reduction ... and drive the idea deep into people ’s hearts . ”
Hu urged organizations and companies to optimize energy use , recycle resources , increase forest coverage , explore water resources scientifically and strengthen international cooperation .
He called for enhancing China ’s ability to monitor , forecast and withstand extreme natural disasters brought by abnormal weather .
Already , flooding this summer has killed over 200 people across China , after an earthquake in Sichuan province in May left more than 80,000 dead or missing and millions homeless .
Unusual rainfall could make this summers ’ flooding the worst in decades , the Sichuan meteorological bureau said on Friday .
Tropical storm Fengshan killed at least 15 people in Guangzhou and Jiangxi province after it came ashore on Wednesday and was downgraded from typhoon level .
It killed hundreds in the Philippines last week .
Floodwaters released from a swollen reservoir in southern Guangdong province caused a 300 - meter bridge in the Baiyun district of Guangzhou to collapse , Chinese media said on Saturday .
And a month of unusual rainfall in Beijing claimed three lives and injured eight people who were overcome by gases when they tried to unblock a flooded sewer in Miyun County .
On Tuesday , the Bush administration moved to accelerate oil - shale development across the Rocky Mountain West .
Along with calls to lift the moratorium on offshore drilling , and open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling , Tuesday ’s release of proposed rules for shale exploration ( pdf ) by the Bureau of Land Management was merely another shot across the bow in the political blame game over $ 4 - per - gallon gas .
[ social_buttons ]
The draft rules recommend reduced royalty rates for the extraction of oil from shale on 2 million acres of public property in Colorado , Utah and Wyoming .
While the government currently charges 12.5 % to 18.8 % for conventional oil drilling , oil shale development would be set at around 5 % .
According to Secretary of the Interior , Dirk Kempthorne , shale deposits in Colorado , Utah and Wyoming could provide 800 billion barrels of oil , enough to meet U.S. demand at current levels “ for 110 years . ”
But the Interior Department is limited in what it can do .
Language inserted in a spending bill by Senator Ken Salazar ( D - CO ) bars the department from issuing final rules on oil - shale development .
Though the moratorium is set to expire this October , Sen . Salazar said on a Denver radio station Wednesday that it would probably be extended for another year , so that the issue of oil shale development could be given a much closer look .
Salazar said :
“ The administration is trying to set the stage for a last - minute fire sale of commercial oil - shale leases in western Colorado , despite the fact that we are still years away from knowing if the technologies for developing oil shale on a commercial scale are even viable . ”
Each barrel could require 1 to 3 barrels of water to produce
Tens of millions upon millions of people all over the southwest rely on water from the Colorado for everything from growing crops to meeting drinking water needs , making it one of the most heavily used and managed water systems in the United States .
One study done at the Los Alamos National Laboratory ( Wilson et al. : 2006 ) projected that it would take 105 to 315 million gallons per day to produce 2.5 million barrels of oil per day from shale .
The authors also projected that an industry that size also would result in a regional population growth of 433,000 people , requiring another 58 million gallons per day .
Shell not in a hurry to develop oil - shale
Shell Exploration & Production Co. is working an oil - shale project on three 160 - acre parcels in Colorado but the company seems to recognize that the technology to squeeze billions of gallons of oil from the rocks of the Rockies is not high on the company ’s list of priorities .
According to the Denver Post :
“ The company is two years into its 10 - year research - and - development leases .
Shell will make a decision on commercial leasing closer to the end of that decade , [ Shell spokesperson Tracy ]
Boyd said …
The company wo n’t be ready for commercial leasing until probably 2015 , Boyd said .
So , what ’s the rush to hand out these oil leases now ?
Even the BLM report states that “ currently , there is no oil - shale industry and the oil - shale extractive technology is still in its rudimentary stages . ”
The lack of a domestic oil - shale industry makes it purely a speculative endeavor to project the development of the technology necessary to extract oil - shale , the future demand for oil - shale leases , and the costs of developing those resources .
After another day of falling oil prices , the hurried rush to hand out oil shale leases for hundreds of thousands of acres of the Rocky Mountain West is merely another knee - jerk reaction from a Bush administration that is struggling to gain political favor in an election year .
But that begs the question – who ’s favor are Republicans trying to gain ?
Despite what Republicans would have you believe , this election will be about much more than gas prices .
And if Republican strategists think otherwise , they ’re in for a big surprise in November .

TBLISI , Georgia ( CNN ) --
As Georgian troops launched a major military offensive Friday to regain control over the breakaway province of South Ossetia , the former Soviet republic 's president accused Russia of bombing its territory .
Georgian troops fire rockets at seperatist South Ossetian troops from an unnamed location not far from Tskhinvali .
According to the Associated Press , Mikhail Saakashvili said in a televised statement that Russian aircraft bombed several Georgian villages and other civilian facilities .
He said there were injuries and damage to the buildings .
" A full - scale aggression has been launched against Georgia , " he said in a televised statement .
A Georgian official said seven people were hurt in the attack , AP reported .
Saakashvili urged Russia to immediately stop bombing Georgian territory .
" Georgia will not yield its territory or renounce its freedom , " he said .
Meanwhile , AP reported that Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin , speaking in televised remarks Friday during his trip to the opening of the Beijing Olympics , blamed Georgia for launching the effort to take control over South Ossetia and warned it would cause an unspecified retaliatory action .
Watch more about the increased violence in Georgia »
The bombing charge came about an hour after Russia 's ambassador to the United Nations brushed off a question about whether Russia would intervene militarily in a conflict between Georgia and its breakaway territory .
Violence in the former Soviet republic prompted an emergency session of the United Nations Security Council that lasted into Friday morning .
The security council failed to issue a statement on the dramatic escalation of violence in a breakaway territory of the former Soviet republic of Georgia .
Meanwhile , Georgia 's president also announced that his government will be calling up reservists as fighting continued to rage in South Ossetia 's capital .
Georgian forces launched fresh attacks into region late Thursday after a top government official said a unilateral cease - fire offer was met with artillery fire .
About 2,000 Georgian troops attempted to storm the breakaway territory 's capital overnight and were regrouping south of the city , Tskhinvali , according to Russia 's ITAR - TASS news agency .
Georgia 's ambassador to the United Nations , Irakli Alasania , said that " Russia has become a party to the conflict . "
He said Russia has supported separatists in South Ossetia , a charge Russia dismissed .
Around 10 a.m. Friday , Georgia said Russian military aircraft violated Georgian airspace and dropped two bombs on Kareli , a part of Georgia that is about 50 miles northwest of the capital , Tblisi , and is not in the conflict zone , said Shota Utiashvili , spokesman for the Georgian Ministry of Interior .
No casualties were reported , he said .
Georgian troops pushed into South Ossetia after separatists attacked Georgian soil , destroying one village and killing several civilians , soldiers and police officers , Alasania said .
Russia 's ambassador to the United Nations , Vitaly Churkin , denied allegations that his country planned to intervene militarily .
In comments to the Security Council , he decried the " blatant aggressive action of Georgia . "
The latest developments follow a week of sporadic clashes between the Georgian central government and authorities in South Ossetia , which declared its independence from Georgia in the early 1990s after a bloody ethnic conflict between Georgians and Ossetians .
Alexander Lomaia , the secretary of Georgia 's National Security Council , said his country had to act .
" The objective of the operation is to protect the civilian population , to ensure their security and then convince the separatists that there is not a military solution to this conflict , " he said .
Lomaia said Georgian troops were responding proportionately to separatist mortar and artillery attacks on two villages -- attacks he said followed a Thursday evening cease - fire and call for negotiations by Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili .
" There were up to 10 people killed , including peacekeepers and the peaceful population , and up to 23 people wounded , including four of them wounded quite badly , " Lomaia said .
But he said Georgia wants a peaceful solution to the conflict and is leaving the door open to negotiations and has offered the territory " the widest possible autonomy . "
The official news agency of the South Ossetian government reported heavy shelling in the South Ossetian capital , Tskhinvali , that left dozens of buildings ablaze .
Lomaia said Georgian troops have no plans to reclaim control over the territory as part of the operation launched Thursday night -- but he said how far they advance " is really dependent on how the situation evolves on the ground . "
" Obviously , there will be a moment when we will be forced to respond , we will be forced to advance in order to prevent such bombardment , " he said .
" But at the time being , there is no such aim of the operation . "
Georgia , located on the Black Sea coast between Russia and Turkey , has been split by Russian - backed separatist movements in South Ossetia and another region , Abkhzia .
Neither region 's government has international recognition .

" Previously , we said house prices would fall at least 15 percent nationally , peak to trough .
Today 's challenging economic environment suggests that the housing market is far from stabilizing , " Richard Syron , the chairman and CEO of Freddie Mac , told investors in a conference call held to discuss the company 's earnings .
" As a result , we now believe that national home prices will fall 18 to 20 percent peak to trough .
...
The long and short of it is that we now think that we are half - way through the overall peak - to - trough decline . "
Freddie Mac
Wednesday posted its fourth straight quarterly loss as it braced for a prolonged housing crisis by setting aside twice as much money for bad loans and setting plans to slash its dividend by at least 80 percent .
The worse - than - expected results come just three weeks after U.S. authorities orchestrated a sweeping effort to prop up the second - biggest provider of U.S. residential mortgage funding and its rival Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac affirmed a commitment to raise fresh capital .
Freddie Mac 's chief financial officer repeated that it continues to maintain a surplus over regulatory capital requirements , and said the company can wait for " choppy " market conditions to improve before raising capital , which could exceed $ 5.5 billion .
For the second quarter , McLean , Virginia - based Freddie Mac reported a loss of $ 821 million , or $ 1.63 cents per share , compared with a profit of $ 729 million , or 96 cents per share , a year earlier .
That included the first loss from its holdings of subprime and other risky loans , which formed a significant part of its $ 2.8 billion in realized and anticipated losses stemming from the steepest U.S. housing downturn since the Great Depression .
@ FredicvsMaximvs : The " current " thing was discovered before people knew about electrons .
They knew there was comething that went from one side to another .
Called one side " + " and the other " - " ( just because they had to name them ) and conventioned that the " current " went from + to -.
Later , they found out about the electrons , and that they actually traveled from - to +.
Thus , the electrons and the current travel in opposite ways .
( i hope it 's understandable with my bad english ... )
We 'd never want the burden of carrying the Olympic torch , not so much because of the pressure , but because we 're out of shape and there 's a distinct possibility that we might burn ourselves .

We should not underestimate the gravity of the case against the president .
When he put his hand on the Bible and recited his oath of office , he swore to faithfully uphold the laws of the United States – not some laws , all laws .
As to the uniqueness of the office the president holds , he is a person in a position of immense authority and influence .
He influences the lives of millions of Americans .
When he took the oath of office , he swore to preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States and to take care that the laws be faithfully executed .
When someone is elected president , they receive the greatest gift possible from the American people , their trust .
To violate that trust is to raise questions about fitness for office .
My constituents often remind me that if anyone else in a position of authority – for example , a business executive , a military officer or a professional educator – had acted as the evidence indicates the president did , their career would be over .
The rules under which President Nixon would have been tried for impeachment had he not resigned contain this statement :
“ The office of the president is such that it calls for a higher level of conduct than the average citizen in the United States . ”
This will not be an easy task .
In fact , it is a difficult ordeal for all Americans , but we will get through it .
We are a great nation and a strong people .
Our country will endure because our Constitution works and has worked for over 200 years .
As much as one might wish to avoid this process , we must resist the temptation to close our eyes and pass by .
The president ’s actions must be evaluated for one simple reason : the truth counts .
As the process goes forward , some good lessons can be reaffirmed .
No one is above the law , actions have consequences , always tell the truth .
We the people should insist on these high ideals .
That the president has fallen short of the standard does n’t mean we should lower it .
If we keep excusing away the president ’s actions we as a nation will never climb upwards because there will be no firm rungs .

“ ¦being a poor example is n’t grounds for impeachment ; undermining the rule of law is .
When Americans come to Washington , they see the words “ equal justice under law ” carved in the facade of the Supreme Court building .
Those words mean that the weak and the poor have an equal right to justice , as do the rich and the powerful .
The framers of the Constitution devised an elaborate system of checks and balances to ensure our liberty by making sure that no person , institution or branch of government became so powerful that a tyranny could be established in the United States of America .
Impeachment is one of the checks the framers gave the Congress to prevent the executive or judicial branches from becoming corrupt or tyrannical .
I do so with no joy but without apologies , just as those on this committee who voted to impeach President Nixon , 24 years ago , did .
Watergate and the Nixon impeachment reversed the results of an overwhelming election and were extremely divisive to our country , but America emerged from that national nightmare a much stronger country and will do so again after this sad part of our history is over .
What is on trial here is the truth and the rule of law .

Much has been made about the absence of bipartisanship on this issue , and I want to reiterate my position on that .
Do not point accusatory fingers at Republicans or Democrats because there is disagreement .
Assuming we vote our consciences and exercise sound judgment , little else can be asked .
… I take umbrage to charges that some are out to get the president … I take umbrage as well to those who claim that some approach this arduous task in a gleeful manner .
I take no joy in discharging this duty before us , but it remains our duty nonetheless .
… I ca n’t see that this is going to shut down the government or tie it up , assuming it does advance to the Senate .

This has been a very trying time .
In a democracy , there are few more serious acts than to consider the possible impeachment of a president .
I can tell you in true conscience it has caused me many sleepless nights .
I wanted to hear the evidence that would prove the charges were false .
I believed that was the only fair way to proceed , and it was also my solemn constitutional duty and immense responsibility .
I waited , I read , and I listened .
Mr. Chairman , I ’m not a lawyer — one of the few on this committee — however , everyone that knows me knows I believe in the rule of law — believe the rule of law is fundamental to our society .
A society without laws is anarchy .
Societies that ignore the laws are condemned to violence and chaos .
( Original Article )
That bothers me .
My district is considered among the safest communities in the nation .
We have fine police officers , which certainly helps , but every officer from the chief to the beat officer will tell you a low crime rate begins with citizens who obey the law .
Every citizen must obey the law , every law .
He violated the Constitution .
To condone this would be to condemn our society to anarchy .
Mr. Chairman , I cannot and will not condone such action .
Hon. Bob Goodlatte ( VA ) Phone ( 202 ) 225-5431 .
Fax ( 202 ) 225-9681
Mr. Chairman , this is a somber occasion .
I am here because it is my constitutional duty , as it is the constitutional duty of every member of this committee , to follow the truth wherever it may lead .
Our Founding Fathers established this nation on a fundamental yet at the time untested idea that a nation should be governed not by the whims of any man but by the rule of law .
Implicit in that idea is the principle that no one is above the law , including the chief executive
Since it is the rule of law that guides us , we must ask ourselves what happens to our nation if the rule of law is ignored , cheapened or violated , especially at the highest level of government .
Consider the words of former Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis , who was particularly insightful on this point .
“ In a government of laws , the existence of the government will be imperiled if it fails to observe the law scrupulously .
For good or for ill , it teaches the whole people by its example .
If government becomes a lawbreaker , it breeds contempt for the law .
It invites every man to become a law unto himself . ”
Mr. Chairman , we must ask ourselves what our failure to uphold the rule of law will say to the nation , and most especially to our children , who must trust us to leave them a civilized nation where justice is respected .
If we truly respect the presidency , we cannot allow the president to be above the law .
Millions of law - abiding Americans from all walks of life , including my constituents , put in an honest day ’s work , follow the rules and struggle to teach their children respect for the law and the importance of integrity .
When a factory worker or a medical doctor or a retiree breaks the law , they do so with the knowledge that they are not above the law .
This same principle must also apply to the most powerful and privileged in our nation , including the president of the United States .
To lose this principle devastates a legacy entrusted to us by our founding fathers and protected for us by generations of American families .
I have a constitutional duty to follow the truth wherever it leads .
The truth in this case leads me to believe that the president knowingly engaged in a calculated pattern of lies , deceit and delay in order to mislead the American people ” ¦
The precious legacy entrusted to us by our founders and our constituents is a nation dedicated to the ideal of freedom and equality for all her people .
This committee must decide whether we will maintain our commitment to the rule of law and pass this precious legacy to our children and grandchildren , or whether we will bow to the political pressure for the sake of convenience or expediency .

Thank you .
Mr. Chairman , every member of our committee recognizes that this is likely the most important vote we will ever cast , and all of us would prefer that the president ’s actions had not led us down this fateful path .
However , we have sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution and we must fully accept that responsibility .
Back in 1974 , Congresswoman Elizabeth Holtzman , who served on the judiciary committee during Watergate , said that she would vote to impeach President Nixon , in part , because — and I quote — “ the presidential cover - up is continuing even through today . ”
The historic record , the law , and the Constitution tell us that the charges against the president do indeed rise to the level of impeachable offenses .
They constitute serious violations of criminal law and fall squarely within our Founding Fathers ’ definition of “ high crimes and misdemeanors . ”
Mr. Chairman , impeaching the president is an extremely serious matter .
Throughout these proceedings , I ’ve tried to keep an open mind , giving the president every opportunity to refute the facts that have been laid before our committee , but now all of the evidence is in and a decision is at hand .
It has become apparent to me that impeachment is the only remedy that adequately addresses this president ’s illegal and unethical acts .
Allowing the president ’s actions to go unpunished would gravely damage the Office of the President , our judicial system and our country .
I have not reached this decision lightly .
I have done my share of soul searching , I have listened carefully to the views of my constituents , and I ’ve reviewed the evidence in excruciating detail .
And much of it was n’t particularly pleasant , I can assure you .
And I ’ve been guided by our Constitution .
When we cast our votes , we are not voting as Republicans or Democrats , we are voting as Americans .
Our allegiance does not lie with any one president but with our country .
Our charge is not handed down from any one political party but from the Constitution .
Every member of this body is duty - bound to put politics aside , follow our conscience , and uphold our oath of office .

We are at a defining moment in our history .
What we do here will set the standard for what is acceptable for this and future presidents .
I believe profoundly that the behavior of this president is unacceptable because I agree with John Jay , one of our Founding Fathers , who said , “ When oaths cease to be sacred , our dearest and most valuable rights become insecure . ”
[ Quoting President John F. Kennedy ] , “ I think you gentlemen should recognize the responsibility of the president of the United States .
His responsibility is different from what your responsibility may be .
In this country , I carry out and execute the laws of the United States .
I also have the obligation of implementing the orders of the courts of the United States .
And I can assure you that who ’s ever president of the United States , he will do the same , because if he did not , he would begin to unwind this most extraordinary constitutional system of ours .
So I believe strongly in fulfilling my oath in that regard . ”
And that regard means if he did n’t fulfill his oath , the system would begin to unwind .
It ’s inexorable .
I submit that in the spirit of our Founding Fathers and John F. Kennedy , that our first duty is to provide for the security of the fundamental rights of Americans .
To properly perform that duty , we must vote to impeach the president .
Thank you .

Millions of Americans who watched Barack Obama and then John McCain respond to nearly identical questions from evangelical minister Rick Warren were surely impressed by McCain ’s quick and sharp answers .
Supposedly he had been in a “ cone of silence ” while Obama was getting grilled during the preceding hour .
However , as it turned out , TV viewers and other Americans were misled .
McCain had not been in any “ cone of silence ” shielding him from hearing Warren ’s questions and Obama ’s answers .
On Saturday night as Obama was on stage , McCain was in his motorcade on the way to the church and thus would have had access through his staff to the questions and how Obama had answered them .
When McCain came on the set , he played along with the fiction about being in a “ cone of silence , ” joking that “ I was trying to hear through the wall . ”
McCain then proceeded to knock the questions out of the proverbial park , impressing not only the audience at Rev. Warren ’s Saddleback Church in California , but the political pundits who spent the next two days praising McCain ’s performance and judging him the clear winner over Obama .
For instance , New York Times columnist William Kristol declared that it was “ McCain ’s night ” and marveled at how “ McCain , who went second , was crisp by contrast [ to Obama ] and his anecdotes colorful . ”
Kristol also mocked grousing from Obama ’s aides that McCain may have had access to the questions beforehand .
“ There ’s no evidence that McCain had any such advantage , ” Kristol wrote in his Monday column .
However , in the same newspaper , New York Times reporters discovered that the assertion by Warren that McCain had been in some “ cone of silence ” was n’t true .
“ Members of the McCain campaign staff , who flew here Sunday from California , said Mr. McCain was in his motorcade on the way to the church as Mr. Obama was being interviewed , ” wrote reporter Katharine Q. Seeyle .
Still , McCain ’s staff bristled at suggestions that McCain listened to the broadcast while en route to the church .
“ The insinuation from the Obama campaign that John McCain , a former prisoner of war , cheated is outrageous , ” said McCain spokeswoman Nicolle Wallace .
[ NYT , Aug. 18 , 2008 ]
What McCain ’s Vietnam War -era POW status had to do with this was n’t clear .
But it was clear that Warren ’s assurance that “ we have safely placed Senator McCain in a cone of silence ” was n’t true , nor was McCain ’s light - hearted remark about trying to hear through the wall .
If McCain did get pre-briefed on what questions to expect , it would be reminiscent of the presidential debate in 1980 when someone from Ronald Reagan ’s campaign stole President Jimmy Carter ’s debate briefing book and allegedly used it to coach Reagan ’s responses .

The U.S. military ’s top officer warned Wednesday that an Israeli airstrike against Iran would make the Middle East more unstable and could add to the stress on overworked American forces in the region .
The comments by Navy Adm. Michael G. Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , came days after he visited Israel and amid growing international concern that Jerusalem is actively considering such an attack on Iran ’s nuclear facilities .
Mullen spoke at a Pentagon news briefing shortly after President Bush addressed the subject .
Bush was asked at a Rose Garden news conference whether he would strongly discourage Israel from an attack , but he sidestepped the question , saying only that he believed the best way to deal with the Iranian nuclear program was through multilateral negotiations .
“ I have made it very clear to all parties that the first option ought to be to solve this problem diplomatically , ” Bush said .
Advertisement
The comments appeared to reflect a strain within the administration as it grapples for a way to address Iran ’s nuclear program , which Tehran says is peaceful but Washington and its allies suspect is intended for developing atomic weapons .
Bush long has pointedly left open the option of military action by the U.S. or Israel , and administration officials have said they will not interfere with Israel ’s right to respond to what it sees as a looming threat .
But American military officials are concerned that U.S. forces , stationed nearby in Iraq and Afghanistan , could become entangled in any conflict that would result .
The Bush administration is eager to keep the prospects of an Israeli strike on the table to maintain pressure on Iran to freeze its uranium enrichment program , said Jon B. Alterman , head of the Middle East program at the nonpartisan Center for Strategic and International Studies .
“ There ’s a belief in the White House that we should n’t give comfort to the Iranians , ” Alterman said .
“ We ’re not actively planning an attack , as far as I know , but we ’re not going to let the Iranians sleep well knowing there ’s no possibility of an attack . ”

Fears of an Israeli attack have been fueled in recent weeks by large - scale war games by Israel ’s air force over the Mediterranean and a warning by a senior official of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert ’s government that an attack could become unavoidable .
Although Bush did not directly answer the question about possible Israeli action , Mullen was more direct .
“ Opening up a third front right now would be extremely stressful for us , ” he said , referring to the prospect of a direct clash with Iran while fighting continues in Iraq and Afghanistan .
“ This is a very unstable part of the world , and I do n’t need it to be more unstable . ”
In his trip to Israel , Mullen met with Defense Minister Ehud Barak and Lt. Gen. Gabi Ashkenazi , chief of the Israeli defense staff .
Mullen declined to say whether an airstrike was broached in his meetings but acknowledged that the Iranian threat was discussed and said he agreed that Tehran was a destabilizing force in the region .

Mullen has expressed his concerns for several months about the risks posed to U.S. troops in Iraq by a strike on Iran , Defense Department officials said , but those warnings have been made mostly in private .
Mullen declined to say whether he had delivered his assessment to the White House in recent days .
American military analysts familiar with Israel ’s thinking said the government there remained uncertain whether an attack on Iran made strategic sense and whether such a strike would prove a decisive blow against Tehran ’s nuclear program .
The subject is controversial in Israel , and many Israelis strongly oppose a strike .
Despite Mullen ’s remarks , rhetoric surrounding a possible airstrike continued to escalate .
The head of Iran ’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard had warned last week that his government would impose controls on shipping through the Strait of Hormuz if the country was attacked .
But U.S. Navy Vice Adm. Kevin J. Cosgriff said at a conference of regional naval leaders Wednesday in Abu Dhabi , United Arab Emirates , that the U.S. would not allow Iran to block the key waterway .
Advertisement
“ We will not allow them to close the Strait of Hormuz .
I ca n’t say it any more clearly than that , ” Cosgriff said , according to Reuters .
Despite Iran ’s official public positions , the country ’s leadership fears both a possible military attack and heightened sanctions and isolation , many analysts say .
In recent days , Iran has rolled out a diplomatic initiative meant to ease U.S. pressure by currying favor with other world powers .
Iran is considering a package of economic and political incentives being offered by Western diplomats to pave the way for wide - ranging talks if it halts its uranium enrichment program .
Diplomats have also suggested a less formal “ freeze - for - freeze ” package , a six - week period of preliminary talks during which Iran would stop adding new uranium - enrichment capability while the West stops pushing for sanctions .
Many Iranian political heavyweights have sought to change the popular Western view that the country is run by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , whose remarks calling for the destruction of Israel have been cited as evidence of Iran ’s ultimate intentions .
Advertisement
In an unusual article published Wednesday in the French daily Liberation , a powerful Iranian foreign policy official emphasized the role of supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , not Ahmadinejad , as the ultimate authority in Iran .
“ In key strategic issues , it ’s the supreme leader that the Constitution , approved by universal suffrage , [ says ] has the final decision , ” wrote Ali Akbar Velayati , a highly placed advisor to Khamenei and a former foreign minister who appears on Iran ’s political scene during peak crisis moments .
He urged readers to look at Khamenei ’s track record to “ predict the future course ” of Iran ’s diplomacy .
“ A compromise could be made using concerns common to Iran and other states , ” Velayati said .

Backers of the White House ’s course contend that the increasingly divergent voices coming out of Tehran are thanks , in part , to continued U.S. pressure and the prospect of an Israeli attack .
But some key international players have argued against military action .
Mohamed ElBaradei , head of the United Nations ’ nuclear watchdog agency , said over the weekend that an Israeli attack on Iran would turn the Middle East into “ a ball of fire . ”

From the WSJ : Banks in Euro Zone Tighten Lending Again
Banks in the euro zone continued to tighten lending standards during the second quarter amid a deteriorating economic outlook , and criteria could become even tighter , according to the European Central Bank 's July Bank Lending Survey .
...
" The ongoing tightening of bank credit standards and the further weakening in demand for bank loans strengthens our belief that the euro - zone credit cycle is turning sharply lower , " said Martin van Vliet , an economist at ING Bank .
The Fed 's July Senior Loan Officer survey should be released soon - and will probably show banks tightened lending standards in the U.S. too .
The Credit Crunch continues .
And the 2nd half recovery - projected by many economists - has been cancelled .
From Kelly Evans at the WSJ : Economists Expect 2008 's Second Half to Be Worse Than First .
Here is a video of the WSJ's Evans summarizing the article :
Several weeks ago , almost every major press outlet picked up the story of the photographs taken of an uncontacted tribe in the Amazon rainforest near the border between Brazil and Peru .
Unfortunately , it seems that fewer members of the media have chosen to keep following the story .
Last week the manager of Peru ’s Alto Purus National Park said that contrary to popular belief , the tribe is not Peruvian , and more importantly , are not being threatened by illegal logging .
He went on to explain that there are control towers in the area where lookouts keep a watch for illegal logging .
The tribe he said is from Brazil , and migrates normally back and forth from Brazil to Peru without knowing the difference .
These comments , combined with the recent news that the Peruvian government has sent a team to the Amazon to investigate the matter makes me think that there really is a problem .
Perhaps the government of Peru really does not want to do anything about the issue with the exception of conducting a token investigation .
This might be the reason why someone of importance is already dismissing the claim of illegal logging .
One challenge , granted , is the fact that it is ideal and desired to leave the tribe alone .
Without talking to them , it is difficult to truly know if they and others have been displaced by logging in Peru .
The area of the rainforest in which they live is also notoriously hard to travel through .
The thing that bothers me most about the aforementioned park manager ’s attitude is that he thinks it somehow matters whether or not the people in question are from Peru or Brazil .
He himself recognizes that they do n’t have knowledge of such a distinction .
So why should we ?
It is discouraging that the manager of such an important park and area would have such a cavalier and contradictory attitude toward helping protect the people that have traditionally lived within it , and probably know the place best .
Of course , it is possible that he is entirely correct .
I ’d like to see him provide more proof to back up his claims .
If you want to keep monitoring news about this fascinating situation , you can check in with Survival International , an organization devoted to the protection of tribal peoples .
They claim that approximately 1300 people around the world wrote to the Peruvian government asking them to stop illegal logging after hearing about the uncontacted tribe and the threat they potentially face .
They have information on their website about how you too can write to the Peruvian government , or donate money to their organization ’s efforts to protect tribal and indigenous peoples .

Two settlers from the West Bank settlement of Susya were arrested Tuesday , in connection with the attack reported by Palestinian shepherds , which took place near the Mouth Hebron , last week .
The two men , one of whom is a minor , were arrested after a covert operation by the Judea and Samaria and Hebron Districts Police .
They were taken in for questioning in the Hebron Districts Police headquarters .
Police sources told Ynet additional arrests are expected .

According to the police report , Four members of a Palestinian - Nawage family claimed they were assaulted by veiled settlers whilethey were herding their sheep in the south Mount Hebron area , seriously wounding one woman .
The family further claimed they had footage of the assault .
The footage was later obtained and published by the B'Tselem organization .
Another assault was reported Monday , as Palestinian shepherds complained that settlers attacked them near the west Bank settlement of Yitzhar .
The Yitzhar community denied the allegations , stating : " Our investigation shows no evidence of any resident or youth involved in such an incident . "
SAN ANTONIO ( Reuters ) - Democrats Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are deadlocked in Texas and Ohio heading into potentially decisive presidential showdowns , according to a Reuters / C- SPAN / Houston Chronicle poll released on Saturday .
Clinton is fighting to save her White House candidacy in the two primaries on Tuesday .
Obama , an Illinois senator , has beaten her in 11 consecutive contests to take control of the race for the Democratic nomination in November ’s presidential election .
In Texas , Obama leads 45 percent to 43 percent , down from a 6 - point advantage on Friday and well within the poll ’s margin of error of 4 percentage points .
In Ohio , they are dead even at 45 percent .
Clinton , a New York senator and former first lady , had led by 2 points on Friday in the rolling poll conducted by Zogby International .
Republican front - runner John McCain had huge leads in both states over his last major rival , former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee , as he moves closer to clinching the Republican nomination .
McCain , an Arizona senator , can come close to winning the 1,191 delegates needed to clinch the nomination with big wins on Tuesday .
The delegates select the nominee at September ’s Republican Party convention .
In the Democratic race , Clinton made overnight gains in Texas in some of her strongest voting blocs , including older and women voters .
She pulled almost even with Obama among voters who made their decision in the last few days .
“ Hillary Clinton may be making a connection with Democratic voters in Texas , especially among those in key demographic groups that have supported her all year , ” pollster John Zogby said .
Clinton also kept her big lead among Hispanic voters in Texas , who could account for one - third or more of the total turnout .
She had huge advantages in the heavily Hispanic southern and western parts of the state .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
Other opinion polls show tightening Democratic races in both states , where Clinton enjoyed big leads just a few weeks ago .
STILL UNDECIDED
In Ohio , 6 percent of Democrats say they are still uncertain of their choice .
In Texas , 7 percent of Democrats are not sure , leaving plenty of room for late swings .
Clinton , who has stressed her prescriptions for the ailing economy in blue - collar Ohio , showed strength in sparsely populated and less affluent southern Ohio , where she spent two days this week campaigning .
But she trailed Obama in heavily Democratic northeast Ohio and the growing central Ohio region .
Among Republicans , McCain leads Huckabee 58 percent to 23 percent in Ohio and 54 percent to 31 percent in Texas .
The other remaining Republican candidate , Texas Rep. Ron Paul , had 7 percent in Texas and 8 percent in Ohio .
The rolling poll was conducted Wednesday through Friday , with most of the survey coming before Clinton launched a fresh attack on Friday on Obama ’s ability and experience handling a national security crisis .
She released a new television ad to be aired in Texas showing children sleeping peacefully in bed .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
“ It ’s 3 a.m. and your children are safe and asleep .
But there ’s a phone in the White House and it ’s ringing .
Something ’s happening in the world .
Your vote will decide who answers that call , ” the ad ’s narrator says
Obama hit back with an ad of his own , which also showed sleeping children and spoke of a White House phone ringing .
“ When that call gets answered , should n’t the president be the one -- the only one -- who had judgment and courage to oppose the Iraq war from the start ? ” the narrator says .
The poll of 701 likely Democratic voters in Ohio and 708 in Texas had a margin of error of about 4 percentage points .
The poll of 600 likely Republican voters in Ohio and 596 voters in Texas had a margin of error in both states of 4 percent .
In a rolling poll , the most recent day ’s results are added and the oldest day ’s results are dropped to track changing momentum .
The poll will continue until Tuesday .

Usually , washing up in the toilet at a sporting event gets you a one - way ticket out of the ballpark , but that could be changing thanks to Lee Isherwood and his ODNA urinal concept .
The first - and probably last - of its kind , the ODNA promotes water conservation by combining a hand washing station with a urinal .
Instead of simply flushing , you go about your business and then wash your hands in the infrared - activated " sink " above .
The cascading water from the sink cleans out the toilet , and serves as the " flush . "

The beauty of the ONDA , beyond its Italian - inspired design and conservation chops ( uses only half the water - think about it ) , is that it can be fitted to existing plumbing .
It also features an " anti-splashback " design for those with less - than - desirable aim ( score ! ) .

Of course , for you non -hand washers out there , this is just another toilet .
You know who you are .

Mr Bello Abubakar says he does not go and find women , they come to him Nigerian Mohammed Bello Abubakar , 84 , has advised other men not to follow his example and marry 86 women .
The former teacher and Muslim preacher , who lives in Niger State with his wives and at least 170 children , says he is able to cope only with the help of God .
" A man with 10 wives would collapse and die , but my own power is given by Allah .
That is why I have been able to control 86 of them , " he told the BBC .
He says his wives have sought him out because of his reputation as a healer .
" I do n't go looking for them , they come to me .
I will consider the fact that God has asked me to do it and I will just marry them . "
But such claims have alienated the Islamic authorities in Nigeria , who have branded his family a cult .
When you marry a man with 86 wives you know he knows how to look after them
Wife Ganiat Bello Abubakar Most Muslim scholars agree that a man is allowed to have four wives , as long as he can treat them equally .
But Mr Bello Abubakar says there is no punishment stated in the Koran for having more than four wives .
" To my understanding the Koran does not place a limit and it is up to what your own power , your own endowment and ability allows , " he says .
" God did not say what the punishment should be for a man who has more than four wives , but he was specific about the punishment for fornication and adultery . "
' Order from God ' As Mr Bello Abubakar emerged from his compound to speak to the BBC , his wives and children broke out into a praise song .
Some of Mr Bello Abubakar 's wives are younger than some of his children
Most of his wives are less than a quarter of his age - and many are younger than some of his own children .
The wives the BBC spoke to say they met Mr Bello Abubakar when they went to him to seek help for various illnesses , which they say he cured .
" As soon as I met him the headache was gone , " says Sharifat Bello Abubakar , who was 25 at the time and Mr Bello Abubakar 74 .
" God told me it was time to be his wife .
Praise be to God I am his wife now . "
Ganiat Mohammed Bello has been married to the man everyone calls " Baba " for 20 years .
When she was in secondary school her mother took her for a consultation with Mr Bello Abubakar and he proposed afterwards .
" I said I could n't marry an older man , but he said it was directly an order from God , " she says .
She married another man but they divorced and she returned to Mr Bello Abubakar .
" I am now the happiest woman on earth .
When you marry a man with 86 wives you know he knows how to look after them , " she said .
No work Mr Bello Abubakar and his wives do not work and he has no visible means of supporting such a large family .
Many of the wives live three to a room , some have seven children
He refuses to say how he makes enough money to pay for the huge cost of feeding and clothing so many people .
Every mealtime they cook three 12kg bags of rice which all adds up to $ 915 ( £ 457 ) every day .
" It 's all from God , " he says .
Other residents of Bida , the village where he lives in the northern Nigerian state , say they do not know how he supports the family .
According to one of his wives , Mr Bello Abubakar sometimes asks his children to go and beg for 200 naira ( $ 1.69 , £ 0.87 ) , which if they all did so would bring in about $ 290 ( £ 149 ) .
Most of his wives live in a squalid , unfinished house in Bida ; others live in his house in Lagos , Nigeria 's commercial capital .
He refuses to allow any of his family or other devotees to take medicine and says he does not believe that malaria exists .
They were sick and we told God and God said their time has come
Wife Hafsat Bello Abubakar
" As you sit here if you have any illness I can see it and just remove it , " he says .
But not everyone can be cured and one of his wives , Hafsat Bello Mohammed , says two of her children have died .
" They were sick and we told God and God said their time has come . "
She says that most of the wives see Mr Bello Abubakar as next in line from the Prophet Muhammad .
Indeed , he claims the Prophet Muhammad speaks to him personally and gives detailed descriptions of his experiences .
It is a serious claim for a Muslim to make .
" This is heresy , he is a heretic , " says Ustaz Abubakar Siddique , an imam of Abuja 's Central Mosque .

Investment in renewable energy rose some 60 percent in 2007 , according to the UN Environment Programme .
Amid rising oil prices and concerns about global warming , global investors put $ 148 billion into new wind , solar , and biofuel projects .
In 2006 , alternative energy drew $ 92.6 billion .
In 2005 , that figure was $ 58.5 billion .
" Just as thousands were drawn to California and the Klondike in the late 1800s , the green energy gold rush is attracting legions of modern day prospectors in all parts of the globe , " said UNEP head Achim Steiner in a press release .
" A century later , the key difference is that a higher proportion of those looking for riches today may find them , " he said .
" With world temperatures and fossil fuel prices climbing higher , it is increasingly obvious to the public and investors alike that the transition to a low - carbon society is both a global imperative and an inevitability .... What is unfolding is nothing less than a fundamental transformation of the world 's energy infrastructure . "
According to UNEP , most of the money went to Europe , where stricter climate change rules are encouraging investment .
Second was the United States .
China , India , and Brazil saw their portion of new investment increase from 12 percent in 2004 to 22 percent in 2007 , an absolute increase from $ 1.8 billion to $ 26 billion .
Most of the money went into wind power , even more than what went into nuclear .
In Europe , wind power accounted for 40 percent of new alternative energy investment ; in the United States it was 30 percent .
Private investment in biofuels fell by almost one - third , and much of the money shifted to Brazil , India , and China .
Investments in solar power and energy efficiency surged .
UNEP also noted that carbon financing is shifting to the private sector , as carbon trading schemes become more established .

MEXICO CITY ( Reuters ) - Mexican men living and working illegally in the United States are more likely to sell their bodies for sex , take drugs or frequent prostitutes than they would have been in their homeland , increasing their risk of AIDS infection , U.S. researchers reported on Wednesday .
And if they are deported , they can take the virus back home with them , the researchers told an international conference on AIDS in Mexico City .
“ They are in a new environment , they are discriminated against , they are living in harsh conditions , sometimes just in boxes covered in plastic near the farms where they work , ” said George Lemp of the California HIV / AIDS Research Program at the University of California , who studied 458 Mexicans before and after they left their homeland .
“ When people live that way , they engage in high - risk behavior , ” Lemp said in an interview .
About 11 million Mexicans live in the United States , more than half of them undocumented , and a recent U.S. crackdown on illegal immigrants and increase in deportations could make the danger of HIV infection worse , conference delegates said .
The men in the study were three times more likely to have sex with a prostitute in California than they were before leaving Mexico , Lemp ’s research showed .
They were five times more likely to have sex while using drugs or drinking and 13 times more likely to have sex with another man .
The men were more likely to use condoms in the United States , according to the study .
But their risk - taking behavior nonetheless increases the possibility of infection , Lemp said .
In Mexico , 0.3 percent of the population is infected with HIV .
In the United States , the infection rate is 0.6 percent .
Hispanics make up about 15 percent of the U.S. population .
They account for 18 percent of new AIDS diagnoses , according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , but determining the infection rate among illegal Mexican immigrants is difficult , as many do not seek testing .
Steffanie Strathdee , a professor at the University of California , San Diego , found that residents of the border city Tijuana who injected drugs and had been deported from the United States were four times as likely to be infected with the AIDS virus as drug users who had not been deported .
New outbreaks of the virus are also being detected in small towns far from the border , researchers said .
Indigenous Zapotec migrants from the southern Mexican state of Oaxaca contracted HIV in the United States but were often too afraid of deportation to seek medical care , a joint study by Mexico ’s health ministry and the California HIV / AIDS Research Program found .
If they return to their villages , they can infect their partners if they do not know , or are unwilling to reveal , that they have the disease , ministry researchers said .
What 's the difference between an indie game and a blockbuster ?
About 5 million man-hours .
Producing a big - budget title like Grand Theft Auto 4 requires armies of people to spend years painstakingly sculpting every individual object in the game world .
Indie games , which are designed by small teams of geeks , can't possibly match that .
But an increasing number of garage coders are building elaborate 3 - D environments by outsourcing the design work — not to Bangalore , but to algorithms .
Take the upcoming online game Love ( shown here ) , due out later this year .
Around 100 players will be able to explore the virtual world together , establish towns , and fight monsters .
And its impressionistic watercolor environment was created by an army of one , Swedish coder Eskil Steenberg .
Love 's world starts as a generic landscape divided into almost 100,000 blocks .
" The game 's engine uses an algorithm to turn the blocks into hills , valleys , and oceans , " Steenberg says — a method called procedural generation .
It then examines the terrain and adds bridges , tunnels , and buildings to ensure that each area is interesting and accessible .
Once the world is created , it can still be modified .
" It 's like a Lego kit that both the players and the game itself can use , " he says .
Players can rearrange trees and boulders , reconfigure buildings , or hollow out new caves in hillsides .
The gorgeous vistas are also subject to natural phenomena like erosion , thanks to Steenberg 's tectonics system .
Love 's vast , morphing creation demonstrates how one man can become like a god — he sets the world in motion and lets simple rules , random numbers , and inhabitants do the rest .

Two weeks ago Dr Anne Guilding and her friends were relaxing in a restaurant , celebrating her son's wedding the day before .
The food , wine and conversation were flowing .
But then it suddenly turned ugly .
No , there was n't a bust - up between the in - laws .
It was because one of the diners dared ask for some tap water so she could take a tablet .
" We had already spent hundreds of pounds , buying wine and expensive sparkling water .
So I was gobsmacked when the waiter refused to bring us a jug of tap water , or even a glass .
He told us it was n't the restaurant 's policy to serve tap water , " says Guilding , whose party at the Brasserie El Prado in Bridgend included a member of the Welsh Assembly and a visiting American astonished that British restaurants do n't automatically serve free water .
" I asked to speak to the manager , and explained that we had bought plenty of drinks and wanted some normal water .
One member of the party needed to take medication and we did not consider asking for a jug of water unreasonable .
He flatly refused to let us have any , reiterating that it was not the restaurant 's policy . "
Guilding left the restaurant angry , embarrassed and humiliated .
But ultimately the restaurant was the loser - the group decided not to leave a tip .
The restaurant 's owner , Jesus Decelas , says : " Water costs us , the ice costs us , the lemon costs us .
I have to charge . "
According to the National Consumer Council , Guilding 's experience is depressingly common in Britain .
Its research found that nine out of 10 restaurants fail to offer free tap water .
A look at the Consumer Council for Water 's website , where restaurant - goers can post reports of restaurant behaviour , reveals widespread anger and indignation about charging for tap water .
One poster , " Sharon " , says : " When I was in Burger King recently , I started coughing and asked for some tap water .
They refused even though I had tears running down my cheeks , as I struggled to stop coughing .
They did offer to sell me a bottle of water ; however , I decided to buy a coke instead as that was cheaper .
Apparently , they do n't ' do ' tap water ! "
Burger King told Guardian
Money that the restaurant was wrong .
It is company policy to provide customers with tap water on request .
At a wedding in Birmingham , the hotel demanded £ 5 per bottle of water placed on tables , and resisted fiercely when the couple asked for jugs of tap water instead .
Pubs are named and shamed for charging as much as £ 1 for a glass of tap water .
Airports and railway stations are regularly cited as money - grabbers , removing free water fountains and effectively forcing travellers to buy bottled water at food outlets .
Some restaurants even tell customers that water can't be provided for " health and safety " reasons .
Dame Yve Buckland , chair of the Consumer Council for Water , says : " As a country we have put £ 70 bn into the water industry .
Tap water in Britain is now of the very highest quality and we urge restaurants to offer tap water to customers for free .
You should n't have to feel like a cheapskate because you ask for tap water . "
But can you force a restaurant to give you free tap water ?
The tales on CCW 's website ( ccwater.org.uk ) reveal widespread confusion over consumer law .
Some tell of heated arguments in restaurants where diners insist that restaurants are required by law to provide free tap water .
One says that under a law passed in Gladstone 's time to promote temperance , restaurants are obliged to provide free tap water .
Some in the trade believe that they are required to serve free water .
" As a retired hotelier and restaurateur , I was always led to believe that , by law , an innkeeper cannot refuse a traveller free water even if they do not spend any money at the establishment , " says one poster on ccwater.org.uk .
But these assertions are pure hokum .
The truth is that in Britain there is no legal requirement on restaurants to provide free tap water to customers .
Some pubs and other premises permitted to sell alcohol may have a clause in their licence that does require them to offer free tap water , but it's on a localised basis only .
Sue Penniston , spokeswoman for the Drinking Water Inspectorate , part of Defra , says : " There are a lot of misconceptions , some of which arose out of the Leah Betts case .
In the wake of her death , a lot of large premises had clauses put into their licensing agreements which obliged them to offer tap water free of charge .
" But apart from that restriction , restaurants do not have to give you water and do not have to supply it for free . "
She adds that it 's nonsense for establishments to refuse tap water on health and safety grounds .
" If a restaurant is on the public mains supply , the water is potable and there is no reason for it not to be supplied on health and safety grounds . "
In the absence of legal compulsion , Buckland is encouraging good practice among restaurant chains .
Pizza
Hut has said it will always give customers free tap water .
Strada , a pizza chain , already serves customers free chilled tap water in a designer bottle .
" Strada is pleased to provide tap water free of charge throughout its restaurants as part of standard service , " a spokeswoman says .
Restaurants and retailers are also facing intense pressure from green campaigners .
Earlier this year , environment minister Phil Woolas condemned the bottled water industry as " morally unacceptable " .
Mineral water suppliers on average use two litres of water for every litre put into a bottle .
Much is transported from overseas , from as far away as New Zealand and Fiji .
Four out of five bottles are plastic , most of which end up in landfill despite recycling initiatives , where it can take four centuries to decompose .
Consumer campaigners
Which ?
estimate that the number of plastic bottles sent to landfill each year would fill Wembley Stadium twice over .
Which ?
describes bottled mineral water as an unnecessary drink that costs us £ 1.68 bn a year .
The good news is that sales fell by 9 % last year , and in the credit crunch sales are expected to fall further .
" Our reasons for buying bottled water are drying up , " according to Which ?
United Utilities , one of the biggest UK water companies , has begun a campaign called " tap into water " that brings free tap water to events such as football matches and street festivals .
Philip Green , UU chief executive says : " At a time when we are facing such huge environmental challenges , buying bottled water at the rate of 3bn bottles a year in the UK is clearly unsustainable .
I hope the hospitality industry will recognise their customers are environmentally aware and offer them free tap water without prejudice . "

Are there any " good " reasons to not shop at Wal - Mart ?
We have been given plenty of " bad " reasons by the likes of not only New York Times columnist Paul Krugman and Sojourners magazine , but also our friends at Chronicles and The American Conservative magazines , who are parroting the far left .
According to them , Wal - Mart destroys jobs , puts mom & pop operations out of business , is anti-union , pays low wages , exploits its workers , practices predatory pricing , destroys small towns , is too big , sells too much junk , does n't provide health insurance to all of its employees , and , when all else fails , buys too much from " Red " China .
This is all bunk , of course , but still , " good " reasons can be given for not shopping at Wal - Mart , just like " good " reasons can sometimes be given for not doing business with any company or shopping at any particular store .
Ultimately , however , these " good " reasons all come down to personal preference .
There are no universal norms that can be applied here .
I live in a Wal - Mart town .
I am within a very short driving distance of three Wal - Marts , and can , if necessary , easily drive to four others in 30 to 45 minutes .
I can , therefore , speak with much experience under my belt ( and in my wallet ) about shopping at Wal - Mart .
I even worked there once , part time , to supplement my other part time income while I was in college .
That being said , my family and I do not buy everything at Wal - Mart .
Even though Wal - Mart is certainly " the incredible stuff machine , " it does not sell everything — at least not yet .
But I do shop there enough to make me an expert witness to the fact that there are " good " reasons not to shop there .
Here are ten of them .
Good reason # 1 : Crowds Wal - Mart is usually crowded .
If you do n't like crowds , then you probably should n't shop at Wal - Mart .
However , the same thing could be said about trying to get into a good restaurant on Friday night — at least in Pensacola , Florida .
Do you want to save money but do n't like crowds ?
Most Wal - Marts are open 24/ 7 .
Get there early in the morning or late at night .
If you are in a hurry to shop on your way home from work , then fight the crowds or go somewhere else .
Good reason # 2 : Parking Although Wal - Mart has one of the largest parking lots of any one store , it can be tough to find a parking space on a Saturday afternoon .
Many of the open spaces are quite some distance from the store .
With gas prices as high as they are , no one wants to burn up their precious gas circling the parking lot at Wal - Mart looking for a parking space .
The solution ?
Shop at another time or get some exercise and walk the distance from the parking spots that are the farthest out .
You needed to loss some weight anyway .
If you do n't want to go to Wal - Mart during the week or you would rather not get some exercise , then shop somewhere else — the parking lot at K - Mart is usually empty .
Good reason # 3 : Carts
When Wal - Mart gets really busy , the shopping carts disappear fast .
There is nothing more frustrating than to park at the far end of the Wal - Mart parking lot , walk the distance up to the store , and then find that there are no shopping carts .
Well , aside from going to another store , there is a solution .
There are always shopping carts in the parking lot that can be brought up to the store as you walk from the back of the parking lot .
And besides , with a shopping cart , you do n't have to carry your returns — just put them in the buggy .
If there are no carts to be found and you do n't wish to wait for one , then go somewhere else this time or every time .
Good reason # 4 : Lines Lines and Wal - Mart go hand - in - hand .
There is a line of cars waiting to turn into the parking lot .
There is a line of people filing out of the store that you have to stop and wait for as you drive by the front of the store .
There is a line of people at the deli getting their meat and cheese sliced .
There is a line of people at the checkouts .
There is a line of people at the return counter .
The worst line is the line of people waiting to get the oil changed in their car ( if their Wal - Mart has a tire and lube department ) .
If someone does n't like lines ( like me ) , then he probably should n't shop at Wal - Mart .
The solution ?
Do n't shop at Wal - Mart during peak times — go to Dollar General or Target .
Still adamant about shopping at Wal - Mart ?
Bring a book to read while you are waiting in line .
I always drop off my truck , van , and SUV ( I have n't driven a car for years ) to avoid waiting in line .
Do n't have a book or time to wait in line ?
Spend an extra $ 10 and get your oil changed at a mom & pop quick lube .
Good reason # 5 : Cashiers Although Wal - Mart has a multitude of checkouts , there is often a shortage of cashiers to man the checkouts .
My pleas to the four supervisors standing around to get some additional cashiers usually go unheeded .
True , I rarely have to wait at K - Mart .
However , I do n't like shopping at K - Mart — that is why I shop at Wal - Mart .
So , what 's the solution ?
See good reason # 4 .
Good reason # 6 : Inventory Although each Wal - Mart has thousands of feet of shelves , sometimes they are empty .
At the Wal - Mart I usually shop at , first it was pineapples , and then it was pinto beans — every time we went in the store the shelf was empty .
Granted , we were looking for the Wal - Mart brand of pineapples and pinto beans , but still , we expected the shelves to be full of inventory .
If someone is tired of empty shelves at Wal - Mart , then he can go somewhere else .
But there is a reason that the shelves are always full at some other store — no one is shopping there .
If full shelves for every item are more important to you than low prices and full shelves for most items , then by all means shop somewhere else .
Good reason # 7 : Selection I 'll be the first one to admit , it is annoying to go back to Wal - Mart a few weeks after a purchase and look for the same item only to find that it is no longer carried or has been replaced by something else that is similar , but not what I wanted .
But I am not dumb enough to think for a minute that I am entitled to be able to purchase the same identical item — even on the next day .
If you do n't like Wal - Mart for this reason then take your business elsewhere .
Good reason # 8 : Self - checkout registers I like self - checkout registers .
However , I like them better when they work .
The self - checkout registers at the Wal - Mart nearest my house always seem to be either closed or suffering from some glitch that entails tracking down the cashier who oversees them .
This is really a minor problem , however , since no one is forced to use the self - checkout registers .
These registers are far outnumbered by the regular ones with live cashiers .
But for those who insist on using the self - checkout registers , other stores have them as well and would be glad to have the extra business .
Good reason # 9 : Prices Contrary to popular opinion , the prices at Wal - Mart are not always the lowest .
Milk , for example , can always be purchased cheaper somewhere else — at least where I live .
But is it really worth the time and the gas to pick up something at another store for a lower price when the same identical item can be purchased while you are already in Wal - Mart ?
Not usually .
Good reason # 10 : Getting Help Looking for someone in charge of a particular department at Wal - Mart who has not left early and is not on break ?
You might want to think about it — a long time .
I know this is not true in every department at every Wal - Mart , but it invariably happens when you need some information in a hurry .
This may be a " good " reason not to shop at Wal - Mart for a particular item , but certainly not to boycott the store altogether .
If it bothers you that much then take your business elsewhere .
If you still prefer the " bad " reasons for not shopping at Wal - Mart then by all means do n't shop at Wal - Mart .
Just quit citing your bogus reasons as if they were facts .
Wal - Mart has never caused any firm to go out of business .
Wal - Mart can't close down any store but one of its own .
It is the customers who no longer do business with a company or shop at a particular store who put that company out of business or closed that store .
Wal - Mart has never caused any person to become unemployed .
Wal - Mart can't cause anyone to be unemployed except its own employees .
If Wal - Mart treats its employees so badly , why do so many thousands of Americans work there ?
Are they too stupid to know that they are being exploited by greedy capitalists ?
Do they not know that they are earning subsistence wages ?
Are they not smart enough to know that their health is in jeopardy because they lack health insurance ?
Why is it that the people so concerned about how Wal - Mart treats its employees do n't work for the company ?
No one is forced to work or to shop at Wal - Mart .
The employees of Wal - Mart vote in favor of the company with their feet when they show up for work .
The customers of Wal - Mart vote in favor of the company with their wallet when they do their shopping .
Whatever your reason , if you do n't like Wal - Mart , then do n't shop there and do n't work there .
And if it makes you feel better , do n't live in any town that has a Wal - Mart store .
Just do n't expect us to do likewise .
