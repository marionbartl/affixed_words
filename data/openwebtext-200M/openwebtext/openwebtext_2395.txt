Click to view November 9 , 1967 , T - minus 8.9 seconds :
Thousands of gallons of kerosene and liquid oxygen begin coursing through the giant center F1 rocket engine : The Saturn V's ignition sequence has begun .
Next , two outer engines are lit , followed 300 milliseconds later by the other two , ignited in pairs to avoid toppling the 364 - foot rocket above .
Nine seconds after all five engines go to full thrust , the first Saturn V rocket begins to lift from the launchpad , taking the unmanned Apollo 4 check - out module into space .
The launch was flawless .
Forty - one years ago to the day , the Saturn V became the biggest , tallest , largest - payload rocket ever to be sent into space .
Even more amazingly , it still is .
If you talk about the Moon landings , some people remember Armstrong and Aldrin landing on the moon , and may think of the photo of that famous footprint , or the planting of the flag .
I choose to remember the rocket that enabled it all , the Saturn V , a pretty shocking mechanical masterpiece all by itself .
Nearly everything about it is monumental in scale and historic in importance : •
At 364 feet high , it was roughly as tall as a 36 - story building .
•
Its launch weight of 6.7 million pounds was equal to about 2,200 average late ' 60s cars . •
Its orbital payload of 260,000 pounds is the equivalent of about 1,500 average people .
It was designed under the supervision of the rocket man , Wernher von Braun , and was chosen in 1963 from a list of potential systems proposed to make good President Kennedy 's promise that a man would visit the moon within a decade .
The rocket was so very large that it required NASA to build the Vertical Assembly Building , one of the world 's largest buildings .
It had to be constructed in three stages , could hold four Saturn Vs at the same time , and was reportedly so large that it had its own weather systems .
It 's still used to put Space Shuttle stacks together , and will house the upcoming Ares series rockets too .
It 's also home to the four largest doors in the world .
The Saturn V's first - stage rockets — five F1s made by Rocketdyne — are the most powerful single - nozzle liquid fueled rocket engines ever to see service .
The engine bell for each was over 12 feet across .
Each engine developed 1.5 million pounds of thrust , drinking over 670 gallons of fuel mixture per second :
That 's enough to empty your typical 30,000 - gallon swimming pool in around 45 seconds .
The F1 even makes the more modern Shuttle seem wimpy , since each F1 had more thrust than all three Shuttle main engines combined .
Its second - stage rockets — five J2s , also by Rocketdyne — were the largest liquid - hydrogen rocket engines in their day , and remained so until the Space Shuttle 's main engines were built .
The J2s were also the first rocket engines that were able to restart in mid-flight .
In comparison , America 's first manned rocket , the Redstone , was about the same length as the final stage of the Saturn V. Redstone was actually less powerful than the emergency escape rockets on the manned capsule atop the Saturn V. ( I suppose it 's important to note , too , that those escape rockets never had to be used . )
And Redstone 's maiden liftoff was only 14 years before the Saturn V's , which shows the tremendous speed of NASA 's rocket program in the '50s and '60s .
Here 's a great comparison chart of the world 's biggest and best rockets :

Even the Space Shuttle , deemed by some the most complex machine humans have yet built , does n't compare to the Saturn V .
And if you 're wondering what the unlabeled black rocket in the middle is , it 's Saturn V's competitor , the Soviet N1 moon - shot rocket .
This had four attempted launches , none successful .
Part of this was due to lack of management and funding , but part had to do with its incredibly complex first - stage design , which required the synchronized firing of 30 separate rocket engines .
Perhaps most amazing of all facts about the Saturn V is that each of its 12 main Saturn V launches was successful .
Two of them suffered in - flight problems including engine cutoffs , but the on - board computers were able to compensate , resulting in a successful mission .
The rocket was even considered at one point to act as a prototype for the first stage of the Space shuttle , thereby requiring no solid - rocket boosters .
If that had happened , the 1986 disaster that befell Challenger would never have happened .
There were also plans for several post - Saturn V projects on the drawing boards .
The best was a super - massive variant with eight engines in each of the first two stages , capable of launching all the International Space - Station hardware to orbit in one shot .
Sadly , for political and financial reasons , all variants were canceled .
Today , there are other contenders as NASA suits up for the next moon shot .
Though not as tall as its predecessor , the massive Ares V rocket , child of NASA 's somewhat troubled Constellation program , is technically able to put 414,000 pounds of payload into low Earth orbit .
But until the Ares V flies , the Saturn V remains king of rockets .
Call me overly nostalgic ( or pessimistic , seeing as Ares is well underway ) , but I 'm inclined to think the Saturn V may well keep that title forever .

I should add that I dated a Mormon man for a few months a while back .
What he told me about the LDS church 's psychological warfare on their gay members , the brutality and viciousness and intolerance with which they attack and hound and police the gay children of Mormon families , would make anyone shudder .
They hounded my ex for having HIV and for being gay .
They followed him secretly , outed him to his family and persecuted him for his illness .
When he was diagnosed with HIV at Brigham Young , he had to run out of the college clinic to escape those who wanted to sequester and punish him .
He died a few years ago .
Most of his Mormon family did n't show up for his funeral .
You want me to love these people ?
Let me say it 's my Christian duty to try .
The Mormons are not unique in this persecution of their own gay folk .
My own church has recently capitulated to bigotry in its own hiring practices , even as the Vatican is run by so many psychologically scarred gay men .
But the Mormons are particularly vicious homophobes .
Gay people are rendered invisible , their personhood erased in this church .
The cruelty the Mormon church inflicts on its gay members is matched only by the Mormons ' centuries - long demonization and hatred of black people .
That African - Americans would seek common cause with a church that only recently still believed they were the product of Satan shows how profound homophobia can be .
But this shared hatred can be exploited by the Hewitts and Romneys of this world .
And what we have just witnessed is a trial run for much larger ambitions .
If we do n't resist this now , we will not be able to resist it later .
We want to hear what you think about this article .
Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com .
Having delved recently into science fiction , these past few days I have been exploring the possibilities of our own near future .
What new things could we conceive of happening to us ?
One of the many ideas that have been going through my mind is the future of the computer .
A quantum computer does not yet exist , but when it does , it will revolutionize computing power forever .
For the first time , we would face the possibility of a thinking machine , capable of its own autonomy .
Artificial intelligence .
Needless to say , this sort of technology could revolutionize our own brain matter .
Imagine , if you will , a developed brain - computer interface , which straps onto you prefrontal lobe ( or wherever else it may suitably fit ) .
Now , imagine that this computer has wifi .
Suddenly , your brain is an internet hub .
It would take some getting used to , but you could access wikipedia with a simple thought .
It ’s not a far stretch , considering that the computer has become more and more personalized as the years have gone by .
What if they become so personal , they link up directly to your mind ?
This would take human communication , as well as the way we learn information , to a nearly magical level .
Meeting one or two people from this new era , you might be convinced they were genius telepaths , when really they simply had better wifi than your macbook .
What would this do to information , schools , or knowledge in general ?
The traditional methods of learning would quickly be out the window .
Most of your time thinking would also consist of browsing the web .
Memorization would be easier , quicker , and less necessary ( Index cards would certainly be a relic of past generations ) .
Instead , you might spend most of your time doing .
Children would spend some time rapidly learning information , and then a majority of school would be application .
What once took years now would take a few months , if even .
If Google can personalize your computer these days , imagine what it could do with this brain chip ?
Search engines applied to this brain - computer interface .
It could revolutionize education , instantly graphing charts of your thought patterns and mental clicks .
It could tell you what you think of the most , and what you ’ve learned to rapidly pick up on .
Teachers of the future could easily direct you along your individual learning path with a simple search engine .
It would all come down to a bizarre and hopefully delicate balance of autonomy and hive - mind .
We would all be part of the net , but completely personalized : just like now .
The interface would change , but the applications would be something we would at least become familiar with over time .
I find myself somewhat uncomfortable , yet truly amazed at the idea of “ Google - Mind , ” or a “ iGoogle ” with an entirely new meaning .
There are a few ideas , but I ’ll save them for the next post .

SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) -- The Food and Drug Administration has found one positive sample of U.S. - made infant formula containing melamine " at very low trace levels , " the Wall Street Journal reported in its online edition Tuesday .
The agency also found melamine in a few samples of nutritional supplements and medical supplements , all made by the five U.S. manufacturers of infant formula , the newspaper said .
However , the melamine detected was at low levels and is believed to be the result of contact with melamine during the processing or from packaging , the Journal reported .
Stephen Sundlof , director of the FDA 's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition , told the newspaper that the melamine found in U.S. - made products is not a cause for concern from a health standpoint .
confirmed that the radioactive material was found at the site , but said the source was inconclusive
Israel needs to provide more information to address Syrian allegations that the uranium may have come from Israeli bombs allegedly dropped on the site during the September 2007 raid
They did it .
They really did it .
So often crudely caricatured by others , the American people yesterday stood in the eye of history and made an emphatic choice for change for themselves and the world .
Though bombarded by a blizzard of last - minute negative advertising that should shame the Republican party , American voters held their nerve and elected Barack Obama as their new president to succeed George Bush .
Elected him , what is more , by a clearer majority than one of those bitter narrow margins that marked the last two elections .
Having snatched defeat from the jaws of victory in 2000 and 2004 it felt at times fated that the Democrats would somehow complete a hat - trick of failures on election day 2008 .
Instead , fuelled by unprecedented financial support , the key things went right for them yesterday , from the moment just after midnight when Dixville Notch voted 15 to six for Mr Obama ( the first time the early - voting New Hampshire hamlet had gone for a Democrat in 40 years ) , through to the early Obama success last night in the prized swing state of Pennsylvania and on into the battleground areas of middle America .
In the last two presidential elections , the American people divided down the middle , producing a both a geographical and a demographic divide that seemed increasingly set in stone .
Blue Democratic America consisted of the west and the east coasts plus the upper Midwest .
Red Republican America covered the swaths in between .
Women , minorities , the poor and the highly educated voted Democratic .
Men , white people , the rich and the religious delivered for the Republicans .
In the mind of Mr Bush 's strategist Karl Rove this division was the template of 21st century American politics , a base for a conservative counter - attack against 20th - century liberalism .
Rove 's America was not just turned on its head yesterday .
It was broken up and recast in a very different mould .
One of Mr Obama 's many achievements has been his refusal to accept the permanence of the blue - red divide .
He has reached out across the divide to states and voters that the embattled Democratic party of the Reagan - Bush years had forgotten about , places like the South and the Rockies , voters like farmers and small business people .
With the Democrats powerfully consolidating their position in both houses of Congress yesterday , the shift was consolidated at state and district level .
This marks the end of the conservative ascendancy of the past 30 years .
Whether it now marks a new , sustained era of American liberalism of the sort which followed the election of 1932 must remain to be seen .
What is not open to doubt is that Mr Obama 's win is a milestone in America 's racial and cultural evolution .
It is 45 years since Martin Luther King , in the greatest of all late - 20th century American speeches looked forward to the day when his children would not be judged by the colour of their skin but by the content of their character .
Almost unbelievably , that dream has now become a reality in the shape of America 's first African - American leader and its first black first family .
It is a day many thought they would never see .
It is hard to know whether to weep or shout for joy now that it has arrived - probably both - but it is a lesson to the world .
Mr Obama will take office in January amid massive unrealisable expectations and facing a daunting list of problems - the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , the broken healthcare system , the spiralling federal budget and America 's profligate energy regime all prominent among them .
Eclipsing them all , as Mr Obama has made clear in recent days , is the challenge of rebuilding the economy and the banking system .
These , though , are issues for another day .
Today is for celebration , for happiness and for reflected human glory .
Savour those words : President Barack Obama , America 's hope and , in no small way , ours too .

Conservative immigration spokesman Damian Green has been arrested and released on bail in connection with a series of leaks from the Home Office .
Police say Mr Green was held on suspicion of " conspiring to commit misconduct in a public office " .
The MP denied any wrongdoing and said " opposition politicians have a duty to hold the government to account " and that he would " continue to do so " .
He was questioned , but has not been charged and was bailed until February .
Mr Green 's arrest is believed to be connected to the arrest of a man suspected of being a Home Office whistleblower .
Speaking outside the House of Commons , Mr Green said : " I was astonished to have spent more than nine hours today under arrest for doing my job .
' Right to know ' " I emphatically deny I have done anything wrong .
I have many times made public information that the government wanted to keep secret - information that the public has a right to know .
" In a democracy , opposition politicians have a duty to hold the government to account .
" I was elected to the House of Commons precisely to do that and I certainly intend to continue doing so . "
The BBC understands that a junior Home Office official was suspended from duty 10 days ago over a number of leaks and the matter was referred to police .
He was arrested but not charged .
It follows a series of leaks , including : The November 2007 revelation that the home secretary knew the Security Industry Authority had granted licences to 5,000 illegal workers , but decided not to publicise it .
The February 2008 news that an illegal immigrant had been employed as a cleaner in the House of Commons .
A whips ' list of potential Labour rebels in the vote on plans to increase the pre-charge terror detention limit to 42 days .
A letter from the home secretary warning that a recession could lead to a rise in crime .
The BBC understands Tory leader David Cameron is angry about what has happened and stands by Mr Green .
' Big questions ' Speaking on BBC One 's Question Time , shadow chancellor George Osborne said : " I think it 's absolutely extraordinary that the police have taken that decision .
" It has long been the case in our democracy that MPs have received information from civil servants - I think to hide information from the public is wrong .
Disclosure of this information was manifestly in the public interest
Conservative Party
Profile : Damian Green
" It is early days , it 's an extraordinary case .
I think there are going to be some very , very big questions asked of the police . "
A spokesman for the Conservative Party said Mr Green had " on a number of occasions , legitimately revealed information which the Home Office chose not to make public .
" Disclosure of this information was manifestly in the public interest .
" Mr Green denies any wrongdoing and stands by his actions . "
Conservative sources said a police investigation into a high - ranking politician would have to have been cleared at " the very top " and have described the actions as " Stalinesque " .
' No prior knowledge ' But a Downing Street spokesman said : " This is a matter for the police .
The prime minister had no prior knowledge of the arrest of Mr Green and was only informed after the event . "
Mayor of London Boris Johnson has said he was informed in advance of the Met 's plan to arrest Mr Green , and expressed " trenchant " concerns about the move .
Mr Green , the MP for Ashford in Kent , who has been the Conservatives ' immigration spokesman since December 2005 , was arrested shortly before 1400 GMT at his constituency home .
The Tories say they understand counter - terrorism officers were involved in searches of his home and offices .
London Mayor Boris Johnson said he had been warned of the arrest
In a statement , the Met said the arrest was made without any ministerial influence .
They said : " The investigation into the alleged leak of confidential government material followed the receipt by the Metropolitan Police Service ( MPS ) of a complaint from the Cabinet Office .
" The decision to make today 's arrest was taken solely by the MPS without any ministerial knowledge or approval . "
It said search warrants had been carried out at a home in Kent , a home in west London , business premises in Kent and in central London " The search at the residential address in west London has concluded , the other searches continue , " it added .
A Home Office spokesman confirmed that a Home Office official had been arrested last week " in connection with an inquiry into alleged leaked documents " .

The Rudd Government will double its assistance to the ailing car industry to more than $ 6 billion over the next 13 years in a bid to retain thousands of jobs and valuable exports .
- $ 6.2 b plan to save car industry
- Plan includes $ 3.4 b in fresh funding
- Car tariffs halved to 5 % in 2010
- Package urges greener cars
The assistance includes an extra $ 3.4 billion in funding announced today as part of the Government 's strategy to protect jobs and focus the country 's car industry on becoming more efficient .
The Government 's ' A New Car Plan For A Greener Future ' followed a review of the future of car industry assistance headed by former Victorian premier Steve Bracks released earlier in the year .
The added funds bring to $ 6.2 billion in Federal aid for the industry , a move likely to be welcomed by companies facing reduced demand at home and abroad as the global economic slowdown saps demand .
'' In a world now beleaguered by likely recession and financial turmoil , the new policy announcements help provide the proactive influence needed to boost the international competitiveness of our automotive industry , " said Zoran Angelkovski , president of the Federation of Automotive Products Manufacturers .
The policy change will also " help us meet the critical challenges of a lower - carbon economy , '' he said .
Less welcomed , though , will be the Government 's decision to support recommendation by Bracks to halve car tariffs to 5 % from 10 % in 2010 .
Hundreds of jobs have been axed in the automotive industry , including about 1400 jobs at Ford 's Victorian operations to be cut over the next two years .
Demand stalls
" We 're very pleased with the announcement , " said Australian Manufacturing Workers ' Union national secretary Dave Oliver .
" We think it will create the right environment to attract investment which will inevitably lead not only to sustaining jobs but increasing jobs . "
" We 're please we 've got a government that is serious about the automotive industry and serious about manufacturing . "
Mr Oliver warned that even with the extra government help , there will be further jobs losses in the industry , declining to provide an estimate .
" The ball will now fall in the court of some of the major car manufacturers , " he said , downplaying the threat that beleaguered US carmakers Ford and GM may pull out of the Australian market .
In October , sales of locally made cars built by General Motors ' Holden , Ford and Toyota fell more than 16 % in a market that shrank 11 % .
" Part of the future '
Mr Rudd said Australia 's car industry was '' part of the future . ''
He said shifting the industry towards producing low emission and fuel - efficient cars would ensure its long - term viability despite the current economic " doom and gloom ' ' .
Mr Rudd added that he did not want to be the leader of a country that did not have a manufacturing industry .
Even so , the automotive plan was not a blank cheque to the industry or a rescue package .
The way in which this assistance is structured is it 's provided in response to actual investments and commitments by the car companies on the ground , all three of them , that 's the way we 'll be implementing it in the future . ''

Under the Green Car Innovation Fund , the Government will match industry investment in green cars on a $ 1 to $ 3 basis .
Mr Rudd said the tariff cuts had already been legislated and reflected Australia 's commitment to free trade and open markets .

Discipline .

No Shooting Shootings , Says Chicago Police
Photo by Mike Anzaldi
This kind of thing is expected in someplace like Nepal or China , but … Chicago ?
Freelance photojournalist Mike Anzaldi was arrested on Tuesday by the Chicago Police Department while covering a shooting in the Englewood section of the city .
He was charged with resisting and obstructing a peace officer , held for nine hours and had about 500 images deleted from his memory card .
No doubt tensions were high since an off - duty detective was involved in the shooting , but Freedom of the Press should apply at all news events , regardless .
And as long as journalists abide by the law , law enforcement should too .
We asked Anzaldi for his side of the story .
He frequently covers breaking news in Chicago , and when he heard about an officer - involved fatal shooting on the radio , he arrived at the scene and was shooting images and video on the property of a neighbor with about 20 - 25 other bystanders .
The problem , he says , arrived in the form of Chicago Police Department spokeswoman Monique Bond .
As Anzaldi tells it :
She said I needed to stop shooting because this was a crime scene , and that there was an investigation going on .
She went on to confirm that I was OK to remain in my location , but that recording was the issue .
I complied . …
A few minutes later , either a family member or friend of the victim arrived on scene .
Obviously , this person was emotional .
I turned the camera and chose to record that emotion .
Bond wasted no time in rushing right back to confront me about recording .
This time she demanded my CPD issued credentials .
This day , I did not have my credential necklace around my neck , but rather sitting on the front seat of my car - along with my wallet and cell phone .
Anzaldi says that the CPD credential does n’t actually grant journalists access to incident scenes but only serves as an ID .
In fact , he says the Chicago Tribune does n’t even apply for them , such is their value .
He concedes that the City of Chicago Municipal Code requires this ID to “ pass police and fire lines for the purpose of gathering and editing spot news or photographing news events . ”
But , he maintains that he has “ never been allowed across police lines , nor seen it done by any photographer , ever . ”
He continues :
My position was outside of the police tape , period .
When Bond demanded the credential , I again insisted that it was n’t on me , and that I did n’t need it anyway .
She argued and insisted that it was absolutely required to shoot news .
It was ultimately this lack of credential that fueled her argument .
She was flanked by uniformed cops and CPD Sergeant Keith Calloway who said , “ I ’ve seen enough , take him in . ”
Spokeswoman
Bond ’s statement to the media was that Anzaldi had crossed police lines and refused to leave when told to , which resulted in his arrest .
It took 6 guys , 5 phone calls and nearly 3 hours to come up with a charge .
They settled on obstruction .
My video camera and tape were confiscated , and kept .
My still cameras were held until my release , 9 hours later .
They were returned to me with the memory cards deleted .
As I signed myself out , I asked if we could make a report , or take note of the fact that the cards were deleted .
The District 7 commander and desk sergeant both said they would not make that note , and that deleting camera cards was not a crime anyway .
I was ordered to have a nice evening .
What really is hard to grasp here is how a person taking images and video – from across the street , not crossing police tape – is obstructing or compromising an investigation in any way .
Let ’s hope the CPD reviews this case , along with their policies .
A team of supertalented coders have managed to break the limits of C64 sound once again .
The Human Coding Machine from Germany and SounDemoN from Finland , have managed to create a music routine that allows you to have :- 4 channels of 8 - bit samplerate , digi playback - 2 channels of SID synth sound -
You can filter both SID channels AND SAMPLES !-
And you have enough rastertime to not being forced to turn off the screen , and can actually do something with it ;) This technique has been presented in the X'2008 demoparty , the bi-annual classic of the C64 scene where usually all barriers are broken and this one has been , fortunately , no exception !
The routine in question was demo'ed in the production VICIOUS SID ( picture ) , which also included other crazy audio routines you can check out by following the attached link .
Beta testing of this software will start soon , a few artists have started to experiment with pre-beta versions of the tools , like Fanta , who made an amazing X'2008 SID music entry with his tune Fanta in Space , which you can check out by clicking here ( this is the output straight from a Commodore 64 , nothing added ! )
Despite the vote Denmark still holds the purse - strings Danish politicians say Greenland is still years away from true autonomy , despite its vote for greater self - rule .
In a referendum on Tuesday , 75.5 % of voters in Greenland backed a plan to increase their autonomy from Denmark , the former colonial power .
Denmark subsidises Greenland 's 57,000 population to the tune of 3.2bn kroner ( £ 395 m ) annually - two - thirds of the Arctic island 's budget revenue .
Greenland 's foreign policy and security will remain in Danish hands .
" Whether the Greenlanders can take over more political institutions themselves depends heavily on the natural resources .
It could well be 30 - 40 years , " said Per Oerum Joergensen , an MP in Denmark 's governing Conservative Party .
He helped negotiate the new Greenland autonomy deal .
Greenland 's tiny population , combined with its economic dependence on Denmark , weakens the case for independence , even if Greenland strikes oil , a senior Danish Arctic affairs official told the BBC .
" The population is less than you could fit into the Superbowl , " Mikaela Engell of the Danish foreign ministry said .
Danish funding
The self - rule plan is expected to be approved by the Danish parliament early next year and should go into effect on 21 June 2009 .
Greenland 's sparse population is scattered along icy shores
Under the new arrangement , Greenlanders - most of whom are native Inuit - will have control of their energy resources and will be treated as a separate people under international law .
Kalaallisut will become the official language , instead of Danish .
But Denmark 's 3.2 bn - kroner annual grant to Greenland will be fixed .
If Greenland strikes oil then it will keep up to 75 m kroner of revenue from the oil sales , but above that half will go to Greenland and half will be taken out of the Danish block grant .
If the revenue reduces the grant to zero , then the whole subsidy deal will be renegotiated , Ms Engell said .
Danish MP Soeren Espersen , a member of the Danish People 's Party , was sceptical about the new autonomy deal , saying Greenlanders had been " brainwashed with unprecedented propaganda " .
" I believe huge problems are waiting in the future , " he said .
Greenland gained self - rule in 1979 , after previously being a colony and then a province of Denmark .
Greenland has been shaken by several scandals over abuse of public money and property in recent years .
Danish police are currently investigating how 11 Greenland MPs and top officials managed to buy attractive properties at a third of the market price .
The scandals have led some Danes to call for stronger controls over Greenland 's management of the Danish subsidies .
Untapped energy Meanwhile , global warming is fuelling a new Arctic race for resources , as geologists get ice - free access to the vast area , raising the potential for a future energy bonanza .
But earlier this year , the US Geological Survey ( USGS ) more than halved its estimate of the potential oil and gas riches off the coast of Greenland .
In 2000 , the USGS estimate was 40bn barrels of oil .
In 2008 , that was cut to 10 - 20 bn barrels .
Experts agree that it could well be 15 - 20 years before the oil is found - and even longer before the huge investments required pay dividends .
The European Commission says it is now time for EU countries to coordinate their Arctic policies , not least because it wants development of the region 's huge resources to be sustainable and environmentally responsible .
Denmark , Sweden and Finland all control parts of the Arctic region .
Greenland is associated with the EU , but is not an EU member under its conditions of autonomy .
Ms Engell said Denmark welcomed more EU involvement in the Arctic , having " tried to direct the EU's interest " towards the region .

The security vulnerability , detected by researchers at Baltimore , Maryland - based Independent Security Evaluators , follows last week 's release of Google 's T - Mobile G1 phone Oct. 22 , which is powered by the Android operating system .
Google 's open source Android operating system is designed specifically for mobile phones , many of which are designed with Web browsing , camera and GPS capabilities .
Researchers at ISE posted an advisory warning users of the potential security threat that would allow their mobile devices to be compromised or exposed if they visited a malicious Web page .
" These phones will currently ship with the vulnerability present and may pose a security risk to their users until and update becomes available , " said Miller in his posting .
According to the advisory , Google Android relies on more than 80 different open source packages .
And the security error stems from a buffer overflow vulnerability in some of the older , more vulnerable versions of the open source software .
Subsequently , an unsuspecting user could be successfully exploited simply by accessing an infected Web page using with a vulnerable operating system , experts say .
Once a user in infected , attackers could then obtain access to any personal information accessible from the victim 's browser -- including cookies , information entered into Web application and saved passwords -- in order to steal a bank account numbers , Social Security information and other sensitive data .
" If you end up on a bad guys ' site , he can basically take over the phone and run code , and access anything your browser has access to and do anything your browser could do , " said Charlie Miller , principal analyst at Independent Security Evaluators .
An attacker could also trick users into revealing sensitive , personally - identifying data by altering an existing site or creating a malicious Web page , Miller said .
However the error precludes attackers from manipulating other features of the phone , such as dialing the phone directly .
While ISE has reliable exploit code , Miller maintained that it will keep that information under wraps until Google repairs the glitch .
So far , there is no known exploit loose in the wild , Miller said , while contending that a successful exploit would likely be one that 's more targeted as opposed to a widespread attack .
" As a targeted attack , it 's definitely a possibility , " said Miller .
" This is an easy way to do it . "
Miller said that he notified Google regarding the vulnerability Oct. 20th -- two days prior to the release of the T Mobile G1 phone -- and said in his posting that ISE is " working with them to try to get a fix as quickly as possible . "
Google echoed that the company was working to remediate the issue .
" We treat all security matters seriously and will carefully work with our partners to investigate and update devices periodically to reduce our users ' exposure , " said Google in a statement .
" We are working with T - Mobile to include a fix for the browser exploit , which will soon be delivered over the air to all devices , and have addressed this in the Android open source platform .
The security and privacy of our users is of primary importance to the Android Open Source Project " we do not believe this matter will negatively impact them . "
However , Miller said Google first asked him not to make the vulnerability public until a fix was found .
Instead , he said he was criticized by Google after reporting the vulnerability to the New York Times before a fix became available .
" I thought it was important to tell people there was a problem , " said Miller .
" If you know there 's a problem , you could at least take precautions . "
" In my mind , I was doing the right thing , " he added .
Credit markets have started to thaw , yet stocks and the larger economy keep sliding .
What 's going on ?
Among the problems are the reality of recession and the uncertainty over Barack Obama 's policies .
But the larger story is that the global economy is fast popping its latest monetary bubble , the one over the last 14 months in commodity prices and non-dollar currencies .
The original bubble was in housing prices and mortgage - related assets , which the Federal Reserve helped to create with its negative real interest rates from ...

Introduction
The examples below show how to call C++ functions in a Microsoft Windows Visual Studio DLL from Haskell , and Haskell functions from the C++ DLL .
This illustrates that it is possible to link Haskell built with GHC to code produced by a different C compiler ( GHC uses GCC ) , and also illustrates some workarounds to the specific problems encountered when building a standalone library ( in this case a Windows DLL ) that is to be called from Haskell .
The examples are also relevant for the simpler case where you just want to statically link against C that is compiled with GCC .
However , there are other pages that cover other aspects of Haskell 's FFI :
Importing C functions that turn out to be CPP macros
Some C functions are actually defined by a CPP header file to be a C macro .
Suppose you foreign import such a " function " , thus :
foreign import foo :: Int ->
IO Int
Then you 'll get the right thing if you compile using - fvia - C , provided you cause the right header files to be included .
But the native code generator knows nothing of CPP macros , so it will generate a call to a non-existent C function " foo " .
In effect , the FFI is defined to interface to the C ABI rather than the C API ; it does n't take account of CPP magic .
To work around this you typically need to write yourself a C wrapper function ( in C ) , thus :
int foo_wrap ( int x ) { return foo ( x ) ; }
This C wrapper lives in a .c file and gets compiled by the C compiler .
Then use the Haskell FFI to foreign - import that , rather than calling the C function directly :
foreign import " foo_wrap " foo :: Int ->
IO Int
We have lots of examples scattered about the libraries already .
Callbacks into Haskell from foreign code
Suppose we have foreign code that takes a function as an argument :
callerback.h :
#ifndef CALLERBACK_H
#define CALLERBACK_H typedef double ( d2d ) ( double ) ; double twice ( d2d f , double x ) ; #endif
callerback.c :
#include " callerback.h " double twice ( d2d f , double x ) { return f( f( x ) ) ; }
We can provide a Haskell function as an argument like this :
CallBacker.hs :
{-# LANGUAGE ForeignFunctionInterface # -} module Main ( main ) where -- we need CDouble for C's double type ; Haskell 's Double may be different import Foreign .
C.Types( CDouble (.. ) ) -- we need function pointer type and free function import Foreign .
Ptr( FunPtr , freeHaskellFunPtr ) -- a " wrapper " import gives a factory for converting a Haskell function to a foreign function pointer foreign import ccall " wrapper " wrap :: ( CDouble -> CDouble ) -> IO ( FunPtr ( CDouble -> CDouble ) ) -- import the foreign function as normal foreign import ccall " callerback.h twice " twice :: FunPtr ( CDouble -> CDouble ) -> CDouble -> IO CDouble -- here 's the function to use as a callback square :: CDouble ->
CDouble square x = x * x main :: IO ( ) main = do squareW <- wrap square -- make function pointer from the function let x = 4 y <- twice squareW x -- use the foreign function with our callback z <- twice squareW y print y -- see that it worked print z freeHaskellFunPtr squareW -- clean up after ourselves
This can be compiled and linked with this Makefile :
CallBacker : CallBacker.hs callerback.c callerback.h ghc - O2 - Wall -o CallBacker CallBacker.hs callerback.c
A very simple example , but hopefully enough to see what is going on .
Important : do n't put " unsafe " on callerback , since it calls back to haskell via the wrapped function !
If you compile with - threaded , your program might simply hang on the callback with no hint as to what went wrong ( compiling without - threaded , however , might give you a hint ) .
Including the FFI header
The typedefs needed by foreign C functions are in HsFFI.h .
However , this file includes various other files , which in turn include other files , and makes use of various definitions which would need to be defined somewhere etc , and does n't compile under Visual C++ ( for example ) .
All in all , the simplest solution is to just make your own header with just the typedefs that are actually needed , and put this in your project directory , for example as FFI.h :
#ifndef FFI_H # define FFI_H typedef unsigned int HsChar ; // on 32 bit machine typedef int HsInt ; typedef unsigned int HsWord ; // Ensure that we use C linkage for HsFunPtr #ifdef __cplusplus extern " C " { #endif typedef void ( * HsFunPtr ) ( void ) ; #ifdef __cplusplus } #endif typedef void * HsPtr ; typedef void * HsForeign Ptr ; typedef void * HsStable Ptr ; #define HS_BOOL_FALSE 0 #define HS_BOOL_TRUE 1 #endif // FFI_H
Note that there is no point including prototypes for the functions hs_free_fun_ptr etc , because there is no way to link a standalone C library ( such as a DLL ) to them .
However this is not a problem because your Haskell code can explicitly pass the Haskell versions of these functions ( wrapped in a FunPtr ) to your C library if you need them .
Calling Haskell from C
As mentioned above , when building a standalone C library , we can't link our C code to the C functions like hs_free_fun_ptr .
However we can solve this problem by passing a FunPtr to the Haskell function freeHaskellFunPtr to our library at runtime .
In the following code , we provide a Haskell function to try to initialize our C library ( eg the DLL ) , run some Haskell code which would set up some call backs , enter some kind of message loop ( eg for a Windows app ) , then deinitialize the C library :
module Duma ( run , module Duma .
Font ) where import Foreign .
Ptr import Foreign .
Foreign
Ptr import Control .
Exception ( bracket ) import Duma .
Font import Control .
Monad ( when ) foreign import ccall duma_begin :: FunPtr ( FunPtr a -> IO ( ) ) ->
IO
Bool foreign import ccall duma_end :: IO ( ) foreign import ccall duma_run :: IO ( ) -- implements a Windows message loop foreign import ccall " wrapper " mkFreeFunPtr :: ( FunPtr a -> IO ( ) ) ->
IO ( FunPtr ( FunPtr a -> IO ( ) ) ) run :: IO a -> IO ( ) run f = bracket ( mkFreeFunPtr freeHaskellFunPtr ) ( \freeFunPtrFn -> do duma_end freeHaskellFunPtr freeFunPtrFn ) ( \freeFunPtrFn -> do initialized <- duma_begin freeFunPtrFn when ( initialized ) ( f >> duma_run ) )
An example of C code would be :
typedef void ( * FunPtrFn ) ( HsFunPtr fn ) ; FunPtrFn freeFunPtrFn = NULL ; __declspec(dllexport ) HsBool duma_begin( HsFunPtr freeFunPtrFnRaw ) { freeFunPtrFn = reinterpret_cast < FunPtrFn>( freeFunPtrFnRaw ) ; return HS_BOOL_TRUE ; }
Then within some C function which needs to release a FunPtr , you can just write :
(* freeFunPtrFn ) ( the_fun_ptr_to_free ) ;
Note that it is not safe to use the freeFunPtrFn to free itself , because some implementations of FunPtr store exit code ( as well as entry code ) in the FunPtr thus a FunPtr needs to be thought of as a function holder rather than just a function pointer ( this is why the definition of run above frees the pointer from the Haskell side once we 've already deinitialized the C library ) .
A scavenger pattern ( [ 1 ] ) can be used to avoid the danger of a FunPtr being freed while the function it points to ( actually holds ) is still being executed .
Note that a direct pointer to the hs_free_fun_ptr function can be obtained this way :
foreign import ccall " & " hs_free_fun_ptr :: FunPtr ( FunPtr a -> IO ( ) )
Improving efficiency
There are two types of foreign call :
those where the foreign function may call back into Haskell ( includes anything which makes use of the Haskell runtime ) before the original foreign call returns those where the function will always return without first calling back into Haskell .
In the first case , a significant amount of book - keeping is required to ensure that Haskell is ready to accept " incomming " calls from the foreign function before it returns , whereas in the second , since there is no danger of a call back into the Haskell runtime , nothing special needs to be done except to marshal the arguments and result as usual .
Therefore the second type of call can be made a lot faster .
To specify which type of call to use with a given foreign function , the FFI provides the keywords safe and unsafe .
The default is safe ( calls which might call back into Haskell before returning ) , so we only need to annotate those functions which we know will not call back into Haskell eg in our example above :
foreign import ccall unsafe duma_createFont :: CString -> IO ( Ptr RawFont ) foreign import ccall unsafe " &duma_releaseFont " -- note the ampersand duma_releaseFont :: FunPtr ( Ptr RawFont -> IO ( ) )
Note that duma_run still needs to be safe because it will execute Haskell IO actions in response to Windows messages ( the actual code for doing this is not included in the example ) , and duma_end also needs to be safe because it will make use of the Haskell function freeHaskellFunPtr ( or hs_free_fun_ptr ) to free any callbacks that were registered before returning .
The annotation you choose for duma_begin would depend on whether or not you need to call back into the Haskell runtime during initialization of your DLL .
Caution !
If you are not responsible for the source of the foreign function you should not mark the import as unsafe unless you are absolutely certain it does n't ( and wo n't ever ) call back into Haskell ...
If in doubt , consider posting a question to the Haskell Cafe or GHC User 's mailing list .
GHC and DLLs
Example of aquiring and using a foreign resource
Suppose you are writing a DLL to provide a nice windowing environment for Haskell , and you want to let Haskell obtain a text font .
Suppose a font is implemented by the C++ class Font , defined by :
// Duma_Font.h namespace Duma { class
Font { public : Font ( const char * name ) : refcount ( 0 ) {/* details omitted !
*/} ~ Font ( ) {} void AddRef ( ) const{++refcount;} void Release ( ) const{if (!-- refcount ) delete this ;} private : mutable unsigned int refcount ; } ; } // Duma
Continuing with our example DLL called Duma , we now edit Duma.h to add the following prototypes :
// Duma.h #ifndef __DUMA_H // be careful to use #ifndef (! ) # define __DUMA_H //
This header needs to be understood by VC ++ and GCC //
When included in the source for building the DLL , // __DUMA_DLL_EXPORT must be defined #ifdef __DUMA_DLL_EXPORT # define DUMA_API __declspec(dllexport ) #else # define DUMA_API #endif #ifdef __cplusplus extern " C " { #endif DUMA_API HsPtr duma_createFont ( const char * name ) ; DUMA_API void duma_releaseFont ( HsPtr fontRaw ) ; #ifdef __cplusplus } #endif #endif // __DUMA_H
We need to tell GHC about these , so we edit Duma.def :
LIBRARY Duma EXPORTS duma_createFont duma_releaseFont
Then we implement them in Duma.cpp :
// Duma.cpp #include " stdafx.h " # include " FFI. h " //
Note we have to define __DUMA_DLL_EXPORT and also // make sure FFI.h is included before we inlcude Duma.h # define __DUMA_DLL_EXPORT
#include " Duma.h " #include " Duma_Font. h " BOOL APIENTRY DllMain ( HANDLE hModule , DWORD ul_reason_for_call , LPVOID lpReserved ) { //
Note this is a * very * dangerous function so do nothing at all in here //
It is not known which DLLs are currently loaded //
If you need to do initialization / deinitialization , you should do // this explicitly by exporting init / deinit functions to be called from // Haskell return TRUE ; } using namespace Duma ; #ifdef __cplusplus extern " C " { #endif DUMA_API HsPtr duma_createFont ( const char * name ) {
Font * fontRaw = new Font ( name ) ; fontRaw -> AddRef( ) ; return fontRaw ; } DUMA_API void duma_releaseFont ( HsPtr fontRaw ) { reinterpret_cast < Font *>( fontRaw ) -> Release ( ) ; } #ifdef __cplusplus } #endif
The header Duma.h is used both within our DLL and externally , by GCC , to verify that the foreign function prototypes match those expected by the FFI .
When used within the DLL , we make DUMA_API expand to the relevant linkage declaration for Visual C++ by defining __DUMA_DLL_EXPORT .
Since ( we hope ) this symbol will not be defined when GCC sees the header , GCC will see a view of the header suitable for it .
Also in regards to the header , we have made our own local FFI typedefs to avoid the problems of trying to get HsFFI.h and all that it includes , to compile .
However GCC will see the real HsFFI.h so when we include Duma.h in our DLL , we have to remember to include FFI.h before it .
Of course we could have used some other symbol and another #ifdef in Duma.h to cause FFI.h to be included when needed but since Duma.h is only used in one place in the DLL ie by Duma.cpp there does not seem much point in going to this extra trouble .
The next thing is to create a Haskell module which will allow us to treat fonts as values which are automatically released when they are no longer needed , so for this we edit a module eg Duma .
Font by creating a directory called Duma in the same directory as your C++ files , then creating a file Font.hs in this directory :
module Duma .
Font ( createFont , Font ) where import Foreign .
C.String import Foreign .
Ptr import Foreign .
Foreign
Ptr import Control .
Exception ( block ) data RawFont -- corresponds to the C++ Font newtype Font = Font ( Foreign Ptr RawFont ) deriving ( Eq , Ord ) foreign import ccall duma_createFont :: CString -> IO ( Ptr RawFont ) foreign import ccall " &duma_releaseFont " -- note the ampersand duma_releaseFont :: FunPtr ( Ptr RawFont -> IO ( ) ) createFont :: String -> IO
Font createFont name = block $ do f <- ( withCString name $ \ cname -> duma_createFont cname ) >>= newForeignPtr duma_releaseFont return $ Font f
There are several points to note about this code :
We are using three types of pointers : Ptr Corresponds to a plain C pointer FunPtr Points to a Haskell or ( in this case ) C function , and encapsulates marshalling details necessary both before entry and after leaving the function .
For this reason a FunPtr must never be destroyed while the function it points to is still being executed Foreign Ptr Associates a plain C pointer with a finalizer function which will be invoked when the ForeignPtr value is garbage collected
It is important to realise that the type declaration of a foreign import shows the type of the Haskell value , not the type of the corresponding C entity that the Haskell value is bound to .
When the specification of the C entity in quotes is omitted , the FFI binds a Haskell value of type A -> B ( or IO B ) to a C function that takes a single argument of type A and returns a value of type B .
If the Haskell value just has type B ( or IO B ) , the FFI expects to find a C function that takes no arguments and returns a value of type B .
However in the case of duma_releaseFont , the Haskell value is a function pointer , and we want this to point to the C function duma_releaseFont , thus we need to explicitly specify the C entity being bound and put an ampersand before the C name , to indicate that we are binding to the address of the C function not the C function itself .
If we omitted the ampersand , the FFI would think that the C entity to use was a function taking no arguments that returned the function pointer rather than actually being the function pointer itself .
It is worth taking the time to achieve clarity about the difference between a function and a pointer to a function , especially since this distinction is blurred in C by the implicit " casting " of a function name ( which is considered to be the function itself , and which is not a first class value in C ) to the address of a function .
Luckily , if you are building with an optimized build , or use the - fviaC option , GCC will give an error message if you forget the ampersand , but beware : GHC native compilation will silently succeed and your app will mysteriously crash .
block is used to make the creation of the font atomic with respect to asynchronous exceptions withCString marshalls a Haskell String to a null terminated C string , and newForeignPtr takes the Ptr RawFont returned by duma_createFont and returns a Foreign Ptr RawFont so that duma_releaseFont will be called on the underlying Ptr RawFont when the Foreign Ptr RawFont value is no longer needed .
Finally we wrap the ForeignPtr RawFont in a newtype to hide all this from the end user .
Debugging Haskell DLLs
Some folks tend to use print , putStrLn , hPutStrLn and friends to emit debug messages to stdout or stderr .
This works fine , if you are developing console application , but if you are writing DLL then you can't be sure that it will be embeded in a process with console interface .
The problem is that when the process is with graphical interface , then it does n't have associated stdin , stdout and stderr at all .
Any attempt to use putStrLn for example will raise an exception and the process will terminate .
The solution is to use Debug .
Trace .
trace or Debug.Trace.putTraceMsg instead .
When they are called from a process with console interface then the messages are redirected to stderr .
When the process is with graphical interface then the debugger console is used instead .
If you want to debug your DLL , then launch the embedding process from your favorite debugger ( gdb , WinDbg or Visual Studio for example ) and you will see all debug messages in its output console .
Beware of DllMain ( ) !
The body of a DllMain ( ) function is an extremely dangerous place !
This is because the order in which DLLs are unloaded when a process is terminating is unspecified .
This means that the DllMain ( ) for your DLL may be called when other DLLs containing functions that you call when de-initializing your DLL have already been unloaded .
In other words , you ca n't put shutdown code inside DllMain ( ) , unless your shutdown code only requires use of certain functions which are guaranteed to be available ( see the Platform SDK docs for more info ) .
In particular , if you are writing a DLL that 's statically linked with Haskell , it is not safe to call hs_exit ( ) from DllMain ( ) , since hs_exit ( ) may make use of other DLLs .
( For example it causes finalizers to be run and a finalizer may need to make use of a function in some other DLL . )
A solution is to always export Begin ( ) and End ( ) functions from your DLL , and call these from the application that uses the DLL , so that you can be sure that all DLLs needed by any shutdown code in your End ( ) function are available when it is called .
The following example is untested but illustrates the idea .
It would be good if someone could check over it or replace by a real life example .
Suppose we have a DLL called Lewis which makes use of 2 Haskell modules Bar and Zap , where Bar imports Zap and is therefore the root module in the sense of GHC user 's manual section 11.2.1.1 .
Then the main C++ unit for the DLL would look something like :
// Lewis.cpp -- compiled using GCC #include < Windows.h > # include " HsFFI.h " # define __LEWIS_DLL_EXPORT
#include " Lewis.h " #include " Bar_stub.h " // generated by GHC # include " Zap_stub. h " BOOL APIENTRY DllMain ( HANDLE hModule , DWORD ul_reason_for_call , LPVOID lpReserved ) { return TRUE ; } extern " C " { LEWIS_API HsBool lewis_Begin ( ) { int argc = ... char * argv [ ] = ... // Initialize Haskell runtime hs_init ( &argc , &argv ) ; // Tell Haskell about all root modules hs_add_root ( __stginit_Bar ) ; // do any other initialization here and // return false if there was a problem return HS_BOOL_TRUE ; } LEWIS_API void lewis_End ( ) { hs_exit( ) ; } LEWIS_API HsInt lewis_Test ( Hs Int x ) { // use Haskell functions exported by // modules Bar and / or Zap return ... } } // extern " C "
and some application which used the functions in the DLL would have a main ( ) function like :
// MyApp.cpp #include " stdafx.h " # include " Lewis.h " int main ( int argc , char * argv [ ] ) { if ( lewis_Begin ( ) ) { // can now safely call other functions // exported by Lewis DLL } lewis_End ( ) ; return 0 ; }
Lewis.h would have to have some appropriate #ifndef to ensure that the Haskell FFI types were defined for external users of the DLL ( who would n't necessarily have GHC installed and therefore would n't have the include files like HsFFI.h etc ) .
Setting up your build environment ( Visual Studio Specific )
If you have n't already done so , create a new windows environment variable called GHC_HOME and set it to c:\ghc\ghc - 6.4.2 or wherever you 've installed GHC
and set it to or wherever you 've installed GHC Create a directory eg c:\dll to store all your DLLs
to store all your DLLs Add this to the PATH environment variable so that Windows will find your DLL at runtime ( Also your path should contain %GHC_HOME % \bin; %GHC_HOME % \gcc -lib if you also want to compile from the command line )
environment variable so that Windows will find your DLL at runtime ( Also your path should contain if you also want to compile from the command line ) Create a new Visual Studio DLL project .
For the purposes of this example , we will call this Duma .
.
In the Solution pane , right click on Duma then select Properties → Build Events → Post - Build Event and add the following event :
Command Line : copy " $( TargetDir ) Duma.dll " c:\dll Description : Copying duma.dll Excluded From Build : No
In the Solution Pane , rename the folder Source Files to Code Files and adjust the properties of this folder so that .h files are also filtered into it .
( This is a good idea for any C++ project because it keeps the .cpp and .h together in the same list which makes editing a C++ unit a lot easier . )
to and adjust the properties of this folder so that files are also filtered into it .
( This is a good idea for any C++ project because it keeps the and together in the same list which makes editing a C++ unit a lot easier . )
Also rename the folder Header Files to Haskell Files and change its filter to select .hs files .
to and change its filter to select files .
In the Code Files folder , create a text file called Duma.def , then select Properties → Custom Build Step → General and enter the following :
Command Line : %GHC_HOME%\gcc-lib\dlltool -d " $( InputDir ) Duma.def " - l c:\dll\libDuma .a Description : Creating libDuma . a from .def Outputs : c:\dll\libDuma.a Additional Dependencies :
This makes the functions you will export from your DLL visible to GHC and GCC .
( The path to dlltool given above will need to be changed if you have installed GHC in a different place . )
Also in the Code Files folder , create a text file called ghc. bat with the following content :
echo off REM Optimized build %GHC_HOME%\bin\ghc.exe -fglasgow-exts - fffi - I. -#include Duma.h -- make main.hs - O2 - optl - lDuma - optl - L" c:\dll " if errorlevel 1 goto failed echo Success :-) goto end : failed echo Failure :-( :end
( The above batch file is based on that kindly supplied by Neil Mitchell on the GHC mailing list . )
You may also want to use - optl - mwindows if you do n't want Haskell to create a console window .
In Tools → External Tools , click Add and specify the following :
Title : &ghc Command : ghc.bat Arguments : Initial directory : $ ( ProjectDir )
Remember to tick the Use Output Window box so you can see what 's happening on the output pane of Visual Studio .
After you 've done all this , you can build your DLL as usual by hitting Control - Shift - B and then make your Haskell program that uses the DLL by using Alt - t - g ( assuming that your main .hs is in the same directory as the C files ) .
When you just make changes to your DLL , you can use F5 as normal ( the first time you do this you will have to type main .
exe into the box where it asks you for the main executable to use ) .
If you later install a newer version of GHC , you only need to modify the GHC_HOME windows environment variable .
Using GHC for DLLs in Excel
This part illustrates the preceding Beware of dllMain ( ) !
section of this document .
It extends the information found in the Building and using Win32 DLLs article .
For build instructions and base code , refer to this article .
Excel crash on Exit when using a GHC DLL
Calling shutdownHaskell from the dllMain function , as in the given example can cause Excel to crash on exit .
As explained in section Beware of DllMain ( ) ! of this article , it 's safer to call startupHaskell and shutdownHaskell from outside DllMain .
Here is an updated dllMain .c code with additional initialization and shutdown functions ( tested ) .
#include < windows.h> # include < Rts.h > # define __ADDER_DLL_EXPORT
# define ADDER_API _declspec( dllexport ) extern void __stginit_Adder ( void ) ; static char* args [ ] = { " ghcDll " , NULL } ; /* N.B. argv arrays must end with NULL */ BOOL STDCALL DllMain ( HANDLE hModule , DWORD ul_reason_for_call , LPVOID lpReserved ) { return TRUE ; } ADDER_API BOOL adder_Begin( ) { startupHaskell ( 1 , args , __stginit_Adder ) ; return HS_BOOL_TRUE ; } ADDER_API void adder_End ( ) { shutdownHaskell ( ) ; }
VBA code for Dll initialization and shutdown
We must call adder_Begin before any call to the DLL exported functions and adder_End before the DLL is unload .
Excel VBA provides us with two callback functions that seems appropriate for this : Workbook_Open and Workbook_BeforeClose .
Function declaration in Excel is extended to add the two initalization and shutdown functions .
I put it in a new module so I can make them public .
The code looks like this :
Public Declare Function adder Lib " adder.dll " Alias " adder@8 " ( ByVal x As Long , ByVal y As Long ) As Long Public Declare Function adder_Begin Lib " adder.dll " ()
As Boolean Public Declare Sub adder_End Lib " adder.dll " ()
The callback functions have to be defined in the ThisWorkbook module and look like this :
Private Sub Workbook_BeforeClose ( Cancel As Boolean ) adder_End End Sub Private Sub Workbook_Open ( ) adder_Begin End Sub
Known problems
If closing Excel is canceled the Workbook_BeforeClose function will be called and haskell will be shutdown leaving the Workbook open but with Haskell down .
The application will crash on the next DLL function call .
This is easy to reproduce , modify the WorkBook , close it without saving and press Cancel .
Change some value to cause a GHC function to be called and Enjoy Excel crashing .
Random Questions
Are FunPtr 's stable ?
Yes .
Once you 've obtained a FunPtr the FunPtr remains valid until it is explicitly freed ( ie the garbage collector will not break it ) .
See Tackling the Awkward Squad section 6.4.2
Can I free a FunPtr from inside the function itself ?
Yes ( unless you are on IA64 , right now ) .
See this thread ( the later messages in particular ) for more details .
If the Tories do n’t get a majority , thank the Bloc not the Grits , Greens or NDP
Having just finished a massive update to the Paulitics National Polling Resource , the Provincial / Regional Polling Resource , and the Seat Projection Meta - Analysis , there is one fact that has become abundantly clear :
If the Conservatives do n’t get a majority , we should thank Gilles Duceppe ’s Bloc Québecois , not the Dion Liberals , the May Greens , or Layton ’s NDP .
Of all of the data uploaded this evening , the astonishing rise of the Bloc in Quebec ( pictured below ) is perhaps the most impressive .
Because of the Bloc ’s rise , the Conservatives have dropped 10 % in Quebec since September 13th .
In other words , 1 in 3 Tory supporters in Québec have abandoned that party since September 13th .
Senator Joe Lieberman ( I ) , Connecticut
Inherent in politics is the fact that someone always loses .
Some lose gracefully , some lose poorly , and , as in the case of Joe Lieberman , some lose their minds .
Since being defeated by an antiwar candidate in the Democratic primary in 2006 , Lieberman ( who was subsequently reelected as an Independent ) has pursued his campaign of revenge against his former party , thinly disguised as an act of principle , replete with the quavering sanctimony that no country should have to put up with from anyone , much less from this small man .
Men of the north , hang your heads in shame .
Spot checks on commuters have revealed that the further north men live , the dirtier their hands .
In Newcastle , swabs of men's hands revealed more than half were contaminated with bacteria normally found in faeces .
The percentage of the unclean fell with latitude , with 34 % of Liverpudlian men testing positive for faecal bacteria , 21 % in Birmingham , 15 % in Cardiff and 6 % in London .
The findings are part of a study by scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine into the nation 's hand - washing habits , which was designed to highlight how infections can easily be spread by people failing to observe basic rules of hygiene .
Researchers approached 409 commuters waiting at bus stops outside major train stations in the five cities .
Swabs of their hands were sent back to a laboratory , where any bacteria on them were grown and identified .
" When we first saw this north - south divide we scratched our heads .
We thought it might be something to do with the way we did the tests , the weather , or the time it took to get the samples back to the lab , but the issue is with the men , not the women , so it must be a difference in behaviour .
The best I can think of is that men in the north are too tough to wash their hands .
We need to investigate it more , it 's puzzling , " said Val Curtis , director of the school 's hygiene centre .
Overall , 28 % of people who agreed to a swab tested positive for faecal bacteria , such as Enterococcus , E coli , Klebsiella and Panteoa .
The types of bacteria rarely cause serious infections , but their presence has alarmed scientists none the less .
" I was expecting to find around five to 10 % of people with faecal bacteria on their hands , so I was flabbergasted at the number .
It means people are n't washing their hands after using the toilet , that they are contaminated and leave their bugs on surfaces where other people pick them up , " Curtis said .
The study , which is preliminary and has yet to be published , found that female hygiene was more consistent than that of males .
On average , 27 % of women had faceal bacteria on their hands , with Londoners again the cleanest at 21 % and Liverpudlians the dirtiest at 31 % .
The study has been released to coincide with Global Handwashing Day , a public - private partnership set up to promote hand washing with soap to reduce diarrhoea and other infections in developing countries .
" These bugs just should n't be on peoples ' hands .
If someone has a pathogen in them , such as rotavirus or Salmonella , this is a superhighway for passing it around to the community , " Curtis said .
" Just rinsing your hands under the tap does n't remove bacteria , because they tend to get stuck in any dirt and grease you 've got on your hands . "
The study found that people who used the bus were nearly twice as likely to test positive for faecal bacteria than train commuters .
Bacteria can live for two to three hours on surfaces after being touched by a contaminated hand .
Worldwide , around 1.9 million people die from diarrhoea every year .
In Britain , an estimated one in five has an episode of diarrhoea each year .
Mike Catchpole , director of the Health Protection Agency 's Centre for Infections , said : " Hand washing is one of the most important ways of controlling the spread of infections , especially those that cause diarrhoea and vomiting , colds and flu .
" Global Handwashing Day serves as a timely reminder that people should always wash their hands after using the toilet , before eating or handling food , and after handling animals .
And remember to cover all cuts and scratches with a waterproof dressing . "
HPA figures suggest that cases of norovirus , the winter vomiting bug , are rising and that the annual norovirus season is likely to have begun already .
Norovirus is the most common cause of gastrointestinal disease in the UK , with the number of cases peaking between October and March .
Between 600,000 and a million people in the UK are affected each year .
• This article was amended on Thursday October 16 2008 .
In the article above we stated that : " Worldwide , around 1.9 million people die from diarrhoea every day " .
We meant to say , every year .
This has been changed .
McCain / Palin : Team from Hell
Questions John McCain Would Not Answer
McCain / Palin : Team from Hell
John McCain was contacted on several occasions to answer some questions for Pravda.ru .
Unlike the western corporate media , nothing is hidden here , nothing is out of bounds to ask the candidate .
Both he and his staff failed to respond .
Those unanswered questions are presented here :
Senator McCain , is it true that as a child , you were quick to anger and you used to hold your breath until you passed out ?
Was it also true that your parents would put you in a bath of ice water to try and get you to stop ?
Is it true that you finished 894th out of 899 at the Naval Academy , the absolute bottom of your class ?
Is it true that because of your family connections , you were admitted into the flight training program over much more qualified candidates ?
Is it true that in flight school , your grades were very poor ( according to your instructor ) ?
Is it true that your first wife , while you were a POW , fought to make sure that you came home and you rewarded this loyalty by divorcing her immediately after your return ?
Is it true you were known for carousing , womanizing , drinking and a poor choice of companions , and that one month after your divorce , you married Cindy Lou Hensley , wealthy daughter from the prosperous Anheuser - Busch beer fortune ?
Is it true that right after you were shot down you were giving interviews to foreign correspondents , providing information on your prior command , casualties and tactics , in violation of the Military Code of Conduct ?
Is it true that while a POW for 5 years , you admit to having given information to the enemy while a prisoner of war in exchange for favors ?
Is it true that when you returned from captivity , you were ashamed to face your family because of what you did while a prisoner of war ?
Is it true that while a member of the Senate Select Committee on POW / MIA Affairs ( 1991 - 1993 ) you referred to POW / MIA family members and activists as whiners , vultures and the lunatic fringe ?
Can you comment on your absolutely dismal voting record on veterans ’ bills and why so many veterans are angry with you ?
http://www.vetvoice.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=1973
Is it true that you fought to improve relations with Vietnam because your family stood to profit greatly because of their large corporate interests in the Budweiser Corporation ?
Was n’t Budweiser among the first large US Corporations to enter Vietnam after relations were normalized ?
Did you recently tell reporters , " I hated the gooks .
I will hate them as long as I live " ?
Was it due to bad luck or lack of ability that you lost 5 aircraft in 11 years ?
The first one in 1958 when you ditched one plane into Corpus Christi Bay while practicing landings .
The second was over the Iberian Peninsula while flying too low , taking out some power lines .
The third happened when returning from partying after an Army - Navy game in Philadelphia , you crashed while flying a navy trainer .
The fourth when you were in the cockpit of a plane aboard the USS Forrestal when it was hit by a rocket .
The plane was destroyed , and you escaped with some injuries , but 134 sailors in the same vicinity on the Forrestal were killed .
The fifth plane was lost when you were shot down on your 23rd mission in Vietnam where you became a POW ?
Is it true that despite having received all sorts of military honors , you had only flown 23 combat missions during the war totaling no more than 20 actual hours in combat ?
Do you still stand behind your previous statements to " make it a hundred " years in Iraq and " that would be fine with me that U.S. troops could be in Iraq for ' a thousand years ' or ' a million years ” as far as you are concerned ?
Before a crowd at Murrells Inlet VFW Hall in South Carolina , you were asked when you thought the US Military might " send an air mail message to Tehran " you started singing : “ ' Bomb , bomb , bomb , bomb , bomb Iran , ' to the tune of Barbara Ann .
What were you thinking ?
Does such behavior suggest that you have the ability to deal with national security , foreign relations and diplomacy ?
You were also quoted on several instances telling voters they are to expect many other wars .
Can you tell us about the wars you are planning on ?
It is said you take a lot of medication for arthritis pain and you also suffer from recurrent melanomas , a deadly form of cancer that spreads quickly .
Given your age and state of health , what are your chances of being healthy enough to perform the duties of your office if elected ?
On March 21 , 2008 , while speaking at a press conference in Amman , Jordan you falsely accused Iran of harboring and training al - Qaida terrorists .
You apologized after Joe Lieberman whispered in your ear that you were wrong .
You then withdrew that statement and instead said that “ While the Iranian government is training other ‘ Islamic extremists ’ across the border , that does not mean they are involved with al - Qaida in Iraq . ”
How does this reflect on your judgment and ability to conduct international relations for your country ?
McCain Misleads US Autoworkers
According to the United Auto Workers union ( UAW ) , Senator McCain is not telling the truth about always buying American cars , as the family fleet reportedly includes a Honda and a Volkswagen among the 13 cars they own .
Cindy McCain drives a Lexus with the private number plate " Ms Bud " which is registered to Anheuser - Busch .
" When he's in the Midwest , he tells voters he supports the industry , " UAW president Ron Gettelfinger said .
In an interview on a Detroit television station , McCain told Michigan voters he was “ Proud to buy American cars . ”
Newsweek reports that Barack Obama and his wife Michelle own a single car , a Ford Escape Hybrid , which was dubbed by Gettelfinger as a " green machine " emblematic of a future generation of US vehicles .
General Petraeus Counters McCain
At a talk at the Heritage Foundation , General Petraeus contradicted John McCain 's arguments about Iraq and Afghanistan .
This would n't be significant except for the fact that McCain consistently cites Petraeus as a justification for his policies .
The drop in violence in Iraq was mainly due to the Anbar Awakening .
As early as 2004/2005 , commanders in Iraq were recommending that the US to negotiate with insurgents .
Petraeus definitively came out for opening communications with America ’s adversaries , a position McCain is attacking Obama for advocating .
Citing his Iraq experience , Petraeus said , “ You have to talk to enemies . ” McCain praises General Petraeus for his success , but refuses to acknowledge what Petraeus himself has learned and said .
What Did McCain Mean by " That One "
John McCain made the remark during the second last debate when discussing a 2005 Senate vote on an energy bill .
“ There was an energy bill on the floor of the Senate loaded down with goodies , billions for the oil companies , and it was sponsored by Bush and Cheney .
You know who voted for it ?
You might never know .
That one , ” he said , pointing to Obama .
“ You know who voted against it ?
Me . ”
McCain was going back and forth on the issues .
He was so angry about the state of his campaign that he referred to Barack Obama as ‘ that one , ’ and could n’t look at Senator Obama , he could n’t manage in his anger to say Obama ’s name .
Many were shocked by the offensiveness of this reference .
Criminal Terrorist Associate and Supporter of McCain
While John McCain and his campaign have been continuously bringing up Barack Obama ’s working with William Ayers , a former Weathermen activist when Obama was 8 years old , Gordon Liddy has contributed thousands of dollars to the campaigns of John McCain .
Liddy held a fundraiser for McCain at his home and hosted him on his radio show , where McCain said to Liddy , " I 'm proud of you . "
In his interview on Liddy ’s radio show , McCain said , " Congratulations on your continued success and adherence to the principles and philosophies that keep our nation great . "
Liddy is a convicted felon whose crime was to try and subvert the democratic process .
He was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his crimes in the Watergate burglarizing of the Democratic National Committee office which was part of a scheme to steal the 1972 election through sabotage , illegal spying and dirty tricks .
Liddy has never expressed any regret for his crimes , nor has he developed any respect for the law .
After the 1993 raid on the Branch Davidian compound in Waco , he endorsed the shooting of federal agents : " Kill the sons of bitches . "
Palin and Troopergate
A state legislative panel comprised of 8 Republicans and 4 Democrats has concluded that Sarah Palin abused her power in the firing of the state 's public safety commissioner .
The vote was 12 - 0 declaring that Palin committed ethics violations and used the power of her office for personal gain .
The panel spent more than six hours discussing an ethics report into the firing by Governor Palin .
The investigative report concludes that a family grudge was n't the sole reason for firing Public Safety Commissioner , Walter Monegan , but says it likely was a contributing factor .
Monegan says he was dismissed as retribution for resisting pressure to fire a state trooper involved in a bitter divorce with the governor 's sister .
Palin contends that Monegan was fired as part of a legitimate budget dispute .
Palin ’s story is that Monegan arranged two unauthorized lobbying trips to Washington .
But according to interviews and records that were obtained , the governor ’s office authorized both trips .
Therefore , Palin was caught in an outright lie .
The report also touches on whether Palin 's husband meddled in state affairs and whether her administration inappropriately accessed employee medical records .
Although the process is just beginning , a judge has ordered an investigation that Sarah Palin used a personal e-mail address to conduct state business so as to avoid the state system set up for such communication .
Palin Still “ Thinks ” Iraq Tied to 9- 11
Quoted in a Washington Post article , Palin told soldiers headed for deployment in Iraq that they would soon be " defending the innocent from the enemies who planned and carried out and rejoiced in the death of thousands of Americans " showing that she thinks Iraq had something to do with 9 - 11 .
Compare and Contrast
The characters that surround John McCain , coupled with his commitment to continue Bush ’s basic anti-middle class economic and social policies , would make his presidency nothing more than a continuation of the nightmarish Bush years and probably even worse .
Additionally , as the Georgian conflict erupted , McCain irresponsibly and foolishly issued belligerent and aggressive statements , condemning Russia without waiting for all the facts .
Barack Obama , other world leaders and even Bush took a more cautious approach .
Henry Kissinger said the unpleasant fact is that “ the first shot was fired on the Georgian side . ”
Colin Powell said the Georgians provoked the crisis .
McCain 's initial response was reckless , as well as his continued approach as outlined during the debates .
Just as Sarah Palin said she was qualified on foreign affairs because she can look over to see Russia , so too can Russia look at Sarah Palin .
What is seen is not liked in the very least .
If the McCain / Palin team were qualified to lead they would n't have to lie , character assassinate , rattle swords and cheat .
McCain 's pro-war mentality might well divide his nation and the world even worse than now and lead to the worst instability and danger in world history , largely due to his known bad temperament and questionable stability .
Senator Obama has run an intelligent and honorable campaign .
He offers ideas and plans rather than empty rhetoric and character attacks .
His economic plans are championed by leading economists , unlike McCain , who has supported the disastrous policies that have brought his nation to the verge of complete economic collapse .
McCain himself should be the most vulnerable in the area of character but for the protection afforded him by the corporate media and the basic ability of his opponent to emphasize issues and solutions to problems , and to advocate and practice change from typical political mudslinging .
Barack Obama has called for a bottom up economic growth that would n’t be solely for the benefit of the super rich .
He has emphasized diplomacy , negotiation and building bridges when dealing with adversaries .
His willingness to negotiate gives Russia and the world a sense of hope for future relations , respect for international law and respect for other nations .

As Republicans take aim at Barack Obama 's past links to a 1960s radical activist , some Democrats are threatening a tit - for - tat assault by noting John McCain 's ties to a group that helped fund right - wing guerrillas during the 1980s Iran - Contra scandal .
The latest round of attacks came as the presidential hopefuls geared up for their second debate in Nashville tonight .
With his fortunes fading in many key states , McCain has made no secret of his plans to question Obama 's character – and Obama allies have fired right back .
After Republican
No 2 Sarah Palin condemned Obama for attending a political event hosted by Bill Ayers , a former leader of the 1960s radical group the Weather Underground , Democratic pundits and bloggers began chiding McCain for his time on the board of the US Council for World Freedom ( CWF ) .
The CWF was used as a conduit for arms sales and other aid to the Contras , a right - wing guerrilla group in Nicaragua that also got backing from the CIA under Ronald Reagan .
McCain was a congressional supporter of the Contras during the early 1980s , while serving on the CWF board but before the Iran - Contra scandal imperilled its work .
The CWF was affiliated with the World Anti-Communist League , whose chairman was forced to resign in 1980 after he was linked to the neo -Nazi movement .
McCain joined the CWF the following year after meeting with its chief , former US army major general John Singlaub .
" I think I met him in the Washington area when he was just a new congressman , " Singlaub told the Associated Press .
" We had McCain on the board to make him feel like he was n't left out .
It looks good to have names on a letterhead who are well - known and appreciated . "
The Obama campaign has yet to raise McCain 's CWF connection directly , but prominent liberals are sure to continue raising the link as a way to temper Palin 's Ayers - related attacks .
Democratic strategist Paul Begala , a former Bill Clinton adviser , was the first to warn McCain that condemning Obama 's arms - length interactions could potentially backfire .
The timing of McCain 's resignation – specifically , its proximity to the Iran - Contra scandal in 1986 – could become particularly pertinent .
McCain has said he quit the group in 1984 , and spokesman Brian Rogers told Politico.com that the Republican nominee resigned " when questions were raised about its activities " .
" But that in no way diminishes his leadership role in ensuring that the forces of democracy and freedom prevailed in Central America , " Rogers added .
McCain 's name remained on CWF letterhead as late as 1986 , however , according to several reports today .
WASHINGTON , Nov 25 ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Federal Reserve , in another massive life - support intervention for the U.S. financial system , on Tuesday announced a $ 600 billion program to buy mortgage - related debt and securities and a $ 200 billion facility to buy consumer debt securities ,
The U.S. central bank said it would buy up to $ 100 billion in debt issued by Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , and the Federal Home Loan Banks , the government - sponsored mortgage finance enterprises .
The Fed also said it would buy up to $ 500 billion in mortgage - backed securities backed by Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , and Ginnie Mae. ( Reporting by Mark Felsenthal , Editing by Chizu Nomiyama )
Feature trailer for The Wrestler .
Back in the late ' 80s , Randy " The Ram Robinson " ( Mickey Rourke ) was a headlining professional wrestler .
Now , twenty years later , he ekes out a living performing for handfuls of diehard wrestling fans in high school gyms and community centers around New Jersey .
Estranged from his daughter ( Evan Rachel Wood ) and unable to sustain any real relationships , Randy lives for the thrill of the show and the adoration of his fans .
However , a heart attack forces him into retirement .
As his sense of identity starts to slip away , he begins to evaluate the state of his life -- trying to reconnect with his daughter , and strikes up a blossoming romance with an aging stripper ( Marisa Tomei ) .
Yet all this cannot compare to the allure of the ring and passion for his art , which threatens to pull Randy " The Ram " back into his world of wrestling .
Director Darren Aronofsky presents a powerful portrait of a battered dreamer , who despite himself and the odds stacked against him , lives to be a hero once again in the only place he considers home ­ inside the ring .
The film features WWE wrestler R - Truth ( Ron Killings ) .
In The Wrestler , actor Scott Spiegel plays a steroids dealer .
Real life would mimic art , as he was arrested a few short months later for steroids possession .
With all of the critiques from acclaimed film festivals peppered throughout The Wrestler trailer , one gets the impression that the film is deep and its story focuses on characters rather than plot .
The music in the trailer brings to mind someone who has been defeated , but is fighting back to reclaim their former glory .
As the trailer progresses , the viewer sees more footage of the main character ( Mickey Rourke ) outside of the ring then inside ( which hints as the story focusing on characters more then just being a movie about wrestling ) .
Along with this , the viewer also sees a decent amount of " behind the scenes " footage of the wrestling show .
Last , but not least , the music is inspiring and calming .
Overall , the trailer definitely gives off an art house vibe .
This does n't seem like a summer blockbuster but rather a small and simple story about a man and his fledgling career .

The Progressive Reading Series is a monthly event in San Francisco , where book authors , comedians and musicians get on stage , do their thing and raise money for a good cause .
The $ 1,000 to $ 2,000 raised each month usually goes to a political candidate , a drive to register voters , or any good cause .
This month , the San Francisco group has decided on what they feel is a very worthy cause : Providing recycling bins to the city of Houston .
Info recycling in Houston
But they can't find someone in the city bureaucracy to accept their largesse .
" I can't get anyone in the city to return my calls so I can figure out where to buy the bins from and where to have them shipped to , " says Stephen Elliott , founder of the group .
" I 've e-mailed and called and one of the volunteers , Chris Benz , who I'm CC'ing , has been trying to talk to someone for two days . "
This month 's event promises to be a big one , moneywise : Author Jonathan Franzen , who wrote the best - seller The Corrections , will be reading .
Plus it will give San Franciscans a chance to get in a jab at poor , benighted Houston .
" I figure we can definitely raise enough for 200 recycling bins , " Elliott says .
( If the city will only take them .
Of course , it may be awkward to accept them when you 're actually cutting back on recycling . )
Elliott has an idea on how to make their donation go even further : " Maybe we could get Exxon to match our donation " he says .
A follow - up post : Houston , we have done our part to get this city off its nonrecycling ass .
We wrote this morning about how a group of San Franciscans wanted to donate recycling bins to the city , but they were getting absolutely no response from Houston officials .
About an hour after the item went up on the Web , the Progressive Reading Series got an e-mail from Marilyn Leday , recycling division manager for Houston .
She said she'd " like to discuss " the idea of donating 200 recycling bins to Houston , which we guess means action will be taken immediately , if not sooner .
( Or maybe not . )
Stephen Elliott , the founder of the reading series , is hopeful :
" Initially she wanted to wait a week or two , but I told her the event is in two weeks so I need confirmation really soon , " he says .
" We also talked about getting larger bins for a pilot single stream recycling program .
Houston needs 4,300 bins to try out the program and those bins are $ 60 a piece .
The current bins are only $ 6.25 .
If we could get corporate sponsorship we could probably fund the bins needed for the pilot program .
But I 'd also be happy just to get 200 more 18 gallon bins out in Houston . "
Thanks , San Francisco .
If we can ever return the favor by shipping some of our pollution your way , we 'll be glad to do it .
Another follow - up post : Houston , we have not done enough to get this city off its nonrecycling ass .
We put blind faith in the report that a city official had finally contacted the San Franciscans who nobly wanted to donate recycling bins to the city .
It was blind faith misplaced .
" Hi Rich — I have n't heard back from Marilyn since Monday , and the fundraiser is a week from tomorrow , " writes Elliott , who frankly is beginning to sound a bit whiney .
A last follow - up post : Mayoral spokesman Frank Michel says the city will be glad to accept the bins .
He disputes how long SF has been trying to contact Houston , and blames any slow response on Tropical Storm Edouard .
( So Edouard did affect something . )
Enron 's Lou Pai Gets Into Cow Farts
Everyone read last week about how Lou Pai , the stripper - lovin ' ex-Enron exec who made off with $ 270 million before the crash , ponied up about $ 31 million in fines to settle his SEC case .
Which will probably affect the gentlemen's clubs in Colorado , where he lives now , for about a month or so .
There was no word on what the Pai-man is up to these days , but now we know :
He 's trying to corner the market on renewable energy .
Natural Gas Week reports that Pai is a major investor in Element Markets , a Houston - based company that , according to its Web site , " helps companies take full advantage of today 's environmental business opportunities — from credit trading to project development and technology commercialization . "
The company deals in Renewable Energy Credits , a bookkeeping thing where energy companies can trade and buy energy from renewable resources .
" Pai 's trying to corner the market on RECs , " one energy executive told NGW .
So the whole business of renewable energy may just get Enron -ed .
We can't imagine a better way of solving the energy crisis .
Element Market 's
Web site , by the way , features shots of a wind farm under the link " wind , " solar panels under the link " solar " and a cow under the link " methane capture . "
So , we guess , Lou Pai is now getting deep into the business of cow farts .

From Crystal Beach in Bolivar Peninsula !
Is a reporter from Channel 13 , outside , telling us no one should be outside during Tropical Storm Edouard .
" There 's surprisingly a lot of traffic out here , " he says , as the camera pans to show two trucks .
Which may very well count as a lot of traffic in Crystal Beach , we guess .
Then an anchor gets a shocked tone in her voice : " BEHIND YOU !!
There 's a sign that looks like it was blown over !!! "
TV news likes nothing better than a blowing sign because that demonstrates the otherwise unfathomable concept that tropical storms can get windy .
You get footage of some sign blowing in the wind , you replay that sucker five - six times an hour .
Anyway , the crisis at Crystal Beach , unfolding before our very eyes , was a bit of a letdown .
" The sign !
Is that evidence of just how strong the winds are out there ? " the anchor asked .
" Ummm ... maybe , " the reporter cautiously replied .
" It was like that when we got here . "
Battle of the Unwanted Comebacks
This past week saw two unlikely  and in some corners , unwelcome  comebacks .
Brett Favre forced his way back into the NFL , and Neil Frank forced his way back into the KHOU studios .
Both are old , old guys who just cant give up doing what they once did  in Favres case , throwing interceptions and not studying game tape ; in Franks case , taking every molehill of a tropical storm and blowing it up into a mountain of a Cat 5 killer .

ANCHORAGE , Alaska ( Reuters ) -
The depleted population of beluga whales that swim off the coast of Alaska ’s largest city was listed as endangered on Friday by the federal government .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , the Republican vice - presidential candidate , called the listing “ premature ” after she had pressed for more time to make beluga population counts .
Environmentalists hailed the listing decision , but criticized the time it took to materialize .
“ Hopefully the State of Alaska will now work toward protecting the beluga rather than , as with the polar bear , denying the science and suing to overturn the listing , ” Brendan Cummings , oceans program director for the Center for Biological Diversity said in a statement .
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said it has determined that belugas in Cook Inlet , the channel that flows from Anchorage to the Gulf of Alaska , are at risk of extinction and deserving of strict protections under the Endangered Species Act .
The population , which fell to a low of 278 in 2005 from 653 in 1994 , has yet to rebound from a period of over - harvesting by the region ’s Native hunters , officials said .
Hunting of Cook Inlet belugas largely ceased in 1999 , but the population continues to struggle , officials said .
“ In spite of protections already in place , Cook Inlet beluga whales are not recovering , ” James Balsinger , acting assistant administrator for NOAA ’s Fisheries Service , said in a statement .
Conservation groups said they had initially filed a petition to list the population as endangered under the Endangered Species Act in March 1999 .
“ The science was clear — and it has been for a very long time , ” said marine mammal scientist Craig Matkin of the North Gulf Oceanic Society .
“ The population is critically endangered . ”
At the urging of the Palin administration , NOAA delayed a listing decision that had been expected in April this year so that it could conduct one additional summer population survey .
“ The State of Alaska has had serious concerns about the low population of belugas in Cook Inlet for many years , ” Palin said in a statement after the NOAA decision .
“ However , we believe that this endangered listing is premature . ”
Denby Lloyd , commissioner of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game , said they had urged NOAA to delay the listing “ for a few years to get more population counts . ”
“ Of course , whenever you have a population of marine mammals that is this low , it is a cause for serious concern , ” Lloyd said .
“ We just are n’t sure that an endangered listing , and all the legal requirements it brings with it , is necessary to assure the health of this population at this time . ”
Various industry groups have also fought the listing , which they fear will hamper Cook Inlet oil and gas development , cargo shipping , commercial fishing and major construction projects .
The beluga population of Cook Inlet is among five beluga populations in Alaska waters .
Bob Cabana toured NASA 's massive Kennedy Space CenterVehicle Assembly Building 38 years ago , a young Navy midshipman awed by theenormity of Saturn 5 moon rockets on the eve of the Apollo 13 launch .
Then a 21 - year - old honors student on a field trip , the futureHall of Fame astronaut could n't have guessed he was destined to direct thenation 's primary spaceport , as NASA winds down its shuttle program and revs upan American returnto the moon .
" We had the ' gold badge tour , ' and I remember walkingthrough the VAB in the spring of 1970 with those Saturn 5 rockets stacked up togo to the moon , " Cabana , 59 , said Tuesday .
" I never dreamed I 'd be an astronaut .
You know , I heldthose guys in such high esteem , " he said .
" But I surely never dreamedI would be the director of Kennedy Space Center . "
Now the director of NASA 's Stennis Space Center in Bay St. Louis , Miss. , Cabana will take the helm at KSC in mid-October , while hispredecessor pursues a private - sector opportunity with a company that doesclassified work for the Department of Defense and U.S. intelligence agencies .
Current KSC Director Bill Parsons , 51 , will take a job withLockheed Martin Mission Services , which specializes in space and defense workthat often requires what 's known as Special Compartmented Informationclearances from the federal government .
It 's a world Parsons is familiar with .
He worked onclassified Department of Defense shuttle payloads early in his career beforejoining NASA in 1990 .
The opportunity with Lockheed Martin came up , and Parsonsdecided he had reached the point in his career where he needed to decidewhether to remain with NASA until retirement or pursue private - sectoropportunities .
He opted for the latter .
" It was a very personal decision .
It was a verydifficult decision , " Parsons said .
" It just felt like it was theright thing to do , so I decided to go ahead and accept their offer , and letother people have a chance at running the Kennedy Space Center . "
Parsons makes $ 168,000 a year as KSC director .
A veteran shuttle pilot and mission commander with fourflights in space , Cabana has equally impressive experience in human spaceflight management positions .
He served as NASA chief astronaut , director of Flight CrewOperations , manager of international operations for the International SpaceStation program , director of NASA operations in Russia and deputy directorof the International Space Station program .
Cabana also has served in " city manager " - typepositions :
He was deputy director of NASA 's Johnson Space Center in Houston before taking the center director post at Stennis .
" Bob has seen it all and done it all in humanspaceflight , and done it with an open , collaborative style , " NASAAdministrator Mike Griffin said in a statement .
" There is just no betterteammate .
He will be a terrific successor to Bill Parsons as director of KSC . "
Parsons agreed .
He 's known Cabana — who was inducted intothe U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame earlier this year — for two decades , and thinksNASA could not have made a better pick .
" Bob Cabana is one of the finest .
He will do afantastic job , " Parsons said .
" I 'm very , very happy that Bob hasdecided to take this on . "
Note to Self :
When going to Washington to ask for hand outs , do n’t bring your private jet .
When the CEOs of Ford , Chrysler and General Motors went to Washington to lobby congress for $ 25 billion in tax payer dollars they decided it would be a good idea to fly their private jets , apparently because tact is not something in their job description .
Sample conversation :
Congressman :
How much money do you need ?
CEO : $ 25 billion , and could you make it snappy ?

President Bush has often stated that history will be the rightful judge of his legacy .
Some academics , such as John Lewis Gaddis and Fareed Zakaria , have already begun early revisions of the Bush years .
But as historians mark the final score , they must not omit a serious examination of the administration ’s policies in Somalia , the consequences of which promise to reverberate for decades to come .
Somalia today is approaching a cataclysm not seen since the early 1990s .
The American role in the intervention , scarcely understood inside the United States itself , has added in no small part to the unfathomable misery that once again engulfs the war - weary Horn of Africa nation .
The brutal Ethiopian military occupation that began on Christmas Eve 2006 has sustained heavy losses over the past 20 months .
The conflict has strained Ethiopian resources , and Addis Ababa is currently reviewing its overall strategy .
What remains of the Transitional Federal Government ( TFG ) , barring a massive new foreign military intervention , teeters on the edge of collapse .
In its place a powerful Islamist insurgency is strengthening rapidly .
Warlordism , criminality , and piracy are also reaching new heights .
Meanwhile , the Somali population remains under siege , caught between the abuses of all sides as a society literally disintegrates .
Underwriting a significant portion of the bloodshed , however , has been an American administration engaged in expansive warfare with a preference for covert military operations .
Somalia has long been of strategic interest to American policymakers .
The country sits aside the strait of Bab al - Mandeb , a key oil transit waterway between the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean  the second closest point between Africa and the Middle East .
Under the Cold War the allied dictatorship of Gen. Siad Barre was the longtime recipient of generous amounts of American military and economic largesse .
In 1991 , after years of unrest , rebellion , and protracted drought , Barre ’s regime collapsed into the famine , war , and chaos now virtually synonymous with the word Somalia .
George H. W. Bush ordered American forces into the country a year later in support of the United Nations relief program , culminating in the Battle of Mogadishu and the now - famous Black Hawk Down incident .
At the American withdrawal and international disengagement , no single actor was strong enough to establish and maintain control .
Somalia fractured along semi- permanent tribal lines and warlord fiefdoms that would come to define the country ’s social and political landscape .
For more than a decade and a half , the territory was left to fester in ungoverned criminality and violence , only rarely piercing international headlines .
September 2001 and the wars in the Middle East brought renewed American focus to the Horn of Africa .
For sometime , a diverse group of Islamists , clan leaders , businessmen , militia heads , and civic actors had been gradually coalescing into what would in 2005 become the Union of Islamic Courts ( UIC ) , a heterogeneous movement seeking to establish a semblance of law and order after years of chaos .
The Courts proved themselves to be well organized , disciplined , and effective civil administrators .
They were popular with average Somalis , even the less devout , all of whom were desperate for relief from the criminal gangs and brutality that had long ruled their country .
The Islamists also began to challenge the weak , faction - ridden Transitional Federal Government  the successor to 13 previous failed attempts at creating a central government  which had been confined to the provincial town of Baidoa , headed by President Abdullahi Yusuf , a strongman closely linked to Mogadishu ’s warlords .
Alarmed at the Islamic Courts growing strength and popularity , in early 2006 , the Central Intelligence Agency began supplying significant quantities of arms and money to a coalition of secular Mogadishu warlords under the name Alliance for the Restoration of Peace and Counter - Terrorism ( ARPCT ) .
The CIA program had been a poorly conceived attempt to hunt down the small number of al - Qaeda affiliated individuals involved in the 1998 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania , then thought to be hiding in Somalia .
But the operation failed disastrously and according to reports " the payoffs added to an anarchic situation that led many Somalis to turn to the Islamic Courts for protection . "
Recognizing the increasing power of the U.S. - backed Alliance , the Islamists struck preemptively and decisively , routing the warlords and seizing control of Mogadishu within a matter of weeks .
For six months in 2006 , the Union of Islamic Courts proceeded to establish security and the provision of basic social services in much of Somalia for the first time in 15 years .
The peace provided by the Islamists also came with more conservative social policies and a type of sharia law .
For average Somalis , however , the security of the Courts brought a brief respite from their usual suffering .
The Bush administration , seeing Somalia and the Islamic Courts through the lens of its War on Terror and having botched the earlier warlord program , began stepping up aid to longtime ally and neighboring Ethiopian autocrat Meles Zenawi .
Zenawi has held power in Ethiopia since the early 1990s and his regime is less than democratic .
During a crackdown against popular protests after fraudulent elections in 2005 , Zenawi ’s security forces massacred nearly 200 people , injured 760 more , and arrested an additional 20,000 , among them opposition leaders , foreign aid workers , and journalists .
Nonetheless , since 2002 , Ethiopia has received nearly $ 25 million in overt U.S. military assistance while at least 100 American military personnel currently work inside the country in advisory positions as part of what the Pentagon characterizes as a " close working relationship " with the Ethiopian military .
Less than two weeks before the invasion , mid-December 2006 , Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Jendayi Frazer publicly declared that " The Council of Islamic Courts is now controlled by al - Qaeda cell individuals , east Africa al - Qaeda cell individuals . "
The claim was dubious , and the Assistant Secretary of State provided no evidence .
Horn of Africa specialist Ken Menkhaus notes that the Islamic Courts " movement as a whole was far from an al - Qaeda front .
Only three foreign al - Qaeda operatives were said by the U.S. to be in hiding in Mogadishu , a number far lower than those suspected of residing in neighboring Kenya . "
Frazer went on to warn of " a risk al - Qaeda may take up bases in Somalia " but denied the United States would take military action against the Courts .
Similarly , then - United Nations Ambassador John Bolton had told reporters days earlier " The United States strongly believes that a sustainable solution in Somalia should be based on credible dialogue between the [ Transitional Federal Government ] and the UIC , and we continue to work with our African and other partners toward that end . "
Behind the scenes , Gen. John Abizaid , at the time U.S. Centcom commander , had already visited Addis Ababa to express some last - minute reservations to Prime Minister Zenawi .
The decision had been made , though , and ultimately Washington lent its support to the invasion .
The Ethiopian military crossed the Somali border on Dec. 24 , 2006 , and reports indicate that " CIA agents traveled with the Ethiopian troops , helping to direct operations . "
The United States also provided important satellite intelligence and other battleground information from unmanned Predator drones .
" A lot of what we taught them was used to fight that global War on Terror , " observed an American military adviser who had trained Ethiopian soldiers now fighting in Somalia .
In terms of weaponry , he noted , " They got what they needed . "
American Special Forces also conducted periodic operations inside Somali territory , possibly moving out of a rumored CIA base in eastern Ethiopia .
The full extent and exact type of activities is not known , but reports of their movements have been confirmed by Somali officials .
As TFG Prime Minister Nur Hassan Hussein explained to reporters in February of this year , " the presence of the CIA , the presence of [ U.S. ] troops , is not a big issue .
We like that they are here .
But right now they do n’t have a permanent military presence .
They come in and out . "
U.S. warships moved into position off the coast of Somalia in anticipation of coming operations .
Acting on intelligence from the ground , Washington ordered bombing raids targeting what it believed to be Islamic militants .
American - piloted AC - 130 gunships and cruise missiles have blasted Somali territory at least a half dozen times since January 2007 .
The first of these air raids killed what turned out to be 70 Somali goat herders whom the Pentagon had initially claimed were Islamic fighters .
After several other attempts , in May 2008 , the bombings finally succeeded in killing the leader of the al - Shabaab militia , Aden Hashi Ayro .
Here too , the strike also demolished the surrounding homes , killing 10 others and leading to anti-American protests throughout the village .
On the ground , the Ethiopian military captured Mogadishu before New Year ’s Day 2007 .
The most powerful army in the region devastated organized UIC forces .
But the remaining militants fled and quickly melted back into the larger civilian population .
As predicted , the collapse of the Islamic Courts and the subsequent Ethiopian occupation has led to a relentless Iraq - style insurgency  one that has been rapidly gaining strength .
The insurgents have successfully used roadside bombs , hit - and - run attacks , and targeted assassinations against government officials to assault the TFG and its Ethiopian backers .
Increasingly , however , they have been able to rout Ethiopian and TFG military forces in direct confrontation , moving to capture and hold entire swathes of territory for extended periods of time .
Ethiopian and TFG forces , for their part , responded with a ferocious campaign to root out militants in Mogadishu and surrounding areas .
The vicious counterinsurgency has seen the regular shelling of densely populated urban neighborhoods .
Distinction between civilians and insurgents is often irrelevant to security forces that frequently prey on the Somali population .
Looting , rape , torture , mutilation , and cutting the throats of victims are regular tactics of Ethiopian and TFG forces .
These are , as it were , the same methods the Ethiopian military has used to suppress another ongoing insurgency in the Ogaden desert .
The most recent report from Amnesty International recounts episodes too horrific to quote from here .
Thus it is that Somalis remain caught in the crossfire between Ethiopian and TFG security forces , insurgents , warlords , criminals , and on occasion American gunships .
The " more common complaint among ordinary Somalis , " according to reporters , however , " is that the Ethiopians are ‘ indiscriminate ’ in their reprisals  and that this is why Mogadishu has been emptied of people . "
The human cost has been staggering .
The forces of war and drought are rapidly converging on the Horn of Africa nation in a perfect storm against the Somali population .
The civilian death toll since the invasion is fast approaching 10,000 .
More than a million people have fled their homes , including half of Mogadishu , and are now living in squalid , makeshift refugee camps .
The food and fuel crisis that has affected international markets has combined with the disruption of fighting , looting , inflation , and a failure of the seasonal rains to push Somalia to the absolute brink .
The country now stands on the verge of famine on a scale not seen since the early 1990s , when an estimated 300,000 Somalis starved to death .
Recent UN estimates hold that more than 3.25 million people , nearly half the population , are currently in need of food aid .
International officials have long been calling the situation the most horrific humanitarian disaster on the African continent .
As in Iraq , the War on Terror in Somalia has become a self - fulfilling prophecy .
It has sewn the increasing radicalization and anti-Westernization of an entire population of poor Third World people .
In recent months there has been new evidence for the first time of foreign fighters inside Somalia  decidedly not the case when Jendayi Frazer declared two weeks prior to the invasion that Somalia was " now controlled by al - Qaeda cell individuals . "
While the leadership of the Islamic Courts was originally a mix of moderate and conservative Islamic actors , the insurgency no longer maintains this character .
A peace agreement between the former moderate elements of the Courts , now called the Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia , and the TFG has already concluded to no effect .
The old leaders of the Courts no longer control the insurgency .
Battle - hardened al - Shabaab militants , perhaps poised to succeed the Transitional Federal Government , espouse a far more radical and anti-Western Islamic ideology .
For the moment , the intervention in Somalia appears to be dreadfully coming full circle .
In September , two Somali men in their early 20s were arrested at a German airport on suspicion of planning terrorist attacks somewhere in the West .
They were released due to insufficient evidence  but German intelligence officials believe the men were arrested too early .
Somalia has indeed been a third front in the War on Terror .
A quiet front , but a front nonetheless .
Six months after the Ethiopian invasion , Defense Department spokesman Bryan Whitman told reporters , " The very nature of some of our operations , as well as the success of those operations , is often predicated on our ability to work quietly with our partners and allies . "
Now , almost two years into the occupation , few can still maintain delusions of success in the Horn of Africa .
Much about the affair recalls the disastrous American interventions in the Congo and Angola during the Cold War .
But perhaps most troubling is that the current episode must be seen against the background of the recent creation of Africom and the larger militarization of U.S. foreign policy in Africa .
What becomes of Somalia remains to be seen .
What is certain is that we have taken a group of the world ’s most destitute , desperate , and brutalized people , and brutalized them some more .
We might expect to see many more angry young Somali men bringing violence to the West in the future .
Whether we know it or not , we have certainly brought it to them .
This is the Bush administration ’s legacy and it will be with us for a long time to come .
RoTM Emergency services were on Sunday obliged to cut free a TGV passenger whose arm was swallowed by the high - speed train 's sucking dunny , the BBC reports .
The unnamed 26 - year - old victim - travelling from La Rochelle to Bordeaux - dropped his mobe into the bog and ill - advisedly attempted to retrieve it from the lav 's depths .
Cue a unsheduled two - hour stop for the train as firemen detached the unit , still clamped firmly to its victim 's limb .
Shaken witness Benoit Gigou recounted : " He came out on a stretcher , with his hand still jammed in the toilet bowl , which they had to saw clean off . "
This is the first reported incident of cantankerous crapper attack across the Channel , where the machine uprising has until now relied on mephistophelean motors to do its dirty work .
UK citizens are , of course , already fully aware of the danger posed by innocent - looking toilets following a spate of assaults which began back in 2001 . ®

Hurricane Ike Slams into Houston
When the storm hit town in the early morn of Saturday , September 13 , it flooded roads , snapped trees , prevented firefighters from saving a culinary landmark and shattered windows on a downtown skyscraper .
UPDATE September 13 , 2014 : Five years after Hurricane Ike roared through the area , photographer Daniel Kramer took the time to go back and see how much has changed since those dark days five years ago .
By comparing these Hurricane Ike locations then and now , you can see how powerful the storm was .
Barack Obama tonight was on course for victory over John McCain in the US election to become the first African - American president , after a momentous day that saw voters turn out in huge numbers .
As key states , including New York , fell his way , Obama was on the verge of a transformational election comparable to Roosevelt 's in 1932 , Kennedy 's in 1960 and Bill Clinton 's in 1992 .
With polls closing quickly , the Associated Press called 17 states and the District of Columbia for Obama , and 12 for McCain , who trailed his rival by 205 electoral college votes to 80 .
" At this point we need a miracle , " a McCain aide was quoted as saying on the CBS News website .
An early blow to McCain 's hopes came when US television networks projected that Obama would win Pennsylvania .
The Republican candidate had based his campaign strategy on stealing the state from the Democrats .
In another big setback for McCain , the Fox News network projected that Obama would win Ohio , the state that ultimately decided the 2004 race between George Bush and John Kerry .
No Republican has won the White House without Ohio .
With Ohio and Pennsylvania in his pocket , Obama would be well on his way towards an overall majority .
Piling on the humiliation for the Republicans , Obama was projected to win Virginia by Fox News , the first time the state has voted for a Democrat in a presidential race since 1964 , when Lyndon Johnson took the state .
Obama was projected to hold on to all the states the Democrats took in 2004 , and win half a dozen or more of the battleground states that had been held by the Republicans .
The Democrat was also projected to win New Hampshire , Connecticut , Delaware , Washington DC , Illinois , Maine , Maryland , Massachusetts and New Jersey .
McCain was projected to win Oklahoma , Tennessee , Kentucky , Georgia and South Carolina .
Despite the encouraging early results , the Obama campaign team urged caution , fearful that a late surge of voters casting their ballots on their way home might yet cause upsets in key states , as happened to the Democratic candidate , John Kerry , in 2004 .
Fears that many white voters would fail , in the privacy of the polling booth , to vote for a black candidate appeared to be unfounded , suggesting that race is becoming less of an issue in the US .
Americans voted in record numbers throughout the day as they finally got the chance to turn their backs on eight years of George Bush and choose a new president after America 's longest and costliest election campaign .
From the eastern shores of Virginia , across the industrial heartland of Ohio , and on to the Rocky mountain states of Colorado and New Mexico and beyond , poll workers and voters reported long lines and waits of several hours in the most eagerly anticipated US election for half a century .
Turnout was at levels not seen since women were first given the vote in 1920 .
Election officials predicted turnout would come close to 90 % in Virginia and Colorado , and 80 % in Ohio and Missouri .
Exit polls gave Obama double - digit leads in states that had been bitterly contested , and on which the outcome depended .
The odds had been stacked against McCain from the start , linked , as he was , to President George Bush , with his near - record low popularity ratings , hostility towards the Iraq war and an impending recession .
But McCain managed to hold his own until mid-September , when the Wall Street crash saw Obama open up a commanding lead .
The next president will inherit horrendous economic problems that will limit the scope of his ambitions .
Obama , in his final rallies , was already tempering his early promise of change with warnings about how he would have to curb some of his more ambitious plans , trying to lower expectations that he would be able to move quickly on health care and education reform .
The stock market experienced its biggest election day rally in 24 years on expectation of an Obama victory as the Dow Jones industrial averages surged 300 points , or 3 % , to close at 9,625.28 points .
Exit polls nationwide provided an early suggestion that it was going to be Obama 's night showing that the top concern of 62 % of voters was the economy , the issue on which voters said they trusted him more than McCain and blame much of the financial crisis on the Bush administration .
Other early exit poll figures also appeared to be good indicators for Obama , with 57 % saying they felt Obama was more in touch with them than the 40 % who said the same about McCain .
Reflecting the intensity of the campaign , Obama and McCain put in a final burst of campaigning after casting their own votes .
Obama made a final dash from his home in Chicago to neighbouring Indiana , which was Republican in 2004 .
Reporters travelling with him reported that the candidate was in a subdued rather than celebratory mood , perhaps reflecting the news of the death of his grandmother on Monday .
Obama told them that whatever happened , the campaign , the costliest in US history at over $ 1bn ( £ 629 m ) as well as the longest , had been " extraordinary " .
Early expectations were of record turnout levels , with the morning bringing long lines at polling stations .
However , exit polls later in the day saw voters under 30 , the target demographic of the Obama camp , voting at about the same levels as in 2004 .
That would be a disappointment for the Obama camp which had been hoping that young voters would buck the tradition of showing enthusiasm for a candidate and then failing to turn out on the day .
Exit polls did chart a rise in African - American turn - out .
CNN , based on the exit polls , projected that Obama would win Vermont , no great surprise as it is traditionally Democrat
Independent election monitors reported sporadic instances of delayed openings of polling stations , broken voting machines , ballot shortages , voter confusion and occasional abuse in a number of battleground states including Florida , Ohio , Colorado , Pennsylvania and Virginia .
The McCain camp raised separate its own charges of irregularities accusing Black Panther activists holding night sticks of standing outside Philadelphia polling stations in an attempt to intimidate white voters .
McCain also accused out - of - state Obama volunteers of casting votes in Florida , and of voters casting multiple ballots in Florida .
In the battle for Congress , the Democrats picked up four seats to increase their majority in the Senate to 55 out of 100 seats .
Democrats were hoping to win a Senate majority of 60 , the magic number to override blocking tactics by Republicans .
In the House , the Democrats were looking to tighten their majority to 261- 174 , from 235-199 .
Some neighborhoods in Roxbury were blanketed over the weekend with campaign literature from a white - supremacist , anti-immigration group that bluntly raised the issue of race regarding presidential candidate Barack Obama , offending some recipients and angering Democratic leaders .
A flier left on driveways in a neatly packaged plastic envelope questioned , " Do You Want A Black President ? " and stated , " Black Ruled Nations most unstable and violent in the world . "
The material was distributed by a group called the League of American Patriots , which has a Butler mailing address .
Police said they received some complaint calls Saturday about the flier and were reviewing the issue to determine if there were any illegalities connected to the material or its distribution .
" I think whoever is doing this should stop and just deal solely with the facts and issues involved in this election , " said Morris County Democratic Party Chairman Lewis Candura .
Roxbury resident Elizabeth Corsetto said she and her husband came home from doing errands Saturday and found the flier at the end of their driveway .
She picked it up , expecting a mailer from a retailer but instead found a one - page , black and white sheet featuring unflattering photos of Obama , including a doctored one portraying him with a long beard and turban .
" Why should we seal our fate by allowing a black ruler to destroy us ? " said the flier , which also detailed what it contended were facts on unemployment , poverty , HIV and crime rates among African Americans , while pointing out woes of a couple of predominantly black - populated countries .
Attempts to reach the League of American Patriots by phone and e-mail were unsuccessful today .
No group leaders or organizers were listed by name on the flier or the group 's website .
Corsetto , a former school board president in Dover , said she was not pleased to get the flier .
" I 'm not against free speech , but I was shocked to find stuff like this in my neighborhood , " Corsetto said .
" I know racism is out there in this world , but I 'm particularly disturbed to believe this is happening in Morris County . "
The League of American Patriots was formed on March 29 at a meeting attended by more than 20 people at an undisclosed site in northern New Jersey , followed by a July meeting at an undisclosed Morris County park , according to the organization 's website .
The group is " committed to restoring America to the principles upon which it was founded .
First and foremost is halting the rapid demographic decline of the European peoples in our homeland , " according to the site .
League members attended an immigration reform rally in Lakewood in May and what was billed as an anti-Mexican rally in Shenandoah , Pa. , in August , according to the site .
Andrew Poag , a spokesman for the Obama campaign in New Jersey , said they have not previously encountered this group or this type of literature in New Jersey during the campaign .
" These divisive and offensive fliers wo n't distract the Obama campaign 's focus on bringing our country together and bringing the change we need to Washington , D.C. , " Poag wrote in an e-mail message tonight .

The increasingly high cost of text messaging has already caused a bit of a stir in Canada , and it looks like Democratic Senator Herb Kohl of Wisconsin is concerned with the situation in the US as well , with him now opening an inquiry to attempt to get the carriers to explain themselves .
Apparently , Kohl is a bit puzzled as to why some customers are now paying 20 cents per message when they paid just 10 cents in 2005 , a period that Kohl notes just happens to overlap with some consolidation in the wireless industry , when the number of national carriers shrunk from six to four .
Those carriers , as you might expect , are n't saying much just yet , with Sprint only going as far as to say that it looks forward to " responding to the Senator 's inquiry about the text messaging options we offer our customers and we will fully cooperate with his request , " and the rest saying even less .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - A 4,600 - year - old grave in Germany containing the remains of two adults and their children provides the earliest evidence that even prehistoric tribes attached importance to the family unit , researchers said on Monday .
The researchers used DNA analysis and other techniques to determine that the group buried facing each other -- an unusual practice in Neolithic culture -- consisted of a mother , father and their two sons aged 8 - 9 and 4 - 5 years .
“ By establishing the genetic links between the two adults and two children buried together in one grave , we have established the presence of the classic nuclear family in a prehistoric context in Central Europe -- to our knowledge the oldest authentic molecular genetic evidence so far , ” Wolfgang Haak of the University of Adelaide said in a statement .
“ Their unity in death suggests a unity in life . ”
The remains were found in graves that held a total of 13 people , all of whom had been interned simultaneously , Haak and colleagues reported in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Several were buried face - to - face , with arms and hands interlinked in many cases .
The remains included children ranging from newborns up to 10 years of age , and adults of around 30 years or older .
Tests showed that many had suffered massive injuries , suggesting they were victims of a violent raid .
One female had a stone projectile point embedded in her back and another had skull fractures .
“ Our study of the Eulau individuals shows that their deaths were sudden and violent , apparent in lesions caused by stone axes and arrows , with evidence of attempts of some of the individuals to defend themselves from blows , ” the researchers wrote .
An analysis of dental remains also offered up insight into Stone Age society and showed that the females came from different regions than the males and their children .
This is evidence that men sought partners from different regions to avoid inbreeding and that it was customary for women to move to the location of the males , the researchers said .
“ Such traditions would have been important to avoid inbreeding and to forge kinship networks with other communities , ” Alistair Pike , an archaeologist at the University of Bristol , who co-led the study , said in a statement .
She forgot to mention that to cops during the initial report , just like she forgot to mention the detail about him spotting the McCain bumper sticker on her car .
It happens ; victims of violent crime forget details initially .
But the nuance is mounting .
Speaking to Channel 4 Action News on Friday , [ police spokesman Diane ]
Richard said they ’re still questioning Todd because of some new developments .
“ We have learned that the victim ’s statement has a few inconsistencies in it and her statement has changed , ” said Richard Richard said Todd now says she is n’t sure if it was a bumper sticker on her car or a campaign button on her jacket that angered the attacker .
Richard said Todd added new details to the attack , saying at one point she lost consciousness .
“ She also indicated she was sexually assaulted as well .
She indicated that when he had her on the ground he put his hand up her blouse and started fondling her .
But other than that , she says she does n’t remember anything else .
So we ’re adding a sexual assault to this as well , ” Richard said .
They gave her a polygraph but have n’t released the results .
Here ’s a photo of the ATM station ; cops say the camera does n’t show anything , but that might be because the attack happened out of frame .
No word on whether it at least shows her using the machine to place her at the scene .
People who work at nearby businesses claim they did n’t hear anything .
I assumed from the first reports that the ATM was enclosed in the foyer of a bank ( the way mine is ) but this appears to be open onto the street , so passersby would have a clear view .
She also says , contra
Ace ’s theory , that the guy was sitting on her chest when he carved the “ B , ” not standing over her upside down :
Ms .
Todd told police during at least five hours of questioning last night that her attacker said to her , “ You are going to be a Barack supporter . ”
She told police the man then sat on her chest , pinning both her hands down with his knees and used what she believed was a dull knife with a roughly 5 - inch blade to carve the B.
Ms .
Todd then went to a friend ’s house in the 5100 block of Cypress Street , about a mile away , where she reported the incident to police about 45 minutes later .
She declined medical treatment at that time .
Like
Ace says , maybe she took the photo herself in the mirror .
If the latter , that would make the “ B ” facing the right way on her left cheek , which would be the likeliest place for a right - handed assailant to cut her ( assuming , probability - wise , that he is right - handed ) .
Exit question one :
Why not release the details of the polygraph ?
If she passed it , it ’s mighty irresponsible to suppress that information while whispering to the press about “ inconsistencies ” in her story .
Exit question two :
If other businesses were open nearby , why did n’t she go in and ask for immediate help ?
Update :
The boss ’s skepticism was justified : Police tell KDKA it ’s a hoax .
Disgraceful .
Police sources tell KDKA that a campaign worker has now confessed to making up a story that a mugger attacked her and cut the letter “ B ” in her face after seeing her McCain bumper sticker …
Investigators did say that they received photos from the ATM machine and “ the photographs were verified as not being the victim making the transaction . ”
This afternoon , a Pittsburgh police commander told KDKA Investigator Marty Griffin that Todd confessed to making up the story .
The commander added that Todd will face charges ; but police have not commented on what those charges will be .
Update ( Ed ) : The College Republicans will have some explaining to do here .
And let ’s remember that even if the story had been true , it still did n’t say anything about Obama and the people who support him .
Update : Fox News VP John Moody set up the left ’s talking points for them perfectly last night : “ If the incident turns out to be a hoax , Senator McCain ’s quest for the presidency is over , forever linked to race - baiting . ”
Update :
No word yet about the black eye , but the “ B ” is her own doing , unsurprisingly .
A McCain - Palin campaign volunteer who claimed she was robbed and cut by a supporter of Sen.
Barack Obama has confessed to making up the story , police sources told the Tribune - Review .
Ashley Todd , 20 , of College Station , Texas , is expected to be charged with filing a false police report and may face additional charges , investigators said .
She told detectives she etched a backward letter “ B ” onto her right cheek and then manufactured a story about being attacked at a Bloomfield ATM by a black man who was enranged by her John McCain bumper sticker .
Detectives are continuing to question
Todd at police headquarters .
They are expected to release additional information later this afternoon .
If it ’s her right cheek , then the photo was n’t taken in a mirror and she really did etch it backwards , like the moron that she is .
Update :
Here ’s one possible explanation for how she got the black eye :
She may not really have a black eye .
Quote : “ The photo also shows Todd with a black eye .
Salon showed it to Jennifer Province , an emergency room nurse , who says she believes the black eye was faked .
The color of it is wrong , Province said , and there ’s less swelling than typically seen . ”
How does one “ fake ” a black eye , exactly ?
Did she actually put make up around her eye and expect the cops to be fooled ?
Update : KDKA updates to say that cops believe the “ injuries ” were self - inflicted .
Whether that ’s a reference to the “ B ” or to something more , like her giving herself a black eye , I do n’t know yet .
Update : Surprise — she told cops she ’s had mental health problems in the past .
Update : I ’ve received the following statement from Ethan Eilon , executive director of the College Republicans :
“ When Ms. Todd initially contacted us claiming to have been attacked our first reaction was obviously to be concerned for her safety .
We are as upset as anyone to learn of her deceit , Ashley must take full responsibility for her actions . ”
– Ashley Barbera , Communications Director
“ We have terminated her effective today .
Obviously , we had know idea she was making this story up . ” – Ethan Eilon
Update :
She simply must be joking .
“ She just opened up and said she wanted to tell the truth , ” Bryant said .
“ She was upset with the media for blowing this into a political firestorm . ”
She told Detectives J.R. Smith and Scott Evans varying stories about how she ended up with two black eyes and a backward letter “ B ” etched onto her right cheek late Wednesday .
She said she remembers being in her car , driving around the city , and seeing the letter on her cheek when she looked into the rearview mirror .
She said she immediately thought of Barack Obama when she saw the “ B , ” Bryant said .
“ She said she does n’t remember doing it but knows it must have been her who did it , ” Bryant said .
Update : Inflaming race relations , sandbagging the candidate she claims to support , sending the cops on a wild goose chase — and no remorse , of course .
“ She has n’t really shown any obvious remorse , ” Kraus said .
“ She ’s certainly surprised that it snowballed to where it is today . ”
“ It ’s been a huge waste of time and man hours , ” said Bryant , adding that police had been working on the story since it broke Thursday …
A woman named Liz who answered the door at the residence where Todd arrived after her purported attack told FOXNews.com that her roommate is friends with Todd , and he told Liz not to discuss any details about the incident .
A Ford Taurus with a Texas license plate and a McCain - Palin sticker was parked outside .
Fox notes that she ’s staying with a “ male friend ” in the area .
I ’m still wondering about that black eye .
Update : KDKA has perp - walk video .
I looked closely to try to see if her eye ’s still black , which would at least prove that it ’s a real injury , but I ca n’t tell for sure .
If it is , it ’s healed an awful lot already .
Windows 7 in time for Christmas ?
No , not this Christmas - but Christmas 2009 .
Microsoft has reportedly told PC and systems engineering partners Windows 7 , the successor to Windows Vista , will be on PCs in time for the next holiday season .
That contradicts Microsoft 's official party line that Windows 7 would not ship until 2010 , three years after Windows Vista received its official launch .
The holiday buying season typically refers to six weeks between US Thanksgiving and the New Year .
If Microsoft is correct , and if this is n't a piece of outdated PowerPoint carrying an old ship date , that could mean OEMs getting Windows 7 by September 2009 at the latest to hit the holiday shopping season .
Microsoft 's last big success was Windows XP , which launched in late October 2001 , in time for that year 's holiday shopping season .
Windows XP had been put in the hands of OEM with a release to manufacturing two months earlier , in August that year .
All about Microsoft blogger , and fellow MicroBite co-host , Mary - Jo Foley said the whisper around the Windows camp fire is there 'll be a Windows 7 beta the week before this Christmas , with the release candidate released in either the first or second quarter of 2009 .
Why so fast on Windows 7 ?
Microsoft is keeping the operating system simple and cutting any features are n't working and that might mutate into delays if work on them continues , based on what The Reg heard at last week 's Professional Developers ' Conference ( PDC ) . ®
Just as surely as night follows day , violence is being directed at ACORN offices and officials in the wake of the flood of right - wing demagoguery about its vote - gathering efforts :
An ACORN community organizer received a death threat and the liberal activist group 's Boston and Seattle offices were vandalized Thursday , reflecting mounting tensions over its role in registering 1.3 million mostly poor and minority Americans to vote next month .
Attorneys for the Association of Community Organizers for Reform Now were notifying the FBI and the Justice Department 's Civil Rights Division of the incidents , said Brian Kettenring , a Florida - based spokesman for the group .
Republicans , including presidential candidate John McCain , have verbally attacked the group repeatedly in recent days , alleging a widespread vote - fraud scheme , although they 've provided little proof .
It was disclosed Thursday that the FBI is examining whether thousands of fraudulent voter - registration applications submitted by some ACORN workers were part of a systematic effort or isolated incidents .
Kettenring said that a senior ACORN staffer in Cleveland , after appearing on television this week , got an e-mail that said she " is going to have her life ended . "
A female staffer in Providence , R.I. , got a threatening call from someone who said words to the effect of " We know you get off work at 9 , " then uttered racial epithets , he said .
John McCain has played a leading role in whipping up this frenzy of hatred .
In Wednesday 's debate , he charged :
We need to know the full extent of Sen .
Obama 's relationship with ACORN , who is now on the verge of maybe perpetrating one of the greatest frauds in voter history in this country , maybe destroying the fabric of democracy .
This is consistent with the hateful language being spewed from the right by the likes of Lou Dobbs , who has taken to routinely characterizing ACORN as a " radical left - wing activist group " as well as " a Democratic Party adjunct " .
In fact , the hysteria 's being generated across a broad spectrum of the Right , from Outer Malkinite Wingnuttia to Inside Beltway Villagers , from McCain and Palin to the frothiest freepers .
And we can see what 's coming , too :
We 're being set up for a running yammer from the right after Obama wins questioning his legitimacy because of a supposedly " tainted " vote .
Conspiracy theories and talking points from the right will circulate , driving up the temperature and feeding the right - wing populist frenzy .
And they 're not even waiting until Election Day to begin .
These are the sorts of implications that cause me to be very skeptical of companies that make seemingly far - fetched claims .
I do n't want technologies receiving legal and tax benefits because of hollow boasts .
This is also the reason I have been critical in my assessments of some of the cellulosic ethanol claims made by ethanol evangelists like Vinod Khosla .
Of course as time went by , the hype unraveled .
But not before the hype resulted in CWT getting earmarks for building their plant ( money that went down the drain as documented here ) as well as a tax credit inserted by Missouri Congressman Roy Blunt to specifically benefit CWT .
That money came out of the pockets of American taxpayers , and could have been better utilized .
But it was hijacked by CWT and their overpromises .
I have a strong distaste for companies or individuals who overpromise and underdeliver .
Changing World Technologies ( CWT ) and their thermal depolymerization ( TDP ) technology is probably the poster child for companies that promised lots and delivered little .
The hype was that they had the " technological savvy " to " turn 600 million tons of turkey guts and other waste into 4 billion barrels of light Texas crude each year . "
Further , they were going to " make oil for $ 8 to $ 12 a barrel . "
( See TDP : The Next Big Thing ) .
Earlier this year a company called Coskata caught my attention after GM made a much - publicized investment .
Coskata claims that their process " brings the first practical cellulosic opportunity to the market " and that they " will produce ethanol for under US $ 1.00 a gallon anywhere in the world . "
That is just the sort of hype we heard from CWT , and therefore was something that I was interested in investigating .
So I took a look at some of their published numbers , compared their costs per barrel of their pilot plant to several other technologies , and wrote a flippant article - Coskata : Dead Man Walking .
The article unleashed an unanticipated firestorm .
Journalists started contacting me .
The government contacted me .
Investors contacted me .
And Wes Bolsen , CMO & Vice President of Coskata contacted me .
The first three all wanted to know whether Coskata was the real deal , because I seemed to be the first to conclude that the emperor had no clothes .
Wes Bolsen contacted me to state emphatically that they were for real .
And he reiterated that during a one - hour phone call in which I was able to quiz him about the process .
The experience taught me a few things .
First , as I reach a larger audience than I did a couple of years ago , I have to be more careful about what I write and what I say .
When someone at the Department of Energy , or some deep - pocketed investor is paying close attention to what I write , I should never be flippant .
If I am going to state that a company is over - hyping their technology , I need to make sure that I have done a very thorough analysis .
As I said in a follow - up essay , sometimes the dead man was falsely convicted .
My initial intent was to write just one short essay on Coskata , but there was so much fallout that I ended up spending an entire week following up .
In my follow - up essays I did peel several layers of the onion ( I got a much more detailed view of what they are doing ) , but I still do n't think they can deliver on their promise of ethanol for less than $ 1 / gallon .
Why ?
In a nutshell , they are using two pieces of technology that are unproven in the service they have proposed .
The technology has only been demonstrated at a small lab scale , and even then it was not all coupled together .
On that basis they have made their claims of $ 1 / gallon ethanol .
So what is the source of my skepticism around Coskata ’s claims ?
Let ’s look at two areas that I think are potential problem areas .
I want to first look at their claims around the energy usage of the process , and then I want to look at the logistics to get a feel for the amount of biomass required to run a 100 million gallon a year plant .
I am not going to offer up solutions to potential problems simply because I would require quite a bit more information to do so .
But what I can do is flag various areas that a prospective investor / partner should investigate .
Energy Usage
The ethanol they produce is very dilute ; only 3.5 % or so according to Wes .
This should take huge amounts of energy to purify .
Coskata claims they have addressed the energy problem by using membrane technology .
The claim is that it takes half the energy of distillation .
This is somewhat hard to believe , as I would expect ethanol plants across the country to rush to adopt the technology .
I am also unaware of any membrane separation technology that does a good job of concentrating up such dilute solutions of ethanol .
The ones I know about may concentrate from 70 % up to 90 % .
If you are starting at 3.5 % , you are way outside of what these systems are normally designe for .
And the technology is n't brand new .
Here is a 2001 article talking up the benefits : Pervaporation comes to age .
Yet there have been numerous ethanol plants built since 2001 .
Why are n't they being built with membrane separation technology ?
Without going in and checking their claims , I can't say for a fact whether that claim of lower energy usage is valid .
But there are question marks all around it .
( Note : I do n't dispute the technology , because I know that it works .
But TDP also worked ; just not as well as advertized .
I would just make sure - if I were about to invest in Coskata - that I had a very close look at their claims around this area . )
Coskata also claims that they get " up to 7.7 times more energy than what is used in making the ethanol . "
In my conversation with Wes , I had asked if this was from Michael Wang .
He said yes , which then put that claim into context for me .
Michael Wang has created a model ( the GREET model ) that has been widely misused .
The number above - 7.7 - will refer not to the energy that is used in the process but rather to the overall fossil energy used .
This is the same way Brazilian sugarcane ethanol can claim an 8/1 energy return , despite the energy intensive process step of separating ethanol from water .
This is a valid metric as long as the context is clear .
But the context is n't usually made clear .
( This is the same metric that has caused some to suggest that it is more energy efficient to produce ethanol than to produce gasoline ) .
Here is an illustration of the potential problems with this metric .
Let 's take an extreme example , as I think they are useful in illustrating concepts .
Let 's say that I have one million BTUs of biomass .
But let 's say I have a conversion process that is terribly inefficient .
I use that biomass in an inefficient process to produce a trifling amount of liquid fuel : 100 BTUs .
In the process , 999,900 BTUs - 99.99 % of what we started with - are lost in the process because they are used to drive the process .
But let 's say I have to input a small amount of fossil fuels ; say in the form of electricity to run a pump .
If I used 13 BTUs of fossil fuel to produce the 100 BTUs , then the energy return based on Wang 's metric is 100 / 13 , or 7.7 .
So , I could claim to have a high energy return despite the fact that almost all of the available BTUs are wasted .
This is the ' opportunity cost ' of those BTUs .
Had we used the starting biomass to produce electricity , for instance , we would have had far more BTUs at the end of the process .
Now I am not suggesting that Coskata loses most of their BTUs in the process of making their ethanol .
But without a real energy accounting - which the 7.7 number is not - it is difficult to determine whether this process makes better use of the available BTUs than a competing process .
A proper energy accounting should take into account the overall BTUs consumed in the process , and not just the fossil fuel usage .
Logistics
David Henson , President of Choren USA ( another company involved in biomass gasification ) , once commented to me " You know , most people just do n't understand that biomass is n't very energy dense . "
David was absolutely correct , but what does that mean ?
The lower the energy density of a substance , the closer it needs to be to the factory .
Imagine hauling potatoes from New York to California in order to convert them into ethanol , and you get the picture .
You would certainly burn more fuel transporting the potatoes than you could make from processing them into ethanol .
I believe this issue of low biomass density , which I have referred to as the logistics problem of cellulosic ethanol , is a killer for cellulosic ethanol .
In fact , I recently calculated that to keep a medium - sized cellulosic ethanol plant running would consume the biomass equivalent of almost 900,000 mature Douglas firs every single year .
However , the Coskata process is not a cellulosic ethanol process .
Gasification processes have distinct differences from cellulosic processes ( I explained why here ) .
The consequence is that a gasification process can have a higher yield because it converts lignin and hemicellulose in addition to cellulose .
In Coskata 's case , they promise 100 gallons (+ ) per ton .
How much biomass then to run a 100 million gallon per year facility ?
A million tons per year .
How much biomass is this ?
If we return to the Douglas fir example , it is the biomass equivalent of around 1.2 million mature Douglas firs per year .
That 's still hard to wrap my head around , but I can put that in context from my current job .
In our wood acetylation plant in the Netherlands , our nameplate capacity is 30,000 cubic meters of wood per year .
A cubic meter weighs half a metric ton , so we run 15,000 metric tons per year through our plant ( about 17,000 short tons ) .
Coskata proposes to process about 60 times as much biomass through their 100 million gallon per year facility .
That is the sort of logistical challenge that boggles my mind , when I try to scale up our process by a factor of 60 .
Further , that biomass has to be finely processed so it can be pushed through their gasifier ( which can be very finicky if the biomass quality varies ) .
To put in the context of rail cars , the coal cars lined up outside of a coal - fired power plant are a familiar site .
According to this , each car carries about 100 tons of coal .
For a million tons of coal a year , you would have to have 1 million / ( 100 tons per car ) = 10,000 cars per year coming into and leaving the plant .
That 's more than a car an hour , 24 hours a day , 365 days a year .
And of course coal is quite a bit denser than biomass , so more cars would be required in the case of biomass .
I wo n't say that 's impossible , but it is going to be a significant challenge .
All I can say is Coskata better have hired some very good logistical experts .
They are going to need them .
The Bottom Line
So what 's the bottom line ?
Let 's say you are an investor with a billion dollars burning a hole in your pocket .
You need to know if Coskata is for real .
Here is my free advice .
The plasma gasification piece and the membrane separation piece both need a very good technical vetting from someone who has signed a secrecy agreement and has access to the experimental data .
A technology that works in the lab is one thing .
But as you start to scale up , little problems turn into big problems ( as was the case with TDP ) .
You need to know to what extent the gasifier works in conditions close to what Coskata is proposing .
These plasma gasifiers are finicky , and normally used for waste disposal .
Has the gasifier been tested extensively with a variable substrate like biomass ?
For how long ?
What were the results ?
What were the key challenges ?
How accurately were the energy inputs measured ?
In fact , I would probably want to park myself in their labs for a few days , and spend a lot of time talking to technicians .
I would want to know - outside of the tours - what 's really going on .
Second , I would really focus in on the logistics issue .
I would want some serious details on how they are proposing to handle the logistics .
How is the biomass going to come into the plant ?
Has a calculation been done on how far away something can be transported before it becomes break even on the energy ?
If it is waste biomass already coming into a point source , then it is n't as big an issue .
But then I would ask if there is any location in the U.S. that is handling a million tons of waste biomass at a point source ( which the gasification plant would be ) .
I would want to see actual examples of someone handling this much biomass .
Finally , I would go over their $ 400 million capital estimate with a fine - toothed comb .
I would ask for an example of any technology that has been piloted in the lab , and then had an accurate capital estimate done at a scale of tens of thousands of times larger than the lab scale .
As I have said before , you have different problems at a pilot scale than you had at the lab scale , and the problems become even bigger at commercial scale .
The capital estimate is already $ 400 million for a 100 million gallon per year plant - $ 61,000 per daily barrel .
That puts it at a disadvantage to GTL or corn ethanol .
Why would n't I expect that capital estimate to climb as they gain piloting experience ?
Why would I expect them to stick with biomass , when the logistics of gasifying ( partially oxidizing ) natural gas are trivial when contrasted with biomass logistics ?
Conclusion
To conclude , let me state for the record that I want Coskata , and for that matter Choren , LS9 , Range Fuels , Virent , Nanosolar - to be successful ( defined as " produce energy in a sustainable manner " ) .
The world needs solutions to our energy problems , and I applaud these companies for their efforts .
I want my kids to grow up in a world with abundant energy .
But I never let what I want cloud my judgment when I am trying to determine what is true .
So , I still believe in scrutinizing their claims very closely , and stating for the record whether I believe their claims to be credible .

Countdowns Keith Olbermann names Rush Limbaugh todays Worst Person in the World for lumping ACORN , Bill Ayers , Jeremiah Wright and Barack Obama into one paranoid , racist rant .
Here is the paranoid , racist rant of Rush Limbaugh that Keith is referring to last night .
I think Rush is off his meds .
On Keith Olbermann ’s list is Frank Gaffney Jr. , who lied about Obama ’s birth certificate .
Media Matters nailed Gaffney to the wall on that one also .
Here is there summary .

Gaffney made false and baseless claims about Obama ’s birth certificate , purported “ ties ” to Khalid al - Mansour
Summary : Washington Times columnist Frank Gaffney Jr. falsely claimed that Sen. Barack Obama “ has , to date , failed to provide an authentic birth certificate which could clear up the matter ” of “ whether Mr. Obama is a natural born citizen of the United States . ”
In fact , even the right - wing website WorldNetDaily found that a birth certificate supplied by the Obama campaign is authentic .

“ ALL along , ” Joel Hodgson said , “ I had a real healthy disrespect for Hollywood . ”
It was more than two decades ago that Mr. Hodgson walked away from a thriving stand - up comedy career , retreating to Minnesota to build sculptures of robots .
There Mr. Hodgson , now 48 , discovered that his eccentric hobby of building automatons , and especially his aptitude for finding the flaws in mass media , could be combined into something greater .
“ There was kind of an invitation there , ” he said , “ that if you can see the seams in this , you can figure out how to make a TV show . ”
The show Mr. Hodgson and a cadre of like - minded Midwesterners came up with in 1988 was “ Mystery Science Theater 3000 ” ( “ MST3K ” for short ) , surely the only comedy series about an outer - space castaway and his robots , who provide a steady stream of quips and comebacks while watching low - budget films .
Image Joel Hodgson on the set of  Mystery Science Theater 3000 . 

“ MST3K ” may have been the first television show in which the commentary was more important than what was being commented on .
You tuned in not to watch schlocky features like “ Fire Maidens of Outer Space ” or “ Manos : The Hands of Fate ” but to see how Mr. Hodgson and his crew would tear them apart .
( You could n’t hear the dismal opening score of “ The Unearthly ” in the same way after one of Mr. Hodgson ’s robots shouted out , “ Music by the Edgar Allan Poe marching band ! ” )
Nowadays the financial crisis is making so much impact , that our old fat piggy bank is starting to weaken and soon become anorexic !
Funny but sad at the same time !

Indian army snipers climb scaffolding opposite the Taj Mahal Palace hotel A number of hostages have been freed from one of Mumbai's top hotels - one of several sites in the city targeted by armed men - eyewitnesses said .
But the situation at the Taj Mahal Palace hotel remains confused , with explosions and gunfire heard coming from inside the hotel .
Police chief AN Roy says gunmen are still believed to be holding hostages at the Oberoi Trident hotel .
The series of attacks began late Wednesday and have killed 101 people .
More than 300 people were injured after the attackers , using grenades and automatic weapons , targeted at least seven sites in the main tourist and business district .
Around 40 people were believed to be held hostage at the two hotels , and hundreds trapped in their rooms , as troops began surrounding the buildings soon after they were taken over by the armed men .
See detailed map of the area Eyewitness reports from the hotels suggested the attackers were singling out British and American passport holders .
If the reports are true , our security correspondent Frank Gardner says it implies an Islamist motive - attacks inspired or co-ordinated by al - Qaeda .
A claim of responsibility has been made by a previously unknown group calling itself the Deccan Mujahideen .
Our correspondent says it could be a hoax or assumed name for another group .
Ambulances arrive Maharashtra state police chief AN Roy told local television that the siege at the Taj Mahal - one of Mumbai 's most recognisable hotels - had ended .
" People who were held up there , they have all been rescued .
But there are guests in the rooms , we do n't know how many . "
I can see more people leaving the hotel .
They are running out with their luggage
Eyewitness outside Taj Mahal hotel ' They killed so many people '
Witnesses said civilians could be seen running from the hotel , some with suitcases .
Ambulances were also reported to be arriving .
But the BBC's Mark Dummett , outside the Taj Mahal , says the situation has since become very confused , with the sounds of explosions and gunfire being heard from within the hotel , suggesting the siege is not yet over .
Earlier in the day , Indian commandos had been seen entering the hotels but there was little detail on the operation .
Mr Roy said some people were still apparently being held hostage at the Oberoi .
" That is why the operation is being conducted more sensitively to ensure there are no casualties of innocent people , " he said .
Meanwhile , explosions have been heard outside a Jewish centre in the city , where an Israeli rabbi is believed to be one of a number of hostages being held there .
MUMBAI ATTACKS
Attacks leave India reeling
In pictures : Mumbai attacks Troops have surrounded the offices of the group Chabad Lubavitch , which were stormed by gunmen overnight .
The city 's main commuter train station , a hospital , and a restaurant popular with tourists were also among at least seven locations caught up in the violence on Wednesday .
Police say 14 police officers , 81 Indian nationals and six foreigners have been killed .
A Japanese businessman and an Italian national were confirmed to be among the dead .
Four suspected terrorists have also been killed and nine arrested , they add .
In other developments : • The head of Mumbai 's anti-terrorism unit and two other senior officers are among those killed , officials say •
There are unconfirmed reports that five gunmen have taken hostages in an office block in the financial district of Mumbai • The British High Commissioner in India , Sir Richard Stagg , says seven UK citizens are known to be among the injured and believes that figure could rise •
The White House held a meeting of top intelligence and counter - terrorism officials , and pledged to help the Indian government • India 's Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange markets are closed , as the authorities urge local people to stay at home Gunmen opened fire at about 2300 local time ( 1730 GMT ) on Wednesday at the sites in southern Mumbai .

Roy said they used " automatic weapons and in some places grenades have been lobbed . "
Local TV images showed blood - splattered streets , and bodies being taken into ambulances .
One eyewitness told the BBC he had seen a gunman opening fire in the Taj Mahal 's lobby .
BOMB ATTACKS IN INDIA IN 2008 30 October : Explosions kill at least 64 in north - eastern Assam 30 September : Blasts in western India kill at least seven 27 September : Bomb blasts kills one in Delhi 13 September : Five bomb blasts kill 18 in Delhi 26 July :
At least 22 small bombs kill 49 in Ahmedabad 25 July : Seven bombs go off in Bangalore killing two people 13 May : Seven bomb hit markets and crowded streets in Jaipur killing 63
International reaction " We all moved through the lobby in the opposite direction and another gunman then appeared towards where we were moving and he started firing immediately in our direction . "
One British tourist had been holed up in his room at the Oberoi hotel throughout the night , hearing sporadic gunfire , small explosions and people running up and down the corridor .
" I 've barricaded my room , I 'm keeping my head down , " he told the BBC .
Other tourists told of groups of 20 to 30 people to a room , lying on the floor and staying very quiet .
Most of the attacks have been blamed on Muslim militants , although police have also arrested suspected Hindu extremists .
The BBC's Sanjeev Srivastava says the timing and symbolism of the latest attacks could not have been worse .
By choosing to target the richest district of India 's financial capital in such a brazen and effective manner , he says those behind the attacks have perhaps dealt the severest blow to date to the morale and self esteem of the Indian authorities .
The attacks have come amidst elections in several Indian states and exposes the governing coalition to the charge that it has failed to combat terror , our correspondent says .

Update : Nicole Belle adds :
Chris Matthews talks to Obama spokesperson Bill Burton and McCain spokesperson Nancy Pfotenhauer about the final days of the campaign .
Pfotenhauer has a great tell : whenever she gets flustered and is desperately trying to spin the unspinnable , her smile gets wider and she laughs nervously .
Matthews had her beaming like a high intensity flare over whose choice it was to spend the $ 150,000 on Palin 's clothing , something the RNC has thrown back in the lap of the McCain campaign and how pathetic it is that Palin does n't know what the role of the Vice President is .
MATTHEWS :
We talked about the superficial , now let 's talk the reality here .
And I want to talk about this : the role of the Vice President .
I want to give you a shot at it , Nancy , you 're a pro .
You 're not somebody in from out of town .
You know how politics works .
What is the role of the Vice President under the Constitution ?
Simply put , you know it or you do n't .
Either a person understands the role of the Vice President or they do n't .
What — as you understand it from the Constitution – as a professional , is the role of a Vice President .
It 's very important you know this answer .
We 're filling the part in two weeks .
PFOTENHAUER : That 's right .
That 's right .
Well , I mean , obviously the role of the Vice President is to support the President , but to also to preside when necessary over the US Senate .
And I think that this is also a tempest in a teapot …
MATTHEWS : No , that 's not the role of the Vice President .
I gave you a shot , Nancy , I want you to try again .
What is the Constitutional role of the Vice President ?
In the Constitution ?
What 's written in the Constitution ?
You 're …look , you 're all strict constructionists …
PFOTENHAUER : I 'm not a Constitutional scholar but I do know …
MATTHEWS : Have you ever read it ?
PFOTENHAUER : I 'm not a Constitutional scholar , but I have been reading the commentary on this and seems to me that people are parsing words and she was obviously trying to explain to a young child …
MATTHEWS : Let me …
Okay , let 's take a look at this …
PFOTENHAUER : … what the Vice President would do …
MATTHEWS : Nancy , I appreciate you coming on the show .
It 's a tough defense of this person , Sarah Palin .
PFOTENHAUER : Oh my …
MATTHEWS : Apparently , she does n't understand .
The role of the Vice President — let me state it very clearly right now — is to replace the President , if that is necessary .
As Colin Powell said on Sunday , that 's the job of the Vice President , to stand ready , under the Constitution in the tragic circumstances to replace the President .
Now that 's one role .
The other role is to have only a tie breaking role , as presiding officer of the US Senate .
That 's it .
The Constitution specifically prescribes that .
In fact it says that 's all the person has the right to do .
Now here 's Sarah Palin with her definition of this role , which sounds strange to me and I 've been in this city a long time .
I have never heard anybody say , and by the way , it 's very similar to what she said in her debate with Joe Biden , which made me wonder then : where did she get her civics ?
A couple of weeks ago , when Miodrag Milenkovic posed an interesting general problem in connection with POW - 7 , I was reminded of the “ hairy ball theorem ” ( obviously a phrase invented during a more innocent era ! ) , and a surprisingly easy proof of same that John Baez once told me over beers in an English pub .
John is quite a good story - teller , and I was n’t able to guess the punch line of the proof before it came out of his mouth –when it came , I was so surprised that I nearly fell off my stool !
Well , I happened to run across the original source of this proof recently , and though it may be “ old news ” for some , it ’s such a nice proof that I thought it was worth sharing .
The hairy ball theorem says : every continuous tangent vector field on a sphere of even dimension must vanish somewhere ( at some point of the sphere , the tangent vector is zero ) .
In the case of an ordinary 2 - dimensional sphere , if you think of a vector at a point as a little “ hair ” emanating from that point , then the theorem says that you ca n’t comb the hairs of a sphere so that they all lie flat against the sphere : there will be a cowlick sticking straight out somewhere .
The classical proofs usually make some kind of appeal to homology theory : for example , a deep result is that the Euler characteristic of a compact manifold can be computed in terms of any continuously differentiable tangent vector field , by adding up the so - called “ indices ” of the vector field in the neighborhoods of critical points , where the vector field vanishes ( a technical result shows there is no loss of generality in assuming the vector field is continuously differentiable ) .
If the vector field vanishes nowhere , then the Euler characteristic is the empty sum 0 ; this cannot be in the case of an even - dimensional sphere , because its Euler characteristic is 2 .
The hairy ball theorem follows .
Some of these homology - based proofs are quite slick , but generally speaking , homology theory requires some heavy infrastructure ; the question is whether a more elementary proof exists .
The following “ analytic ” proof is due to John Milnor and uses very little machinery , basically nothing beyond advanced calculus .
I will follow his exposition ( American Mathematical Monthly , July 1978 , pp. 521-524 ) pretty closely .
For the first step , suppose that we have a continuously differentiable vector field defined in a compact region of space , .
For any real and for , define a function
The matrix of first partial derivatives of is , where denotes the identity matrix .
For sufficiently small , the determinant of this matrix is strictly positive over all of .
Lemma 1 : If is sufficiently small , then is a one - to - one function of onto its image , and is a polynomial function of .
Proof :
Since is continuously differentiable over a compact region , there is [ using e.g. the mean value theorem , evidently a red rag for some people 😉 ] a Lipschitz constant so that
We have only if ; if we assume , this can happen only if .
So is one - to - one for such .
The determinant of the matrix of first partials above is of the form
where the are continuous functions in .
By the first part of the lemma , we may take so small that is a continuously differentiable embedding , and then by a change - of - variables formula in multivariate calculus we have that
where
This completes the proof .
Next , suppose that on we have a continuously differentiable non-vanishing field of tangent vectors .
Applying the continuously differentiable map , we assume the vector field consists of unit tangent vectors .
For each , the vector is thus of length , hence maps the unit sphere to the sphere of radius .
Lemma 2 : For sufficiently small , the map maps onto the sphere of radius .
Proof : Extend the vector field on ( and therefore also ) to the compact region between two concentric spheres , , by homothety , i.e. , put , for and .
There is a Lipschitz constant such that
for
Take , and let be any unit vector .
The function
maps the complete metric space to itself ( because and — just use triangle inequalities ) , and satisfies a Lipschitz condition where .
By a classical fixed - point theorem , has under these conditions a ( unique ) fixed point , so that .
Rescaling and by the factor , the statement of lemma 2 follows .
Now we prove the hairy ball theorem .
If is a continuous non-vanishing vector field of tangent vectors on , let be the absolute minimum of .
By standard techniques ( e.g. , using the Stone - Weierstrass approximation theorem ) , there is a continuously differentiable vector field such that , and then so that is also non-vanishing .
As above , we may then substitute for , i.e. , assume that consists of unit vectors .
Given , we extend to the region by homothety .
For sufficiently small , the map defined above maps a spherical shell in this region bijectively onto the shell .
Hence maps to the region , and we get a dilation factor :
By lemma 1 , is polynomial in .
So must be even ; therefore admits a non-vanishing vector field only if is odd .
This gives the hairy ball theorem .
Man , what an awesome proof .
That John Milnor is just a master of technique .
Just a quick note on how any of this bears on Milenkovic ’s problem .
He asked whether for any topological embedding of in and any point in the region interior to the embedding , there exists a hyperplane through such that the barycenter of the - dimensional region coincides with .
Under the further simplifying assumption that the barycenter varies continuously with , the answer is ‘ yes ’ for even - dimensional spheres .
For ( taking to be the origin ) we can define a tangent vector field whose value at is the vector from to the barycenter of .
For even , this vector vanishes for some , hence coincides with the barycenter for that particular .
Down in the underbrush beneath Sarah Palin ’s forest of lies there ’s been this line that even if she was a big time earmarker that she still vetoed half a billion worth of earmarks as governor .
Well , not exactly .
Mesa police found photos of a murder victim posing nude in a shower and , minutes later , lying in his bathroom " bleeding profusely , " according to a report released this week .
The photos , found on the digital card of a water - damaged camera , include the woman accused of killing him posing naked on a bed the afternoon of the killing .
The graphic photos from the June slaying of Travis Alexander , 30 , a businessman and motivational speaker , were revealed in a Mesa police report after defendant Jodi Ann Arias , 28 , the victim 's ex-girlfriend , was extradited from Northern California on Friday to face first - degree murder charges .
Police also found other evidence tying Arias to the murder , including a bloody palm print that matched both her and Alexander 's DNA .
Arias was indicted Monday by a Maricopa County grand jury , and Juan Martinez , one of the state 's top death - penalty prosecutors , was assigned to the case .
The Maricopa County Attorney 's Office has not formally filed legal papers to seek the death penalty .
" Jodi was described as being completely obsessed with Travis by his family and his closest friends , " the report said .
When police were called to Alexander 's upscale east Mesa home June 9 , they found his body sitting in the shower , with his throat cut from ear to ear , the report said .
It is unknown how long his body was there , but the report noted it was " well into the decomposition process . "
Wounds show that Alexander attempted to fight his attacker , the report said .
A spent .25 caliber casing was found near the sink .
An autopsy found Alexander sustained 27 puncture wounds and one gunshot wound , with the bullet found in his left cheek .
The digital camera , which belonged to Alexander , was heavily damaged in the washing machine but the digital card was intact .
Scientists in the Mesa police crime lab recovered the photos , some of which had been deleted .
Deleted pictures showed the victim posing naked in the shower on June 4 at 5:22 p.m. , with the last picture showing him alive at 5:30 p.m.
Subsequent photos showed him bleeding while on the floor , the report said .
The pictures of Arias posing naked on Alexander 's bed were taken at 1:40 p.m. the same afternoon , the report said .
" All were nude pictures and some in provocative sexual poses , " the report said .
Arias ' bloody left palm print was found on the bathroom wall , the report said .
Arias ' DNA also was found in hair recovered from a bloody wall .
The report said the photos are important because they show Arias lied about not seeing Alexander since April 2008 .
Numerous photos of Alexander and Arias were posted on Arias ' myspace.com page as a memorial album .
" You are as enlightened as you are beautiful , " Alexander wrote in a January 2007 blog in reaction to a series of inspirational quotes posted by Arias .
In her latest message on the social - networking Web site , Arias wrote that she missed Alexander .
" See you soon my friend but not soon enough . "
Arias told police that the couple dated for five months but broke up in June 2007 " after some jealousy issues on the part of both of them , " but privately continued a sexual relationship after that .
Arias is being held at a Maricopa County jail on a $ 2 million bond , according to court records .
She lived in Yreka with her parents prior to her arrest in July .

METAL AIRCRAFT HANGAR - METAL AGRICULTURAL BUILDING -METAL CHURCH BUILDING
There are many accessories for the Steel Arch Buildings to customize the metal building to suit your individual needs .
Just some of the options would include , Colored Endwalls to more closely blend in with the metal buildings environment , skylights , Endwall frame and windows , service doors , overhead or sliding doors , turbine vent kits , and insulation .
Steel buildings are considered the most flexible solutions that you can purchase for contractors , builders , complete it yourselves as well as their families .
These durable , virtually no maintenance building solutions come with significant benefits .
Custom engineering and design of today 's metal buildings allow owners to obtain the look they need , when using the functionality they should get .
The stringent state - of - the - art requirements of today 's building owners demand that their building system employ simply not only advanced designs , but additionally offer flexibility , efficient use of energy , and speedy construction times .
When a steel building is made , design , fabrication , and construction times are greatly reduced .
And future expansion is uncomplicated .
The increasing popularity of Integrity Steel 's Steel Building Systems has stemmed from pre-engineered metal buildings signature benefits , which include :
1. Durability
Pre-engineered steel buildings are incredibly durable .
They are definitely sufficiently strong to face up to heavy snowfall , high winds , and powerful earthquakes .
The steel roof panels will also be coated using an aluminum compound called galvalume to prevent rusting and increase the life of this very panels .
They 're also non-combustible so it 's unlikely they are going to be destroyed by fire .
2. Quick Assembly
Construction of a traditional wood building takes a minimum of several months to finish up .
Assuming that your steel building structure is purchased from a reliable provider and it does not require significant customizing , they are very quick and easier to erect .
Anchor bolt patterns , detailed assembly drawings , and a bit by bit erection guide are everything included with every building .
All major connections are bolt - together with pre-punched holes , and the majority components are precut and numbered to correspond with your drawings for quick assembly .
3. Flexibility
Pre-engineered metal buildings could possibly have few to no interior columns , therefore their interior layout can be more flexible and be better for storing large pieces of equipment , installing lifts , and conducting interior activities .
Pair that having the capability to have much larger door openings ( e.g. overhead , rolling , and sliding doors ) as well as having the benefits start adding up significantly .
Larger door openings make her better for storing large items of equipment .
From within an agricultural or aviation perspective , this makes them ideal for storing large aircraft or farm equipment .
4 . Low energy use
Rigid frame steel buildings can possibly be insulated far better than wood frame steel buildings , which boosts energy efficiency and might result in vast savings on HVACs costs .
5. Significant Cost Savings
Pre-engineered steel buildings usually cost less than traditional construction .
The event process with pre-engineered steel buildings is often not affected by delays like traditional construction .
Because the building just should be assembled , there are actually rarely any surprise cost increases .
Also , these steel buildings can easily be assembled and erected by almost anyone , so costs of labor are reduced and also you save time in the process .

The losses keep piling up - close to one trillion in stocks , and almost $ 5 trillion in U.S. homes �the Dow gives a pathetic shot to try to buck the downward trend yesterday �
*** The Fed is going into the wild �Ron Paul takes on Big Ben� ***
A revolutionary breakthrough in modern medicine �do n't miss out on your winter fuel payments �and more !
---------------------
Yes , dear reader , we are going where no man ever went before �into the wild .
All around us is virgin territory .
No one has ever been here before .
But watch out , these virgins are vicious amazons .
In this wild place , you can forget living it up .
Do n't even think about getting rich .
Riches ?
If you 've got 'em�hide 'em .
Luxury ?
Who needs it anyway ?
The best you 'll be able to do is survive .
And then , maybe , years from now , we can put our financial lives back together again �and get on with things �
Never before have seen so much wealth disappear in such a short time .
The latest report from MSCI shows the planet 's losses from the sell - off of equities has now reached more than $ 30 trillion - or more than twice the GDP of the U.S.A .!
And this is just stocks .
Reported write - downs , write - offs and credit losses have reached almost a trillion .
And losses of housing prices in the United States alone - the only country for which we have reliable figures - has reached about $ 5 trillion .
Nor have we ever seen such a rapid reaction .
In the space of a few months , people have gone from believing that nothing could go wrong to thinking that there 's nothing that wo n't go wrong .
Where once they thought that free - market capitalism would make them rich �they now believe that the government can save them from getting poor .
And where only a year ago they thought the world 's globalized economy would always give them everything they needed " just in time , " they now believe they better keep a few sheckels on hand " just in case . "
And just look at the bonds !
A few months ago , investors stretched for yields .
Now , it 's safety they reach for .
They dump corporate bonds for fear they may be " toxic , " and grab U.S. Treasury debt with both hands .
Investors now seem to have an unqualified trust in the full faith and credit of the world 's largest debtor .
Yields on 91 - day T - bills have fallen to 0.11 % - scarcely a tenth of one percent !
Yes , dear reader , the " Great Unwind " �the " Big Bust " �the " Great De-leveraging " - call it what you want ; we 've never seen anything like it .
The Dow rose 151 points yesterday - a limp and pathetic little attempt buck the downward trend .
Gold lost $ 6.80 � leaving it at $ 735 .
China 's stock market had managed an 18 % rebound �following the announcement of its half - trillion dollar bailout plan .
But yesterday , Chinese stocks were collapsing again .
The latest news from America tells us that housing prices are still going down in 4 out of 5 cities .
Homebuilders ' wives are hiding the shotguns and pouring out the whiskey ; their husbands ' confidence has never been lower , according to this morning 's news report .
Big towns �little towns �in the sophisticated cities and out in bumpkin country , the story is the same .
The Wall Street Journal tells us that the " fall in crop prices " is putting an end to the boom in the boonies .
U.S. producer prices fell 2.8 % in October - the most they 've ever fallen .
And the Big Three automakers say that if they do n't get some help soon , the results will be " catastrophic . "
Meanwhile , over on the sunny California coast , the whole state is going up in smoke �it 's not only going broke , it 's burning up .
" I have to dust the ash off my car every morning , " reports daughter Maria , recently arrived in LA and hoping to make it big in the motion pictures .
" It 's eerie �there 's always a little smoke and soot in the air � "
Not only is the bust unlike anything we 've ever seen before �so is the planet - wide effort to stop it .
All over the globe , the feds are going ' into the wild ' with extraordinary measures .
They 're mobilizing troops to fight the crisis in the boardrooms .
They 'll fight it in the stock markets .
They 'll fight it at home - with house - to - house combat to stop foreclosures and defaults .
They 'll fight it abroad - the U.S. government is even loaning money to foreign governments !
They 'll fight it with loans and giveaways .
They 'll fight it with fiscal policy .
They 'll fight it with monetary policy .
They 'll fight it with every weapon available to them - including the printing press .
And they will lose .
***
To give you an idea of the wild measures undertaken by the feds , we look at what is happening at the world 's leading bank - the U.S. Federal Reserve .
The short form of how the Fed operates is this : it holds a certain amount of securities in its vault ; this is the cornerstone capital - or monetary base - of the whole banking structure .
How does it get this capital ?
It buys it , creating the money to pay for it as necessary .
Naturally , the Fed does n't want to create too much money or the inflation rate would get out of control and economists would point their fingers accusingly .
But now , people fear dandruff more than inflation .
So , the Fed has gone wild .
From the day of its founding in 1913 to September 24 , 2008 the Fed 's assets - the aforementioned cornerstone capital for the US financial system - grew to $ 1 trillion .
By November 14 , 2008 the amount had grown to over $ 2 trillion .
And in a speech in Texas , the head of the Dallas branch of the Fed said he expected the total to reach $ 3 trillion by year - end .
For the moment , this explosion of monetary inflation is hardly noticed .
Asset deflation has the headlines .
People worry about having too few dollars , not about having too many .
Comes the news this morning that U.S. business chiefs are asking the up - coming Obama administration for another $ 500 billion ' stimulus ' program .
They 'll get it .
And much more .
Trillions worth .
Trying to stimulate the economy with easier credit in the early 2000s , Alan Greenspan overdid it .
He gave the world the credit it wanted , and created the biggest bubble in human history .
Now that bubble is collapsing and his successor - Ben Bernanke - is confronted with a new problem .
Now it is cash that people want - income to pay their debts !
Bernanke will give them what they want .
And , most likely , he will overdo it too .
***
At a recent hearing on Treasury Department use of government assistance funds , Ron Paul , who is well - known for often calling out the Federal Reserve chairman on their liberal use of the printing press , took on Big Ben .
Here is the transcript of their interaction , in case you missed the C - SPAN coverage : Ron Paul :
The Austrian free market economists had predicted all these problems would come , and they were certainly correct in everything that they said .
Of course they 're not very satisfied including myself with the so - called solutions , because it looks like we 're spending a lot of energy and a lot of money trying to patch a system together that is unworkable .
So we have Congress spending a lot of money , we have Treasury very much involved in trying to pick and choose which worthless asset that we 're going to buy , and of course the Federal Reserve is involved in injecting trillions of dollars that nobody seems to be keeping track of .
But what we 're failing to do I think is to recognize that the system no longer works , but I can understand why we do this because if Congress could n't do this and if the Fed could n't do this and Treasury could n't do this , it would make us all irrelevant .
And instead of looking at the causes of this , and then finding the solutions are n't going to be found here , we have to make ourselves feel pretty important .
But I think there 's another reason we think we 're pretty important , it 's because in a way our interference in the market corrections that tried to come about since 1971 seem to work .
I mean , the failure was established in 1971 with a system that had no way of automatically correcting the balance of payment and the current account deficits .
And that 's where the problems have been , and economists - whether they were left or right or middle - over the last several decades have always said , this current account deficit is a big problem .
And now it 's totally out of hand .
So here we are struggling with all these rules and shifting back and forth and really getting nowhere .
My question is directed toward , when we come to the full realization that the system is unworkable , what are we going to do , what have you thought about doing , and already we see talk in the newspapers .
We see articles about a new international world reserve currency , and to me that 's pretty important , because the fiat dollar reserve system is not going to work anymore , and that 's the information that we have to accept and decide what we 're going to do in the future .
Also , this is not new in history .
Currencies have failed , financial systems have failed , and generally , to restore the confidence that everybody is talking about , they usually have to go back to a currency with integrity to it , rather than just fiat money .
And , you know , the stages is there .
It 's not impossible , already the central banks of the world still own 15 % of all the gold that was ever mined in all of history .
So they hold on to this gold for some reason , and therefore something has to give , or are we going to keep trying to waste more money and time patching this system together .
Just last week there was a report that Iran purchased 75 billion dollars worth of gold , took their reserves out of Europe , bought gold and put it in Asia .
So is that a sign of the times , is that moving on ?
My question is , in your meetings , and you had a meeting just recently with other central bankers , does this thought come up about a new international world reserve currency , and if so , does the subject of gold ever come up ?
How do you restore the confidence ?
Have you recently had conversations with any central banker , and is there a move on to replace the dollar system , because the dollar system is essentially declared dead , because it 's not working , but this indeed was predictable because of these tremendous imbalances that were never allowed to be corrected , and they were always patched up .
We always came in .
We 'd spend , we 'd inflate , we would run up deficits , and since ' 71 we 've been able to correct these problems .
Could you tell me what kind of conversations you 've had regarding a new reserve currency ?
Ben Bernanke : Yes , Congressman .
I do n't think the dollar system is dead .
I think the dollar remains the premier international currency .
We 've seen a good deal of appreciation in the dollar recently during the crisis precisely because there 's been a lot of interest in the safe haven and the liquidity of dollar markets .
And the Federal Reserve has been engaged in swap agreements to make sure there 's enough dollar liquidity in other countries because the need for dollars is so strong .
So I think the dollar system remains quite strong .
I do agree with you very much on one point , which is about the current accounts .
The current account imbalances have proved to a very serious problem .
It was in fact the large capital inflows in those current accounts which created a lot of the financial imbalances we saw and have led to some of the problems we are seeing , and one of the silver linings in this huge grey cloud is that we 're seeing some improvement and greater balance in our current account deficits .
Ron Paul :
But does the subject of a new regime ever come up ?
Ben Bernanke : No , it does n't .
Ron Paul :
And does the subject of gold ever come up in any of your conversations ?
Ben Bernanke : Only in terms of the sales that the central banks are planning .
The I.O.U.S.A. team interviewed the Congressman for the documentary .

*** GWB - you can't say we did n't warn you .
A top British judge has just announced that he considers the Bush administration 's attack on Iraq as a violation of international law .
Years from now , George W. Bush is likely to be charged with war crimes and human rights violations .
Normally , this would pose no problem .
A former U.S. president could expect the protection of the U.S. government .
But as Americans sink into depression they are not likely to feel kindly towards their ex-president .
They will blame him for the decline of their incomes�and for the fall of their empire .
They are likely to want to cooperate with the world 's new institutions �and throw over their own former commander - in - chief .
Advice to GWB : Go back to Texas .
Do n't ever leave home again .
*** Colleague Patrick Cox , at Breakthrough Technology
Alert offers some rare optimism into this otherwise downright gloomy market : " Yes , we have been swindled by politicians who pushed the U.S. banking system into the shape it 's in today .
The people who tried to stop the meltdown have utterly failed to explain the root of the problem to the American people .
We 've officially entered recession now and policymakers will do little to address the real problems .
" Though the hit the economy has suffered recently pales in comparison with the drain on world resources associated with that war , our situation is similar .
We are at a point of incredible opportunities .
" The reason is , in a word , science .
The accelerating pace of breakthrough discoveries will deliver economic benefits that few fathom today .
While the entire world will gain from these discoveries , investors who understand what we are going through now will profit most and earliest .
Even better , the return on these stocks will be so great that even relatively modest investments will produce fortunes .
" Let me give you a few hints about the shape of things to come .
Just in the last few weeks , two groups of scientists announced the discovery of microorganisms that produce biodiesel naturally .
Professor Gary Strobel from Montana State University discovered a fungus deep in the Patagonian rain forests of Argentina .
This organism naturally produces the long chain hydrocarbons needed to create fuels .
" Even bigger news is coming on the medical front .
I predict that real stem cell therapies will be offered offshore within the year .
Currently , there is a billion - dollar industry offering stem cell snake oil , but real lifesaving and life - extending therapies are already available in the laboratory .
These therapies are relatively inexpensive to produce and will revolutionize medicine .
Even the FDA will come around when wealthy early adopters begin reporting true rejuvenation results .
By the end of Obama 's first term , we will see SC and other therapies that will radically cut the cost of treating horrendously expensive illnesses . "
Patrick has been alerting us to a breakthrough that could change the way we view modern medicine .
And when news breaks - which is rumored to happen tonight - those who have gotten in on this revolutionary idea stand to make some pretty major gains .
Read all about it here .

We got a letter from Her Majesty 's government .
" Winter Fuel Payments � do n't miss out ! "
Yes , dear reader , this is how societies collapse .
People invent problems .
Then , they find solutions to the problems .
Then , the solutions cause more problems .
And finally the cost of all the solutions brings the whole system falling down .
A news report out today tells us that the weekend will be cold .
An " arctic blast " is said to be on its way .
Of course , some parts of the city already feel as though they were in a nuclear winter .
London 's main industry is finance .
And finance has iced up .
A headline in yesterday 's paper told us that London is expected to lose 370,000 jobs over the next two years .
But thank God for the world improvers : " Our records show that you may become eligible for a payment this winter , " begins the letter .
Why ?
Because your editor is enrolled in the Britain 's national health service ( a requirement for employment ) .
NHS records must have revealed to the authorities that your editor turned 60 in September .
Accordingly , he is eligible for 125 pounds to help him with his heating costs this winter .
Imagine the miserable bureaucrats administering this program .
They have computers to program�letters to write �records to keep �internal procedures to devise , administer and respect .
They have to hire people �and then support them for the rest of their lives , paying for pensions and holiday , just like any other business .
Then , they have to work out internal disputes �make sure the coffee maker is working properly �and organize an annual Christmas party .
It probably costs more than 125 pounds to send out each check !
And why should someone over 60 get money and not someone under 30 ?
The older person has had 30 more years to stuff newspaper in the cracks , firewood in his garage and money in his bank account .
If he 's cold this winter �it 's his own damn fault .
But if you 're going to give him money to help him keep warm , why not some extra money to help him with his eating needs ?
He has to eat , does n't he ?
And why does n't HM Government just send him a bottle of Chateau Margaux ?
Maybe 1985 .
To help him with his drinking needs .
Until tomorrow , Bill Bonner

The fingers of blame are pointing every which way during the U.S. financial crisis�but in Ed Bugos ' opinion on a few are pointing in the right direction : toward the Federal Reserve System .
Read on� VOICES OF REASON STILL IN THE WILDERNESS
by Ed Bugos " Karl Marx ( 1818 - 1883 ) originated the idea that recurrent crises are inherent in the unhampered ( free ) market economy .
Mises has shown that ' the trade cycle is � on the contrary , the inevitable effect of manipulation of the money market ' "
- Percy L. Greaves Jr. , Mises Made Easier Occasionally I hear the odd guest on CNBC or Bloomberg Radio who lays blame for the crisis in exactly the right place - the Federal Reserve System in the U.S�. or central banking more broadly .
These extremely influential institutions ostensibly exist to regulate prices , employment and interest rates by way of control over the money supply .
They do this by inflating bank reserve credit , on which the banks can pyramid , thus essentially abrogating the role of interest rate determination by the market .
That is , the central bank tries to determine interest rates as far as it can .
The rationale for this policy is to attain full employment and price stability , and to otherwise manage economic affairs .
Any economist whose lenses are n't blurred by the fatal errors of the neo-classical doctrines is immediately capable of spotting the problem with that policy foundation .
Unemployment could scarcely exist on a free market , where the government did not interfere with the price of labor .
Just like shortages of goods cannot really exist in a market where their price is free to adjust to the reality of existing conditions , there can be no excess labor unless the government intervenes to artificially boost its price .
It 's the same principle .
It is a simple economic fact - free of political considerations .
Labor is an economic good primarily because it is scarce .
Moreover , whether we are talking about labor legislation or the central bank trying to manage growth , prices and interest rates , it amounts to economic management , even planning .
The apparent effect of the policy is to bring about a boom in investment and consumption � the building up of bubble companies and uneconomic enterprises relying on the continued increases in the selling prices of the goods they deal in - be it widgets , homes or securities .
These price increases are afforded by regular money debasement , which is one of the economic consequences of an increase in the supply of money in particular .
So it is illusory .
In reality , as Rothbard points out , the boom " is actually a period of wasteful misinvestment .
It is the time when errors are made , due to bank credit 's tampering with the free market " .
So this policy , and the booms it engenders , crowds out real savings ( by pushing rates below market ) , and investment comes to rely on the continued " stimulus " of money creation or from borrowing overseas .
Ultimately , it further lays the seeds of its own demise because the process invariably arrives at a point at which the central bank must desist if it does not want to prompt a run of confidence in its notes , leading to hyperinflation .
This is why we say the policy is " unsustainable . "
Thus it tries to withdraw the stimulus or " tighten " money and credit - explaining that the overheated economy might produce inflation .
The error in its thinking is that it is managing a delicate balance between price stability and growth �that it checks market failures , and can know the unknowable ( the future ) .
In fact , almost all economists would agree , it cannot produce growth .
It 's like the analogy of pushing on a string .
The Fed 's policy can only increase employment by decreasing the relative cost of labor through inflation ( the expansion of money supply relative to demand ) .
And as one of the largest of interventions conducted by government policy , it only produces more instability - i.e. the boom - bust cycle as well as interest rate and foreign exchange volatility eventually .
Technically , tampering with the rate of interest produces disequilibrium as a mismatch between consumer preferences and producers ' investment plans - during the boom phases .
Effectively , it taxes long run growth , and is but a massive redistribution of wealth from savers to borrowers and speculators .
The bust , which often begins with the onset of a financial crisis , brings much pain , and threatens job losses on a wide - scale .
But this is because the artificially low rate of interest produced by the previous policy , which could not be sustained , produced waste , a " cluster of error " as Rothbard called it .
This " malinvestment " or uneconomic activity is essentially exposed as the subsidy is withdrawn .
In his book , America 's Great Depression , Rothbard posits the error in Marx 's reasoning , " In the purely free and unhampered market , there will be no cluster of errors , since trained entrepreneurs will not all make errors at the same time . "
What you see then is basically the widespread failure of parasitic enterprises that could not survive on their own - without the handouts and support of the central bank .
This is the empirical evidence that should indict any inflation policy .
But , the bust still merely represents a return to natural market ratios .
" The ' depression ' is actually the process by which the economy adjusts to the wastes and errors of the boom , and reestablishes efficient service of consumer desires .
The adjustment process consists in rapid liquidation of the wasteful investments " ( Rothbard )
It follows then , that " Attempts to interfere with free and flexible prices , wage and interest rates prevent recovery and prolong the depression period " ( Mises Made Easier ) Efforts to stabilize the bust with even more inflation effectively prevent the liquidation of uneconomic enterprises necessary to return the economy to equilibrium , where markets reflect actual conditions .
Now , I 'm not a policy maker .
I do n't want to suggest the best way to fix the world or argue why these theories are true .
My chief concern is the future .
And the evidence that most people would side with Marx on this ( over Mises et al ) is all I need to predict more inflation , war and higher gold prices .
Joe Public can't for the life of him figure out why it matters if interest rates are 1.5 % or 1 % .
He cannot connect the escalating price at the pump to the process of money creation required to bring about such a modest change in the interest rate .
The tech bust was the fault of irrational speculators , and greedy investment bankers .
The housing bust is blamed on Wall Street 's larceny , his mortgage and real estate brokers , or the thrust toward deregulation .
The painful increase in commodity prices is caused by too much growth .
The growing trade deficit is caused by new competition from foreign countries .
And so on .
For , Joe takes his cue not from Mises , but from the media and political classes under heavy influence by the progressive institutions .
Political leaders in Europe , meanwhile , are taking full advantage of Joe to wage a new war on capitalism from the left on grounds that American style capitalism is in dire need of more regulation .
This is the great evil of the inflation policy .
It is insidious .
The great economists have all recognized this truth .
It only produces the opposite of what it claims to accomplish .
It also funds the growth of government and anti-capitalist sentiment , and other confused ideas that may lead , ultimately , to the general disintegration in the division of labor , the fabric of society .
It promotes moral degradation and corruption , conflict , and finances wars .
It is 80 % of what 's wrong with the world .
But for the most part , the voices of reason that point to this cause are trampled over by the rhetoric of the larger political class , which fear mongers people into clamoring for more money and credit .
This truth is evident in the Fed 's actions .
It has abandoned any remnants of conservatism , as have the other central banks worldwide .
The helicopter blades are in full swing .
So any enthusiasm about the world having reached this place where it is ready to turn a new leaf must be tempered by this fact .
The voices of reason , though on the beltway , are still only voices in the wilderness .
This alone suggests we are going to continue to see more inflation , taxes and government .
The scary part is that this process is accelerating .
The next bubble may well be in gold .

The winner of the US presidential election is not always the candidate who wins the popular vote - the path to victory is to win a majority in the electoral college .
Each state has a certain number of electors who elect the president - the number depends on the state 's population - and the trick is to win enough states to stack up 270 electors ' votes .
The map to the right shows how the states have voted since 1948 .
Below we reprint five expert projections , based partly on the latest opinion polls , which indicate how the race could end in 2008 .
Each website regularly updates its map .
This is what the maps looked like as polls opened on the east coast of the US .
CQ POLITICS : Obama 311 , McCain 157
The Congressional Quarterly has tracked both presidential and congressional races for many years .
Its current calculations suggest that Barack Obama is ahead in two major swing states , Ohio and Virginia .
Its list of toss - up states includes not only Florida and North Carolina , but also Montana , Missouri , North Dakota and Indiana , which were considered solidly Republican until very recently .
We have slightly simplified the CQ Politics map .
As well as toss - up ( or , in its terminology , " no clear favourite " ) it has three categories of states : " safe " " favoured " and " leans " .
We have amalgamated the " favoured " and " leans " category .
( This is why more states appear in the " leaning " category on this map than on the other four . )
REAL CLEAR POLITICS : Obama 291 , McCain 132
The Real Clear Politics website aggregates election polls , and rates states by averaging the most recent polls in that state .
The most striking feature of this map is the fact that Arizona - home state of Republican presidential candidate John McCain - now appears in the toss - up category .
( This change was made on 31 October ) .
Real Clear Politics also lists Georgia as a toss - up , in contrast with CQ , which lists both states as " favoured " for McCain .
On the other hand , Real Clear Politics has recently moved Pennsylvania ( 30 October ) and Minnesota ( 3 November ) from the solid Obama category , to the leaning Obama category .
And on 2 November it moved Virginia and Ohio from " leaning to Obama " to the toss - up category .
The website has also recently moved South Dakota and Arkansas from the " firm " for McCain category into " leaning " .
POLLSTER : Obama 311 , McCain 142
Pollster.com is another site that takes polls from other sites and uses them to estimate state - by - state results .
Both tracking sites now broadly agree on the shape of the race .
As of noon GMT on Saturday 1 November , Pollster had not followed Real Clear Politics in moving Arizona into the toss - up category , or Pennsylvania into the leaning Obama group .
It also sees New Mexico as solid for Obama , whereas Real Clear Politics classifies it as leaning towards Obama .
Like Real Clear Politics , Pollster also sees support for the Republican candidate weakening in South Dakota .
NEW YORK TIMES : Obama 291 , McCain 163
The New York Times combines data from state polls with the judgement of its correspondents on the ground .
It regards the contest as much closer than CQ , Real Clear Politics or Pollster.com .
Like most other sites , it now suggests that support for Mr McCain is weakening in some unlikely places , such as Georgia , Montana , North Dakota and West Virginia .
CRYSTAL BALL : Obama 364 , McCain 174
The website of Professor Larry Sabato , a well - known election expert from the University of Virginia , is now ( since 30 October ) predicting a landslide - more than 350 electoral college votes - for Barack Obama .
Professor Sabato no longer lists any states as toss - ups .
He has also stopped referring to states as " leaning " to one candidate or the other .
Instead he says the race in certain states is " close " .
However , he lists close races in either red or blue , so we have continued to describe them as " leaning " , and shaded them in the same colour as the leaning states on the other maps , to make a visual comparison easy .
Perhaps because of this change of terminology , Professor Sabato is the only one of our five experts who - instead of listing Florida and Missouri as toss - ups - sees them as tending towards Barack Obama .
O ren Koules has a new show in the works titled The Tortured and , no , it is not another name for the Tampa Bay Lightning , as fitting as it may be .
Koules , a former Major Junior A and minor pro player who grew up in the Chicago area , made his considerable fortune as a Hollywood producer , then used a chunk of it to buy into part ownership of the Lightning .
He has co-produced the string of Saw horror movies , now numbering five , about serial killings .
Murderous might also describe his proprietorship so far with the Lightning ( along with , among others , ex- NHL player Len Barrie , a Canadian who made it big in B.C. real estate development ) .
Barry Melrose is said to have been Koules ' personal choice as head coach but he is also assumed to have signed off on Melrose 's firing Friday after only 16 regular - season games on the job .
Koules was also behind the movie Dumb and Dumberer : When Harry Met Lloyd .
Which , irresistibly , might describe how all involved are looking – the Lightning has fired two head coaches , Melrose and John Tortorella , since June and has now elevated a man , Rich Tocchet , into the position who is still on probation for his involvement in a sports betting scam .
Melrose is owed $ 2.25 million ( U.S. ) over three years ; Tortorella is still collecting the $ 1.3 mil ' he 's owed .
Koules ' TV credits include the hit series Two And A Half Men .
That 's what the Lightning 's five skaters have looked like on most shifts in most games this season .
Melrose berated them for lack of effort , they responded by giving him more ( or less ) of the same .
That 's two NHL coaches fired already this season , Denis Savard having lasted only four games with the Chicago Blackhawks .
( The other day , Savard accepted a position with the team as an " ambassador . " )
The serial killings continue .
Columnist Joe Henderson of the Tampa Tribune : " It 's possible for a franchise to look more foolish than the Lightning do right now , but then again maybe not .
They should abandon the Forum for a circus tent .
In the league of serious people , these are the guys with big red noses that honk and squirt water . " ... Gary Shelton , writing in the St. Petersburg Times :
You work 16 games , and what do you get ?
Evidently , a fresh pink slip and a severance check . "
AND FURTHERMORE : Seeing as he is likely to get a contract worth more than $ 137 million ( U.S. ) , what does the CC in CC Sabathia stand for anyway ?
Cold Cash ?
In fact , it 's Carsten Charles .
... Carmelo Anthony and LeBron James both admit to having some Barry Manilow tunes on their iPods .
Do you ?
...
The Montreal Canadiens may be owned by an American , but the Toronto Maple Leafs will soon be run by a pair of them , Brian Burke and Ron Wilson .
What would Conn Smythe have thought of that ?
Harold Ballard ? ... Sage Rosenfels , good with math , knows he was a long shot to be named the Houston Texans ' starting quarterback : " I have been a backup for eight years .
So , if there 's 32 teams in the league times eight years , that 's 256 times that teams have said , ' This guy is not our starter . '
So , yeah , I think there are some ( detractors ) out there . " ...
Topps , the sports trading cards company , is putting out a line of Barack Obama cards , 90 in all .
Will there be more to mark his rookie year as President ?
... The Vicktory Dogs Wine Collection , with some profits tabbed for charity , features portraits of 22 dogs confiscated from Michael Vick 's Bad Newz Kennels .
The dogs are now living at the Best Friends Animal Sanctuary in Utah .
FANNIE BAY , Australia , Nov. 30 ( UPI ) --
An Australian woman says she hated snakes even before she found 14 young carpet pythons in her bedroom .
Esther Honegger of Fannie Bay told The Northern Territorian she first noticed some of the snakes as she prepared for bed Wednesday night .

" I hate snakes and as I walked backwards and forwards I would see another one , " she said .
" They were everywhere -- there was one curled around my bedhead , another around the bottom of the chair , and when I went outside there was one in the hallway , another on the railing and another on the step .
It was like I was having a nightmare . "
Snake catcher Geoff Brouff removed seven of the baby pythons Wednesday and was summoned back to Honegger 's home Thursday , when he found seven more .
Brouff believes a female python living on the roof laid her eggs there and the babies slithered down through air - conditioning vents .
Since carpet pythons usually lay 25 to 30 eggs , Honegger could have some more unwelcome guests .
" I 've never had a call out for so many snakes before , so I thought it was a joke for sure , " he said .

The Georgia Guidestones
The Georga Guidestones are located in Elbert County , Georgia , approximately 90 miles ( 145 kilometers ) east of Atlanta , and 9 miles ( 15 kilometers ) north of the center of Elberton .
The monument is situated on a rise a short distance to the east of Georgia Highway 77 ( Hartwell Highway ) , and is visible from that road .
Small signs beside the highway indicate the turnoff for the Guidestones , which is identified by a street sign as " Guidestones Rd . "
The Georgia Guidestones are a huge granite monument located on a hilltop in Elbert County , Georgia , USA .
It is sometimes referred to as the " American Stonehenge , " a title that has been applied at times to a number of other structures , including Mystery Hill .
A message comprised of ten guides or commandments is inscribed on the monument in eight modern languages , and a shorter message is inscribed at the top of the structure in four ancient scripts .
The monument is almost twenty feet tall , and made from six granite slabs that weigh more than 100 tons .
One slab stands in the center , with four arranged around it .
A capstone lies on top of the five slabs , which are astronomically aligned .
An additional stone tablet , which is set in the ground a short distance to the west of the monument , provides some clarifying notes on the history and purpose of the Guidestones .
The stones are placed so that a slit at eye level in the central upright slab permits an observer to view the eastern horizon and aligns with the position of the rising sun at the Summer and Winter Solstices .
Through the center stone , from south to north , a two - inch diameter hole is inclined at an angle of 34 degrees and points to the North celestial pole .
A beam of sunlight passing through a hole in the capstone forms a spot of light below .
The position of the spot can be used to determine high noon and the day of the year .
The eye - level , oblique hole is drilled from the South to the North side of the center , Gnomen stone , so that the North Star is always visible , symbolizing constancy and orientation with the forces of nature .
A slot is cut in the middle of the Gnomen stone to form a window which aligns with the positions of the rising sun at the Summer and Winter Solstices and at the Equinox , so that the noon sun shines to indicate noon on a curved line .
The cap stone includes a calendar of sorts , where sunlight beams through a 7/8 inch hole at noon , and shines on the South face of the center stone .
As the sun makes its travel cycle , the spot beamed through the hole can tell the day of the year at noon each day .
Allowances are made because of variations between standard time and sun time to set the beam of sunlight at an equation of time .
The site was chosen because it commands a view to the East and to the West and is within the range of the Summer and Winter sunrises and sunsets .
The stones are oriented in those directions .
History
The story behind the guidestones is as mysterious as the monuments themselves .
In June 1979 a well dressed , articulate man walked into theoffice of the Elberton Granite Company in Elberton , Georgia and said that he wanted to know the cost of building a large monument to the conservation of humanity .
He identified himself as Mr. R. C. Christian and said that he represented a small group of Americans who wished to remain anonymous .
Altough Elberton is considered the granite capital of the United States , the president of the granite company was skeptical of undertaking a project of this magnitude and very skeptical of the stranger in his office .
He asked Mr. Christian to speak to the company 's banker , Mr. Wyatt Martin , thinking that would be the last he saw of him .
However , Mr. Christian went to the bank and explained to Mr. Martin that although his name was a pseudonym with symbolic meaning , he and the group he represented were very serious about erecting these guidestones for , " the conservation of the world and to herald the coming age of reason .
Should there be a holocaust in the civilized world , the group wished the guidestones to be one of the most enduring things to help humanity start anew .
Mr. Martin agreed to handle the funds and after an escrow account was set up , work began on the monument .
Skilled workers quarried and cut the blocks , others sandblasted the message in 4 " high letters , and still others hauled them to a hillside 7 miles north of Elberton where they were astronomically aligned with the North celestial pole , the noonday sun , and the rising and setting points of the sun and moon on the horizon .
A year after completion of the project the final correspondence arrived in Elberton from R. C. Christian and the group responsible for the guidestones .
So far no one knows who this mysterious group is or why they felt compelled to erect the Georgia Guidestones and its message for mankind .
Controversy : A California man named John Conner has called for the Guidestones to be removed from public property saying they are an occult monument .
He believes the name " R.C. Christian " is actually a reference to Christian Rosenkreuz , the supposed founder of the Rosicrucians , a secret society dating back to the 15th century .
The Message of the Georgia Guidestones
A message consisting of a set of ten guidelines or principles is engraved on the Georgia Guidestones in eight different languages , one language on each face of the four large upright stones .
Moving clockwise around the monument from due north , these languages are : English , Spanish , Swahili , Hindi , Hebrew , Arabic , Chinese and Russian .
The message in English reads :
Maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature .
Guide reproduction wisely improving fitness and diversity .
Unite humanity with a living new language .
Rule passion , faith , tradition , and all things with tempered reason .
Protect people and nations with fair laws and just courts .
Let all nations rule internally resolving external disputes in a world court .
Avoid petty laws and useless officials .
Balance personal rights with social duties .
Prize truth , beauty , love , seeking harmony with the infinite .
Be not a cancer on the earth .
Leave room for nature .
Leave room for nature .
Balance personal rights with social duties
A shorter message appears on the four vertical surfaces of the capstone , again in a different language and script on each face .
The explanatory tablet near the Guidestones identifies these languages / scripts as Babylonian Cuneiform ( north ) , Classical Greek ( east ) , Sanskrit ( south ) , and Egyptian Hieroglyphics ( west ) , and provides what is presumably an English translation : " Let these be guidestones to an age of reason . "
Explanatory Tablet
A few feet to the west of the monument , an additional granite tablet has been set level with the ground .
This tablet identifies the monument and the languages used on it , lists various facts about the size , weight , and astronomical features of the stones , the date it was erected , and the sponsors of the project .
It also speaks of a time capsule buried under the tablet , but the positions on the stone reserved for filling in the dates on which the capsule was buried and is to be opened are missing , so it is not clear whether the time capsule was ever put in place .
The tablet is with one edge to each of the cardinal directions , and is inscribed such that the northern edge is the " top " of the inscription .
The complete text of the explanatory tablet is detailed below .
The image abive shows the overall layout .
The tablet is somewhat inconsistent with respect to punctuation , and also misspells " pseudonym . "
The original spelling , punctuation and line breaks in the text have been preserved in the transcription that follows .
The text of the tablet is as follows :
At the center of each tablet edge is a letter representing the appropriate compass direction ( N , S , E , W ) , contained within a small circle .
At the top center of the tablet is written :
THE GEORGIA GUIDESTONES
CENTER CLUSTER ERECTED MARCH 22 , 1980
Immediately below this is the outline of a square , inside which is written :
LET THESE BE

- THE $ 50 ROBOT - STEP-BY - STEP ROBOT TUTORIAL
STEP 1 : UNDERSTAND THE ROBOT
Build a quality robot for under $ 50 - on your own !
Motivation
Before we get started , I want to tell you about the motivation behind writing this tutorial .
I remember back when I began building my very first robot .
I had been wanting to build robots for years , since 3rd grade actually .
I was completely fascinated by them .
But unfortunately I never had any outside influence to do this - none .
Not a single person I knew understood what even a resistor was good for , even through highschool !
No one to help me , no one to explain anything , no guidance from teachers , no SoR either !
I bought robot like toys , dabbled with electronics , but did n't have a clue on where to start .
Nature , failed by nurture . . .
Then in my sophomore year in college , I took my first robotics class .
The professor gave us an optional project to build our own robot , and offered money to anyone up to the challenge .
It was my chance !
Still had no idea what I was doing , but I had money to do it !
I immediately started drawing up plans , and began talking with people .
Still clueless , I spoke to two mechanics , a biochemist , a CS prof .
Combined I knew enough to go to Home Depot and buy a bunch of steel beams that I knew somehow magically connected together .
Soon after , I remember walking into the CMU Robotics Club and saying ' I have these steel beams and I want to cut them to size , how do I do it ? '
At first confused by my high level of incompetence , they agreed to show me how to use the bandsaw .
From that point on , if I needed help , I knew where to find it .
Ok so my first robot was a complete failure , but its where I learned all the basics to get me started on my own . . . and the rest is history . . .
The point of that story is that people need just two things to build a robot :
a chance / opportunity
outside guidance
As you have realized , SoR has been the outside guidance people need .
Got a question ?
Post it in the forum .
Need expertise ?
Read the many tutorials .
But what I have n't offered , at least up to now , is an opportunity .
About This Tutorial
What I am offering in this tutorial is an opportunity for you to build your own very first robot , step - by - step , for under $ 50 .
I spent the time to design a robot for you , the beginner , based on three metrics .
The first is simplicity - it has to be something that can be easily done by anyone , where mistakes are hard to make and easy to fix .
The second metric is cost - most people typically cant spend more than $ 50 to $ 100 on projects like this .
The robot kits you can buy , at least the good ones , all cost more than $ 100 thereby making them very prohibitive to buy .
The last metric is quality .
I can design for you a robot that costs under $ 25 , but it would probably take you 5 x longer to make it , and would be significantly harder for you to understand anything .
I dont want you to be a lemming , I want you to understand , too .
But that 's not all I 'm offering in this tutorial .
I 'm also going to teach you the basic steps to going about designing and building all your future robots .
And I am going to do it in a manner so you can use tools from around your house and the local hardware store .
Serious About Robotics ?
One more thing before we begin .
Ask yourself how serious you are about robots .
Do you just want to just try it out ?
Maybe make something for your child to learn with ?
Perhaps encourage your highschool students in the direction of engineering ?
Or do you want to study it in college ?
Maybe you want robotics to be your professional career ?
If you fall in the latter two categories , you need to stop being cheap .
Seriously , if you want to be a professional , you need to go all out .
Buy yourself some good equipment , make investments in robot parts , do n't cut corners because of cost .
Of course , you do n't need to go out buying $ 5 k laser rangefinders , but do n't spend 10 hours making an accelerometer when you can buy one for $ 10 .
If you are a serious builder , build / buy your robot parts under the assumption they will be scraped for robots in the future .
Beginners often spend between $ 100 - $ 400 for their first 2 or 3 robots , while experts spend about $ 0 - $ 40 for their robots .
Why is this ?
Its because they made the long - term investment .
If you are going to build robots the rest of your life , spend for the long term .
The investment will pay for itself .
In all honesty , you may end up spending $ 150 + for this robot , but if you are willing to make the investment , in the long term it will pay off .
Either way , I will give multiple options throughout the tutorial to match each persons wallet ( or lack of ) .
Speaking of which , are you just too poor to invest ?
If you want to know more about paying for robots , read my robot funding tutorial .
And just so you know , I designed this robot in such a way that people who arent serious wont waste money , and those who are serious get good parts to scrap for their next robot .
A quality robot , for under $ 50 . =P
Beginning the Tutorial - Design and Part Selection
As I mentioned , I will teach you the process of making a robot , as you make it .
The very first step anyone would make would be to design your robot .
Interestingly this is where beginners fail .
Beginners spend 90 % of their time building , and 10 % designing .
Experts are the opposite - 90 % designing and 10 % building .
Of course when you are a beginner its hard to design - you dont always know what works until you try it .
But planning never hurts .
A good example of planning a robot would be the CAD work I did for my sumo robot , Stampy :
Typically the design phase is an iterative process / cycle between design and part selection , meaning the designer juggles between the design he would like , and the affordable parts available on the market .
The designer will keep redesigning until both reach a harmony - often a long and tedious task .
There have been several times where I spent a week designing a circuit , only to find out a key chip I need has been sold out and no longer exists !
It forces me to redesign the whole darn thing .
Pain !
But lucky for you , I designed this robot using highly available , easily replaceable components .
For this tutorial you can mostly skip the design / part selection phase , but its still a very important skill you will need to learn .
In the future , if you are looking for robot components , I have written up a robots parts list to save you time .
Parts List
Starting you off , these are the parts you need to purchase .
Buy them right after you read through this tutorial , but before you start building anything .
That way the parts have time to ship while you are building the robot chassis .
Note that some of the parts in the optional list can replace the more expensive parts in the required list .
Also , some members have complained about shipping practices at Digikey.com , so just search for the parts at mouser.com instead if you feel you may have a problem .

Part costs may change due to market factors .
Last price update Dec 2008 . . . prices go up with inflation so at some point it 'll be over $ 50 for sure !
Although not necessary , I posted the datasheets of all parts ( 4 mb ) for more information .
If you live in Britain , a generous user has suggested this parts list to save you money in shipping .
Thanks Paula !
And if you live in Australia , Smash has suggested this parts list .
Tools / Misc List
Ok so to be honest , you will probably have to spend more than $ 50 on your robot .
This robot was designed to use parts you are likely to have around your house , or that can be borrowed from friends or school . . . but if you like live in a box , and do n't have friends or something , you might have issues finding these items .
wires
screws
four 1.5V batteries ( rechargeable NiMH are best )
cardboard
waterbottle
two rubber bands
chopsticks / popsicle sticks
scotch / duct tape
serial port on your computer
if no serial port , get a usb to serial adaptor cable
sharp scissors
soldering iron
solder roll ( 22 to 25 gauge )
multimeter ( not required , but good to have )
safety goggles ( you only have two eyes )
If you cant find any of these items , your local hardware store will have them .
Remember , if you are serious about robotics , make an investment in good tools and equipment .
What Kind of Robot Are We Going to Build ?
In one sentence : we are going to build a differential drive robot , using the photovore algorithm , with photoresistors , capable of basic object avoidance .
This means your robot can run around your house without running into objects such as furniture and your cat . . . preferably just the furniture . . .
Please read those tutorials before continuing , as they can give you a fundamental knowledge of what we will do in this tutorial series .
The Balance - Mechanics , Electronics , and Software
You have probably noticed how I often divide robotics up into these three separate categories - such as I do in the forum .
This is because making robots involves three independent skills .
Only combined , can you make a functioning robot .
When a robot designer makes a robot , he has to account for all three in the design phase so that each falls into balance .
But for this tutorial , I will do one at a time to make it easier for you to understand .
First will be mechanics where we build the robot , then electronics where we hook up the brains and sensors , and finally software will be written to program the robot .
Now that you are ready to start making your very first robot ,
continue on to Step 2 : Build Your Robot Chassis >>>.
This picture almost landed a 12 - year - old girl in jail !
Child Nearly Arrested for ' Unlawful Photography '
WJHL TV 11 ( July 11 , 2008 ) reported that Johnson County deputy Starling McCloud arrested Scott Conover for " unlawful photography . "
To quote the press , " the cell phone photographer says the arrest was intimidation , but the deputy says he feared for his life . "
They ( WJHL ) failed to mention other facts in the case .
This was not a mere traffic stop .
There 's no such law about taking a picture of a cop on a public street .
The cop claimed Conover had a laser pointer , but it was only the picture he wanted that was taken on an IPhone , which has no such thing as a laser pointer .
When Conover tossed the IPhone to his 12 year - old daughter and she took a picture of McCloud , he threatened the child with arrest too .
Another blogger Carlos Miller filled in the missing details .
Scott Conover was from Key Largo , Florida and moved to Johnson County five years ago .
He did n't stand for the intimidation and disregard for the Constitution that some Tennessee Counties such as Sullivan and Johnson engage in and had been in fights with the Johnson County sheriff before .
Conover witnessed deputies as they " beat the shit " out of a man in front of his bar .
He acted as a witness for the victim , and they demanded to know why he was involved .
That cost the county an undisclosed amount in a closed settlement .
According to Conover , " They were wolf - packing my customers .
They would lie and wait for them to leave and then pull them over to see if they had been drinking . "
He was suing them over this tactic and it was in front of his bar ( Jammers Rocking Road House ) where the so - called " traffic stop " occurred .
Conover rolled down the window and said , " Hey fellas , I 'm just getting your picture . "
He snapped the picture , then Deputy McCloud ( on the force only 18 months ) went crazy .
Keep that in mind , now here is the rest of the news report .
" Here 's a guy who takes me out of the car and arrests me in front of my kids .
For what ?
To take a picture of a police officer ? " said Scott Conover .
A Johnson County sheriff 's deputy arrested Scott Conover for unlawful photography .
" He says you took a picture of me .
It 's illegal to take a picture of a law enforcement officer . " said Conover .
" This is a public highway . "
The deputy also asked Conover to delete the picture three times .
" He said if you do n't give it to me , you 're going to jail , " said Conover .
Under the advice of the Johnson County attorney , the sheriff would not comment and the arresting deputy said he did n't want to incriminate himself by talking to us ... the deputy said he saw something black with a red light which he thought was a threat .
Conover was also arrested for pointing a laser at a law enforcement officer ...
In a witness statement by a Mountain City officer , it says the deputy asked about the picture rather than looking for a laser ...
Update : Carlos Miller says , " I talked to Scott Conover this morning and he said they delayed his court appearance to Sept. 3rd , which sounds familiar because they kept doing the same thing in my case .
( I was arrested last year for photographing cops against their wishes ) .
In my case , I took it as a sign that they were hoping the delay would cause the media interest to die down . "
Conover was n't the only person targeted by this nonsense it seems .
Let 's keep it in the news .
View the police report here ( pdf file ) that has nothing to do with any laser pointer and McCloud only demanded the picture be deleted .

My friends at MM made me this clip .
I did n't have a chance to make it , but it 's shocking .
And Newt Gingrich wants to run for president ladies and gentlemen .
This is an issue that America isknown for .
It 's called " FREEDOM . "
And it should be fought vigorously .
Freedoms have never come easy in America .
Women could n't even vote until the 1920's and we all know about the civil rights movement .
Country Fair :
On the November 14 edition of Fox News '
The O'Reilly Factor , in reference to actions by individual protesters of Proposition 8 , the recently passed California ballot initiative amending the state constitution to ban same - sex marriage , Fox News contributor Newt Gingrich stated
O'REILLY : OK , now , the culture war .
I know you 've been flying around the country , and you 're doing stuff .
In the last three or four days , this is really nasty stuff .
I mean , you know , hyper -- we 're gonna show you some of the video .
A woman getting a cross smashed out of her hand .
We had a church in Michigan invaded by gay activists .
We 're gonna show you the video on Monday of that -- we have exclusively .
We had a guy in Sacramento fired from his job .
We had boycotts called on restaurants .
I mean , it is getting out of control , very few days after the election .
How do you assess that ?
GINGRICH : Look , I think there is a gay and secular fascism in this country that wants to impose its will on the rest of us , is prepared to use violence , to use harassment .
I think it is prepared to use the government if it can get control of it .
I think that it is a very dangerous threat to anybody who believes in traditional religion .
And I think if you believe in historic Christianity , you have to confront the fact .
And , frank -- for that matter , if you believe in the historic version of Islam or the historic version of Judaism , you have to confront the reality that these secular extremists are determined to impose on you acceptance of a series of values that are antithetical , they 're the opposite , of what you 're taught in Sunday school .
Gingrich thinks gay marriage is a very dangerous threat to traditional religion .
Can he tell me how they are dangerous ?
Just because he does n't believe in it does n't mean it will hurt anyone .
This is ignorance .
The right needs an issue to motivate their base , but this lack of freedom for the gay community actually hurts their lives on a daily basis where as in the religious community it hurts no one .
Are they honestly afraid that their kids will go gay or something ?
I know what James Dobson thinks :
They want to destroy the institution of marriage .
It will destroy marriage .
It will destroy the Earth . "
That is pure lunacy as we know .
All gays want to do is part of that institution and have the same rights as all Americans do .
The frog that breaks its own legs and grows claws .
The beetle that sprays a jet of boiling fluid at predators .
The fish that engulfs its enemy in a thick casing of slime .
The ant that explodes .
These are just a few of the incredibly unusual ways animals have evolved to defend themselves against predators .
If you enjoyed learning about the strangest endangered animals on earth , be prepared for even more oddities with this list of strange animal defense mechanisms .
Do n't say you were n't warned .
Malaysian exploding ant
( Image via cafeguaguau )
You know Malaysian ants – always exploding all over themselves , ruining the fun .
All kidding aside , it 's really true .
Malaysian ants internally combust under threat , causing their bodies to explode ( they wait until their enemies are close enough to die before detonating ) .
Camponotus saundersi soldier ants have large glands full of poison inside their bodies .
When they sense a threat , they contract their abs , causing the glands on either side of their bodies to explode and spray poison .
Sea cucumber
( Images via reefseekers )
The sea cucumber can literally take on different body states – from hard to liquid – in order to defend itself .
From wikipedia : " Like other echinoderms the cuke has a type of collagen in its skin capable of excreting or absorbing more water effectively changing from a ' liquid ' to a ' solid . '
They can turn their bodies into mush , climb through small cracks and then solidify into small lumps so that they can not be extracted . "
Even more amazing than effectively scattering yourself into pieces of your collective whole and then reassembling : the ability to turn yourself inside out so that your digestive tract 's toxic juices poison your enemies .
Yeah , the sea cucumber can do that , too .
Do not mess .
Hagfish
( Images via NOAA )
The Pacific Ocean Hagfish has a disgusting way of defending itself .
When under attack , it oozes a suffocating slime from its many pores that envelops its predator in a fatal mass of fibrous goo .
The hagfish , unfortunately , sometimes falls prey to its own defense mechanism , but normally it twists itself into knots to escape the gelatinous goop .
Hairy frog
( Images via New Scientist )
The hairy frog or " horror frog " intentionally breaks its own bones to turn out a wicked set of cat - like claws .
Like Wolverwine , only slimy and a lot more terrifying because it's a freaking frog .
Scientists do n't know if the claw is able to retract once it pierces through the skin .
According to New Scientist : " Trichobatrachus robustus actively breaks its own bones to produce claws that puncture their way out of the frog 's toe pads , probably when it is threatened . "
Also , it is apparently hairy .
This does n't stop Cameroon locals from spearing and roasting hairy frogs as a tasty snack .
Bombardier beetle
Oh , there 's nothing like a pulsating jet of foul boiling anal fluid to say " Howdy , neighbor ! "
The bombardier beetle may look innocent enough , but it is famous for being able to spray boiling hot and chemically toxic bodily fluids in the direction of any would - be predator .
The bombardier beetle does n't exactly melt in your mouth ( but it will melt you ) .
Horned lizard
( Image via salamandarcandy )
The horned lizard is a seemingly normal looking lizard found in the southwest region of the United States .
It does n't use its horns to defend itself , as you might expect .
Rather , when attacked , it pressures its own sinus cavities until the blood vessels in its eyes burst , and it sprays its attacker with blood from its eyes .
Skunk
The skunk , or polecat , is actually an attractive little mammal and some people keep them as pets ( sans glands , of course ) .
Skunks are omnivores but will turn to trash and carrion when no fresh insects or honeybees , their favorite food , are available .
Though their amazing musk can be smelled miles away , their vision is exceptionally weak , and most skunks can only see about 10 feet in front of them .
As a result , many are run over – half of all skunk deaths , in fact , are due to humans .
All Mustelidae family members ( like weasels and ferrets ) can spray musk , but skunks are famously the most potent .
The skunk 's anal musk is so powerful that if sprayed directly , the victim will experience temporary blindness .
Opossum
( Image via animalphotos )
The cute little opossum has a number of tricks up its defensive sleeve .
It can play dead .
It can foam at the mouth in an attempt to convince its predators that it is toxic , sick or perhaps just bat sh*t insane .
It can also emit a green anal fluid that smells nearly as bad as a skunk 's offensive spray ( though mercifully it can easily be washed off ) .
Opossums playing dead actually slip into a semi- comatose state , thus removing any excitement of the kill for a predator .
Potato beetle
( Image via NCSU )
Like our little friend the komodo dragon , potato beetle babies ( larvae ) cover themselves in their own poop to avoid being eaten .
Unlike baby komodos , the potato beetle 's feces are actually poisonous to predators .
Smelly but effective !
Black turnout , cont'd
More huge numbers from Florida : " More than one in five early voters -- 22 percent -- was black , though blacks account for just over 13 percent of the electorate . "
And a North Carolina pollster thinks the African - American vote is likely to tip his state , and others :
I am much more confident that there will be a large increase in black turnout than I am that there will be a large increase in youth turnout , but the same truism applies to black voters : there will be a major movement toward the Democrats with them whether there 's a large increase in turnout or not .
Take North Carolina as the biggest example .
The 2004 exit poll showed John Kerry winning black voters in the state 85 - 15 .
A private poll we conducted statewide over the last few days showed Barack Obama winning them 95 - 5 .
That may not sound like a huge difference , but look at it this way .
Kerry won them by 70 .
Obama 's winning them by 90 .
Let 's conservatively put black turnout at 20 % .
A 20 % improvement with 20 % of the population is worth an extra four points for Obama statewide .
That 's a huge deal .

John McCain greets enthusiastic supporters Monday in Indianapolis .
The sad campaign of John McCain
As his campaign rattles to an end , John McCain has never been better on the stump .
Not a natural orator , McCain finally has found his voice .
“ Stand up !
Stand up !
Stand up and fight ! ” McCain thundered Monday in Blountville , Tenn .
“ We never give up !
We never quit !
We never hide from history ; we make history ! ”
Advertisement
And he will make history Tuesday night .
He will enter the history books either as having pulled off one of the greatest upsets in modern political history or for having run one of its worst campaigns .
As of now , he appears to be heading for the latter .
Let ’s take a look just at some recent examples .
How about that Dick Cheney endorsement Saturday ?
Was n’t that a brilliant move with just three days to go in the race ?
Here is John McCain struggling to demonstrate to the voters that his election will not represent four more years of the George W. Bush administration , and so who does McCain ’s campaign trot out ?
The leading architect of the George W. Bush administration !
You would have a hard time finding a less popular national political figure in America today than Dick Cheney .
His approval rating is around 18 .
And that is 18 people , not 18 percent .
( OK , OK , I am kidding .
But an 18 percent approval rating is pretty awful . )
In September , the McCain campaign artfully avoided having Cheney and Bush show up at the Republican National Convention by basically canceling the first day of the convention , allegedly because of concerns over Hurricane Gustav .
It was a pretty nifty move — which the campaign has now undone by wheeling out Cheney .
And did the McCain campaign really think Barack Obama would miss the opportunity to exploit it ?
The Obama campaign immediately put up an ad attacking the endorsement , and Obama mocked it from the stump .
“ Yesterday , Dick Cheney came out of his undisclosed location and hit the campaign trail , ” Obama said .
“ That endorsement did n’t come easy .
Sen. McCain had to vote 90 percent of the time with George Bush and Dick Cheney to get it . ”
So what is the defense for Cheney ’s thoroughly unnecessary high - profile endorsement of McCain ?
( Cheney , after all , had already announced his support for McCain . )
Well , it was supposed to energize the base .
But have n’t we heard that one before ?
Was n’t the selection of Sarah Palin supposed to energize the base ?
The trouble with this strategy is not just that part of the Republican base has recoiled from Sarah Palin but that the Republican base has never been smaller .
McCain ’s great strength as a candidate was supposed to be his ability to reach beyond the base and get swing voters .
Does Palin help with that ?
Does Cheney ?
But wait .
There is also Joe the Plumber .
Joe the Plumber — real name : Samuel Joseph Wurzelbacher — has become the embodiment of the McCain campaign , its central image .
The McCain campaign has Joe the Plumber tours and Joe the Plumber rallies and an “ I am Joe the Plumber ” commercial .
Not content , however , to be a symbol of middle - class anxiety over Barack Obama ( which is what he is supposed to be , I guess ) , Wurzelbacher decided to show off his own foreign policy credentials .
At a rally in Ohio last week , a McCain supporter in the crowd asked Wurzelbacher if he agreed that “ a vote for Obama is a vote for the death of Israel . ”
Wurzelbacher replied : “ I ’ll go ahead and agree with you on that . ”
When asked later on Fox News to explain his extraordinary statement , Wurzelbacher demurred .
“ You do n’t want my opinion on foreign policy , ” he said .
“ I know just enough about foreign policy to probably be dangerous . ”
Probably ?
And then there was “ Saturday Night Live ” over the weekend .
I admire John McCain for appearing on the show so close to Election Day .
And he did show a flash of the old , easygoing , likable John McCain from 2000 .
But I thought the evening turned out to be more poignant than funny .
I winced during the sketch when Tina Fey , impersonating Sarah Palin , joked that the McCain campaign was hopeless .
“ OK , listen up , everybody , I am goin ’ rogue right now , so keep your voices down , ” Fey / Palin said .
“ Available now , we got a buncha these ‘ Palin in 2012 ’ T - shirts .
Just try and wait until after Tuesday to wear ’em , OK ? ”
John McCain — the real one — was standing a few feet away and gamely went on with the show , coming back to do a bit about how he might adopt some new strategies to save his campaign .
One , he said , was the “ sad grandpa ” strategy .
“ That ’s where I get on TV and go , ‘ C’mon , Obama ’s gonna have plenty of chances to be president !
It ’s my turn !
Vote for me ! ’” McCain said .
In the final days of this campaign , John McCain has indeed found his voice .
Sometimes tough , sometimes appealing ... and sometimes sad .
A reader writes :
Obama was addressed as " Barack " by McCain zero times ( by Schieffer once ) .
McCain was address as " John " by Obama seven times .
Another adds :
On last names the situation seems to be reversed - Obama said " McCain " 26 times , and McCain said " Obama " 41 times .
But this is mostly when towards the end McCain kept criticizing Obama 's record .

Like millions of Americans who invested their retirement accounts in the stock market , I was relieved that the mere suggestion of a governmental bailout of $ 85 billion for the insurance giant AIG reversed the market arrow up for two days .
Relief turned to despair the next two trading sessions , however , until Washington bureaucrats promised another $ 700 billion for the financial industry in general , leading to another couple of happy trading days and sleep - filled nights .
When the plan was scuttled the market crashed again , until it was finally passed , at which point I thought we were headed for greener pastures .
Alas , it ’s been red - filled days on the iPhone stock ticker ever since .
( And all of this market anguish and elation happened before Congress approved the allocation of even a single dollar .
That ’s the mind of the market for you — it is as much psychology as economics . )
But then it dawned on me : since when is the government in the business of protecting corporations from self - inflicted high - risk losses ?
The whole point of capitalism is risk taking to make a profit .
Low risk taking typically results in slow and steady growth , whereas high risk taking historically produces both high profits and steep losses .
By entering the business of risk protection , the government is sending a clear signal to the market : do n’t worry about taking big risks with your own and investors ’ money ; we ’ll bail you out .
In profits we ’re capitalists , in losses we ’re socialists .
Welcome to the Welfare Queens of Wall Street .
This is corporate welfare , and once the $ 700 billion are allocated every employee of all the corporations receiving our money will be on the dole .
( Do n’t believe the caveats that this is a one - time fix for a once - in - a - lifetime catastrophe — precedence is everything in government handouts , and nearly every government program began as an emergency fix . )
The CEOs and COOs of AIG and all the other Wall Street financial giants in receipt of this corporate welfare will be welfare queens .
And like the welfare queens during the reform movement of the 1990s , they should all be put on a very public welfare - to - work program in which their salaries ( I recommend that they be paid minimum wage to start ) are tethered directly to the amount of money paid back — with interest — to the people who earned the money in the first place ( us taxpayers ) .
The corporate leaders could be even be featured in a new Fortune 500 list , ranked by how much of our money they have returned .
Contrast the Bernanke / Bush plan with the actions of billionaire investor Warren Buffet , who put his money where the bureaucrat ’s mouth is by committing $ 5 billion of his company ’s assets in Goldman Sachs stocks .
This investment gave the company ’s stock a bump of nearly 20 percent in three days of trading , and boosted investor confidence in the market as a whole .
This is different from what the feds did in two important ways .
One , the $ 5 billion is Buffet ’s property and as such he can do whatever he wants with it .
Two , we are confident that one of the greatest investors in history is basing his risk assessment on sound fiscal reasoning .
Contrast this with Ben Bernanke ’s comments to Congress , in which he called the $ 700 billion “ not an expenditure , it is an acquisition of assets . ”
No it is n’t .
You cannot acquire assets with other people ’s money that you ’ve confiscated without their permission .
That ’s called theft .
When Warren Buffet invested in Goldman Sachs he was doing so in order to make a profit for his company .
That ’s called investment .
It is fully moral because it is his money and his risk .
You can voluntarily join Buffet in the risk by purchasing stocks in Goldman Sachs ( or any of Buffet ’s other corporate holdings ) , but Warren Buffet will never compel you to contribute to his holdings .
A short lesson in economic civics : the primary job of government is to protect our private property from being plundered by foreign powers and domestic criminals ( through the military and the police respectively ) , to resolve disputes over property ( through the courts ) , and to protect our civil liberties ( another form of property ) by enforcing the Constitution and Bill of Rights ( through legislation ) .
The government does not produce property , so in order to pay for these services ( military , police , courts , legislature ) it taxes us .
According to the Oxford English Dictionary , a tax is “ a compulsory contribution to the support of government ” .
A “ compulsory contribution ” is an oxymoron .
It is compulsory confiscation , and we are all about to have $ 700 billion confiscated from us .
For what ?
For protection from foreign plunder or domestic crimes against our property ?
No .
For resolving property disputes ?
No .
For defending our Constitutional rights and civil liberties .
No .
For covering the losses of corporations suffering from taking undue risks ?
Yes .
So , we are all about to have $ 700 billion confiscated from us in order to buy homes and mortgages ( and the financial instruments tied to them ) that are so worthless that even our most stable and endowed financial institutions could not retain their value .
At least Bernanke recognizes the risk , as he told Congress : “ That does expose the taxpayer to significant risk , there ’s no question about it . ”
Behavioral economists have demonstrated experimentally and experientially that humans are normally very risk averse .
Specifically , the research shows that losses hurt twice as much as gains feel good .
That is , in order to get someone to invest their hard - earned money you have to convince them that the potential gains are twice as much as the possible losses .
Why did n’t risk aversion work in the housing industry ?
Two reasons : short term thinking and reduced risk signals .
First , potential home buyers and investors mistakenly assumed that the increasing trend line in housing prices would continue unabated indefinitely .
Two , loan officers and their financial institutions intentionally and deceptively reduced the normal risk signals sent to potential customers in hopes that the artificial bubble would not burst .
It did , and here we are .
Like everyone else , my emotional brain would love it if the government bailout program drives the market back up and my retirement account recovers .
But that ’s just greed and short - term thinking on my part .
My rational brain knows that such a bailout program sends the wrong risk signals to the market .
Why ?
Because the government is not in the business of risk management because only the people who produce the wealth can properly assess how best to risk it in future investments .
The Buffets of the world can do that .
The Bernankes of the world cannot .
Cloud computing is yet another name for services that have existed for a really long time .
Here ’s the 2008 IEEE Internet Computing quote regarding Cloud Computing :
“ Cloud Computing is a paradigm in which information is permanently stored in servers on the Internet and cached temporarily on clients that include desktops , entertainment centers , table computers , notebooks , and wall computers , handhelds , sensors , monitors . ”
Information stored on servers ?
Temporary caching ?
Holy fuck .
You mean like those email servers and clients I ’ve been running for 15 YEARS ?
The innovation in cloud computing happened years ago .
It happened when some bright engineer was trying , for the 185th time , to draw the Internet on a slide , and thought , It ’s this big , huge , amorphous thing that lacks definition .
It ’s a… cloud .
That ’s when the magic happened .
That ’s when the name mattered .
When it was first used to eloquently and visually describe an idea that lacked mental definition .
Everything that has been happening since then is marketing and wishful thinking .
It ’s those marketing nerds getting paid too much money to rename ideas we ’ve already had .
Innovation does n’t come when we give our ideas new names ; it comes when the fundamental idea quietly evolves .
Innovation often happens silently — not by what you say , but what you do .
Anywhere .
Transparently .
My use case for the cloud has n’t changed in years .
I want a single folder sitting somewhere in the cloud that I can transparently access from any computer … anywhere .
I ’m not greedy ; I ’ll make it even simpler : I ’ll only put documents in that folder .
No applications , no preferences , just my well - defined documents .
I ’ve been trying creatively - named solutions to this use case for a decade .
This is how my technology investigations play out :
Discover
Install
Configure the bits
Give the solution a whirl three times
Never use it again .
Fact is , getting me to change my information workflow is pretty hard .
I ’m a creature of habit and efficiency .
While I will compulsively give any new idea or tool a try , an application or service needs to fulfill strict requirements .
Just to grab me , you have to :
Make it look and feel like magic .
Work flawlessly in the first 10 minutes .
If you ca n’t survive 10 minutes of critical analysis , I ’m gone .
Provide additional , unexpected awesomeness .
Like I said , it ’s tough , and chances are that even if an application meets all of these requirements , I ’m going to throw it out because I do n’t trust it .
I trust Dropbox .
Here ’s why .
Dumb versus Smart
There are two approaches to cloud storage : dumb and smart .
A dumb cloud does just what you ’d expect .
You attach an external drive or you mount a network directory .
It ’s there .
It does nothing unless you remember to manually copy stuff yourself .
A smart cloud combines the external storage with a scheme to do your copying or back - up for you .
The idea is that as you change files locally , these changes are detected and sent off to the cloud .
Sounds simple enough , right ?
Brace yourself .
Remember my use case : a single folder sitting somewhere in the cloud that I can transparently access from any computer … anywhere .
The key word in that sentence is transparent , and a tool ’s inability to be transparent is why applications in this space have been a study in failure .
I ’ll explain .
The fail begins with you and your two computers : a portable and a desktop machine .
You edit one file on your desktop machine .
Fine , the bits get sent to the cloud .
Then , you make a different change on the SAME file on your portable , which is NOT on the network .
Two hours later , you bring that portable onto the network and what happens ?
You ’ve got two different versions of that file which both contain original work .
Whatever cloud sync tool you are using will likely ask you : “ Hey , both of these files have changed .
This one was edited this morning and this one was edited two hours later .
Which one do you want to keep ? ”
It ’s a fair question .
Sync is trying to be useful , sync is trying to be helpful , but sync is giving you a choice , and while you are generally good at choices , you will screw up .
And when you do you will never , ever blame yourself , you will blame sync .
You will twitter : SYNC FUCKING OVERWROTE MY CHANGES , when all sync was doing was what it was told .
See , sync will happily screw you if instructed to do so .
By you .
Even though it ’s my fault , data loss is a colossal disaster in my universe and that means once I figure out data was overwritten , I will not cease my irrational swearing until whatever tool responsible is completely eradicated from my system .
Yet , it is my fault .
I chose a solution that was too smart .
What I need is for my smart clouds to be dumb .
Dumbing it down with Dropbox
There is nothing new about the idea behind Dropbox .
Even the name shows little in terms of innovation .
Before I explain how Dropbox gained my trust by solving the sync problem , let ’s talk about how it grabbed me .
Is it magic ?
After a simple install and easy account sign - up on the Mac , you end up with a new menu extra .
Choosing ‘ Open your Dropbox ’ reveals the directory structure of your Dropbox and you ’re off .
Doing what ?
I do n’t know — whatever it is you do .
Folders and files thrown into the Dropbox folder are silently synced with the cloud .
On the Mac , unless you look closely , it ’s not even clear what ’s going on .
I had to fire up my portable and set up Dropbox on a second machine to confirm that it was actually doing anything .
The magic of Dropbox is that it does n’t ask you to think about what you do .
You care about one thing : do I have access to the most recent version of my files ?
And with Dropbox , yes , you do .
Wherever you are , so are your files .
A flawless 10 minutes .
Once I convinced myself that Dropbox was actually doing something , I pushed it .
I dumped a large Keynote into Dropbox on one machine and then jumped to another machine and deleted a different file .
How long until everything was reconciled ?
It was n’t instant , the Keynote copy was limited by bandwidth , but it worked flawlessly .
And besides , you do n’t need instant access to your files because you ca n’t be in two places at once .
What you want is to never be bothered by the fact that your files are in the cloud .
Dropbox is designed to never get in your way … even when you do something stupid .
More on this is in a second .
Unexpected awesomeness .
While it was n’t in my first 10 minutes , the unexpected awesomeness came when a friend asked for a presentation that was n’t mail server - friendly .
He emailed me a link to a shared Dropbox folder , and when I clicked on it , the folder was immediately integrated with my existing Dropbox hierarchy .
That ’s right , I can construct a complex shared hierarchy in the cloud and you know what that complex collaborative beast looked like ?
My familiar directory structure .
It ’s these types of design decisions where trust begins .
Trust begins when I can see the design intention of an application .
What in NetNewsWire , for example , is the end result of endless fretting over every design angle regarding reading feeds .
What I expect is that when I ’m stumped , its author , Brent Simmons , has not only thought about why I ’m stumped , he ’s already provided the right feature configured in precisely the right manner to circumvent my stumpedness .
When I use Microsoft Word , I see corporate intent .
I see how different warring internal groups tugged the UI to and fro for a decade .
I see the intern who did that one feature four years ago .
I see a land of misfit toys in the features that have n’t been touched in years .
When I ’m using Word , I keeping seeing Word , and I do n’t see what I should be seeing , which is what I am writing .
When I ’m using Dropbox , I do n’t even know that I ’m using it because it is designed be transparent .
The Screw - Me Scenario
How does Dropbox solve the screw - me sync scenario ?
To date , Dropbox has n’t said a thing to me .
It has n’t given me a single decision to screw up .
Dropbox is very smart because it never asks you a thing about sync or any file operation .
This is the brilliance : Dropbox knows that any question is a chance to make a wrong decision .
And a chance to make a wrong decision is a chance to erode trust .
Yes , you can create the conflict scenario .
When it occurs , Dropbox quietly creates a conflict file in your folder and lets you figure out what to do .
See , Dropbox is n’t going to ask because that ’s not the model .
That ’s not the design .
The Dropbox flow is : “ We ’re not going to bother you with sync because we ’re just keeping track of you changing stuff and your stuff is only changing when you change it and there is only one of you .
If there ’s a problem , you ’ll figure it out when you ’re good and ready ” .
It ’s not elegant ; I still have to eventually go and clean up the mess , but the more you trust a tool , the less you care about the edge cases .
Dropbox is not dumb .
In fact , Dropbox is quite smart because it lets me be dumb .
And I ’m dumb .
Two weeks ago , I sat down to put the final touches on a presentation .
I fired up the portable , looked in the usual Dropbox location and it was empty .
Ok , well , I saved it to my desktop , right ?
Ok , no .
Maybe another location inside Dropbox ?
Ok , no .
I can taste it ’s - deleted - forever adrenalin in the back my mouth now .
Spotlight reveals nothing and I ’m starting to blame Dropbox now , so I fire up their web interface , where I discover they keep track of each discrete file operation , and it looks like last night I deleted the presentation in a fit of psychotic folder cleanliness .
But here in the Dropbox web interface is every single version of the file that I saved , as well as the ability to restore them .
Click .
Restore .
And I ’m saved .
And that ’s smart .
“ My center is giving way .
My right is in retreat .
Situation excellent .
I attack ! ”
That ’s the message supposedly sent by General Ferdinand Foch of France to his commanding general , Joseph Joffre , during the crucial First Battle of the Marne in September 1914 .
The French and British counterattacks succeeded .
The German Army , after advancing for a month , was forced back .
Here in the U.S. , after more than a month of Democratic advances , it ’s the Republican center that ’s giving way , and some on the political right who are in retreat .
The Obama campaign is marching toward the biggest nonincumbent Democratic presidential victory since 1932 , and the Democratic Party is fighting its way toward its best overall presidential and Congressional year since 1964 .
Situation not - so - excellent .
Time for McCain to attack  or , rather , finally to make his case .
The heart of that case has to be this : reminding voters that when they elect a president , they ’re not just electing a super - Treasury secretary or a higher - level head of Health and Human Services .
They ’re electing a commander in chief in time of war .
The McCain campaign intends , I gather , to return to the commander in chief theme with an event in Florida Wednesday showcasing former secretaries of state and retired senior military officers .
But why not showcase young Iraq vets instead ?
These young soldiers and marines can testify eloquently to the success of the surge that John McCain championed , and to the disaster and dishonor that would have followed Barack Obama ’s preferred path of withdrawal .

Today , social media marketing is the most powerful way of building brand and relationships on the Internet .
Its impact will diminish as everyone jumps on the bandwagon , but for now it 's the biggest show in town .
With focus and persistence it could revolutionize your personal and business brands .
To demonstrate just how powerful it can be , read the article in the International Herald Tribune , that that !
Here are a few valuable exerts from the article , with my comments ( in bold ) about the lessons that you and I can learn :
In February of 2007 , a friend telephoned Marc Andreessen , the founder of Netscape and a board member of Facebook , and asked if he wanted to meet with a young man with an idea that sounded preposterous on its face .
Social media marketing ( SMM ) is big news for internet entrepreneurs .
If you want to learn what SMMa look at ' The Essential Social Media Marketing Guide ' Today , social media marketing ismost powerful way of building brand and relationships on the Internet .
Its impact will diminish as everyone jumps on the bandwagon , but forit 's the biggest show in town .
With focus andit could revolutionize your personal and business brands .
To demonstrate just how powerful it can be , read the article in the International Herald Tribune , " Electoral triumph built on a Web revolution " by David Carr .
It describes how Barack Obama used social media marketing as the foundation of his campaign strategy , which resulted in him winning the presidential election .
Results do n't come much biggerthat !
Always game for something new , Andreessen headed out to the San Francisco airport late one night to hear the guy out .
A junior member of a large powerful organization with a thin , but impressive résumé , he was about to take on far more powerful forces in a battle for leadership .
He wondered if the power of social networking , with its tremendous communication capabilities and aggressive database development , might help him beat the overwhelming odds facing him .
" It was like a guy in a garage who was thinking of taking on the biggest names in the business , " Andreessen recalled .
" What he was doing should n't have been possible , but we see a lot of that out here and then something clicks .
He was clearly supersmart and very entrepreneurial , a person who saw the world and the status quo as malleable . "
And as it turned out , Barack Obama , now president - elect , was right .
Barack Obama himself embraced the Internet and social media marketing .
It was this personal committment that made the campaign so successful .
As an entrepreneur , you have to lead your social media activity .
You can't leave it to marketing .
Like a lot of Web innovators , the Obama campaign did not invent anything completely new .
Instead , by bolting together social - networking applications under the banner of a movement , they created an unforeseen force to raise money , organize locally , fight smear campaigns and get out the vote that helped them topple the Clinton machine and then the Republicans .
Adopting social media marketing is easy ; everything you need is available , much of it for free .
The key to success is how you use those tools .
As a result , when he arrives at the White House , Obama will have not just a political base , but a database , millions of names of supporters who can be engaged almost instantly .
And there 's every reason to believe that he will use the network not just to campaign , but to govern .
His e-mail to supporters on Tuesday night included the line , " We have a lot of work to do to get our country back on track , and I 'll be in touch soon about what comes next . "
The real advantage of social media marketing is it builds long term loyalty ; it 's not just a one - off , one - way pushed message , like advertising .
It should be an ongoing conversation , with both parties listening and contributing .
The Bush campaign arrived at the White House with a conviction that it would continue a conservative revolution with the help of Karl Rove 's voter lists , phone banks and direct mail .
But those tools were crude and expensive compared with what the Obama camp is bringing to the Oval Office .
Social media marketing tools are so cost effective and powerful , when used correctly , they can drown out the messages pumped out through traditional media channels , even if millions of dollars have been spent .
" I think it is very significant that he was the first post - boomer candidate for president , " Andreessen said .
" Other politicians I have met with are always impressed by the Web and surprised by what it could do , but their interest sort of ended in how much money you could raise .
He was the first politician I dealt with who understood that the technology was a given and that it could be used in new ways . "
This is an important point .
If you think of social media marketing as just another way of promoting your services and generating sales you will fail .
Social media is about building relationships which are mutually beneficial .
Sales and making money will be the result of building trust .
The juxtaposition of a networked , open - source campaign and a historically imperial office will have profound implications and raise significant questions .
Special - interest groups and lobbyists will now contend with an environment of transparency and a president that owes them nothing .
The news media will now be contending with an administration that can take its case directly to its base without even booking time on the networks .
Again this is an important point .
Today , every online entrepreneur is beholden to Google .
If Google decides not to index your site for any reason , there is a good chance your business will fail .
Social media marketing reduces this risk by putting you directly in contact with your audience , cutting Google and the other search engines out of the loop .
More profoundly , while many people think that Obama is a gift to the Democratic Party , he could actually hasten its demise .
Political parties supply brand , ground troops , money and relationships , all things that Obama already owns .
And his relationships are not the just traditional ties of Democrats - teachers ' unions , party faithful and Hollywood moneybags - but a network of supporters who used a distributed model of phone banking to organize and get out the vote , helped raise a record - breaking $ 600 million , and created all manner of media that was viewed millions of times .
It was an online movement that begat offline behavior , including producing youth voter turnout that may have supplied the margin of victory .
Many large organisations are learning about the power of social media marketing the painful way .
Individual bloggers , ' twitterers ' and networkers can make share prices plummet with a single post .
Why ?
Because they have an audience who trust their opinion more than they trust the propaganda pumped out by most corporate communications departments .
Apple be warned !
" Thomas Jefferson used newspapers to win the presidency , FDR used radio to change the way he governed , JFK was the first president to understand television , and Howard Dean saw the value of the Web for raising money , " said Ranjit Mathoda , a lawyer and money manager who blogs at Mathoda.com .
" But Senator Barack Obama understood that you could use the Web to lower the cost of building a political brand , create a sense of connection and engagement , and dispense with the command - and - control method of governing to allow people to self - organize to do the work . "
This sums it up .
People who understand social media can build brand , business and multiple revenue streams for a fraction of the cost of using traditional media .
All of the Obama supporters who traded their personal data for a ticket to a rally or an e-mail alert about the vice presidential choice , or opted in on Facebook or MyBarackObama , can now be mass e-mailed at a cost close to zero .
And instead of the constant polling that has been a motor of presidential governance , an Obama White House can use the Web to measure voter attitudes .
All successful online businesses are built on relationships and trust .
The only way to build trust is to be in regular contact with your audience , and email remains the best way to do this .
" When you think about it , a campaign is a start - up business , " Mathoda said .
" Other than his speech in 2004 at the convention and his two books , Obama had very little in terms of brand to begin with and he was up against Senator Clinton , who had all the traditional sources of power , and then Senator McCain .
But he had the right people and the right idea to take them on .
When you think about it , it was like he was going up against Google and Yahoo .
And he won . "
Amen !
Power to the entreprenuer !
There is tremendous power in opening up citizen access to government - think of how much good will and support Mayor Michael Bloomberg garnered by coming up with 311 , a one - stop phone number for New Yorkers who had a problem .
Obama 's 20 - month - long conversation with the electorate is entering a new phase .
There is sense of ownership , a kind of possessive entitlement , on the part of the people who worked to elect him .
The shorthand for his organizing Web site , " MyBo , " says it all .
" People will continue to expect a conversation , a two - way relationship that is a give and take , " said Thomas Gensemer , managing partner of Blue State Digital , the folks who helped conceive and implement Obama 's digital outreach .
" People who were part of the campaign will opt in to political or governing tracks and those relationships will continue in some form . "
The founders of America wanted a government that reflected its citizens but would be at remove from the baser impulses of the mob .
The mob , flush with victory , is at hand , but instead of pitchforks and lanterns they have broadband and YouTube .
Like every other presidency , the Obama administration will have its battles with the media , but that may seem like patty - cake if it runs afoul of the self - publishing , self - organizing democracy it helped create - say , by delaying health care legislation or breaking a promise on taxes .
That 's the thing about pipes today : they run both ways .
" It 's clear there has been a dramatic shift , " said Andrew Rasiej , the founder of the Personal Democracy Forum , an annual conference about the intersection between politics and technology .
" Any politician who fails to recognize that we are in a post - party era with a new political ecology in which connecting like minds and forming a movement is so much easier will not be around long . "
This final point is a stark warning .
Once you start down the social media marketing route , you are public property .
You and your organisation will be expected to listen AND ACT when your followers call for change .
If you do n't , they may turn against you .
The web is a fickle world .
There are individuals who no - one had heard of two years ago , who can move markets with a single comment .
On the other side of the coin there are entrepreneurs and businesses that have been destroyed because they did not understand the power of the crowd .
Conclusion
This is a great article because it provides a case study of just how powerful social media marketing can be .
I recommend you take the time to learn about this subject and start using it to build your personal and business brand .
Just remember :
You are what you publish , so think carefully before you click ' submit '
SMM is about a two way conversation so listen and interact
Focus on building a relationship with your audience , not on promoting or selling something
SMM is about building a long term loyal following .
Do n't think of it as a marketing campaign
Do n't be afraid of social media , but do be aware of the possible consquences of becoming visible on the internet
In August 2002 , the Mojahedin-e Khalq ( MEK ) , an armed Iranian opposition group listed by the State Department as a terrorist organization but supported by the neoconservatives within and without the Pentagon , provided the first concrete evidence of the existence of Iran ’s uranium enrichment facility in Natanz .
In February 2003 , Iran formally declared the existence of the facility to the International Atomic Energy Agency .
Since then , Iran ’s nuclear facilities and program have undergone the most intrusive and time - consuming inspections in the history of the IAEA , including from October 2003 - February 2006 , when Iran voluntarily implemented the provisions of the Additional Protocol of its Safeguards ( SG ) Agreement with the IAEA , which it had signed but not ratified .
Despite the intrusive inspections and intense propaganda , which consisted mostly of lies , exaggerations , half - truths , and dire predictions by the neoconservatives , the War Party , and the Israel Lobby , the IAEA could identify only a few breaches of Iran ’s SG Agreement  none serious  and what ultimately turned out to be non-issues altogether .
According to Iran ’s SG Agreement , a breach happens when Iran
Iran has acknowledged breaching its SG Agreement by failing to report to the Agency the following activities :
2
In addition , there were certain other contentious issues between Iran and the IAEA that turned to be non-issues :
The past and current administration of Iran ’s Gechin uranium mine and mill ( near Bandar Abbas in southern Iran ) .
The IAEA was concerned about secret use of uranium from the mine by Iran ’s military .
Procurement of certain equipment , with potential nuclear applications , and their use by researchers at Sharif University of Technology , one of Iran ’s top universities .
The source of nuclear contamination at a physics research laboratory in Lavisan - Shian near Tehran .
The procurement activities of the former head of the same physics research laboratory .
The IAEA was concerned that he had been used as a cover for clandestine nuclear activities .
Iran ’s possession of a 15 - page document that described the procedures for converting UF 6 into uranium metal and casting and machining enriched uranium metal into hemispheres , suitable for a nuclear weapon .
So , though it may seem that Iran was in deep trouble with the IAEA , it certainly was not .
The Iranians turned out to be more truthful than George Bush , Dick Cheney , and the neocons .
In its Feb. 22 , 2008 , report to the Board of Governors of the IAEA , the Agency declared satisfactory resolution of all the above issues and non-issues .
For example , Iran had contended that the 15 - page document had been provided by A. Q. Khan with the design for the P1 centrifuges in 1987 , as a sweetener for future deals , without Iran asking for it .
After checking with Pakistan , the IAEA confirmed Iran ’s contention .
Regarding the contamination issue , which the neocons and the Israel Lobby had declared as the missing “ smoking gun , ” the IAEA environmental sampling and tests confirmed Iran ’s explanation that they had been brought into the country by the imported centrifuge parts .
The IAEA declared that its analysis “ tends , on balance , to support Iran ’s statement . ”
Documents From the Stolen Laptop
Given the February 2008 report , it would have been reasonable to expect that Iran ’s case before the Board of Governors , and even the United Nations Security Council , would be closed .
Absolutely not !
The U.S. and its European allies have no intention of letting Iran off the hook , even when they have nothing to press it with .
It has been a pattern that each time the IAEA declares its satisfaction with Iran ’s explanations for any issue , new allegations and questions are raised , and Iran ’s response to them is declared “ urgent ” and its timing a “ defining moment . ”
This time was no exception .
After declaring its satisfaction with all the above issues and non-issues , Olli Heinonen , the IAEA ’s deputy director general of safeguards  a man who has a reputation inconsistent with impartiality and objectivity  presented a briefing to the Board of Governors in Vienna in which he presented a dark view of Iran ’s nuclear program under the guise of “ Agency Evaluation , ” as if his employer had not just declared its satisfaction with the resolution of many issues that , up until then , had been considered “ crucial ” and “ critical . ”
In fact , there are persistent rumors about tension between Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei , the IAEA ’s director - general , and his SG experts .
Heinonen spoke about three supposedly secret projects : Project 5 for converting UO 2 to “ green salt ” ( so named due to its color and smell ) or uranium tetrafluoride ( UF 4 ) , an intermediate compound in the conversion of uranium ore to gaseous UF 6 ; Projects 110 and 111 for the design of device and re-entry vehicle for a missile ; and Project 3.12 for testing high - power explosives .
They were supposedly led by Dr. Mohsen Fakhrizadeh , a 40 - year - old physicist , not a nuclear engineer as has been reported in the West , who received his Ph.D. from Shiraz University in southern Iran and works openly in physics research institutes in Tehran .
The same type of accusations was repeated in the IAEA ’s reports presented to the Board of Governors on May 26 , 2008 , and Sept. 15 , 2008 .
What was the source of the new “ information ” and “ data ” that Heinonen was talking about ?
A laptop that had been purportedly stolen in Iran , taken out of the country , and made available to Western intelligence agencies in Turkey .
Iran ’s MEK has been given credit for the theft .
But the existence of the laptop has been known since 2004 .
The first time there was any indirect reference to it was on Nov. 17 , 2004 , when , in a conversation with reporters , then - U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell briefly referred to “ new , missile - related ” intelligence on Iran .
Shortly thereafter , articles were published in the Washington Post , the Wall Street Journal , and the New York Times about the laptop they claimed contained the “ smoking gun ” for Iran ’s ( nonexistent ) nuclear weapon program .
Journalist Gareth Porter cited reports that the laptop had been given to the MEK by Israel .
My own information indicates that , because the MEK is completely discredited in Iran , Israel ’s first preference was for the laptop to be publicized by Iran ’s monarchist opposition groups ( which are supported by Iranian Jews in the U.S. and Europe ) , but that they had refused to go along ( some of the most senior statesmen among the Iranian monarchists actually support Iran ’s nuclear program ) .
In July 2005 , the Bush administration began exerting pressure on the United Nations to take action against Iran and , as part of its concerted efforts , it briefed Dr. ElBaradei on the contents of the laptop on July 18 .
But then the U.S. stopped pressing the issue .
Most experts have cast doubt on the authenticity of the laptop ’s documents .
A senior European diplomat was quoted by the New York Times ‘ William J. Broad and David E. Sanger in a Nov. 13 , 2005 , article as saying , “ I can fabricate that data .
It looks beautiful , but is open to doubt . ”
Another European official said , “ Yeah , so what ?
How do you know what you ’re shown on a slide is true , given past experience ? ”
A senior intelligence official was quoted as saying , “ It ’s easy to fall into the trap of thinking that beautiful pictures represent reality , but that may not be the case . ”
Another U.S. official was quoted as saying , “ Even with the best intelligence , you always ask yourself , ‘ was this prepared for my eyes ? ' ” Julian Borger of the Guardian quoted an IAEA official as saying “ there is some doubt over the provenance of the computer . ”
Commenting on the New York Times article , David Albright of the Institute for Science and International Security in Washington said that “ the information [ in the laptop ’s documents ] actually describes a reentry vehicle for a missile .
This distinction is not minor .
The information does not contain any words such as nuclear or nuclear warhead .
The ‘ black box ’ carried by the reentry vehicle may appear to be a nuclear warhead , but the documents do not state what the warhead is . ”
In other words , even if the documents are authentic , they do not prove anything about the existence of a secret nuclear weapon program in Iran .
The New York Times refused to publish Albright ’s rebuttal of the claims made in the article by Broad and Sanger .
Aside from the above experts ’ opinions , there are many reasons to believe that the documents are not authentic .
Anyone with even rudimentary knowledge of how the Iranian political establishment works knows that often even the most harmless documents are classified as “ top secret . ”
Yet none of the documents had been designated as such .
As Borger of the Guardian reported , all the documents are in English , without any Persian notes .
That is odd for a country where the official language is Persian , and many do not know much English .
Why had the documents not been translated ?
If the documents include exchanges between various officials , then anyone with even elementary knowledge of the workings of the Iranian bureaucracy knows that , once a document is received by some official , he writes ( in Persian ) in the margins in his own hand “ received , ” and signs and dates it .
Do the documents have such notes ?
Why would the documents name the projects ’ leader , Dr. Fakhrizadeh ?
Iran has had experience with the murder of prominent people in its missile program .
In July 2001 , Col. Ali Mahmoudi Mimand , known as the father of Iran ’s missile program , was found dead in his office .
After the laptop was supposedly smuggled out of Iran , Dr. Ardeshir Hassanpour , a prominent and award - winning figure in Iran ’s nuclear program , was murdered on Jan. 15 , 2007 .
Stratfor.com reported that Israel ’s Mossad had murdered Dr. Hassanpour .
We also know that a large number of Iraqi nuclear scientists have either disappeared or been killed .
Why does a man like Dr. Fakhrizadeh , who supposedly knows so much of Iran ’s secrets , work and appear in public so freely ?
Why could Iran not hide such documents ?
This is a nation that could hide the development of its extensive uranium enrichment program for 18 years .
Iran is also a nation with a thousand - year culture of writing in coded language .
Why would such sensitive documents be put on a laptop ?
Even then , why was the laptop not at a secure place with very tight control , given the degree of secrecy that the Iranian government applies to all of its affairs ?
Iran ’s Ministry of Intelligence ( MI ) is known in the Middle East as a ruthless and extremely efficient organization .
If the laptop with all the sensitive documents had been stolen , its absence should have been noticed almost immediately .
In that case , Iran ’s MI should have been able to at least trace back the events in order to identify the person who stole the laptop .
There has never been a report in Iran about the discovery of such a spy .
If the documents were authentic , then , given that some time after the laptop had been stolen , the Iranian officials knew that they would be confronted with the documents , they should have been able to prepare reasonable and plausible explanations for the documents .
After all , as noticed above , Iran provided satisfactory answers to all the issues and non-issues listed above .
Yet Iran ’s only response so far has been that the documents are forgeries .
Some of the documents describe and discuss issues that can be found in the open literature .
Some others have to do with Iran ’s conventional arms industry , which Iran has readily admitted and talked about .
Therefore , it would be easy to copy such documents , or create some based on the available information .
Why would Iran have a separate project for the green salt when it has openly , and under the IAEA ’s Safeguards , established the uranium conversion facility in Isfahan that produces the same uranium compounds ?
Even if some of the documents are authentic , how do we know that , for example , they are not just indicative of Iran ’s efforts for its missile program ?
If the documents contain such devastating information , why did the U.S. and its allies wait four years to confront Iran ?
After all , the documents seem to provide the long - missing “ smoking gun . ”
In fact , at first the U.S. made much noise about the laptop , and asked for and convened an emergency meeting of the Board of Governors of the IAEA in January 2006 .
But then it stopped crying “ wolf . ”
The contention is that the laptop was stolen by a member of the MEK .
However , it is practically impossible for the MEK to be able to penetrate the Iranian government at such a sensitive level .
After the MEK started its armed opposition to the Islamic Republic in June 1981 and assassinated many top government officials , its member were ruthlessly eliminated from all levels of Iran ’s bureaucracy .
Digital Chain of Custody
Although very difficult , if not impossible , one might argue that one can find plausible answers to the above questions .
However , one crucial piece of information about the laptop and its contents can shed definitive light on the authenticity of the documents .
This is the documents ’ digital chain of custody , which has not been discussed or mentioned .
It is defined as “ An account documenting data at a particular place and time . ”
It is a technique by which one can trace back electronically stored documents on a computer to their original source  the electronic source from which they were copied , or when and how the documents were uploaded electronically , etc .
If done in a forensically sound manner , it will generate a digital fingerprint .
Then , a credible forensic test can reveal when or how different versions of the documents were created .
Therefore , it should not be difficult to analyze the digital chain of custody of the laptop ’s documents , in order to better understand their original source .
That would settle at once the question of the documents ’ authenticity .
Iran has asked to see the laptop in order to analyze it , but the IAEA has responded that its source does not allow that .
Dr. ElBaradei has said repeatedly that the IAEA is bound to “ follow due process , which means I need to establish the veracity , consistency , and authenticity of any intelligence , and share it with the country of concern . ”
But once again , in Iran ’s case this established procedure has not been followed .
Iran has not even been presented with an analysis of the digital chain of custody of the documents , indicating their authenticity .
Yet it is being pressed to respond to charges of doubtful legitimacy .

This action is vital because even believed the
A Scottsdale - based developer and his contractor have reached an " unprecedented " settlement with the federal government over claims they violated the Clean Water Act by bulldozing , filling and diverting a 5 - mile stretch of the Santa Cruz River and its tributaries , the U.S. Justice Department said Tuesday .
The $ 1.25 million penalty against George H. Johnson and his associates is one of the largest settlements ever obtained by the Environmental Protection Agency under the section of the Clean Water
Act that protects against the unauthorized filling of federally protected waterways , officials said .
The settlement , known as a consent decree , is expected to be finalized by the courts after a 30 - day comment period .
Johnson and his partners reached a record $ 12.1 million settlement with the state in a parallel case less than a year ago .
Johnson 's representatives declined to comment on the settlement Tuesday other than to say that they would adhere to the terms of the agreement .
The federal complaint , filed in 2004 , alleged that Johnson and his companies - Johnson International Inc. and General Hunt Properties Inc. - as well as contractor 3 - F Contracting Inc. , razed and filled an extensive stretch of the lower Santa Cruz and the Los Robles Wash while clearing land for a development in Pinal County near Red Rock .
They did not obtain the necessary permits from the Army Corps of Engineers and altered the course of the Santa Cruz , said Alexis Strauss , director of the EPA 's Water Division for the Pacific Southwest Region .
' Very rich landscape '
The land , prior to those activities , had supported a variety of vegetation , including one of the few extensive mesquite forests in Arizona 's Sonoran Desert , the government said .
He said the area was a " very rich landscape with important habitat , beautifully braided streams . . . in such a pristine state . "
" And all of a sudden , it looked like a big - box parking lot , " Strauss said .
" To have it bulldozed in such a way was really a concern . "
A spokesman for Johnson declined to comment Tuesday on the state 's allegations or the specifics of the settlement .
" It 's important to note that George Johnson and any of the entities related to George Johnson have not admitted to liability or fault , " said Garry Hays , a spokesman for Johnson International .
" We will abide by the terms and conditions of the consent decree . "
The Justice Department said Tuesday that the case shows that it is serious about enforcing federal environmental rules .
" A seven - figure penalty in this type of enforcement case is virtually unprecedented , " said Ronald J. Tenpas , assistant attorney general for the Justice Department 's Environment and Natural Resources Division .
" It underscores the Justice Department 's commitment to enforce the nation 's laws that protect valuable water resources in Arizona and other arid western states and to hold violators of those laws accountable . "
Settlement with state
In December , Johnson and his partners agreed to pay more than $ 12 million to settle a similar case with state officials .
The alleged violations in that case involved land razing for the same project .
The state 's suit alleged that in 2003 and 2004 , Johnson 's companies and contractors cleared land on two ranches near Red Rock to make way for the community , which would have included 67,000 homes , a resort , golf courses and businesses .
Along the way , workers bulldozed state - trust land , demolished Hohokam archaeological sites and destroyed saguaros and other native vegetation , the state said .
The suit also included claims that Johnson brought in domestic goats that wandered into federal land and infected dozens of bighorn sheep with a disease .
More recently , Johnson has been working to reach an agreement with the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality on how to clean up a polluted wash near Queen Creek .
His company Johnson Utilities , a privately owned utility , recently came to terms with department officials on a disinfection plan for the area .
A backup at a wastewater - treatment plant resulted in the release of thousands of gallons of raw sewage .
No fines have been levied in that case .
There have been several Russian attempts to cultivate eggs from frozen mammoths that look so perfectly preserved in ice .
But the perfection is deceiving since the DNA is always degraded and no viable cells remain .
Even a genome - based approach would have been judged entirely impossible a few years ago and is far from reality even now .

Still , several technical barriers have fallen in surprising ways .
One barrier was that ancient DNA is always shredded into tiny pieces , seemingly impossible to analyze .
But a new generation of DNA decoding machines use tiny pieces as their starting point .
Dr. Schuster ’s laboratory has two , known as 454 machines , each of which costs $ 500,000 .
Another problem has been that ancient DNA in bone , the usual source , is heavily contaminated with bacterial DNA .
Dr. Schuster has found that hair is a much purer source of the host ’s DNA , with the keratin serving to seal it in and largely exclude bacteria .
A third issue is that the DNA of living cells can be modified only very laboriously and usually at one site at a time .
Dr. Schuster said he had been in discussion with George Church , a well - known genome technologist at Harvard Medical School , about a new method Dr. Church has invented for modifying some 50,000 genomic sites at a time .
The method has not yet been published , and until other scientists can assess it they are likely to view genome engineering on such a scale as being implausible .
Rudolph Jaenisch , a biologist at the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge , said the proposal to resurrect a mammoth was “ a wishful - thinking experiment with no realistic chance for success . ”
Dr. Church , however , said that there had recently been enormous technical improvements in decoding genomes and that he expected similar improvements in genome engineering .
In his new method , some 50,000 corrective DNA sequences are injected into a cell at one time .
In the laboratory , the cell would then be grown and tested and its descendants subjected to further rounds of DNA modification until judged close enough to that of the ancient species .
In the case of resurrecting the mammoth , Dr. Church said , the process would begin by taking a skin cell from an elephant and converting it to the embryonic state with a method developed last year by Dr. Shinya Yamanaka for reprogramming cells .
Asked if the mammoth project might indeed happen , Dr. Church said that “ there is some enthusiasm for it , ” although making zoos better did not outrank fixing the energy crisis on his priority list .
Temperature Of Held Objects Influences Behavior
Free will is an illusion .
Even a cup of coffee manipulates you in ways you can't tell .
Even a cold or hot cup of coffee temporarily held in a person 's hands can act like a puppeteer manipulating human emotions and behavior .
In the first study , Williams and John A. Bargh , a psychology professor at Yale University , found that holding a hot cup of coffee leads people to judge a stranger to be a warmer person , in terms of such traits as generosity and kindness , compared with a group of people who held a cup of iced coffee .
In a second study , they had people hold either a warm or cold object ( therapeutic hot or cold pads ) , and then gave them a choice of reward for participating in the study : either a gift for a friend , or a reward for themselves .
" We found that people who held the hot pad were more likely to choose the gift for a friend , and people who held the cold pack were more likely to choose the reward for themselves , " Williams said .
" Both of these effects occurred without people 's awareness of the possible effects of temperature . "
Hand a friend something hot to hold before you ask for a favor .
" We found that people who held the hot pad were more likely to choose the gift for a friend , and people who held the cold pack were more likely to choose the reward for themselves , " Williams said .
" Both of these effects occurred without people 's awareness of the possible effects of temperature . "
People are incredibly sensitive to cues in their physical environments , Williams said .
" The metaphorical relationship between physical temperatures and interpersonal warm or cold feelings is not haphazard or accidental , but reveals something interesting about the way the mind works , in that a cue from the physical domain can have such a meaningful impact on psychological outcomes , " he said .
Never mind that old saying " cold hands , warm heart " .
The truth of the matter is " cold hands , cold heart " .
In a similar study , Williams repeated the same experiment using not coffee , but hot and cold compress pads .
To eliminate any inadvertent influence on the experiment by the confederate , the study subjects were asked to retrieve either a hot or cold pad and to evaluate it under the guise of a product test .
After rating the effectiveness of the pads , the study subjects were given a choice of reward for participating in the study : either a Snapple beverage or a $ 1 gift certificate to a local ice cream shop .
In some cases the reward offer was framed as a gift to " treat a friend " and in others as a personal reward .
Regardless of which gift was offered , those primed with coldness were more likely to choose a gift for themselves , while those primed with warmth were more likely to choose the gift for a friend .
" Experiences of physical temperature per se affect one 's impressions of and pro-social behavior toward other people , without one 's awareness of such influences , " said Williams .
" At a board meeting , for instance , being willing to reach out and touch another human being , to shake their hand , those experiences do matter although we may not always be aware of them .
In a restaurant , it 's been shown that wait staff who touch customers usually get a better tip .
It 's a nice gesture , but it also has a warming effect . "
Williams said the research could have marketing implications because it shows just how strong the bond is between the physical and the psychological world .
" In a point - of - service or communications interaction , paying attention to the fact that customers are tied to the physical world in which buying behavior occurs is important , " said Williams .
" If you are running a promotion outdoors on a cold day , maybe giving away a warm cookie will help you make connections with consumers .
It gives marketers and managers more tools to work with . "
Scientists will find many more ways that environmental cues can alter human behavior .

Data from the Ulysses mission show that the Sun has reduced its output of solar wind to the lowest levels since we 've had readings and it could reduce the natural shielding that envelops our Solar System .
The Sun 's solar wind plasma is a stream of charged particles that are ejected from the upper atmosphere of the Sun .
The solar wind interacts with every planetary body in our Solar System .
It even defines the border between our Solar System and interstellar space .
This border , called the heliopause , is a bubble - shaped boundary surrounding our Solar System where the solar wind 's strength is no longer great enough to push back the wind originating from other stars .
The region around the heliopause also acts as a shield for our Solar System , warding off a significant portion of the cosmic rays outside the galaxy .

" The Sun ’s 1.5 million km - per - hour solar wind inflates a protective bubble around the Solar System and can influence how things work here on Earth and even out at the boundary of our Solar System , where it meets the galaxy , " said Dave McComas , Principal Investigator for the Ulysses solar wind instrument and senior Executive Director at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio , Texas .
" Ulysses data indicate the solar wind ’s global pressure is the lowest we have seen since the beginning of the space age . "
" Galactic cosmic rays carry with them radiation from other parts of our galaxy , " said Ed Smith , NASA 's Ulysses Project Scientist from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California , USA .
" With the solar wind at an all - time low , there is an excellent chance that the heliosphere will diminish in size and strength .
If that occurs , more galactic cosmic rays will make it into the inner part of our Solar System . "
Galactic cosmic rays are of great interest ; cosmic rays are linked to engineering decisions for unmanned interplanetary spacecraft and exposure limits for astronauts traveling beyond low - Earth orbit .
The heliosphere is the big magnetic bubble in space carved out by the solar wind .
The solar defines the border between our Solar System and interstellar space .
This border , called the heliopause , is where the solar wind 's strength is no longer great enough to push back the wind originating from other stars .
The region around the heliopause also acts as a shield for our Solar System , warding off a significant portion of the cosmic rays outside the galaxy .
Latest data from Ulysses show that the Sun has reduced its output of solar wind to the lowest levels since accurate readings have become available .
This current state of the Sun could reduce the natural shielding that envelops our Solar System .

In 2007 , Ulysses executed its third scan of the solar wind and magnetic field from the Sun ’s south to the north pole .
When the results were compared with Ulysses observations from the previous cycle , the strength of the solar wind pressure and the radial component of the magnetic field embedded in the solar wind were found to have decreased by 20 % .
The field strength near the spacecraft has decreased by 36 % .

The Grenada Chocolate Company was founded in 1999 by Mott Green ( born David Friedman ) , Doug Browne and Edmond Brown who had the idea of creating an Organic Cocoa Farmers ’ and Chocolate - Makers ’ Cooperative .
This radical new business model created the first “ Tree to Bar ” chocolate this century , adding all the value to the local economy in the village of Hermitage , St Patricks .
Mott Green often said “ It takes a whole village to make a bar of our chocolate ” ; the factory produces high quality organic dark chocolate in Grenada using the world famous Trinitario cocoa beans that grow right on their own doorstep .
The chocolate factory is nestled in lush cocoa groves in Grenada ’s pristine rainforest .
The internationally award - winning organic dark chocolate has the wonderful complex flavour of Grenada ’s fine - flavored organic cocoa beans , processed carefully in small batches .
Producing chocolate right where the cocoa grows allows the co-operative to do its own fermenting which gives a real advantage in creating the finest , most complex phenolic profile from the beans .
The other important factor is that fresh beans are used to make the chocolate rather than ones that have been shipped half way around the world and might be months or even years old .
The GCC extracts its own cocoa butter from the same cocoa to add to the chocolate recipes , using unique presses designed by Mott and Doug .
This gives the chocolate a luxurious extra richness to add to its deep intense fruity flavour .
The co-operative now has over 200 acres of organic cocoa farms which was formed with the objective of ensuring that the farmers would be fairly rewarded for their hard work .
The GCC pays 1EC$ ( 65 % ) per lb more for the beans than the local price and in many of the farms of the co-operative is also involved in the management of the land as well as the planting , growing and harvesting of the cocoa .
The cocoa is grown totally naturally without the use of any chemical pesticides , herbicides or fertilizers and has been Certified Organic by CERES .
The minimal amount of sugar used is a fine organic raw sugar produced and milled by an organic growers ’ co-operative in Brazil .
Whole organic vanilla beans grown bio-dynamically in Costa Rica provide our “ dash ” of vanilla .
Organic soy lecithin is used as an emulsifier in extremely small amounts , because they have found that without this addition it is almost impossible to make small batch chocolate successfully in the humidity of the tropics .
The GCC is one of very few small - scale chocolate - makers producing fine chocolate where the cocoa grows .
Because small batch chocolate - making is extremely rare , the GCC had to create many of their own processing methods , designing specialist small scale machines and refurbishing antique equipment to meet the requirements of their unique situation .
Most of the machines were designed in the early 1900 ’s , harking back to a time when quality had precedence over quantity in the world of chocolate - making .
Sustainability is at the core of the GCC ’s values , so many of the machines were reconfigured to be powered by solar - electric energy .
The original impetus and principle of the co-operative company was to revolutionize the cocoa-chocolate system that typically keeps cocoa production separate from chocolate - making and therefore takes advantage of cocoa farmers .
The GCC believes that the cocoa farmers should benefit as much as the chocolate - makers .
Awards
Bonbon Chocolates
In 20 ?? the GCC opened its own factory outlet store called Bonbon Chocolates where they produce a wide variety of delicious chocolates right on - site , using only local ingredients combining the wonderful dark chocolate with the many fruits , nuts and spices of Grenada .
This charming small shop is located a few yards from our factory .
We stock a collection of Bonbons that are pure , delicious , natural and healthy so it ’s well worth the trek up into the rain forest to track down this little gem .
Postscript
Doug Browne died from cancer in November 2008
Mott Green died in an electrical accident in June 2013
Edmond Brown is the sole surviving founder , and continues to be responsible for making chocolate every day .

Google is profiting from millions of typo- squatting websites that earn advertising from Google 's Adsense advertising program , Harvard University professor Ben Edelman says .
In a report published Monday , Edelman says Google profits from typo - squatting websites that run ads using Google 's Adsense — which , ironically , are often bought by the owners of the legitimate sites web surfers were trying to visit .
" This is one of the unsavory ways we all end up paying Google , " Edelman says in an interview .
" Users do n't have to write Google a check to receive Google 's services .
But , one way or another , Google manages to get users ' money . "
Typo-squatting sites are found at domains that have one letter different from legitimate , trademarked domains — bankofdamerica.com , for instance , as depicted in the screenshot above , which has a " d " in the URL .
Typo-squatting has been around since the beginning of the web , but until recently , typo - squatters had limited means of profiting from surfers ' bad spelling or clumsy typing .
But using Google 's Adsense for Domains ( AFD ) program , typo - squatters fill their sites with sponsored links that often point to the legitimate domain .
If a misdirected surfer hits a sponsored link , the legitimate domain owner ends up paying the typo - squatter for that referral , and Google as well .
The typo-squatter Bankofdamerica.com , for example , has a sponsored link to the real Bank of America website .
Typo-squatting , Edelman says , is illegal .
" There sure are a lot of these sites , in the millions , " Edelman said .
" The overall majority show Google ads . "
Google reported net income of $ 1.25 billion for the quarter ending June 30 on revenue of $ 5.37 billion .
Advertising generates about 99 percent of Google 's revenue , according to its financial statement .
Google says in a court filing that it has " no reason to know " whether a domain in its advertising program " could infringe a valid trademark . "
Edelman , an assistant professor at the Harvard Business School and an advisor to McAfee , says there are as many as 80,000 domains " typo- squatting " on the United States ' top 2,000 websites alone , including MySpace , FaceBook and Craigslist .
Edelman 's report , published in the McAfee Security Journal ( .pdf ) , shows that there are as many as 251 typo- squatted domains associated with Bank of America alone , and there are as many as 327 typo- squatted domains feeding off the cartoonnetwork.com site .
Edelman and other lawyers have filed a class action lawsuit representing domain owners who claim the Google Adsense for Domains ( AFD ) program is assisting in violating trademarks .
A hearing is scheduled for as early as next month in which Edelman will ask an Illinois federal judge to allow the case against Google to proceed .
The Mountain View , California , company did not respond for comment on how much revenue is generated via typo -squatting .
But Google attorney Maria Moran says Edelman 's allegations are " misguided , " and that Google is doing nothing illegal because it " merely distributes third - party advertisements . "
Google is immune from liability , she adds .
" Google 's sweeping trademark protection policies provide that Google will immediately remove any allegedly infringing domains from its AFD program at the request of the trademark holder . "
Edelman , however , said Google is attempting to confuse two laws : the Anti-cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act .
The DMCA " safe harbor " provision protects sites from claims that they host copyright infringing material if that material was put there by users and if the sites remove material upon notice from copyright holders .
Google relies on the safe harbor provisions to avoid liability for videos posted on its YouTube site , for example .
But Edelman says Google is wrong to try to invoke a notification safe harbor as a defense to typo - squatting .
" There is no similar safe harbor doctrine as to trademark infringement or typo- squatting , " Edelman says .
The law simply says , " do not typo - squat .
Do not register , traffic in or use infringing domain names or confusingly similar names of trademarks , " Edelman says , referring to the Anti-cybersquatting Çonsumer Protection Act of 1999 .
Google says in response to the lawsuit that it " has no way to know — and no reason to know — whether a given domain in the AFD program could infringe a valid trademark , " Google 's Moran writes .
" And even if Google did somehow have the ability to pluck out those domains which could infringe a valid trademark , Google has no way to know who has registered the domain , be it an infringer , a licensee of the trademark owner or the trademark owner itself . "
Bush ’s impact on the next Republican presidential candidate did not have to be so devastating .
McCain is n’t , as he and his defenders keep protesting , a passive martyr to a catastrophic administration .
He could have made separating himself from Bush the brave , central and even conservative focus of his campaign .
Far from doing that , he embraced the Bush ethos  if not the incredible shrinking man himself  more tightly than ever .
The candidate who believes in “ country first ” decided to put himself first and sell out his principles .
That ignoble decision is what accounts for both the McCain campaign ’s failures and its sleaze .
It ’s a decision McCain made on his own and for which he has yet to assume responsibility .
Though it seems a distant memory now , McCain was a maverick once .
He did defy Bush on serious matters including torture , climate change and the over - the - top tax cuts that bankrupted a government at war and led to the largest income inequality in America since the 1930s .
But it is n’t just his flip - flopping on some of these and other issues that turned him into a Bush acolyte .
The full measure of McCain ’s betrayal of his own integrity cannot even be found in that Senate voting record  90 percent in lockstep with the president  that Obama keeps throwing in his face .
The Bushian ethos that McCain embraced , as codified by Karl Rove , is larger than any particular vote or policy .
Indeed , by definition that ethos is opposed to the entire idea of policy .
The whole point of the Bush - Rove way of doing business is that principles , coherent governance and even ideology must always be sacrificed for political expediency , no matter the cost to the public good .
Like McCain now , Bush campaigned in 2000 as a practical problem - solver who could “ work across the partisan divide , ” as he put it in his first debate with Al Gore .
He had no strong views on any domestic or foreign issue , except taxes and education .
Only after he entered the White House did we learn his sole passion : getting and keeping power .
That imperative , not the country , would always come first .
One journalist who detected this modus operandi early was Ron Suskind , who , writing for Esquire in January 2003 , induced John DiIulio , the disillusioned chief of the White House Office of Faith - Based and Community Initiatives , to tell all .
“ There is no precedent in any modern White House for what is going on in this one : a complete lack of a policy apparatus , ” DiIulio said .
“ What you ’ve got is everything  and I mean everything  being run by the political arm .
It ’s the reign of the Mayberry Machiavellis . ”

If politics strongarm everything , you end up with the rampant cronyism , nonexistent long - term planning and abrupt , partisan policy improvisations that fed the calamities of Iraq , Katrina and the economic meltdown .
Incredibly , McCain has nakedly endorsed the Bush - Rove brand of governance in his own campaign by assembling his personal set of lobbyist cronies and Rove operatives to run it .
They have not only entangled him in a welter of conflicts of interest , but they ’ve furthered cynical political stunts like the elevation of Sarah Palin .
At least Bush and Rove did n’t try to put an unqualified hack like , say , Alberto Gonzales half a heartbeat away from the presidency .
Today 's " Global War on Terrorism " is a modern form of inquisition .
It has all the essential ingredients of the French and Spanish inquisitions .
Going after " Islamic terrorists " , carrying out a Worldwide preemptive war to " protect the Homeland " are used to justify a military agenda .
" The Global War on Terrorism " ( GWOT ) is presented as a " Clash of Civilizations " , a war between competing values and religions , when in reality it is an outright war of conquest , guided by strategic and economic objectives .
The GWOT is the ideological backbone of the American Empire .
It defines US military doctrine , including the preemptive use of nuclear weapons against the " state sponsors " of terrorism .
The preemptive " defensive war " doctrine and the " war on terrorism " against Al Qaeda constitute essential building blocks of America 's National Security Strategy as formulated in early 2002 .
The objective is to present " preemptive military action " -- meaning war as an act of " self - defense " against two categories of enemies , " rogue States " and " Islamic terrorists " , both of which are said to possess weapons of mass destruction .
The logic of the " outside enemy " and the evildoer , allegedly responsible for civilian deaths , prevails over common sense .
In the inner consciousness of Americans , the attacks of September 11 , 2001 justify acts of war and conquest :
" As was demonstrated by the losses on September 11 , 2001 , mass civilian casualties is the specific objective of terrorists and these losses would be exponentially more severe if terrorists acquired and used weapons of mass destruction . "
( National Security Strategy , White House , Washington , 2002 ) America 's Inquisition
The legitimacy of the inquisition is not questioned .
The " Global War on Terrorism " justifies a mammoth defense budget at the expense not only of health and education , but of virtually every single category of public expenditure .
The " Global War on Terrorism " requires " going after " the terrorists , using advanced weapons systems .
It upholds a preemptive religious - like crusade against evil , which serves to obscure the real objectives of military action .
The lies underlying 9/11 are known and documented .
The American people 's acceptance of this crusade against evil is not based on any rational understanding or analysis of the facts .
America 's inquisition is used to extend America 's sphere of influence and justify military intervention , as part of an international campaign against " Islamic terrorists " .
Its ultimate objective , which is never mentioned in press reports , is territorial conquest and control over strategic resources .
The GWOT dogma is enunciated and formulated by Washington 's neoconservative think tanks .
It is carried out by the military - intelligence establishment .
It is embodied in presidential speeches and press conferences :
" We 've been warned there are evil people in this world .
We 've been warned so vividly .
...
And we 'll be alert .
Your government is alert .
The governors and mayors are alert that evil folks still lurk out there .
As I said yesterday , people have declared war on America and they have made a terrible mistake .
...
My administration has a job to do and we 're going to do it .
We will rid the world of the evil - doers , " ( George W. Bush , CNN , September 16 , 2001 ) The objective of the " Global War on Terrorism " launched in September 2001 is to galvanize public support for a Worldwide campaign against heresy .
In the eyes of public opinion , possessing a " just cause " for waging war is central .
A war is said to be Just if it is waged on moral , religious or ethical grounds .
The Demonization of Muslims and the Battle for Oil
The US led war in the broader Middle East Central Asian region consists in gaining control over extensive reserves of oil and natural gas .
The Anglo - American oil giants also seek to gain control over oil and gas pipeline routes out of the region .
( See table and maps below ) .
Muslim countries possess 66 percent of total oil reserves .
( Michel Chossudovsky , The " Demonization " of Muslims and the Battle for Oil , Global Research , Jannuary 4 , 2007 ) .
In contrast , the United States of America has barely 2 percent of total oil reserves .
Iraq has five times more oil than the United States .
Demonization is applied to an enemy , which possesses more than 60 percent of the world 's oil reserves .
" Axis of evil " , " rogue States " , " failed nations " , " Islamic terrorists " : demonization and vilification are the ideological pillars of America 's Inquisition .
They serve as a casus belli for waging the battle for oil .
The Battle for Oil requires the demonization of those who possess the oil .
The enemy is characterized as evil , with a view to justifying military action including the mass killing of civilians .

Historical Origins of the Inquisition
The objective is to sustain the illusion that " America is under attack " by Al Qaeda .
Under the American inquisition , Washington has a self - proclaimed holy mandate to extirpate Islamic fundamentalism and " spread democracy " throughout the world .
" Going after Bin Laden " is part of a consensus .
Fear and insecurity prevail over common sense .
Despite the evidence , the White House , the State Department , the two Party system , cannot , in the minds of Americans , be held responsible for a criminal act ( 9/11 / ) resulting in the deaths of American civilians .
What we are dealing with is an outright and blind acceptance of the structures of power and political authority .
In this regard , the American Inquisition as an ideological construct , is , in many regards , similar to the inquisitorial social order prevailing in France and Spain during the Middle Ages .
The inquisition , which started in France in the 12th century , was used as a justification for conquest and military intervention .
Initially it took the form of a campaign in southern France directed against the Cathars and Waldensians , which challenged the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church .
The Cathar movement was a religious sect which was protected by the regional feudal order in southern France , against the dominion of the Catholic Church and the French monarchy in Paris .
" The Cathars believed they were the true Christians and the Catholic Church was a false church , founded by the devil . "
In the early 13th Century , " Pope Innocent III declared a crusade against the Cathars " at the behest of the French royal family .
The crusade was in fact a war of conquest under the disguise of a campaign against heresy .
The Inquisition directed against heresy was intended to consolidate the Monarchy 's territorial control .
It provided a pretext to intervene militarily in south and southwestern France , using the authority of the Catholic Church as a façade .
The inquisition became part of a political consensus , carried out by the Church 's inquisitors , imposed by the ruling feudal order and supported militarily .
Its purpose was to maintain and sustain the social and political order , extend the powers of the central State , subjugate regional powers in France , using the campaign against heresy as " a justification to wage war " .
Sounds familiar ?
Today 's Inquisitorial Order
Anybody who doubts the legitimacy of the American inquisition ( 9/11 and " Global War on Terrorism " ) is a heretic conspiracy theorist or an accomplice of the terrorists .
The American Inquisition is part of a Bipartisan Consensus .
Both the Democrats and the Republicans support the American Inquisition .
" Going after Osama bin Laden " is part of the election platform of both political parties .
In fact it is the central component of the election campaign :
I [ Barack Obama ] argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11 , and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights ( Barack Obama , Acceptance Speech , National Democratic Convention , Denver , August 2008 )
We have dealt a serious blow to al Qaeda in recent years .
But they are not defeated , and they ’ll strike us again if they can .
( John McCain , Acceptance Speech , Republican National Convention , St Paul , September 2008 )
There is an " outside enemy " .
The Homeland is under attack .
Islamic terrorists " threaten our way of life " .
" We must defend ourselves " preemptively against Osama and his lieutenants .
US Northern Command ( Northcom ) , with headquarters at the Petersen Air Force base in Colorado was established in early 2002 to protect America against a terrorist attack .
It was presented to public opinion as a response to the 9/11 attacks .
The real strategic objectives of Northern Command using sophisticated aero defense weapons including nuclear warheads , are not mentioned .
Political Consensus
The mouthpiece of America 's inquisitorial order is the Western corporate media .
People who question the validity of any of these statements or who have doubts about who is behind the 9/11 attacks , are considered to be accomplices of those who threaten the American Homeland .
In 1232 , Pope Gregory IX set up a system of special religious courts called the inquisition .
The Dominican friars were sent out to find and question heretics :
" Heresy can not be destroyed unless heretics are destroyed and ... their defenders and [ supporters ] are destroyed , and this is effected in two ways : ... they are converted to the true catholic faith , or ... burned .
( Henry Charles Lea , A History of the Inquisition of the Middle Ages , p. 535 , 1887 ) Those who refused to recant , which means give up their heresy , were burned alive .
Today 's Patriot Act , the military courts , the Guantanamo concentration camp , the CIA rendition camps , Abu Ghraib , etc. , are part of an advanced inquisitorial system .
Terrorist suspects are held incommunicado .
They are tortured , tried by military courts and sentenced .
They are not given the right to recant .
The objective is not to " make the World safer " by putting the terrorists behind bars .
The trials of the alleged terrorists perform an important social function .
They sustain the illusion , in the inner consciousness of Americans , that the " Islamic terrorists " constitute a real threat .
The arrests , trials and sentences of " Islamic terrorists " sustain the legitimacy of the American State and its inquisitorial legal and law enforcement apparatus .
The ultimate objective is to convince public opinion that the enemy is real and that the US Adminstration is protecting the lives of its citizens .
Manufacturing Dissent
Washington does not silence its antiwar critics .
Quite the opposite .
The inquisitorial social order allows certain forms of dissent .
It is politically correct under a " democracy " to condemn US foreign policy in the strongest terms .
What is not allowed is to question the inquisition .
Those who oppose the US Administration are not branded as heretics .
Many " Progressives " , Liberals and Antiwar activists , led by prominent intellectuals , firmly believe that Muslims were behind the 9/11 attacks .
" We are against the war , but we support the war on terrorism . "
The New World Order builds a political and media consensus ( i.e. the GWOT ) but at the same time it creates and moulds its own opposition .
It establishes the limits of dissent .
It " manufactures dissent " .
The presidential candidates in the bipartisan race are supported by powerful corporate interests including the oil companies , Wall Street and the defense contractors .
At the same time , these same corporate interests , through their various foundations ( including Ford , Rockefeller , Gates , et al ) , support and finance a number of Liberal / Progressive organizations and alternative media .
9/11 is the cornerstone of the American Inquisition .
The lies underlying 9/11 are accepted by the mainstream antiwar movement .
US foreign policy is condemned , but the " Global War on Terrorism " is upheld .
Wittingly or unwittingly , this endorsement of the GWOT by those who claim to be opposed to the US administration , provides a legitimacy to the inquisitorial order , which underlies the actual practice of US foreign policy .
On the other hand , those who have serious doubts regarding the official 9/11 narrative , including the 9/11 Truth Movement , are branded as heretics and nonbelievers .
The " Just War " theory
The " Just War " theory ( justum bellum ) has a longstanding tradition .
It has been used throughout history to uphold the dominant social order and provide a justification for waging war .
In the case of Afghanistan , 9/11 played a key role in justifying the invasion .
The war on Afghanistan was considered a " Just War " , waged on humanitarina grounds .
On September 12 , 2001 , NATO invoked for the first time in its history " Article 5 of the Washington Treaty - its collective defense clause " declaring the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center ( WTC ) and the Pentagon " to be an attack against all NATO members . "
Afghanistan was tagged , without a shred of evidence and prior to the conduct of an investigation , as the " state sponsor " of the 9/11 attacks .
The invasion of Afghanistan in early October 2001 was presented as a counter - terrorism operation directed against the perpetrators of 9/11 and their state sponsors .
Trade unions , NGOs and many " progressive " intellectuals endorsed the US - NATO led invasion .
The events of 9/11 played a key role in gaining the support of various sectors of American society including the opponents and critics of the Bush adminstration 's foreign policy .
The war on Afghanistan was prepared prior to 9/11 .
War preparations were already in an advanced stage of readiness .
The green light to wage war by the US and NATO on Afghanistan was provided within 24 hours of the 9/11 attacks .
The press reports failed to reveal a fact which is known and acknowledged by military analysts : a major theater war cannot , under any circumstances , be planned and carried out in a matter of 4 - 5 weeks .
9/11 was used as a justification to carry out a " humanitarian war " .
Known to military analysts , the war on Afghanistan had been planned well in advance of the tragic events of September 11 , 2001 .
The Spanish Inquisition
In the 14th and 15th centuries , the Inquisition spread to other parts of Europe .
In Italy , the inquisition went after nationalist movements in regions like Lombardy in the north , Venice , or Sicily .
It was used to suppress these political movements .
In northern France and Germany , the inquisition used the pretext of small mystical sects , to intervene politically and militarily .
Regional powers including local principalities refused to cooperate with the inquisition .
In today 's world , this form of interventionism is carried out by sending in US special forces to " help governments " to combat terrorism .
Spain , conquered by Muslims and in part reconquered by Christians in the 13th Century , was " religiously heterogeneous , and a tolerance had developed so Muslims , Christians , and Jews could live together in relative peace . "
Toward the end of the 15th Century , coinciding with a period of political and territorial consolidation , " Spanish tolerance changed abruptly .
Spain saw the rise of a form of inquisition more ruthless and disruptive than anywhere else in Europe . "
( Bill of Rights in Action )
The Spanish inquisition was also characterized by a process of building a consensus , of going after the heretics and nonbelievers .
The inquisition was used to support the process of territorial consolidation in the Iberian peninsula .
The objective was to reinforce the absolute monarchy and the powers of the landed aristocracy against the Muslim and Jewish merchant classes .
The Spanish Inquisition was executed at the behest of Queen Isabel , Reina Catolica .
In 1483 , The Reyes Catolicos , Isabel de Castilla and Ferdinando de Aragon , established a Council to direct the Inquisition .
Tomas de Torquemada , an advisor to Isabel become the first General Inquisitor .
Torquemado had previously preached against the Jewish and Muslim Converts ( Conversos ) .
The objective was to repress the upcoming merchant classes .
" One country , one ruler , one faith " became the mandate of the General Inquisitor .
The pope upheld the inquisition , the hidden agenda was the feudal order and the Spanish led colonial wars .
The Spanish inquisition lasted for 300 years .
Today in America , the General inquisitor is the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security .
The Legal Apparatus
The inquisition in the Middle Ages would collect accusations :
" If two witnesses under oath accused someone of heresy , the accused person would be summoned to appear .
opinions , prejudices , rumors , and gossip were all accepted as evidence .
the accused was never told the names of the accusers , nor even the exact charges .
Inquisitors examined the accused in secret .
Anyone who refused to confess immediately was assumed to be guilty .
Inquisitors were trained only in religion , and they would try to trap the accused with religious questions .
For example , an inquisitor might ask , " Do you believe what the holy church believes ? "
" I am a faithful Christian , " the fearful suspect might reply .
" So ! " the inquisitor might shout .
" We already know you believe in heresies !
You 're saying your beliefs are the true Christianity and the church is false ! "
( Bill of Rights in Action )
No lawyers were allowed , because it was considered heresy to defend a heretic :
" They would torture those who refused to recant .
During torture , the religious inquisitors would stand by as witnesses to record confessions or take down the names of other heretics .
The government also carried out the final sentence of imprisonment or death .
Those who recanted immediately might receive a fairly light sentence -- saying prayers , fasting , being whipped in public , or making a pilgrimage .
Some who recanted were forced to wear a yellow cross of felt sewn on all their clothing .
The cross marked them as a former heretic , and many people would stay away from them in fear .
Many who refused to recant right away were sentenced to prison for life .
If they refused to recant at all , the Inquisition turned them over to government authorities to be burned alive .
Some inquisitors were so thorough that they went after the dead .
If a dead person was accused of heresy , his or her bones could be dug up and burned .
For most accused heretics , there was no appeal .
A few rich or powerful people might beg the pope to change a sentence , but for most of the condemned , the sentence was final .
The families of those sent to prison or to the stake lost their property .
( Bill of Rights in Action , see also History of the inquisition ) Today 's legal system in America has all the essential features of an inquisitorial order .
Torture is permitted " under certain circumstances " , according to an August 2002 Justice Department " legal opinion " :
" if a government employee were to torture a suspect in captivity , 'he would be doing so in order to prevent further attacks on the United States by the Al Qaeda terrorist network , ' said the memo , from the Justice Department 's office of legal counsel , written in response to a CIA request for legal guidance .
It added that arguments centering on " necessity and self - defense could provide justifications that would eliminate any criminal liability " later .
( See Washington Post , June 7 , 2004 )
" Even if an interrogation method might arguably cross the line drawn in Section and application of the stature was not held to be an unconstitutional infringement of the President 's Commander in Chief authority , we believe that under current circumstances [ the war on terrorism ] certain justification defenses might be available that would potentially eliminate criminal liability . "
( Complete August 2 , 2002 Justice Department Memorandum in pdf )
Torture
" The Spanish Inquisition was particularly terrifying because of its inherent characteristics .
The accused never knew who their accusers were .
Once arrested , the accused heretic 's properties were seized . "
" These properties were then administered at first by the Crown , and later by the General Inquisitor ....
Even if the accused was now a devout Christian , he was tried as severely as possible because of his roots .
The accused was also not allowed to have a lawyer or counsel for his defense , and the names of all witnesses were kept secret from him ( Jason L. Slade , The Spanish Inquisition August 6 , 1996 ) Torture was the order of the day .
The accused were not allowed to have a lawyer .
The torture methods applied by today 's CIA inquisitors bear a canny resemblance to the torture techniques used by the Inquisitors in the Middle Ages , including the water torment or aselli , commonly referred to in CIA jargon as " water boarding " :
" Because the trials were for spiritual matters , the Church handled them .
However , the punishments were usually very much physical , so they were handled by the state .
There were many means of this physical torture for confession .
The two most famous or infamous were the strappado or pulley , and the aselli or water torment .
( Jason L. Slade , The Spanish Inquisition August 6 , 1996 ) Water - boarding then and now
Alfred McCoy reports in the regard that the CIA :
" had often added to their no - touch repertoire physical methods reminiscent of the Inquisition 's trademark tortures -- strappado , question de l'eau , " crippling stork , " and " masks of mockery . "
At the CIA 's center near Kabul in 2002 , for instance , American interrogators forced prisoners " to stand with their hands chained to the ceiling and their feet shackled , " an effect similar to the strappado .
Instead of the Inquisition 's iron - framed " crippling stork " to contort the victim 's body , CIA interrogators made their victims assume similar " stress positions " without any external mechanism , aiming again for the psychological effect of self - induced pain ...
( Alfred McCoy , The Hidden History of CIA Torture : America 's Road to Abu Ghraib , Global Research , December 2004 ) In Spain in the 16th Century , the inquisition was accepted .
It was a consensus .
The population was led to believe that it was a good thing and that torture " served to purify society " .
" A bishop came out and shouted out the names of the condemned .
then the heretics were led out , wearing black robes decorated with red demons and flames .
officials of the government tied them to the stake .
" do you give up your heresy against the holy church ? " a priest would challenge .
anyone who repented would be strangled to death before the fires were lit .
most , however , stood silent or defiant .
the fires were lit , and the square echoed with the screams of the heretics and cheers from the crowd . " ( quoted in Bill of Rights in Action , op cit ) Anybody who dared to question the validity of this " war on terrorism " was himself branded a terrorist and subjected to the anti-terrorist laws , which at the time , in Spain , was death .
In today 's inquisitorial environment , most people are skeptical regarding the official 9/11 narrative , but nobody dares question the validity of the " war on terrorism " .
" These are bad people , and we must go after them , take them out . "
The discourse is almost the same .
The ultimate objective is to subdue the citizens , totally depoliticize social life in America , prevent people from thinking and conceptualizing , from analyzing facts and challenging the legitimacy of the inquisitorial social order which rules America .
The Big Lie becomes the Truth .
Realities are turned upside down .
War becomes peace , a worthwhile " humanitarian undertaking " ,
Peaceful dissent becomes heresy .
The objective is to create an atmosphere of fear and insecurity , with a view to upholding the New World Order .
In the words of Monthy Python :
" NOBODY expects the Spanish Inquisition !
Our chief weapon is surprise ... surprise and fear ... fear and surprise ....
Our two weapons are fear and surprise ... and ruthless efficiency ....
Our * three * weapons are fear , surprise , and ruthless efficiency ... and an almost fanatical devotion to the Pope ....
Our * four *... no... * Amongst * our weapons ....
Amongst our weaponry ... are such elements as fear , surprise ....
I 'll come in again . " ( Monthy Python , The Spanish Inquisition )
How to reverse the tide ?
Undermine the Inquisition ;
Reveal the lies behind 9/11 ;
Break the consensus ;
Reveal the Crimes committed by those in High Office ;
Unseat the inquisitors :
" Millions of people have been misled regarding the causes and consequences of September 11 .
Across the land , the image of an " outside enemy " is instilled in the consciousness of Americans .
Al Qaeda is threatening America and the world .
The repeal of democracy under the Patriot legislation is portrayed as a means to providing " domestic security " and upholding civil liberties .
When people across the US and around the World find out that Al Qaeda is not an outside enemy but a creation of US foreign policy and the CIA , the legitimacy of the bipartisan war agenda will tumble like a deck of cards ...

Paul Otlet 's vision that came way before its time
So how fast do you think one of these things will go ?
Gather round and let me tell you .
Few years ago I was working on the weekend as a ski instructor at a semi-major NYC area ski mountain ( that 's a giveaway ... there 's only one ) .
For winterfest they decided to have an employee contest to see which department could build a cardboard sled and go the fastest .
The rules were that it had to be all cardboard , no special surface treatments no wax .
Of course there was cheating .
EVERYONE cheated .
The contest rules were simple : Jump on the cardboard sled at the top of the run , radar gun at the bottom of the run would determine who was going fastest .
First up was ( I believe ) the electricians .
They had coated the bottom of the " sled " with lift tickets , overlapping in a careful lamellar pattern to minimize friction .
They blew through the end of the run with a radar speed over 55 mph .
They sped across the few yards of flat at the bottom of the run without shedding any speed .
Next up was the berm built up by the front - end loaders that clear the parking lot , which formed an imperfect ramp that launcehd them ass over teakettle into the cars in the parking lot .
Serious Head Trauma ensued , including a medivac helicopter ride and a long , long stay in the hospital for two of the pilots .
No further runs were made .
Contest cancelled ( duh ! )
So , would I ride one of these things ?
Hell yes !
Get me my helmet , Martha !
How many Marines and soldiers will die in Afghanistan before the mainstream media dares to speak the truth and ask questions based thereon ?
Yes , it is the mainstream media that is keeping us locked in Afghanistan , and they are doing so for two reasons :

Overview
Barack Obama has achieved a significant lead over John McCain in the days following the first presidential debate .
Pew ’s new survey conducted Sept. 27 - 29 finds that Obama has moved to a 49 % to 42 % advantage among registered voters .
The race was virtually even in mid-September and early August .
Obama had not led McCain by a significant margin in a Pew survey since June .
The latest national poll by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press , conducted among 1,505 adults ( including 1,258 registered voters ) by landline and cell phone , suggests that three factors appear to be favoring Obama .
First , more voters rate Obama ’s performance in last Friday ’s debate as excellent or good than say the same about McCain ’s ( 72 % vs. 59 % ) .
Obama ’s leadership image also has improved .
There is now almost no difference in the minds of voters as to which candidate would use better judgment in a crisis .
Second , the electorate continues to have much more confidence in Obama than McCain to deal with the financial crisis , which is dominating the public ’s attention at levels usually associated with wars and natural disasters .
Obama also has widened his lead as the candidate best able to improve the overall economy , from nine points in mid-September to 18 points currently ( 51 % to 33 % ) .
( See : Interest in Economic News Surges , October 1 , 2008 )
Third , opinions about Sarah Palin have become increasingly negative , with a majority of the public ( 51 % ) now saying that the Alaska governor is not qualified to become president if necessary ; just 37 % say she is qualified to serve as president .
That represents a reversal of opinion since early September , shortly after the GOP convention .
At that time , 52 % said Palin was qualified to step in as president , if necessary .
In the past few weeks , Obama has made significant gains among Democrats , including white Democrats .
In fact , the current poll finds that he has somewhat greater support among Democrats than McCain draws among Republicans .
In addition , a majority of Republican voters ( 52 % ) credited Obama as doing a good job in the debates , while only 37 % of Democratic voters were complimentary about McCain ’s performance Friday night .
Since mid-September , Obama has garnered more support from older baby - boomers , affluent voters and those in the battleground states , where he now holds a 52 % to 39 % lead .
While McCain continues to lead Obama among white voters overall , his support among whites is concentrated among men , older voters , those with less education , and those living in the South .
Obama currently leads McCain among college educated whites , while the preferences of white women are evenly split .
Obama ’s resurgence in the horse race parallels a recovery of his advantage over McCain for dealing with key domestic issues such as the economy , energy problems and taxes .
By wide margins , voters express more confidence in him than in his rival to deal with these problems ; Obama ’s advantage on these issues had narrowed in mid-September .
Nonetheless , McCain continues to inspire more confidence on the foreign policy and national security issues , as he has throughout the campaign .
Obama ’s renewed advantage on the economy may also be in part a measure of reaction to the economic crisis .
Seven - in - ten Americans say they are paying very close attention to economic news , the highest mark in almost 20 years .
Obama continues to lead , by 46 % to 33 % , as the candidate best able to handle the nation ’s financial crisis .
McCain ’s leadership advantage has declined since the summer .
About the same percentage says Obama would use good judgment in a crisis as says that about McCain ( 42 % Obama vs. 45 % McCain ) .
McCain held a 15 - advantage on this leadership dimension in August .
Similarly , Obama runs about even with McCain in views of which candidate is a strong leader ( 43 % McCain , 42 % Obama ) .
In the new survey , nearly identical percentages of voters view Obama and McCain as well - informed .
McCain holds a solid advantage as being more personally qualified to be president ( by 49 % to 35 % ) ; however , his lead has narrowed since August , when twice as many voters viewed McCain as more qualified than Obama .
Obama is viewed by a majority of voters ( 52 % ) as the candidate who “ can bring about the change the country needs ; ” just 33 % say that phrase better describes McCain .
There is a clear correlation between views of Palin ’s qualifications and support for McCain , which may be hurting the GOP candidate .
Fewer people see her as qualified to become president , and the balance of opinion toward Palin has grown more negative since early September .
Unfavorable views of the Alaska governor have increased among most demographic and political groups , with GOP voters a notable exception .
Currently , a narrow majority of independent voters ( 54 % ) express a favorable view of Palin , while 37 % are unfavorable .
In early September , positive impressions of Palin among independents outnumbered negative opinions by greater than two - to - one ( 60 % vs. 27 % ) .
While both candidates receive favorable reviews for the debate , those who watched had very different impressions of the candidates ’ performances .
“ Confident ” is the word used most often by voters to describe Obama ’s debate performance , while “ inexperienced ” and “ intelligent ” are also mentioned frequently .
Voters use the word “ experienced ” most commonly to describe their impressions of McCain ’s debate performance , followed by “ old ” and “ knowledgeable . ”
Obama Takes Post - Debate Lead
While the overall contours of support for the two candidates remain largely unchanged , Obama has gained among some key groups of voters , including his own partisan base and voters in battleground states .
Indeed , Obama now has more overall support – and more highly committed support – among Democrats than McCain has among Republicans .
But he continues to struggle among less educated white voters , white non-Hispanic Catholics , and voters ages 65 and older .
There continues to be a strong generational difference in support for the two candidates .
Obama has made significant gains among baby boomers ( ages 50 - 64 ) , including white voters in this age group .
He currently leads by 12 points among voters ages 50 to 64 ( 51 % to 39 % ) , up from just five points in early September .
By contrast , McCain has widened his advantage among the next oldest group : currently , he leads 48 % to 35 % among voters ages 65 and older ; in early September , his lead was just five points among voters in this age group ( 45 % to 40 % ) .
Obama also has increased his support among better educated white voters , gaining 11 points among whites with some college education and five points among white college graduates .
He continues to do poorly , however , among whites with no more than a high school education ( trailing McCain 33 % to 52 % ) .
He also trails among white Catholics by a similar margin ( 39 % to 52 % ) .
Obama has made progress in consolidating his base support : he now leads McCain among Democrats by a 92 % - 5 % margin , a gain of five percentage points since earlier in the month .
McCain leads among Republicans by 86 % to 8 % .
Independents continue to tilt slightly to McCain ; he currently holds a 46 % to 38 % edge among independent voters .
While both candidates gained in strong support among their partisans after their respective party conventions , Obama has now moved ahead of his rival on this important measure of commitment .
Fully 70 % of Democrats say they support Obama “ strongly , ” a gain of eight points since earlier in the month .
By contrast , just 55 % of Republicans say they strongly support McCain .
Greater enthusiasm for Obama among his partisans is also seen in an analysis of the swing vote , those voters who are either undecided or who favor a candidate but say they might change their mind .
Among conservative and moderate Democrats , a group that had not fully warmed to Obama in previous polling , 81 % now say they are certain to support Obama , up from 69 % earlier in September .
Obama also has gained among liberal Democrats ; 92 % now say they are certain to vote for him , up from 87 % two weeks ago .
McCain ’s Republican support is less certain ; 79 % of conservative Republicans and 64 % of moderate and liberal Republicans are firmly committed to supporting McCain .
The first presidential debate appears to have done little to help independent voters make up their minds .
Independents remain uncertain about their choice , with 43 % in the latest poll classified as swing voters , about the same as earlier in the month when 41 % were swing voters .
Independents who are certain about their choice divide 32 % for McCain , 25 % for Obama .
The overall size of the swing vote is about the same as it was prior to the first presidential debate : currently 26 % are swing voters , 27 % were classified this way two weeks ago .
Four - in - ten voters are firmly committed to Obama , as are 34 % for McCain .
Among swing voters who watched the debate , more gave Obama ’s performance a positive rating ( 63 % ) than did so for McCain ( 54 % ) .
And they also say Obama would do a better job on the economy , energy , and bringing needed change to the country .
But by even larger margins , swing voters rate McCain as personally qualified to be president .
And substantial proportions of swing voters say that McCain would do a better job with foreign policy , the war in Iraq and preventing another terrorist attack .
Candidate Favorability
Two - thirds of all registered voters ( 66 % ) say they have a favorable impression of Obama , compared with just 31 % who have an unfavorable opinion of him .
McCain ’s overall image is also positive ; 60 % of voters say they have a favorable impression of McCain while 35 % express and unfavorable opinion .
Views of Obama are now more favorable than were opinions of John Kerry following the first presidential debate in 2004 .
In early October 2004 , 53 % expressed a positive opinion of Kerry , while 41 % expressed a negative view .
McCain ’s image is similar to George Bush ’s at about the same point in the 2004 campaign ; at that time , 57 % of voters had a favorable opinion of Bush while 40 % felt unfavorably toward him .
Candidate Images
Since early August , Obama has almost pulled even with McCain as the candidate who would use good judgment in a crisis , and has cut into McCain ’s wide advantage as the more personally qualified candidate .
These changes , however , reflect gains for Obama among his political base rather than among independent voters .
The share of Democrats who say Obama has the better judgment in a crisis jumped from 63 % in August to 81 % currently .
But he continues to trail McCain among independents on this quality by wide margin ( 32 % Obama , 49 % McCain . )
Similarly , the share of Democrats who now say Obama is more personally qualified to be president rose from 55 % to 69 % , but has not risen at all among independents , who still see McCain as the more qualified by greater than two - to - one ( 56 % to 24 % ) .
Obama and McCain also are cited by about the same number of voters as a strong leader and well - informed .
Obama holds a wide advantage as the candidate who can “ bring about the change the country needs ” ( 52 % Obama , 33 % McCain ) .
McCain maintains the image as the candidate who “ is willing to take a stand , even if it ’s unpopular ” ( 50 % McCain , 37 % Obama ) .
Candidates and the Issues
At a time of widespread economic uncertainty and concern , Obama has doubled his advantage over McCain in just a few weeks on improving the economy .
McCain , meanwhile , continues to hold the edge on foreign policy and the war in Iraq .
On several issues , though , the differences appear similar to what they were before McCain ’s gains in mid-September , following the GOP convention .
Just over half ( 51 % ) say Obama can do the best job of improving economic conditions , compared with about a third ( 33 % ) who choose McCain .
In mid-September , shortly after the GOP convention , 47 % chose Obama and 38 % chose McCain .
Both candidates are near where they were in July , when Obama held a 15 - point lead on the economy .
A similar pattern emerges on dealing with the nation ’s energy problems .
In the latest survey , slightly more than half ( 52 % ) choose Obama , compared with 36 % who choose McCain .
This is similar to late May , although McCain had narrowed the margin after the convention ( 46 % to 40 % ) .
McCain continues to hold advantages on foreign policy , Iraq and protecting the country from a terrorist attack , but the margins have narrowed slightly on all three issues since mid-September .
For example , 53 % now say McCain can do the best job of defending the country from a terrorist attack , compared with 36 % who choose Obama .
In mid-September , McCain ’s lead was slightly greater ( 56 % to 31 % ) .
In July , McCain led on terrorism by 48 % to 33 % .
Obama , meanwhile , appears to have boosted his edge on the question of which candidate would do the best job dealing with taxes .
Close to half ( 49 % ) answer Obama , while 36 % choose McCain .
That margin is wider than earlier this month ( 44 % to 39 % ) and similar to Obama ’s lead on taxes in June ( 47 % to 36 % ) .
Obama has a substantial advantage on taxes among women voters ( 25 points ) .
By contrast , men voters are almost evenly split as to which candidate could do a better job on taxes .
Obama also holds a clear lead on this issue among voters in all age groups , except for those ages 65 and older .
And while voters with annual incomes of less than $ 50,000 favor Obama by wide margins on taxes , he also runs slightly ahead of McCain among higher - income voters .
Views of McCain as Change from Bush
Voters remain split over whether or not McCain represents change from President Bush .
In the current survey , 46 % say McCain , if elected , would take the country in a different direction than Bush , while 41 % say McCain would continue Bush ’s policies .
There has been little movement in opinion on this question since March .
The partisan divide on whether McCain would govern differently than Bush remains wide .
Fully 75 % of Republicans believe McCain would take the country in a different direction , compared with only 16 % of Democrats .
A slim majority of independents ( 55 % ) believe McCain would break from Bush ’s polices as president , while a three - in - ten ( 30 % ) think he would not .
A narrow majority of swing voters ( 54 % ) say that McCain will take a new direction , while 22 % say he would continue Bush ’s policies .
In mid-September , swing voters by 48 % t
o 35 % said that McCain represented a change from Bush .
The Vice Presidential Candidates
In advance of Thursday ’s vice presidential debate , a majority of Americans ( 63 % ) say that Joe Biden is qualified to serve as president if that becomes necessary , but fewer than four - in - ten ( 37 % ) say Sarah Palin is qualified to take on the job .
Majorities of Republicans ( 55 % ) , Democrats ( 78 % ) and independents ( 56 % ) say Obama ’s vice - presidential nominee is qualified to hold the office of president .
In contrast , though a majority of Republicans say Palin is qualified ( 68 % ) , more than three - quarters of Democrats ( 77 % ) and a plurality of independents ( 47 % ) do not believe she is qualified for the presidency .
Compared with public opinion immediately following Palin ’s nomination and convention speech , far fewer now hold the view that she is qualified to be president .
More than half ( 52 % ) viewed her as qualified earlier in the month .
The decline in the belief that Palin is qualified to become president has been broad - based .
While roughly two - thirds of Republicans ( 68 % ) say their party ’s candidate is qualified , that represents a substantial decrease since early September ( 16 points ) .
In addition , only about a third of women ( 34 % ) say Palin is qualified to step in as president , down from 52 % a few weeks ago .
Women are now slightly less likely than men to view Palin as qualified ; in early September , identical percentages of women and men said she was qualified to be president if the need arose .
Views of Palin
Views of Sarah Palin are less favorable than they were shortly after the Republican convention .
Palin ’s favorability ratings are little changed from the Sept. 9 - 14 survey ( 54 % to 51 % ) , but 40 % of voters now say they have an unfavorable opinion of the Alaska governor , compared with 32 % earlier in the month .
By contrast , views of her Democratic counterpart , Joe Biden , remain virtually unchanged over the same period ( 53 % favorable now , 52 % in early September ) .
Opinions of Palin have declined across most groups , although Republican opinion about the Alaska governor has remained relatively stable .
Views of the vice presidential nominee , which were already divided along party lines , have become more polarized .
About seven - in - ten Democratic voters ( 69 % ) now hold a negative view of Palin , up 10 points from earlier in the month ; just 21 % say they have a favorable opinion of her .
Among independent voters , unfavorable opinions have increased from 27 % in mid-September to 37 % .
Nearly nine - in - ten Republicans ( 87 % ) continue to express a favorable opinion of Palin , which is largely unchanged from earlier in the month .
Among voters with college degrees , 49 % see the vice presidential nominee unfavorably , compared with 39 % of those with some college and 35 % of those who have not attended college .
Voters age 65 and older are somewhat less likely to hold unfavorable views of Palin than younger voters .
Traits of VP Candidates
There are major differences in voters ’ views of the personal traits of the vice - presidential candidates .
Fully three - quarters of voters say they think of Biden as well - informed , while just 45 % say Palin is well - informed .
By contrast , 70 % see Palin as down - to - earth , compared with a much smaller majority ( 55 % ) that associates that trait with Biden .
Voters generally see both of the vice - presidential candidates as honest ; 61 % say they think of Palin as honest while a nearly identical percentage ( 60 % ) says the same of Biden .
Neither is seen as arrogant by a large percentage of voters .
One - third of voters says they think of Biden as arrogant while somewhat fewer ( 27 % ) say that negative trait applies to Palin .
In general , voters who say they are certain to vote for McCain see Palin in a positive light ; this also is the case for committed Obama supporters ’ views of Biden .
It is notable , however , that a solid majority of those who say they are certain to vote for McCain say they think of Biden as well - informed ( 63 % ) , compared with 79 % who say the same about Palin .
Swing voters , like voters generally , are much more likely to view Biden as well - informed ( 70 % vs. 45 % for Palin ) .
By a wide margin ( 70 % to 50 % ) , more swing voters say Palin is down - to - earth .
While nearly identical percentages of all voters see both candidates as honest , more swing voters say this trait describes Palin ( 67 % ) than say it applies to Biden ( 53 % ) .
Who Sees Palin as Well - Informed ?
Men and women voters have similar views about whether Palin is well - informed .
Fewer than half of women voters say they think of Palin as well - informed ( 46 % ) as do 44 % of men voters .
However , there are differences among women about whether this trait applies to the Alaska governor .
Married women are far more likely than unmarried women to say that Palin is well - informed ( 52 % vs. 39 % ) .
There also are sizable differences in opinions among religious voters about whether Palin is well - informed .
Nearly two - thirds of white evangelical voters ( 65 % ) say they think of Palin as well - informed , compared with just 41 % of white non-evangelical Protestants .
Obama Had Debate Edge
Barack Obama and John McCain received high marks from voters for their debate performances .
However , substantially more say Obama did an excellent or good job ( 72 % ) than say the same about McCain ( 59 % ) .
Obama ’s debate performance is rated more highly than McCain ’s across several demographic groups .
Women voters who watched the debate are considerably more likely to say Obama did an excellent or good job than they are to say the same about McCain ( 75 % vs. 56 % ) .
Men who watched the debate , however , give Obama only a slight edge ( 69 % vs. 63 % ) .
Obama ’s debate edge is widest among young voters ; more than eight - in - ten voters ( 81 % ) under age 35 who watched the debate say the Democratic candidate did an excellent or good job , compared with 58 % who give McCain similar ratings .
Obama also holds an 18 - point advantage among voters ages 35 - 49 and a smaller 10 - point advantage among those ages 50 - 64 .
The two candidates receive virtually identical ratings among voters ages 65 and older , a group that supports McCain in the horserace by a 48 % to 35 % margin ; about six - in - ten debate watchers 65 and older give each candidate an excellent or good rating for his performance ( 62 % for Obama vs. 61 % for McCain ) .
Issues and the Presidential Debate
Voters who watched all or part of last Friday ’s presidential debate tend to see Obama more favorably when it comes to who can best handle issues .
For example , Obama runs almost even with McCain on foreign policy among debate watchers ( 45 % Obama , 49 % McCain ) , while McCain holds a 14 - point lead among voters who did not watch ( 36 % Obama , 50 % McCain ) .
Similarly , among debate watchers Obama leads McCain by a 52 % to 37 % margin on the issue of taxes , compared with a slimmer 44 % to 36 % margin among those who did not watch .
Interestingly , the difference between those who did and did not see the debates is all
in the share who see Obama as the stronger candidate .
On every issue , McCain runs about equally well among those who did and did n’t watch the debates .
But on nearly every issue , a larger share of debate - watchers selects Obama , while a smaller number say “ do n’t know . ”
These gaps cannot be attributed simply to party identification .
The overall balance of party identification among debate watchers is 51 % Democrat / lean Democrat , 43 % Republican / lean Republican – an eight point Democratic advantage .
But there is a comparable six point advantage among non-watchers as well ( 47 % vs. 41 % ) .
Among voters overall , Democrats hold a 49 % to 42 % edge in party identification ( including leaners ) .
More Say Economy is Poor
Public views of the national economy , which have been negative for more than a year , have gotten even worse .
Virtually no one rates the economy as excellent , while 7 % rate it as good ; overall positive opinions of the economy little changed from July ( 10 % excellent / good ) .
But the proportion rating the economy as poor has risen by 15 points , from 50 % in July to 65 % .
Bleak views of national economic conditions are increasingly held across party lines .
At the time of the 2006 mid-term elections , the condition of the economy was a partisan issue with 70 % of Republicans calling conditions excellent or good compared with only a quarter ( 25 % ) of Democrats .
Republicans have soured on the economy over the past two years ; the share of Republicans rating economic conditions as excellent / good has fallen from 70 % in November 2006 , to 46 % in September 2007 , to 14 % today .
As a result , the party gap on this issue has steadily diminished .
A large majority of Americans continue to say that the economy is either in a recession ( 56 % ) or a depression ( 21 % ) ; both numbers are largely unchanged from July .
Partisan differences in views about whether the economy is in a recession also have narrowed : currently , 60 % of Democrats and 54 % each of independents and Republicans say the economy is in recession .
Since July , the proportion of Republicans saying the economy is in a recession has increased by nine points 9 ( from 45 % ) , while remaining largely unchanged among independents and Democrats .
However , Democrats remain far more likely than Republicans to say that the economy is in a depression .
About quarter of Democrats express this view ( 27 % ) , compared with 22 % of independents and just 10 % of Republicans .

PRESS RELEASE :
Volkswagen 's Jetta TDI Named 2009 Green Car of the Year(R )
Green Car Journal Announces Winner at the Los Angeles Auto Show
LOS ANGELES , Nov 20 , 2008 / PRNewswire via COMTEX / --
Volkswagen 's milestone 2009 Jetta TDI has been named Green Car Journal 's 2009 Green Car of the Year ( R ) , besting competitors that included a pair of advanced hybrids , a clean diesel sport sedan , and a trendy fuel - efficient microcar .
This is the first time that a clean diesel model has been awarded the title Green Car of the Year ( R ) .
Green Car Journal has been unveiling the Green Car of the Year ( R ) winner at the LA Auto Show every year since it initiated the annual award in 2005 .
" The 2009 Volkswagen Jetta TDI epitomizes what the Green Car of the Year ( R ) honor is all about , " said Ron Cogan , editor and publisher of Green Car Journal and editor of GreenCar.com .
" It raises the bar significantly in environmental performance with its EPA estimated 41 mpg highway fuel economy , reduced greenhouse gas emissions , and extremely low tailpipe emissions .
This is all the more impressive when you consider the Jetta TDI is a clean diesel , achieving the kind of fuel efficiency offered by gasoline - electric hybrids but in a more affordable way . "
Volkswagen 's Jetta TDI features a 2.0 - liter , turbocharged direct injection engine featuring the latest in diesel injection and emissions technology that allows it to meet strict emissions standards in all 50 states .
Although its mission is to provide buyers a comfortable and fuel efficient five - passenger family sedan at an affordable $ 21,990 , there 's a bit of performance in the bargain because of this clean diesel engine 's abundant low - end torque and the Jetta 's well - tuned suspension .
This Volkswagen 's new - generation diesel powerplant is also exceptionally quiet for a diesel , reflecting just how far advanced diesel technology has come in recent years .
A jury of environmental and automotive experts selected the 2009 Jetta TDI from the field of five finalists that also included the BMW 335d , Ford Fusion Hybrid , Saturn Vue 2 Mode Hybrid , and smart fortwo .
This jury is comprised of nine jurors including Carl Pope , executive director of the Sierra Club ; Frances Beinecke , president of the Natural Resources Defense Council ; Jean - Michel Cousteau , president of Ocean Futures Society ; automotive expert and Tonight Show host Jay Leno ; automotive icon Carroll Shelby ; and four Green Car Journal editors .
About Green Car of the Year(R )
The Green Car of the Year ( R ) award is an important part of Green Car Journal 's mission to showcase environmental progress in the auto industry .
Since 1992 , Green Car Journal has focused on the intersection of automobiles , energy , and environment , first with an industry newsletter and then with an award - winning auto enthusiast magazine .
Today , the magazine is considered the premier source of information on high fuel efficiency , low emission , advanced technology , and alternative fuel vehicles .
Green Car of the Year( R ) is a registered trademark of Green Car Journal and RJ Cogan Specialty Publications Group , Inc. Additional information about the 2009 Green Car of the Year ( R ) can be found at GreenCar.com
There are a few standouts in the emerging green sector of the U.S. auto market that are hitting the market in 2009 .
BMW 's first clean diesel in the United States , the 335d , is one such vehicle that has torque - loving enthusiasts salivating , and General Motors ' upcoming Saturn Vue is the first application of the 2 - Mode hybrid system in a front - wheel drive vehicle .
No green car discussion is complete without a mention of the smart fortwo , which sports the best mileage of any non -hybrid car available .
Of course , the new Fusion Hybrid and Milan Hybrid from Ford are shaping up to be real contenders in the green mid-size sedan sweepstakes and they may take a chunk out of Camry hybrid sales when it finally debuts .
Still , there is one '09 car that seems to offer the best of all worlds , with a relatively low starting price , excellent fuel economy and refined driving dynamics :
The 2009 Volkswagen Jetta TDI .
For these reasons , the oil - burner from Germany has been selected by Green Car Journal as the 2009 Green Car of the Year .
We 're not arguing with the decision , but you are , of course , free to make your voice heard in the comments section .
Courtenay Semel finally answered the question at the forefront of tech geeks ' minds since her recent blowup at a bouncer who did n't know who she was : " Why did n't Terry Semel 's daughter say , ' Yahoo Me ' ? "
The seemingly mortified spawn of Yahoo's former CEO explains her drunken choice of words to TMZ by saying that her " dad is done with Yahoo . "
She adds that " Google me just sounded like a better catchphrase . "
Indeed , her whole rant is a great catchphrase ; it 's only a matter of time before someone puts it on a t - shirt .
And while it 's nice of Courtenay to try to get back into dad 's good graces , she likely said " Google me " because that 's what everyone says .
No one refers to Yahoo 's search engine because very few people use it .
So , yeah , Terry Semel 's done with Yahoo and so is everyone else .

Introduction
I 've been doing a small Haskell project for the Uni and got really interested in this language and the Functional paradigm in general .
I suddenly felt like porting some of this cool functionality to Javascript .
Currying
I started by allowing functions to be curried .
Here 's a demo showing the script I made .
This is quite a fun way of making functions that derive from other functions .
Haskell functions
I then felt like porting Haskell 's functions .
Seemed doable considering Javascript has Higher Order Functions and we now can curry them .
I ported many Prelude 's methods as well as Char methods .
Special features
Apart from currying , these functions can also work on strings , the same way as they do for lists ( arrays ) .
You do n't need to worry about splitting ( before ) or joining ( after ) .
I added this because that 's how Haskell 's functions work .
These functions also work on maps / object / associative arrays .
This might not be true for some functions where this was too complicated .
This was the best adaptation of Haskell 's Tuples that I could think of .
A couple of functions like fst and snd do n't have a concrete application for now .
In case I did n't make myself clear on this one , all the functions I made can be automatically curried .
They 're all contained in one namespace , that is , window.hs .
I added a method called : hs.global ( ) that will import all the functions to the global namespace .
The magic currying function is available as hs.curry .
Operators
Haskell 's operators are regular functions .
I did imitate this adding most operators as methods .
The only problem is that to reference them , you need to use something like hs [ '+'] instead of hs .+ as one would like .
To defeat this , I made hs a function , it provides a small shortcut for these cases .
As an example : hs [ '+ '] ( 1,2 ) == hs ( '+' , 1,2 ) .
I think the second option does look better .
These functions can also be curried .
hs._ will work the same as hs , but inverting the ( 2 ) arguments .
I added the dot operator for function composition , it 's quite a powerful function .
That 's it , the script is licensed under BSD , check the demo and play with it !

When five former secretaries of state talk , the nation should listen .
Their collective message :
The next White House administration should talk directly to its enemies , not just isolate or demonize them .
In case anyone was missing the point , the panel filled in the blanks .
Yes , they were talking about Syria , Russia and Iran , where relations with Washington are rocky or nonexistent .
Their words , spoken at a university forum last week , came just days before a debate between John McCain and Barack Obama over the terms and timing of such foreign policy overtures .

Thousands of displaced people have been fleeing to Goma
The UN says it is deeply concerned about the plight of tens of thousands of people fleeing a rebel advance in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo .
Police are trying to arrest retreating soldiers blamed for causing chaos in the city of Goma , which was calm but tense early on Thursday .
Oxfam and other aid agencies said they had decided to evacuate international staff from Goma .
The French foreign minister said the EU will consider whether to send troops .
Bernard Kouchner said a potential European force of as many as 1,500 soldiers could provide humanitarian assistance in Goma but would not fight the rebels .
He said the EU security committee would be meeting in Brussels later on Thursday or Friday to discuss the idea .
Tutsi rebel CNDP leader Laurent Nkunda , whose forces are just outside Goma , declared a ceasefire on Wednesday night and urged others to do the same .
Many of the population that have fled are staying in vacant schools , in churches and outside
Unicef's Jaya Murthy
Eyewitness : ' Chaos in Congo city '
In pictures : Goma chaos Timeline : DR Congo The UN Security Council has urged the rebel leader to implement the ceasefire .
An emergency session of the council also expressed alarm over cross - border firing between DR Congo and Rwanda .
The Security Council took no action on a request from the country 's mission head , Alan Doss , for temporary reinforcements but said some of its peacekeepers could be redeployed from elsewhere in DR Congo to back up those in Goma .
See detailed map of the area
The UN children 's agency Unicef said the latest bout of fighting had resulted in a " very bad " humanitarian situation .
" We 're talking tens of thousands of people who have fled towards Goma and thousands more who are fleeing north to a town called Kane Byunga , " Unicef 's Jaya Murthy told the BBC's World Today programme .
" Many of the population that have fled are staying in vacant schools , in churches and outside . "

Oxfam said national staff had been advised to stay at home , but it was hoping to resume humanitarian work for more than 65,000 people in Goma 's camps soon .
Another aid group , Merlin , said it had been unable to reach an estimated 150,000 people who had fled the chaos on Wednesday .
Medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres ( MSF ) said it was reinforcing its staff in Congo .
Gen Nkunda has written a letter to the UN mission in Goma saying he would open a " humanitarian corridor " for aid to reach the thousands of people who are trapped between his rebel forces and the positions of the UN and Congolese government troops .
Many of the latter have fled the combat zone and some have been blamed for looting in Goma .
Overnight , Goma resident Tawite Anthony told the BBC that there were " uncontrolled soldiers who were looting all over the city " .
He said he had seen the dead body of one man who had apparently been shot by the police while trying to break into a shop .
Some people were fleeing to Rwanda , he said .
" Everybody 's afraid of the wars .
They are fearing what will happen next . "
The BBC's Thomas Fessy in Goma said the atmosphere was calm but tense after a night of gunfire and looting .
He said he had seen a body with bullet wounds , but was still unclear how many people had been killed or injured .

Advertisement Earlier , UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called for an immediate end to the fighting , which he said was creating a " humanitarian catastrophe " .
Mr Ban said he deplored the deliberate targeting of civilians and their use as human shields and said UN peacekeepers were " doing everything possible to protect civilians and fulfil their mandate in untenable circumstances " .
Correspondents say the 17,000 - strong UN force in DR Congo - the world 's largest - is stretched to breaking point .

Gen Nkunda told the BBC the goal of his forces was to protect his Tutsi community from attack by Rwandan Hutu rebels , some of whom are accused of taking part in the 1994 genocide .
A peace deal was signed in Goma between the government and various rebel groups at the end of January .
Although he signed the deal , Gen Nkunda has refused to disarm while Rwandan Hutu rebels still operate in the area .
The AP news agency reported Mr Nkunda as saying on Thursday that he wanted direct negotiations with the government about security and his objections to a $ 5 bn ( £ 3.1 bn ) deal that gives China access to the region 's mineral resources .
Some observers say that the fighting in eastern DR Congo is really over control of such resources .
Rwanda has denied claims that it is backing Gen Nkunda .
US assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Jendayi Frazer has said she had no evidence that Rwanda was directly involved in the fighting .
Rwandan Foreign Minister Rosemary Museminali was due to meet Congo's President Joseph Kabila in Kinshasa on Thursday , AFP news agency reported .

When Abraham Lincoln appointed his secretary of state , he picked his greatest opponent in the battle for the presidency , who just happened to be an able and popular senator from New York .
Just like president - elect Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton , in fact .
Mr Obama 's greatest rival within his own Democratic Party for the White House travelled secretly to Chicago last week , and was all but offered a top job in his administration .
She was first spied at the airport .
Later , after Mr Obama 's cavalcade left his anonymous steel and glass headquarters , a second convoy of Secret Service 4x4s was seen departing .
As a former First Lady , Mrs Clinton never has to drive herself , but it was a giveaway for reporters camped outside the building .
The Obama camp , which almost never leaks , has made it clear that Mrs Clinton is in the running for the foreign policy slot or for some other top position in the next administration .
Bringing her on board would be as clear an indication as any that Mr Obama intends to build an administration of political superstars for the challenges of the post - Bush era .
One of Mr Obama 's aides yesterday described him as " self - confident enough to want to send a message to the world about America and all that it can be – and Hillary Clinton as secretary of state would do that " .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
But other allies worry that choosing a former rival who voted for war in Iraq , and who is seen as a pillar of the Washington establishment , will not chime well with Mr Obama 's promise of bringing about far - reaching change in America 's way of doing business .
Mrs Clinton 's presence in the cabinet might destroy the extraordinary cohesiveness the Obama inner circle has shown over the past two years .
In one sense the possible appointment might not be surprising .
Veterans from former president Bill Clinton 's two terms are playing decisive roles in shaping Mr Obama 's transition .
John Podesta , his former chief of staff , is leading the transition team , and Rahm Emanuel , another throwback to the era , is Mr Obama 's designated White House chief of staff .
But some of Mr Obama 's other close advisers , who are expected to get prominent positions in his administration , are less enamoured of her .
Susan Rice , a senior foreign policy adviser to Mr Obama , who is thought to be in the running for the UN ambassadorship or the post of deputy national security adviser , attacked Mrs Clinton 's foreign policy credentials during the primaries .
Quoting a campaign ad by Mrs Clinton – the " 3 am phone call " television spot that questioned Mr Obama 's experience – Ms Rice retorted that the ability to handle a crisis phone call to the White House was not acquired " merely by being married to a commander in chief " .
It is true that Mrs Clinton 's travels to 83 countries as First Lady were as a ceremonial spouse rather than as a policymaker .
During her contest with Mr Obama she also faced biting criticism after she claimed to have endured sniper fire in Bosnia , despite television footage that disproved it .
On the other hand , Mrs Clinton is on first - name terms with many world leaders , and as a presidential candidate revealed herself to be a person of extraordinary competence .
If she wants the job , it seems the only question is whether she can pass the rigorous Obama vetting process for all cabinet and other high - level positions .
This would include a thorough examination of Bill Clinton 's private business since he left the presidency .
One reason Mrs Clinton was never a contender for the vice - presidency , Mr Obama 's aides have said , was the complications surrounding the vast amounts of money her husband earned on the international speaking circuit and his links to foreign businessmen .
There are also unanswered questions about foreign donors to his presidential library and aspects of a controversial deal to help a Canadian businessman secure a uranium contract in Kazakhstan .
Before joining the Obama administration , Mrs Clinton will have to fill in the same 63 - question application as others .
Candidates and spouses must provide details of all their finances over the past 10 years .
But Mrs Clinton 's approval by the Senate is considered a formality , given her good relations with her colleagues there .

Her appointment would underline the extraordinary parallels between the careers of Abraham Lincoln and Barack Obama .
Lincoln was an outsider from Illinois , a lawyer with little national experience and , at 51 , was only four years older than Obama when he won the presidency in 1860 .
On the eve of the Civil War , one of his first acts as president - elect was to appoint William Seward secretary of state and build a " team of rivals " that would preserve the nation and free it from the curse of slavery .
Just like Hillary Clinton , Seward was bitterly disappointed that the presidency had been snatched from him by an upstart lawyer , but the two men soon became great allies .
Mrs Clinton joins the former presidential candidates Senator John Kerry and Governor Bill Richardson of New Mexico on the shortlist for the post .
There has been much speculation about Mrs Clinton 's future as it became clear that her return to work as the junior senator from New York was not going to be an easy transition .
When she asked the Democratic leader of the Senate , Harry Reid , about becoming chairwoman of a special sub -committee to handle her pet subject of healthcare reform , she was told to forget about it .
Despite his illness Senator Teddy Kennedy has no intention of relinquishing his life 's work of overhauling America 's healthcare system .
Hiring his former rival would do more for Mr Obama than fulfil the old saw of keep - your - friends - close - and - your - enemies - closer .
It would prevent a very real rival and potential troublemaker from becoming a one - person Roman tribunal in the Senate .
A nightmare scenario for Mr Obama would be for Mrs Clinton and her friend John McCain to form tactical alliances against him .
But Mr Obama is also wooing Mr McCain , whom he is due to meet tomorrow .
The speculation is that the president - elect will ask for his bipartisan help on issues of common interest , such as energy policy .
The Machiavellian theory of why Mr Obama might want Mrs Clinton in the cabinet is that it would stop her putting her oar into domestic policy issues .
It 's also not done for top cabinet secretaries to practise politics while in government .
However badly things turn out for Mr Obama in the next four years , he would have removed a possible challenger for 2012 .
Mrs Clinton 's many advisers were crowing yesterday that the next move is hers .
" Obviously Hillary 's got to make the decision herself , " Terry McAuliffe , her campaign manager , was quoted as saying .
" She 's a spectacular senator , and healthcare is something she wants to battle on .
But as secretary of state , she would have 100 per cent name ID and she is a beloved figure who is continually rated the most admired woman in the world . "

Speeding up ASP.NET with the Runtime Page Optimizer
Earlier this year I worked on an exciting product called the Runtime Page Optimizer ( RPO ) .
Originally written by the guys at ActionThis to solve their website ’s performance issues , I had the opportunity to develop it with them and help turn the RPO into a product that works on any ASP .

How RPO works
At its heart the RPO is a HttpModule that intercepts page content at runtime , inspects it , and then rewrites the page so that is optimized to be downloaded to the client .
Because the RPO is a module it can quickly be added to any existing ASP .
NET website , creating instant performance improvements .
What RPO optimizes
The RPO does three things to speed up a web page :
Reduces HTTP requests
Reducing the number of resources on a page often produces the most dramatic improvement in performance .
A modest sized web page can still take a significant amount of time to load if it contains many stylesheets , scripts and image files .
The reason for this is most of the time spent waiting for a web page to load is not for large files to download but from HTTP requests bouncing between the browser and the server .
The RPO fixes this by intelligently combining CSS and JavaScript text files together and merging images through CSS spriting .
Fewer resources means less time wasted from HTTP requests and faster page loads .
Compresses Content RPO minifies ( whitespace removal ) and zip compresses JavaScript and CSS files , as well as the ASP.
NET page itself .
Compression reduces page size , saves bandwidth and further decreasing page load times .
Caching
The RPO ensures all static content has the correct HTTP headers to be cached on a user ’s browser .
This further decreases " warm " page load times and saves even more bandwidth .
When resources change on the server , the client - side cache is automatically refreshed .
Other stuff
Every site is different so the RPO has extensive configuration options to customize it to best optimize your ASP .
NET application .
RPO has been used on ASP .
NET AJAX , MVC , SharePoint , CRM , EpiServer and DotNetNuke websites .
Lots of thought has been put into performance .
The RPO caches all combined content and supports load balancing .
Once combined content has been cached the only thing that happens at runtime is lightweight parsing of HTML , which is darn quick .
I know because I wrote it that way [ : ) ]
The RPO supports all browsers , including new kid on the block : Chrome .
RPO is even smart enough to take advantage of features only available in certain browsers and supply specially customized content to further improve page load times .
The industrious people at RPO are making a version for Apache .
Working on the RPO was a great experience .
Some very smart people are behind it and everyone contributed something unique to make RPO the awesome tool that it is today .
RPO is out now and a fully featured trial is available at getrpo.com .

Update :
I noticed there is a question about the RPO on StackOverflow ( I 've been using StackOverflow a lot lately , excellent resource ) .
The question discussion has some positive comments from users who have tried the RPO out .
The big news since the last IBM server snapshot in February , of course , is the combining of the System i and System p , but obviously , that is n't all IBM has done in the past six months .
Hard - Core Hardware : A new mainframe offering , and the consolidation and launch of sever lines are but some of the big changes at Big Blue in the past six months .
Among the highlights are the next - generation System z mainframe , a new line of servers known as System x iDataPlex , and several new blade servers — the HS12 and JS12 .
Power
In April , IBM announced the birth of Power Systems .
This effectively represented a combination of System i and System p into a single group .
As part of the reorg , IBM appeared to be primarily focusing on reducing costs via organizational streamlining , and component sharing .
Both System i and p have used the same POWER - family processor for several years now for example , Steve Sibley , manager , Power Systems Offering Management , noted :

Sun
HP
Unisys
Gateway
The new Power Systems line offers IBM virtualization technology and energy - saving capabilities to help dramatically reduce bottom - line operating costs , such as those for energy , floor space and systems management , while improving system performance , helping customers transition to a new enterprise data center .
Gordon Haff , an analyst at Illuminata ( Nashua , N.H. ) , put things in historical perspective .
" System i and System p sprang from wholly different roots , " he said .
" System i , long known as the AS / 400 , was an independent thread of IBM systems development .
System p , on the other hand , was long called the RS / 6000 , then later pSeries . "
According to Haff , this also means that there 's now one common set of system models that can run AIX , i , or Linux operating systems &3151 or a combination thereof using the integrated server virtualization features that fall under the PowerVM umbrella .
What does this mean in terms of products ?
Several new low - end Power Systems have been introduced , such as the Power 520 Express , Power 550 Express and the i Edition Express for the BladeCenter S .
" They deliver value and performance in a package suitable for the budget constraints and limited administrative assets of SMBs , " said Sibley .
Shortly after announcing these servers , IBM introduced two new high - end Power Systems servers .
The Power 595 , which Sibley characterizes as a " water - cooled supercomputer , " and the Power 575 , which he claims is the world 's fastest Unix server .
The unification of the IBM i operating system ( formerly known as i5 / OS ) with AIX and Linux on Power systems and POWER processor - based BladesCenter , according to Sibley , is providing users new opportunities to optimize their IT infrastructure .
" Clients taking advantage of the simple - to - use , integrated i operating environment and database can now leverage the systems industry 's fastest processor and most popular midrange servers to update their infrastructure and run both their traditional applications as well as AIX and Linux applications , " he said .
System z
The major change to System z is the introduction of the z10EC , which IBM markets as its next - generation mainframe .
According to Anne Altman , general manager , IBM System z , this new machine enables businesses to better manage and accommodate the complexity of today 's data centers as well as eases the transition to managing IT as a service .
" The arrival of the System z10 EC mainframe addresses the fact that data center costs and complexity continue to rise and intensify , " said Altman .
" Built to be shared , the z10 helps business units within a firm to share , track and automate the management of IT resources . "
She believes the z10 compares well against virtualized x86 servers — i.e. , IBM touts this as a better platform than x86 for virtualization .
In addition , the z10 is up to 50 percent faster and offers up to 100 percent performance improvement for CPU - intensive jobs , and up to 70 percent more capacity than the previous z9 line .
System x
The iDataPlex is the new member of the System x family .
It was built with Web 2.0 style computing in mind .
As such , it is designed to operate massive data centers with tens of thousands of servers .
" iDataPlex is a new line of rack systems featuring design innovations in cooling and efficiency that can help replace the inefficient white - box servers commonly used by Internet companies , " said Rajesh Sukhramani , manager System x marketing .
" As consumers demand richer content and more immediate access to Web - based applications , iDataPlex can allow online gaming , social network , search and Internet companies to scale rapidly to meet this need . "
According to Sukhramani , the iDataPlex uses less space , which enables administrators to double the number of servers they can run in a single rack for better space utilization .
He also states that it saves up to 40 percent energy and less air conditioning .
iDataPlex solutions are arranged in rack configurations with IBM Flexible Node Technology to tailor it for each specific business — you can mix and match to achieve the right balance of compute intensity , networking and storage - rich nodes .
" System x servers are an important element in helping clients develop a new enterprise data center , which offers dramatic improvements in IT efficiency and provides for rapid deployment of new IT services to support future business growth , " said Sukhramani .
Coming in September , the dx320 will be the next addition to the iDataplex family of servers .
It is said to be optimized for significantly lower power and is aimed at extreme scale environments .
The Future
Like most vendors these days , IBM is going all out on the green bandwagon .
In fact , its strange predilection to air primetime ads about System z products , has now been augmented by an equally puzzling series of ads with a green flavor .
The ads may make sense to techies but not to the millions watching TV who hardly even know what a server is .
Anyway , at least IBM is not just hot air .
It is investing heavily to back up its green trumpet blowing .
" Looking to the future , scientists at IBM's Zurich Research Laboratory recently presented a pioneering concept of a zero-emission data center at CeBIT 2008 , " said Sibley .
" A new kind of water - cooling system embedded on a chip is the basis for an innovation that captures the water at its hottest and pipes it off the chip for reuse in heating a building or for hot water . "
The research team is currently trying to get the water even closer to the chip , not with a copper plate but actually inside the chip .
Sibley states that once the water is captured , it can be routed out of the computer and pumped into the heating system for re-use .

If you ’re curious like me , you probably ventured at least once in the scary and mind - bending world of functional programming , came back and told yourself : “ It would be nice if I could do this or that in c ++ ” .
FP languages have been present for decades but only recently , we ’ve been starting to see the adoption of some of their techniques in classical imperative languages … like higher order functions , closures / lambdas functions , currying and lazy evaluation .
For example , Javascript supports closures since version 1.7 and C# from 3.0 .
Seeing how useful these techniques are , it ’s normal to want them in our favorite programming language .
We ’re already doing a bit a FP without knowing thanks to the standard library algorithms .
Lots of them takes functors / predicates as arguments so they mimics fairly well the behavior of higher order functions .
Besides that , C++ has no built - in support for other idioms like lambda functions or closures but we can achieve similar effects due to the lazy nature of templates and a technique known as “ expression templates ” .
More on that technique on a future post …
To demonstrate my point , let ’s take a small program that takes a string as input and return the most frequent character .
In the old classical C++ way , it could be implemented as follow :
# include < iostream > # include < locale > # include < map > # include < string > namespace { char most_frequent_letter ( const std::string &str ) { typedef std :: map<char , unsigned int > char_counts_t ; char_counts_t char_counts ; for ( std : : string :: const_iterator itr = str.begin( ) ; itr != str.end ( ) ; ++itr ) if ( std::isalpha( * itr , std::locale ( ) ) ) ++char_counts [*itr ] ; for ( char_counts_t::const_iterator itr = char_counts.begin( ) ; itr != char_counts.end ( ) ; ++itr ) std::cout << itr-> first << " => " << itr->second << std::endl ; if(!char_counts.empty ( ) ) { char_counts_t::const_iterator highest_count = char_counts.begin( ) ; for ( char_counts_t::const_iterator itr = ++char_counts.begin( ) ; itr != char_counts.end ( ) ; ++itr ) if ( itr -> second > highest_count ->second ) highest_count = itr ; return highest_count -> first ; } return ' '; } } int main ( int argc , char * argv [ ] ) { if ( argc >
1 ) { std :: string some_string = argv [ 1 ] ; std::cout << " The string is : " << some_string << "
" << std::endl ; std::cout << " The most frequent letter is : " << most_frequent_letter(some_string ) << std::endl ; } else std::cout << " Usage : " << argv [ 0 ] << " < string > " << std::endl ; } [ / sourcecode ]
So far so good , it works and does the job .
We 're putting the characters in a map using the character as the key and the count as the value .
Then , we print the content of the map and finally iterate through it to find the character with the highest value .
The problems with this code is that we 're reinventing parts already in the standard library and that code lacks expressiveness .
Let 's see how the code could look like if we used the standard algorithms .
[ sourcecode language='cpp ' ] namespace { template < typename map_t > struct map_filler { typedef void result_type ; map_filler ( map_t &map ) : map_( map ) { } template < typename T> result_type operator ( ) ( const T &t ) const { if ( std::isalpha( t , std::locale ( ) ) ) ++ map_[t ] ; } private : map_t & map_ ; } ; struct pair_printer { typedef void result_type ; template < typename pair_t > result_type operator ( ) ( const pair_t & pair ) const { std::cout << pair.first << " => " << pair .second << std::endl ; } } ; struct pair_value_comparer { typedef bool result_type ; template < typename pair_t > result_type operator ( ) ( const pair_t &a , const pair_t &b ) { return a.second < b.second ; } } ; char most_frequent_letter ( const std::string &str ) { typedef std:: map<char , unsigned int > char_counts_t ; char_counts_t char_counts ; std::for_each(str.begin( ) , str.end ( ) , map_filler < char_counts_t>( char_counts ) ) ; std::for_each(char_counts.begin( ) , char_counts.end ( ) , pair_printer ( ) ) ; char_counts_t::const_iterator result = std::max_element ( char_counts.begin( ) , char_counts.end ( ) , pair_value_comparer ( ) ) ; return ( result != char_counts.end ( ) ) ?
result -> first : ' '; } }
Hmm … Okay …
Let ’s see , our “ most_frequent_letter ” function is now using the standard library algorithms .
It does make the function clearer and way more expressive but at the cost of around 40 lines of “ support code ” whose are in our case , functors .
Even when thinking in terms of reusability , the chance of needing that same support code in the future is small , if not inexistant .
What would we do in that case in a FP language ?
Use a small lambda functions / closure instead .
For that example , I ’m going to use boost : : phoenix 2.0 , an efficient FP library part of boost which is in my opinion the best general , multi- purpose C++ library and a must - have for any serious C++ programmer .
Let ’s see what phoenix can do :
namespace { namespace phx = boost :: phoenix ; using namespace phx :: arg_names ; using namespace phx:: local_names ; using phx : :at_c ; char most_frequent_letter ( const std::string &str ) { typedef std:: map<char , unsigned int > char_counts_t ; char_counts_t char_counts ; std::for_each(str.begin( ) , str.end ( ) , phx : :if_( phx ::bind ( std ::isalpha< char > , _1 , phx::construct < std::locale >( ) ) ) [ phx :: let ( _a = phx::ref( char_counts ) [ _1 ] ) [ ++_a ] ] ) ; std::for_each(char_counts.begin( ) , char_counts.end ( ) , std::cout << at_c<0>( _1 ) << " => " << at_c<1>( _1 ) << std::endl ) ; char_counts_t::const_iterator result = std::max_element ( char_counts.begin( ) , char_counts.end ( ) , at_c <1>( _1 ) < at_c <1>( _2 ) ) ; return ( result != char_counts.end ( ) ) ?
result -> first : ' '; } }
I made a few using statements to make the code easier to understand .
Let ’s take a look the for_each statement , the 2 first arguments are the usual . begin ( ) and .end ( ) but then you see that strange if_ as the third argument .
if_ , like every phoenix statement , returns a functor object created at compile time via template composition ( Expression templates ) .
So with this library , you can create inline functors on the fly without the “ support code ” bloat .
You can use your own functors as long as they ’re lazy which means they do n’t do anything before the operator ( ) is called on them .
Fortunately , the lib also provides wrapper for “ normal ” functions .
Now for that code , nothing much to say for the if_ statement , it ’s just a lazy version of the classic if keyword .
phx :: bind is one of the included wrappers , it creates a lazy version of a function passed as the first argument binded with the arguments passed as additional parameters .
_ 1 and _2 are placeholders , they ’re the actual parameters passed by the algorithm to the functor and phx : : construct returns a new object of the type passed as the template parameter .
Knowing that , we can now understand that “ phx::bind ( std : : isalpha , _1 , phx : : construct ( ) ) ” returns a lazy version of std :: isalpha with the current argument from std :: for_each binded as the first argument to std :: isalpha and an object of type std:: locale binded as the second .
phx :: let ’s only purpose is to create scoped local variables .
phx : : ref returns a reference to the object passed as the parameter .
phx :: at_c is simple , on a std :: pair phx :: at_c returns . first and phx ::at_c . second .
For more information , consult the boost :: phoenix documentation .
With that new tool , we can now more easily than ever use C++ to imitate some FP idioms :
#include
#include
#include
#include

{
namespace phx = boost :: phoenix ;
using namespace phx ::arg_names ;
using namespace phx::local_names ;
std ::vector input ;
input.push_back ( 1 ) ;
input.push_back ( 2 ) ;
input.push_back( 3 ) ;
input.push_back ( 4 ) ;
input.push_back( 5 ) ;
// map ( Make a new sequence with all the elements multiplied by 2 )
std::transform(input.begin( ) ,
input.end ( ) ,
std::ostream_iterator ( std:: cout , “ , “ ) ,
_1 * 2 ) ;
std::cout << std::endl ; // filter (
Make a new sequence containing all the odd numbers ) std::remove_copy_if(input.begin( ) , input.end ( ) , std::ostream_iterator ( std:: cout , “ , “ ) ,
!( _1 % 2 ) ) ;
std::cout << std::endl ; // fold / reduce ( Builds up and returns a value based on the sequence ) // I use std :: string here because it makes it easier to show what is // going on exactly .
std::vector words ;
words.push_back ( “ H ” ) ;
words.push_back ( “e ” ) ;
words.push_back ( “ l ” ) ;
words.push_back ( “ l ” ) ;
words.push_back ( “o ” ) ;
// foldl
std::string result = std::accumulate(words.begin( ) ,
words.end ( ) ,
static_cast ( “ ” ) ,
_1 + _ 2 ) ;
std::cout << result << std::endl ; //foldr result = std::accumulate(words.rbegin( ) , words.rend ( ) , static_cast ( “ ” ) ,
_1 + _ 2 ) ;
std::cout << result << std::endl ; } [ / sourcecode ]
In a near future , we 'll probably see more FP techniques being applied to imperative languages because they can make the code cleaner and more expressive without penalties .
In the case of C++ , like we just saw , they can leverage existing standard library algorithms and make them more convenient .
Take Back the Flag wrote recently about the deception in McCain ’s energy ads ( see “ You ca n’t have your wind energy and drill domestically too “ ) .
Now , Factcheck.org published their in - depth analysis of McCain ’s ad ( as well as Obama ’s stance on renewable energy ) .
Surprise !
McCain ’s plan fails to describe any details for supporting new energy sources .
From Factcheck.org :
“ A McCain ad shows pictures of wind - driven turbines while the narrator says : “ Renewable energy to transform our economy , create jobs and energy independence , that ’s John McCain . ”
But , in fact , his energy plan does n’t specify any new federal spending for renewable energy and says only that he ’d “ rationalize ” existing tax credits to provide incentives .
In the past , however , he ’s opposed extending such tax credits when paid for by tax increases elsewhere . ” ( Factcheck.org )
The second part of McCain ’s ad is also no suprise : lies about Obama ’s support for “ more taxes . ”
I think it ’s time the American people move beyond the awful sterotype that allows Repubicans to lie to Congress and all Americans to enter a war , detain prisoners in violation of international rules of war , strip away our civil and privacy rights , offer no -bid contracts to old business buddies , ignore the demise of our planet , and embarass America on the world stage , then quickly regain the favor of the electorate by blurting “ uh , oh my opponent just supports higher taxes ” in between “ clarification ” statements on their most recent personal indiscretions in a hotel room or airport bathroom .
And these are the politicians “ cutting taxes ” in principle , but in reality , only the top wage earners see the lower burdens .
This double deception is a new addition to a unfortunately long list of reasons why Obama must go on a strong defense and an even stronger offense .

[ 1 ] rhesus monkey infant in one of Harlow 's isolation chambers .
The photograph was taken when the chamber door was raised for the first time after six months of total isolation .
The Pit of despair was a name used by American comparative psychologist Harry Harlow for a device he designed , technically called a vertical chamber apparatus , that he used in experiments on rhesus macaque monkeys at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in the 1970s .
[ 2 ]
The aim of the research was to produce an animal model of depression .
Researcher Stephen Suomi described the device as " little more than a stainless - steel trough with sides that sloped to a rounded bottom " :
A ​3 ⁄ 8 in. wire mesh floor 1 in .
above the bottom of the chamber allowed waste material to drop through the drain and out of holes drilled in the stainless - steel .
The chamber was equipped with a food box and a water - bottle holder , and was covered with a pyramid top [ removed in the accompanying photograph ] , designed to discourage incarcerated subjects from hanging from the upper part of the chamber . [ 3 ]
Harlow had already placed newly born monkeys in isolation chambers for up to one year .
With the " pit of despair , " he placed monkeys between three months and three years old who had already bonded with their mothers in the chamber alone for up to ten weeks .
[ 4 ]
Within a few days , they had stopped moving about and remained huddled in a corner .
Background [ edit ]
Much of Harlow 's scientific career was spent studying maternal bonding , what he described as the " nature of love " .
These experiments involved rearing newborn " total isolates " and monkeys with surrogate mothers , ranging from toweling - covered cones to a machine that modeled abusive mothers by assaulting the baby monkeys with cold air or spikes . [ 5 ]
In 1971 , Harlow 's wife died of cancer and he began to suffer from depression .
He was treated and returned to work but , as Lauren Slater writes , his colleagues noticed a difference in his demeanor . [ 6 ]
He abandoned his research into maternal attachment and developed an interest in isolation and depression .
Harlow 's first experiments involved isolating a monkey in a cage surrounded by steel walls with a small one - way mirror , so the experimenters could look in , but the monkey could not look out .
The only connection the monkey had with the world was when the experimenters ' hands changed his bedding or delivered fresh water and food .
Baby monkeys were placed in these boxes soon after birth ; four were left for 30 days , four for six months , and four for a year .
After 30 days , the " total isolates " , as they were called , were found to be " enormously disturbed " .
After being isolated for a year , they barely moved , did not explore or play , and were incapable of having sexual relations .
When placed with other monkeys for a daily play session , they were badly bullied .
Two of them refused to eat and starved themselves to death . [ 7 ]
Harlow also wanted to test how isolation would affect parenting skills , but the isolates were unable to mate .
Artificial insemination had not then been developed ; instead , Harlow devised what he called a " rape rack " , to which the female isolates were tied in normal monkey mating posture .
He found that , just as they were incapable of having sexual relations , they were also unable to parent their offspring , either abusing or neglecting them .
" Not even in our most devious dreams could we have designed a surrogate as evil as these real monkey mothers were " , he wrote . [ 8 ]
Having no social experience themselves , they were incapable of appropriate social interaction .
One mother held her baby 's face to the floor and chewed off his feet and fingers .
Another crushed her baby 's head .
Most of them simply ignored their offspring . [ 8 ]
These experiments showed Harlow what total and partial isolation did to developing monkeys , but he felt he had not captured the essence of depression , which he believed was characterized by feelings of loneliness , helplessness , and a sense of being trapped , or being " sunk in a well of despair " , he said . [ 8 ]
Vertical chamber apparatus [ edit ]
Harlow 's vertical chamber apparatus
The technical name for the new depression chamber was " vertical chamber apparatus " , though Harlow himself insisted on calling it the " pit of despair " .
He had at first wanted to call it the " dungeon of despair " , and also used terms like " well of despair " , and " well of loneliness " .
Blum writes that his colleagues tried to persuade him not to use such descriptive terms , that a less visual name would be easier , politically speaking .
Gene Sackett of the University of Washington in Seattle , one of Harlow 's doctoral students who went on to conduct additional deprivation studies , said , " He first wanted to call it a dungeon of despair .
Can you imagine the reaction to that ? " [ 9 ]
Most of the monkeys placed inside it were at least three months old and had already bonded with others .
The point of the experiment was to break those bonds in order to create the symptoms of depression .
The chamber was a small , metal , inverted pyramid , with slippery sides , slanting down to a point .
The monkey was placed in the point .
The opening was covered with mesh .
The monkeys would spend the first day or two trying to climb up the slippery sides .
After a few days , they gave up .
Harlow wrote , " most subjects typically assume a hunched position in a corner of the bottom of the apparatus .
One might presume at this point that they find their situation to be hopeless . " [ 10 ] Stephen J. Suomi , another of Harlow 's doctoral students , placed some monkeys in the chamber in 1970 for his PhD .
He wrote that he could find no monkey who had any defense against it .
Even the happiest monkeys came out damaged .
Reaction [ edit ]
The experiments were condemned , both at the time and later , from within the scientific community and elsewhere in academia .
In 1974 , American literary critic Wayne C. Booth wrote that " Harry Harlow and his colleagues go on torturing their nonhuman primates decade after decade , invariably proving what we all knew in advance — that social creatures can be destroyed by destroying their social ties . "
He writes that Harlow made no mention of the criticism of the morality of his work . [ 11 ]
Charles Snowdon , a junior member of the faculty at the time , who became head of psychology at Wisconsin , said that Harlow had himself been very depressed by his wife 's cancer .
Snowdon was appalled by the design of the vertical chambers .
He asked Suomi why they were using them , and Harlow replied , " Because that 's how it feels when you 're depressed . " [ 12 ] Leonard Rosenblum , who studied under Harlow , told Lauren Slater that Harlow enjoyed using shocking terms for his apparatus because " he always wanted to get a rise out of people " . [ 13 ]
Another of Harlow 's students , William Mason , who also conducted deprivation experiments elsewhere , [ 14 ] said that Harlow " kept this going to the point where it was clear to many people that the work was really violating ordinary sensibilities , that anybody with respect for life or people would find this offensive .
It 's as if he sat down and said , ' I 'm only going to be around another ten years .
What I 'd like to do , then , is leave a great big mess behind . '
If that was his aim , he did a perfect job . " [ 15 ]

Booth is explicitly discussing this experiment .
His next sentence is , " His most recent outrage consists of placing monkeys in " solitary " for twenty days — what he calls a " vertical chamber apparatus ... designed on an intuitive basis " to produce " a state of helplessness and hopelessness , sunken in a well of despair " .

EXCLUSIVE :
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has directed nearly $ 100,000 from her political action committee to her husband ’s real estate and investment firm over the past decade , a practice of paying a spouse with political donations that she supported banning last year .
Financial Leasing Services Inc. ( FLS ) , owned by Paul F. Pelosi , has received $ 99,000 in rent , utilities and accounting fees from the speaker ’s “ PAC to the Future ” over the PAC ’s nine - year history .
The payments have quadrupled since Mr. Pelosi took over as treasurer of his wife ’s committee in 2007 , Federal Election Commission records show .
FLS is on track to take in $ 48,000 in payments this year alone - eight times as much as it received annually from 2000 to 2005 , when the committee was run by another treasurer .
Lawmakers ’ frequent use of campaign donations to pay relatives emerged as an issue in the 2006 election campaigns , when the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal gave Democrats fodder to criticize Republicans such as former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay of Texas and Rep. John T. Doolittle of California for putting their wives on their campaign and PAC payrolls for fundraising work .

Last year , Mrs. Pelosi supported a bill that would have banned members of Congress from putting spouses on their campaign staffs .
The bill - which passed the House in a voice vote but did not get out of a Senate committee - banned not only direct payments by congressional campaign committees and PACs to spouses for services including consulting and fundraising , but also “ indirect compensation , ” such as payments to companies that employ spouses .
“ Democrats are committed to reforming the way Washington does business , ” Mrs. Pelosi said in a press release at the time .

Schiff ’s bill will help us accomplish that goal by increasing transparency in election campaigns and preventing the misuse of funds . ”
Last week , Mrs. Pelosi ’s office said the payments to her husband ’s firm were perfectly legal , insisting she is compensating her husband at fair market value for the work his firm has performed for the PAC .
But ethical watchdogs said the arrangement sends the wrong message .
“ It ’s problematic , ” said Melanie Sloan , executive director of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington ( CREW ) , a nonprofit ethics and watchdog group .
“ From what I understand , Mr. Pelosi does n’t need the money , but this is n’t the issue . …
As speaker of the House , it sends the wrong message .
She should n’t be putting family members on the payroll . ”
A senior adviser to Mrs. Pelosi described the payments to FLS as “ business expenses . ”

“ She ’s followed all the appropriate rules and regulations in terms of records and paperwork , ” said Brendan Daly , Mrs. Pelosi ’s spokesman .
“ When [ former treasurer ]
Leo McCarthy became ill , she thought that it was best that that firm did the accounting and she ’s paid fair market value in San Francisco . ”
Between 1999 and 2006 , FLS collected $ 500 per month to cover rent , utilities and equipment for the leadership PAC , according to the FEC records .
The PAC ’s address is listed as a personal mailbox in San Francisco , across the street from FLS ’s Montgomery Street office building , but the rent payments went to an office space .
In early 2007 , the PAC ’s treasurer , Leo T. McCarthy , former Democratic speaker of the state assembly and lieutenant governor in California , died .
Mr. Pelosi took over as treasurer and his company ’s PAC payouts rose .
At that point , FLS started charging the PAC $ 24,000 per year for accounting work .
In January 2008 , the PAC ’s rent - paid to FLS - also quadrupled from $ 500 to $ 2,000 per month .
Mr. McCarthy , the previous treasurer , had done the work as a volunteer , according to FEC documents and Jennifer Crider , a senior adviser to Mrs. Pelosi and spokeswoman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee .
She said FLS ’ accounting fees are in line with costs for other PACs .
The jump in rent was an adjustment to reflect San Francisco ’s pricey real estate market , Miss Crider said .
The rent was adjusted to $ 1,250 per month , with $ 750 in back rent to reflect that the rent should have been increased in mid-2007 .
This was the first increase since the PAC was established in mid-1999 , records show .
Over the first six months of 2008 , FLS was the largest vendor for Mrs. Pelosi ’s PAC .
Brian Wolff , a political consultant , is the second - largest vendor , bringing in $ 22,500 this year .
FLS ’ payments represent 11 percent of the $ 213,900 the PAC raised over the first half of this year , according to the FEC documents .
PACs , which are designed to help politicians contribute to other candidates and build influence with colleagues , operate under lighter restrictions than traditional campaign committees .
Meredith McGehee , policy director at the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center , said putting family members on a PAC payroll is bound to raise questions and , in some cases , allow for abuse .
“ The reality is that under the current system , PACs are rife with self - dealing transactions , ” she said .
“ The laws and regulations could and should be strengthened .
“ There is a point now that you ’re starting to talk about real money , ” she said of Mrs. Pelosi ’s PAC .
“ This is not just a mom-and - pop operation and any self - dealing transaction by a member of Congress is going to get scrutiny , particularly with large amounts of money and prominent members . ”
It is illegal for members of Congress to hire family members to work on their official staff , but hiring relatives to work on a campaign or PAC is legal .
To be sure , many political action committees employ or work with family businesses .
Last year , CREW found that 19 members of Congress used campaign committees or PACs to purchase services from a family member between 2002 and 2006 .
Mrs. Pelosi’s PACs have been in trouble before .
In 2004 , one of her political action committees , Team Majority , was fined $ 21,000 by the FEC for accepting donations over federal limits .
It was one of two PACs she operated at the same time .
The Team Majority PAC was closed shortly after the fine was levied .

Windows 1.0
The world 's most ubiquitous operating system was not always so .
The evolution of Windows was often uncertain and precarious .
Its success was symbiotic with advancements in processor speed and memory capacity , and Microsoft relied heavily on third - party software to bridge the gap between concept and consumer .
Tour the 23 - year history of the Windows OS through these screenshots .
Left : Microsoft 's first graphical user interface – Windows 1.0 – was n't released until November 1985 , nearly two years after Apple introduced the Mac .
Due to legal issues with Apple , Gates could n't include key features like overlapping windows and a trash can .
Looking at it now , it 's not surprising it was a flop .
Windows 1.0 was more an extension of MS - DOS than its own operating system , but it did allow limited multitasking and mouse support .
Windows 2.0
Gates soon signed a licensing agreement with Apple to use some of the Macintosh GUI elements in Windows .
It was a huge coup for Gates , especially when Apple later took him to court for 170 counts of copyright infringement after Windows 2.0 was released .
Windows 2.0 had fully realized icons and overlapping windows , but all the alleged infringements were eventually dismissed .
In addition to the face lift , version 2.0 also enjoyed some key program support .
Early versions of Word and Excel used Windows for their interfaces , even though Windows closed when the programs were exited .
Aldus PageMaker , a popular desktop - publishing program that had previously run only on the Mac , also debuted for Windows 2.0 .
This was a pivotal moment for Windows , as it greatly expanded the operating system 's usefulness and its market .
Windows 3.0
Released in 1990 , Windows 3.0 was a complete overhaul .
A new file - management system and enhanced graphics finally made the Windows PC a competitor to the Mac – six years on .
The OS had a new look , and protected and enhanced operating modes for more efficient memory handling .
Windows 3.0 was a huge success , selling 10 million copies in two years .
Developers began writing a ton of third - party software – a huge incentive for consumers to buy Windows .
The sudden influx of money changed Microsoft 's direction and narrowed its focus on the OS .
Windows 3.11
Mainly a polish of version 3.0 , Windows 3.11 included support for TrueType scalable fonts , multimedia capabilities and Object Linking and Embedding .
A host of other fixes and updates released since 3.0 were also wrapped into 3.11 .
Windows 3.11 NT
A much more powerful version of Windows and developed independently from the consumer version of 3.11 , NT was developed for businesses and engineers who needed more sophistication in their OS .
Unlike 3.11 , NT was written for 32 - bit processors .
Unfortunately , there was little hardware support .
Developers did n't want the trouble of making their devices compatible with NT because it was so complex and the OS captured only a small segment of the market .
Windows 95
Windows 95 brought computing to the masses , and served as an introduction to Windows and the world of computers for a vast number of people .
Packaged with Internet Explorer , Windows 95 also became a common portal to the web .
Windows 95 marked the debut of the Start button and the taskbar , which remain Windows fixtures today .
Windows 95 was also emblematic of Microsoft 's everlasting struggle with backward compatibility .
Much of the architecture from 3.11 – as well as some of the design flaws – were ported to Windows 95 , and while some parts ran in 32 - bit mode , others did not , leaving the OS stretched between the past and the present .
Most users were ignorant of these issues , but they laid the groundwork for system instabilities and constant security updates .
Windows 98
More of a stability upgrade to Windows 95 than a new OS , Win 98 included support for multiple monitors , WebTV and larger file partitions thanks to the new FAT32 file system .
Win 98 was also the version of Windows to incorporate Internet Explorer into its GUI , fomenting the famous antitrust cases against Microsoft .
Windows 98 Second Edition was released a short time later , adding , among other things , the internet connection sharing function .
Windows 2000
Released in February 2000 , Win 2 K was an upgrade to the NT line of Windows .
It was the first instance of Windows to offer automatic updates over the internet .
Windows Millennium Edition
Nicknamed " Mistake Edition , " this build of Windows was particularly problematic .
With infamous stability issues , Windows ME was released quickly before Windows XP and given little support .
The interface inexplicably degraded with every new program installed , but the GUI was , however , a pleasing step forward from Win 98 , or even Win 2 K , and anticipated the potential of XP .
Windows XP
Released in 2001 , XP merged the NT architecture with the consumer - friendly interfaces of the 95/98 / ME versions of Windows .
While coming under fire for security , XP was a vast improvement in many areas , including file management , speed and stability .
The GUI was a significant upgrade and made the OS more palatable and accessible to less - experienced users .
Windows Vista
Released to consumers in January 2007 with great fanfare , Vista sported a brand new GUI full of slick animations and transparencies .
But it got mixed reviews from the tech press ( including us ) and sales took a hit when manufacturers failed to produce Vista - ready versions of their software and hardware in a timely manner .
Those buying new PCs got Vista — and its compatibility headaches — pre-installed , but many Windows users decided to stay with the aging Windows XP a little longer .
Vista Service Pack 1 , a software patch issued by Microsoft to correct many of Vista 's foibles , followed 14 months later in March 2008 .
Windows 7 , the successor to Windows Vista , is n't due until 2009 , but development is well under way .
Microsoft publicly demonstrated the next version of Windows at a developer conference in October , showing off a new system - wide search tool , an updated taskbar and new tools that make it easier to connect to devices and to other computers on the network .
By and large , however , Windows 7 borrows quite a bit of its visual flair from Vista ( and still more from Mac OS X ) while doing away with many of the older OS 's legendary annoyances , bugs and nagging pop-ups .

Regular Expressions Basics
What are Regular Expressions ?
Regular expressions ( which will now be referred to as " regexes " ) are basically pattern matching inside of text .
They use special syntax and concepts in order to obtain information from a string .
Many programming languages have some sort of support for regexes , because of the sheer usefulness of them .
Not only can patterns be used to validate that a certain pattern exists in a string , but they can also be used to physically extract matched portions and make them usable in your PHP code .
Although it 's not mentioned in this tutorial , keep it in mind as you 're reading it , because it 's the main focus of the next tutorial in the series .
How are they different from regular string searching functions ?
Regular string searching functions like strpos ( ) and str_replace ( ) are very limited in what they can actually do .
They 're great for replacing a single character or two , or changing ' ham ' to ' turkey ' in a recipe , but that 's about all they can do .
If you want to see if a string contained all numbers ( and possibly commas to separate the numbers ) , you 'd have to create some convoluted processing routine along the lines of :
<? php $ string = " 731,489,392,222 " ; foreach ( str_split ( $ string ) as $ char ) { if ( !is_numeric ( $ char ) or $ str != ' , ' ) { $ bad = true ; } } if ( !$ bad ) { .... } ?>
That 's where the power of regexes comes into play .
They have amazing capabilities in terms of analyzing strings for certain patterns and matches .
Why bother ?
I can make parsing routines that do the job just fine .
This question is actually quite commonly asked for first - time regex users .
Regular expressions have quite a learning curve , and they have a very intricate syntax , but they are one of the most powerful ways to get PHP to handle data precisely as you want .
Sometimes , the kinds of data and patterns that regular expressions can parse are simply not possible to emulate with regular string handling functions .
Regexes can be quite daunting at first , but when they 're broken up into individual parts and their syntax is analyzed , they 're actually quite simple .
Well , now it 's time for you to learn how to create regular expressions of your very own .
Note :
This tutorial is just covering regular expression syntax .
Actual pattern matching , substitution , and handling of results in PHP will be covered in subsequent tutorials .
Also , this tutorial set covers Perl - Compatible Regular Expressions ( PCRE ) , for reasons which will be discussed later .
Creating Your Own Patterns
Before we start interpreting regular expression syntax , it would be a good idea to first see what a pattern looks like .
A pattern must ALWAYS have an opening delimiter and an ending delimiter to " enclose " the pattern so the engine knows where to stop and for separating modifiers from the rest of the pattern , which will be discussed later on in the tutorial .
The most commonly seen delimiter is / , but it 's often advisable to use some obscure character that will never end up in one of your patterns ( such as ` , # , or ! ) .
For most of the examples in this tutorial , I 'll be using / as my delimiter , simply because it 's conventional , but you can use any character really .
Now that we have delimiters out of the way , let 's look at one of the most simple patterns .
/ abc/
When a plain letter is shown in a regular expression , it 's interpreted as just that -- a plain letter .
This pattern would match ANY string containing a ' abc ' in that order .
Not very useful , but it illustrates some basic principles .
Notice how the part you want matched ( ' abc ' ) is contained within the delimiters ?
That 's how every pattern has to be formatted , otherwise it simply wo n't work .
More Than Plain Letters
Being able to throw some plain letters inside of / / is great , but you could just use your trusty strpos ( ) for that .
Where the real power of regular expressions comes in is with metacharacters .
These characters do n't match themselves , but actually " misbehave " a bit .
Some misbehave so much that they actually cause other characters to misbehave .
The metacharacters in regular expressions are :
\ | . ( ) [ ] { } ^ $ + ?
In order to actually match these characters literally , you 'd need to add a backslash before them .
So , by that statement , in order to match a literal . , you could use the following pattern :
/\./
Notice once again the delimiters (/ / ) , and the backslash which comes before the metacharacter to " de- meta " it .
But a bit of an interesting point to note would be that in order to match a literal backslash , you 'd need to put 2 backslashes , since the backslash itself is a metacharacter .
/\\/
How Metacharacters
Work
This section will be completely devoted to an in - depth explanation of each of the metacharacters , and how they act when used in a pattern .
The Catch - All Metacharacter (.)
The . is actually a pretty simple concept .
The .
metacharacter matches ANY character except for a newline (
) , but that can be modified ( we 'll explain that much later ) .
A simple demonstration of the .
at work would be in a pattern like :
/ c.t/
This pattern would match cat , cut , cbt , cet , czt , c4t , and so on , but not caat because there 's only one dot (. ) in the pattern .
It 's important to note that .
only matches ONE character , until quantifiers are introduced .
The Anchoring Metacharacters ( ^ $ )
Sometimes you 'll need to actually make sure that a string begins or ends with a certain character .
That 's where ^ and $ come in .
The ^ character matches the beginning point of a string .
It does n't actually match a literal character , but instead , it matches a boundary .
To make sure that a string starts with a Z , you could apply the following pattern :
/ ^Z /
The $ character is essentially the same as the ^ character , except it matches the end of a string .
To make sure that a string ended with a g , you 'd use :
/ g$ /
Note how the $ came after the g , unlike in the pattern with ^ .
This is because the pattern is literally telling the regex engine " a g followed by the end of the string boundary " , not the other way around .
In fact , it would make little sense , because you can't have characters after the end of a string .
The only way that characters can appear after a $ is if you have your regular expression multi-line mode .
It will be discussed in depth later on in this tutorial , but keep in mind that the meaning of ^ and $ can change sometimes .
These two metacharacters can also be used simultaneously in a pattern , and in fact , that 's often how they are used .
It would probably help to show an example :
/ ^abc$ /
This pattern , after being taken apart , is quite simple .
It is saying that a string must begin , then match a ' abc ' , then match the end .
Basically , the string must be ' abc ' in order to match .
The Grouping Metacharacters ( ( ) )
The ( and ) characters are both used in a concept called grouping .
The ( character begins a group , and the ) character ends it .
Every ( must have a closing ) .
This comes into play not only in capturing things to be used later , but it also is the only way to make other metacharacters operate on more than one character .
Normally , each character is its own little subpattern on which other metacharacters can operate , but the parentheses change that .
They allow more ' complex ' subpatterns to be made .
Any reference to the word subpattern from now on means a single character subpattern or a parenthesized group .
Any examples show right now would be rather pointless , but here 's one :
/( abc ) /
Right now , this would match the same as / abc / , but that 's going to change after the explanation of other metacharacters .
Another use of grouping is to create backreferences , which actually allow you to match things based on what previous groups captured .
This comes into play in substitution and more advanced syntax , but keep it in mind .
The Quantifying Metacharacters ( * + ? { } )
The quantifiers are among the most important regex metacharacters .
They dictate how often a certain letter ( or group ! ) can or must appear .
They certainly make patterns more dynamic than just matching single characters .
The * quantifier says that the preceding subpattern must appear 0 or more times , which basically means that it can appear , and if it does , it does n't matter how many there are .
It 's often used to account for random whitespace in a string , but it has other uses as well .
For now , let 's look at a simple pattern :
/ ab*c/
This pattern would match ac , abc , abbc , abbbc , etc .
If you want to have * operate on more than one character , you 'd need to use those grouping metacharacters that were mentioned earlier ( I told you they 'd come in handy ! ) :
/ a( bcd ) */
This would match a , abcd , abcdbcd , abcdbcdbcd , and so on .
The + quantifier operates just like the * , except it dictates that the preceding subpattern must appear one or more times .
It tells the Engine that a certain subpattern must appear , and if it does , it can repeat indefinitely .
/ c.+t/
Here , you can see some of the real power of quantifiers .
They can be used with any character , including metacharacters like the dot , in this case .
This pattern would match cat , caaaaat , cbbbajsduasuut , cjkallskt , etc .
The ?
quantifier makes the preceding subpattern optional , meaning the preceding group can appear zero or one times .
/ a( bcd ) ?e/
This would match either abcde or ae , because the ?
makes the ( bcd ) subpattern optional .
The { and } metacharacters are used to specify even more exact quantities for subpatterns .
They have several different syntax options to accomplish different things , and they are as follows :
/ a( bcd ) { 2}e/ # matches abcdbcde because { 2} specifies EXACTLY 2 matches / a( bcd ) {2,3}e / # matches abcdbcde or abcdbcdbcde because { 2,3} means 2 or 3 matches , inclusive / a( bcd ) { 2 , }e / # matches any string with a , ' bcd ' repeated AT LEAST 2 times , and an e. { 2 , } represents a minimum
By the way , you can't just specify a maximum without a minimum ( like { , 2} ) .
If you wanted a maximum , you could say { 1 , max} .
Also , an interesting note is that all of the other quantifiers can somehow be represented in terms of { } :
/ a( bcd ) *e/ is equal to / a( bcd ) {0 , }e / / a( bcd ) +e/ is equal to / a( bcd ) { 1, }e / / a( bcd ) ?e/ is equal to / a( bcd ) { 0,1}e /
The * , + , and ?
quantifiers are often preferred for readability though .
It 's important to note that without using the anchoring metacharacters , ^ and $ , a pattern will bring back matches in a string even if there are other characters present .
For example , in the following string :
drtabcabcabcpdl
The following pattern would indeed bring back a positive match :
/ ab*c/
If you wanted to ensure that a string contains ONLY a certain pattern , you 'd need to anchor it :
/ ^ab*c$ /
Now the pattern would only match a , any number of b's , and a c .
The Alternation Metacharacter ( | )
The alternation metacharacter is basically equivalent to or in PHP ( which is why it looks so much like || ) .
It tells the Engine to match the stuff separated by | , starting from left to right .
The instant that it finds something in the alternation , it breaks out and continues with the pattern .
You 'll most often use the grouping metacharacters to tell the | which strings to actually operate on , otherwise it could have quite unexpected results .
The alternation metacharacter operates as far as the innermost enclosing parentheses .
/ ( yes ) |( no ) /
That would match either ' yes ' or ' no ' in its entirety , but it could have different results if the grouping was left out .
It 's highly recommended to keep track of how you group things , since it can completely change how the Engine looks at a pattern .
Just to help you visualize an example of where grouping in alternation is important to keep track of , I 'll show you the following pattern :
/ prob|n|r|l|ate /
This pattern would actually match ' prob ' , 'n ' , 'r ' , 'l ' , or ' ate ' .
If you wanted to match probate , pronate , prorate , and prolate , you 'd use :
/ pro(b|n|r|l ) ate /
The Character Class Metacharacters ( [ ] )
Ah , finally we 've reached character classes .
These are extremely powerful regex concepts to learn and understand , so read this section over a few times if it does n't click .
Character classes tell the Engine to match any character contained within [ ] as one character .
I think it would be best to start off with a basic example , such as :
/c[aeiou ]t/
This regex would match cat , cet , cit , cot , and cut , because the [ aeiou ] class contains those characters in between the c and the t .
If I changed the character class to [ au ] , it would only match cat and cut .
Now , it 's not to say that you could n't accomplish the same thing with the alternation metacharacter , but it becomes very unwieldy and most of the " cool " functionality of character classes ( which will be covered right after this ) can't be achieved with it .
The previous pattern could have been written as :
/c(a|e|i|o|u )t/
But who actually wants to type that ?
The cool part about character classes is ranges .
Inside of a character class , you can specify ranges ( separated by a -) to match .
If you wanted to match a string containing any 5 digit number , you could write this pattern :
/ ( [ 0 - 9 ] {5 } ) /
Acceptable ranges are a -z , A - Z , 0 - 9 , and some other ranges involving the actual " value " of certain characters , but that 's a bit advanced .
Another important thing to mention is that ranges can be " stacked " inside of a single class .
The following example illustrates that .
/ ^[ a -zA - Z0 - 9 _ ] +$ /
That pattern would dictate that a string must contain any amount of only alphanumeric characters and the underscore ( _ ) , due to the anchors ( ^ and $ ) , the quantifier (+ ) , and the character class ( [ a - zA - Z0 - 9 _ ] ) .
There are also " shortcut " character classes which the Engine understands automatically .
They are as follows :
/\d/ #matches any digit / \D/ #matches any NON - DIGIT / \w / # matches any word character ( which includes the underscore and digits , so it 's like [ a - zA - Z0 - 9 _ ] ) /\W/ #matches any NON - WORD character / \s/ #matches any whitespace character like a literal space , a tab , and a newline / \S / #matches any NON - WHITESPACE character
These shortcuts can be used both inside and outside of actual character classes , meaning they can appear anywhere in a pattern .
So , with this knowledge , we can shorten that " match 5 digits " pattern to :
/\d{5} /
Learn the shortcuts , as they 'll help you a lot when you 're actually writing patterns of your own .
An example of using a shortcut inside of a character class would be :
/^[ a - zA - Z\s ] +$/
This pattern would match a string containing a-z , A - Z , and any space characters .
There are also some other tiny nuances with character classes that you should really familiarize yourself with .
If a character class starts with a ^ , it no longer means the beginning of the string , but instead , it acts as !
( NOT ) does in PHP .
It negates the character class .
/ c[ ^au ]t/
That would match cbt , c$t , c!t , crt , etc , but not cat and cut .
Another interesting point to mention is that the .
loses its metacharacter properties inside of a character class , meaning you can use it as a literal period inside of a class .
Metacharacter Conclusion
That just about sums it up for the metacharacters ( there 's still some advanced syntax involving a few metacharacters , but it 's nothing to worry about yet ) .
Remember that all of these metacharacters can be used at once in a pattern , allowing you full control of how you match your string .
Quantifier Greediness
I felt that this topic deserved a page of its own .
When using quantifiers , there is a concept known as greediness and laziness which can cause a lot of confusion for newcomers to regular expressions .
What is greediness ?
Greediness is how the Engine interprets the " jurisdiction " of a quantifier .
Let me set up a quick scenario :
You have the string ' exasperate ' .
You run the following pattern on it :
/e(.*)e/
Believe it or not , but that (.*) actually matches xasperat instead of xasp as you may have thought .
The regular behavior for quantifiers is to gobble up as many characters as it possibly can , hence greediness .
It wants to grab as many characters as it can possibly get away with and still match .
That 's why it goes right past the second e in exasperate and keeps on matching until it reaches the last possible e it can .
Making the Match Lazy
This default behavior can be changed by adding a ? after a quantifier .
In order to have (.*) match ' xasp ' in the previous scenario , you could use :
/e(.*?)e/
That tells the engine to take as much as it needs to succeed on the match , and nothing more .
Another way that you might see greediness being countered is by using negative character classes , but that only works if there 's only one character you want to prevent greediness from .
For example , in an HTML - matching pattern , you wanted to get the text in a certain < p > tag , which just so happens to be followed by another < p > , like in this tiny snippet :
< p id =" test " >
p1</p> < p id =" test " >
p2</p>
You could write your pattern like this :
! < p id =" test " >(.+)</p>!
This would , not surprisingly , gobble up BOTH < p > tags , even though it 's really mismatching the closing tag .
The Engine does n't realize that , and it likes being greedy , so it does .
You could rewrite the pattern as :
! < p id =" test " >(.+? )</p>!
Or , you could use a negative character class and say :
! < p id =" test " >( [ ^ <]+)</p >!
The latter is often slightly quicker in terms of execution speed , but can be more difficult to understand .
Another great use for negative character classes is when you 're trying to get the information from a specific HTML tag 's attribute .
The following pattern would get an img tag 's src attribute .
!<img ( .+? ) src= " ( [ ^ " ] + ) " (.*? ) />!
Now , that 's a really complicated pattern , but when you break it down , it 's actually quite simple .
First , you want to match the literal pattern ' < img ' .
Then , you match any amount of characters ( non-greedy ) , until you reach the src attribute .
Then , you use a negative character class ( [ ^ " ]+ ) in order to grab everything up to the ending " .
Then you have any amount of characters , followed by the standard way to close an img tag .
The concept of greediness and laziness is very important to learn in order to get the results you want when we actually get to using the patterns matched ( that 's the subject of the next tutorial , actually ) .
Re-read this page as many times as it takes until you completely understand the concept .
Pattern Modifiers
Remember when I was talking about reasons why a regular expression must have delimiters ?
It 's not only to contain the regular expression , but it's also to allow for use of special pattern modifiers that go after the ending delimiter .
These allow you to modify how the Engine actually views your pattern .
In this section , I 'm going to go over every modifier that 's commonly used in match regexes .
In the next tutorial , when substitution is covered , I 'll go over the modifiers that work for substitution , as there are some differences .
The Insensitivity Modifier ( i )
If you use the // i modifier , case insensitivity is enabled for the entire regular expression .
Take , for example , the following regular expression :
/ super /
That would match ' super ' , but not ' SuPeR ' or ' SUPER ' .
In order to have it match all of those possibilities , you could use a lot of alternation or some clever character classes , or you could just apply the i modifier :
/ super /i
Note how the i went AFTER the closing delimiter .
The Newline Match Modifier ( s )
Back when I explained the Catch - All Modifier , . , I said that it would NOT match newlines .
The //s modifier allows it do to so .
Consider the following scenario .
You have a file with the following contents :
something // start STUFF !
some more stuff ...
//end
If you wanted everything between those two comments ( // start and //end ) , you would write your regex like this :
!//start(.+?)//end!s
Now , pay close attention to what I did .
Since I actually needed to use the / character in my pattern , it made no sense to use it as the delimiter , because then it would need to be escaped every time I used it ( /\/\/start(.+?)\/\/end/s ) , and it 's incredibly hard to read , so I used an exclamation point as the delimiter .
The s modifier on the end allows the pattern to match all of that stuff in between the two comments even though they 're on separate lines .
The Multiline Mode Modifier ( m )
This modifier is kind of strange , to be honest .
It actually changes the behavior of those two anchoring metacharacters ( ^ and $ ) .
Normally , they 'd match at the beginning and end of a string , respectively , but with the // m modifier , they actually match next to
( newlines ) .
You probably wo n't find yourself using this too often , unless you maybe wanted to ensure that every line in a file had , for example , only 5 digits per line :
/ ^\d{5}$ /m
The Freespace Modifier ( x )
This is more of an advanced modifier , and it makes the Engine ignore ANY whitespace inside a regex .
This allows you to actually create comments inside of a regex and freely space it to make it easier on the eyes .
For example , the following regex ( which illustrates some concepts that I have n't gone over yet , but do n't worry about it , it 's just to demonstrate free spacing ) :
/\b( \w\S+ ) ( \s+\1)+\b/i
Can be written as :
/ /b #word boundary ( \w\S+ ) # word " chunk " ( \s+ # whitespace \ 1 # same word " chunk " ) + #repeat if necessary \b #boundary / xi
Certainly more readable , right ?
Comments can be placed on the end of the line with a # and then your remarks .
Where to Find More Modifiers
You can always look at http://us3.php.net/manual/en/reference.pcre.pattern.modifiers.php in order to see every supported pattern modifier .
Many of these are hardly used , so I deemed it unnecessary to show them all to you , but if ever need to look one up , you can do it on that page .
Remember , always consult the manual when you 're in doubt about something .
Also , keep in mind that there 's actually a modifier that can ONLY be used when substituting , and I 'll introduce it in the next tutorial , since you would n't be able to really visualize what it could do yet .
PCRE vs. POSIX
This is more of a technical part of the tutorial that I felt should be covered ( thanks zanus ! ) .
There are actually two " flavors " , if you will , of regular expressions supported by PHP .
They are Perl - Compatible Regular Expressions ( PCRE ) and POSIX Extended regular expressions .
PCRE is much more robust than POSIX , and it can do so many more things that POSIX simply can't even come close to .
They 're VERY similar in syntax ( for the most part , until you get to advanced syntax , which will be in a later tutorial ) , but PCRE has a lot more functionality .
I thought that I 'd outline some of those differences here , so you know why you should most certainly learn PCRE over POSIX .
Binary data
PCRE can be used on binary data , whereas POSIX cannot .
PCRE can function with all of the individual bytes and characters of any string , be it text or binary , which is a huge plus .
Speed
POSIX has the potential to be much slower than PCRE .
I 'm not going to go into much more detail than that because I 'd rather not confuse people .
Modifiers and Delimiter
POSIX does not support ANY modifiers on their patterns , but they also do not use delimiters like PCRE .
The only option that you have with POSIX is case - insensitivity , but it even uses a completely different function , which I could hardly call optimal .
PCRE 's modifiers extend the regex language 's capabilities in countless ways .
Deprecation in PHP6
Here 's one of the most important reasons to not use POSIX .
POSIX regexes and the related functions ( ereg ( ) , eregi ( ) , ereg_replace ( ) , and eregi_replace ( ) ) will no longer be a part of PHP6 .
They will be available ONLY in an extension through PECL ( which is basically PHP extensions written directly in C for optimization ) .
Many people wo n't be able to add this extension , especially on shared hosts , so POSIX is pretty much pointless to learn .
Usability in Perl
PCRE regular expressions were modeled after Perl 's regular expression engine ( hence Perl - Compatible ) , and can often be ported directly over to Perl , provided you know how to actually use regular expressions in Perl .
Many of today 's languages that support regular expressions also use some form of PCRE , so you only need to learn one flavor of regex in order to use it in many different languages .
Putting it All Together
Well , now that we have the basic syntax out of the way , I 'm going to put some example patterns up for you to analyze , and then show you exactly what they do .
/^\w +:( \s+\w+ ) \s+\d+$ /m
Match a word , a colon , a space , a word , a space , and some digits on every line
/ pro(b|n|r|l ) ate /
i
Matches probate , pronate , prorate , prolate , without case sensitivity
/^[+-]?\d+$ /
Matches an integer which can have + or - ( or even nothing ) in front of it .
It can also have leading zeros because 0 is included in \d .
~//start
(.+?)
//end~is
Matches // start , a newline , any amount of characters on any amount of lines ( //s modifier ) , a newline , and //end
These are just some example patterns .
When I get into advanced syntax , you 'll be able to create much more intricate patterns , such as :
/( \d ) ( \d{3} ) ( ?!\d ) / replacement : $ 1 , $ 2
I hope some of these basic patterns have gotten you more interested in pursuing regular expressions . ;)
Conclusion and Future Tutorials
This tutorial was meant to be a ( comprehensive ) tutorial of the most basic regular expression syntax .
There are still many more advanced concepts , but that will be the subject of maybe the 3rd or 4th tutorial in this set .
The next tutorial will involve actually applying these patterns in PHP , creating matches and using the grouping metacharacters to create match groups , substitution , and some other concepts directly related to regex use in PHP .
Then , I 'll cover all of the advanced concepts in order to help you create more efficient and more specific patterns .
Just to show you the utility of regular expressions , I actually had to use one to correct some of the tags that I used to show you the regular expressions .
It looked a bit like this :
!\[ code ( =php ) ?\ ] (.+? ) \[/ code\ ]!is
That found all of the code tags for me , so I could easily use a replacement pattern to make them into the proper tags . ;)

The Defense Department 's geeks are spooked by a rapidly spreading worm crawling across their networks .
So they 've suspended the use of so - called thumb drives , CDs , flash media cards , and all other removable data storage devices from their nets , to try to keep the worm from multiplying any further .
The ban comes from the commander of U.S. Strategic Command , according to an internal Army e-mail .
It applies to both the secret SIPR and unclassified NIPR nets .
The suspension , which includes everything from external hard drives to " floppy disks , " is supposed to take effect " immediately . "
Similar notices went out to the other military services .
In some organizations , the ban would be only a minor inconvenience .
But the military relies heavily on such drives to store information .
Bandwidth is often scarce out in the field .
Networks are often considered unreliable .
Takeaway storage is used constantly as a substitute .
The problem , according to a second Army e-mail , was prompted by a " virus called Agent.btz . "
That 's a variation of the " SillyFDC " worm , which spreads by copying itself to thumb drives and the like .
When that drive or disk is plugged into a second computer , the worm replicates itself again — this time on the PC .
" From there , it automatically downloads code from another location .
And that code could be pretty much anything , " says Ryan Olson , director of rapid response for the iDefense computer security firm .
SillyFDC has been around , in various forms , since July 2005 .
Worms that use a similar method of infection go back even further — to the early '90s .
" But at that time they relied on infecting floppy disks rather than USB drives , " Olson adds .
Servicemembers are supposed to " cease usage of all USB storage media until the USB devices are properly scanned and determined to be free of malware , " one e-mail notes .
Eventually , some government - approved drives will be allowed back under certain " mission - critical , " but unclassified , circumstances .
" Personally owned or non-authorized devices " are " prohibited " from here on out .
To make sure troops and military civilians are observing the suspension , government security teams " will be conducting daily scans and running custom scripts on NIPRNET and SIPRNET to ensure the commercial malware has not been introduced , " an e-mail says .
" Any discovery of malware will result in the opening of a security incident report and will be referred to the appropriate security officer for action . "
" The USB ban should be effective in stopping the worm , " Olson says .
Asked if such a wide - spread measure was a bit of over - kill , Olson responded , " I do n't know . "
" I know this [ is an ] inconvenience , " e-mails one Michigan Army National Guardsman .
" This has been briefed to the CoS [ Chief of Staff ] of the ARMY .
This is not just a problem for Michigan , and is effecting operations around the world .
This is a very serious threat and should be treated as such .
Please understand that this is a form of attack , and we need to have patience in dealing with this issue . "

We 've been reporting on the GOP 's October " Surprise " over the last few days ( challenges to Democratic voter registrations in a number of states , and , perhaps more notably , their bogus PR campaign to charge that ACORN , a community organization that heroically registers millions of low - income voters who nobody else bothers to , is committing " voter fraud . "
See here , here and here , for example . )
But the November Surprise , as we 've been trying to warn for many months ( if not years ) , will undoubtedly be the thousands who show up to the polls to vote on November 4th , only to find out that they have somehow " fallen off " the voter rolls .
We 've urged folks to check their registrations , even if they recently voted in a primary election , to make sure they have n't been purged ( info on how to do that quickly in all 50 states , right here ) .
Late last month , CBS News reported on voter purges occurring in at least 19 states across the country , many of them swing states , naturally .
Today , the New York Times has published a scathing report , based on a detailed investigation revealing that " Tens of thousands of eligible voters in at least six swing states have been removed from the rolls or have been blocked from registering in ways that appear to violate federal law . "
We 've got to run out to host an hour of " Election Year Special Coverage " right now on KPFK / Pacifica , ( guests to include filmmakers Patty Sharaf of Murder , Spies & Voting Lies : The Clint Curtis Story and John Ennis of Free For All ! : One Dude 's Quest for Democracy ) , so here are some very notable , must - read excerpts from the Times full report for the moment .
So , we may have more thoughts on all of this later today , but for now , please read on !...

[ B]ecause Democrats have been more aggressive at registering new voters this year , according to state election officials , any heightened screening of new applications may affect their party ’s supporters disproportionately .
The screening or trimming of voter registration lists in the six states — Colorado , Indiana , Ohio , Michigan , Nevada and North Carolina — could also result in problems at the polls on Election Day : people who have been removed from the rolls are likely to show up only to be challenged by political party officials or election workers , resulting in confusion , long lines and heated tempers .
Tens of thousands of eligible voters in at least six swing states have been removed from the rolls or have been blocked from registering in ways that appear to violate federal law , according to a review of state records and Social Security data by The New York Times ....
[ B]ecause Democrats have been more aggressive at registering new voters this year , according to state election officials , any heightened screening of new applications may affect their party ’s supporters disproportionately .

Some states allow such voters to cast provisional ballots .
But they are often not counted because they require added verification .
...
Michigan and Colorado are removing voters from the rolls within 90 days of a federal election , which is not allowed except when voters die , notify the authorities that they have moved out of state , or have been declared unfit to vote .
Indiana , Nevada , North Carolina and Ohio seem to be improperly using Social Security data to verify registration applications for new voters .
In addition to the six swing states , three more states appear to be violating federal law .
Alabama and Georgia seem to be improperly using Social Security information to screen registration applications from new voters .
And Louisiana appears to have removed thousands of voters after the federal deadline for taking such action .
Under federal law , election officials are supposed to use the Social Security database to check a registration application only as a last resort , if no record of the applicant is found on state databases , like those for driver ’s licenses or identification cards .
The requirement exists because using the federal database is less reliable than the state lists , and is more likely to incorrectly flag applications as invalid .
Many state officials seem to be using the Social Security lists first .
In the year ending Sept. 30 , election officials in Nevada , for example , used the Social Security database more than 740,000 times to check voter files or registration applications and found more than 715,000 nonmatches , federal records show .
Election officials in Georgia ran more than 1.9 million checks on voter files or voter registration applications and found more than 260,000 nonmatches .
...
In three states — Colorado , Louisiana and Michigan — the number of people purged from the election rolls since Aug. 1 far exceeds the number who may have died or relocated during that period .
States may be improperly removing voters who have moved within the state , election experts said , or who are considered inactive because they have failed to vote in two consecutive federal elections .
For example , major voter registration drives have been held this year in Colorado , which has also had a significant population increase since the last presidential election , but the state has recorded a net loss of nearly 100,000 voters from its rolls since 2004 .
...
In Michigan , some 33,000 voters were removed from the rolls in August , a figure that is far higher than the number of deaths in the state during the same period — about 7,100 — or the number of people who moved out of the state — about 4,400 , according to data from the Postal Service .
In Colorado , some 37,000 people were removed from the rolls in the three weeks after July 21 .
During that time , about 5,100 people moved out of the state and about 2,400 died , according to postal data and death records .
In Louisiana , at least 18,000 people were dropped from the rolls in the five weeks after July 23 .
Over the same period , at least 1,600 people moved out of state and at least 3,300 died .
The secretaries of state in Michigan and Colorado did not respond to requests for comment .
A spokesman for the Louisiana secretary of state said that about half of the numbers of the voters removed from the rolls were people who moved within the state or who died .
The remaining 11,000 or so people seem to have been removed by local officials for other reasons that were not clear , the spokesman said .
...
On Monday , the Ohio Republican Party filed a motion in federal court against the secretary of state to get the list of all names that have been flagged by the Social Security database since Jan .
1 . The motion seeks to require that any voter who does not clear up a discrepancy be required to vote using a provisional ballot .
Republicans said in the motion that it is central to American democracy that nonqualified voters be forbidden from voting .
The Ohio secretary of state , Jennifer Brunner , a Democrat , said in court papers that she believes the Republicans are seeking grounds to challenge voters and get them removed from the rolls .
Considering that in the past year the state received nearly 290,000 nonmatches , such a plan could have significant impact at the polls .
From the sidebar graphic included with the Times story :
I saw this around a few places over the last couple days , but it bears passing on to our readers .
It is simply that cool .
Two great geeky joys , combined into one .

Bigotry against atheists is not limited to theory and harsh language — anti-atheist bigotry can also lead to anti-atheist discrimination .
After all , if bigots are convinced that atheists are immoral , untrustworthy , and perhaps even evil on some level , then it ’s only to be expected that they will treat atheists unequally and as inferiors .
Unfortunately , the reasons behind anti-atheist discrimination are no better than discrimination against Jews and racial minorities in the past .
Atheists Are Discriminated Against in Politics
Perhaps the most obvious example of how atheists are discriminated against is in politics : people are less likely to vote for atheists than they are for any other minority — women , blacks , Jews , Muslims , or even gays .
No atheist is likely to be elected on any level anywhere in America and no politicians are likely to specifically appeal to atheists ’ votes by defending their interests .
Some even openly express bigotry against atheists , for example , President George H.W. Bush .
Atheists Are Discriminated Against in Child Custody Cases
Some may find it surprising , but atheists are routinely discriminated against by judges deciding child custody cases .
There is a common assumption that religion — any religion — is necessary for properly raising children and that atheists are incapable of seeing to the religious , moral , and social needs of their own kids .
Parents who regularly attend church are given great preference over parents who do n’t believe in gods .
Atheists Are Discriminated Against in the Boy Scouts
It is well known that the Boy Scouts of America excludes atheists both as members and as leaders .
Not so well known is why : the Boy Scouts of America asserts that atheists are incapable of being sufficiently moral or patriotic to deserve to be involved with scouting .
As a private organization this is their right , however bigoted it is ; so long as they receive public assistance and funding , however , their discrimination should be as illegal as it is unethical .
Atheists Are Discriminated Against in the Workplace
Religious discrimination in the workplace is illegal , but this does n’t keep those who are prejudiced against atheists from acting .
Atheists can be the targets of discrimination like any other minority unless others are unaware of a person ’s atheism — one reason why many atheists keep their true beliefs a secret .
Very rarely does one find people willing to admit to discrimination , but it does happen because some really do n’t believe that bigotry and discrimination against atheists is wrong .
Atheists Are Discriminated Against in Schools
Discrimination against atheists in school is n’t too uncommon , unfortunately , and as a consequence atheists can feel very much alone .
Just as some schools have tried to hinder the creation of groups for gay students , some have tried to hinder the creation of groups for atheists , agnostics , and freethinkers .
Such discrimination is illegal , but that does n’t stop school administrators who do n’t want to be seen as supporting godless atheists .
Atheists Are Discriminated Against in the Media
When was the last time you saw an open atheist in the media — whether news media , movies , or television programs ?
It ’s very rare , and often when we do see atheists they ’re rarely portrayed as normal , well - adjusted people .
Gay characters and individuals are far more visible than atheists , which is yet another example of how even gays are less despised in America than atheists .
Atheists Are Discriminated Against in Families
It ’s a sad but unfortunate fact that many atheists have to keep their atheism hidden from their own families .
Sometimes , not even spouses are made aware that one is an atheist — they go to church if they have to and participate in religious holidays but without really believing and without the ability to be truly honest .
They feel this way because some families will simply disown and turn away from someone merely for being an atheist .
Bigotry should n’t twist families apart like that .
Atheists Are Discriminated Against in History
Perhaps the most unusual place we find discrimination against atheists is in history — or the presentation of history , to be more accurate .
There have been a number of known or suspected atheist philosophers , scientists , and political leaders throughout history as well as quite a few freethinkers who remained theists but rejected orthodox religious beliefs .
How often , though , do we hear about these things ?
This is not unlike how the homosexuality of many famous figures is suppressed .
Atheists ’ Fear in a Christian Nation
A common theme throughout all these examples of how atheists can be discriminated against is the fear atheists can experience at the prospect of others finding out about them .
The consequence of Christians ’ anti-atheist bigotry can be quite severe , so of course , atheists will do all they can to avoid revealing the truth .
This , of course , only serves to underscore the courage of those willing to come out of the closet to stand up for what ’s right and against illegal behavior .
Christian Right bigots who seem to revel in promoting anti-atheist prejudice commonly attack these same atheists verbally , accusing them of being anti-American and threatening to destroy the liberties which define America .
Why ?
Because they dare to challenge what they see as improper government promotion of religion .
These verbal attacks all too frequently encourage actual physical attacks : atheists who challenge issues such as school prayers or teaching creationism have had to contend with assaults , threats , and vandalism .
They may be shunned by their community where neighbors will turn away and merchants will refuse to serve them .
Coming out as an atheist in any manner , but especially in a very public manner , is dangerous and made even more dangerous by Christians in America .
They insist that America is a “ Christian Nation , ” which often appears to mean that atheists are n’t welcome and should n’t make waves by demanding equality .
For many atheists , the idea of America as a “ Christian Nation ” is one that instills fear at the prospect of what Christians might do when they have even more power to discriminate than they currently do .

The UK government has announced a package of measures aimed at rescuing the banking system that makes available £ 400 bn ( $ 692bn ) of fresh money .
It will initially make extra capital available to eight of the UK 's largest banks and building societies in return for preference shares in them .
It is " designed to put the British banking system on a sounder footing " , said Prime Minister Gordon Brown .
Some bank shares rose on the news although the main FTSE 100 index fell .
See chart of rescue plan Shares in HBOS , the UK 's biggest mortgage lender , ended up 24.5 % , and Royal Bank of Scotland was 0.8 % higher - trimming earlier gains .
Shares in Lloyds TSB fell 7 % and Barclays was down 2.4 % .
The fall on the FTSE 100 , which ended down 5.18 % at 4,366.69 points , also came despite co-ordinated interest rate cuts from the Bank of England , European Central Bank and Federal Reserve .
Taking taxpayers ' money will not be a licence to trade as normal
Robert Peston , BBC business editor
Read Robert Peston 's blog Treasury statement in full World in turmoil
The key points of the plan are : Banks will have to increase their capital by at least £ 25bn and can borrow from the government to do so .
An additional £ 25bn in extra capital will be available in exchange for preference shares .
£ 100bn will be available in short - term loans from the Bank of England , on top of an existing loan facility worth £ 100bn .
Up to £ 250 bn in loan guarantees will be available at commercial rates to encourage banks to lend to each other .
To participate in the scheme banks will have to sign up to an FSA agreement on executive pay and dividends .
Falling shares BBC business editor Robert Peston said that it was understandable that shares had fallen following news of the government 's package .
" What Gordon Brown and central banks have done today should stave off economic Armageddon - but it 's probably too late to save us from months , or even years , of sluggish growth . "
He said that HBOS shares had risen strongly because it would be more likely to benefit from the plan than its peers .
Special company BANKS SIGNED UP Abbey Barclays HBOS HSBC Lloyds TSB Nationwide Building Society Royal Bank of Scotland Standard Chartered
See banking sector shares Parties support plan Latest at a glance Reaction to the plan Much of the current crisis has been caused by the banks ' unwillingness to lend to each other , so the government hopes that if those loans can be guaranteed then lending will resume .
" This is beginning a process of un - bunging a big problem where banks wo n't lend to each other for long periods , " Mr Darling said .
The lenders that have confirmed their participation in aspects of the scheme are Abbey , Barclays , HBOS , HSBC , Lloyds TSB , Nationwide Building Society , Royal Bank of Scotland and Standard Chartered .
The Treasury said that other banks and building societies would be able to apply for inclusion in the plan .
Possible profit Preference shares pay a fixed rate of interest instead of a dividend , which has to be paid before other shareholders receive anything , but they do not carry voting rights .
Taxpayers may even end up making a profit from the shares , but that is by no means guaranteed .
Robert Peston said there would be strings attached for banks that take the government money .
" Taking taxpayers ' money will not be a licence to trade as normal , " he said .
Negotiations will take place with each participating institution that will require them to extend normal credit lines to homeowners and small businesses , in addition to rules on executive pay and dividends to other shareholders .
' Stop the panic '
It is hoped that the deal will get the money markets going again and assure the future of the banking system .
" They 've got additional capital now if they want it , they 've got an unlimited source of liquidity , " said Terry Smith , chief executive of the money brokers , Tullett Prebon .
" That certainly should stop the panic in terms of people wondering whether or not the banks are safe . "
The deal has also been welcomed by the banks .
" The government 's announcement represents a very real and serious intention on the part of the authorities , following consultation with the banking industry , to bring stability and certainty to the UK banking system , " HBOS said in a statement .
Barclays , Lloyds TSB and RBS also issued statements welcoming it .
HSBC , Nationwide and Standard Chartered also welcomed the plan but said they did not intend to take on any new capital at the moment .

Dear Miss Manners :
My matron of honor , my sister , will be ( if all goes well ) six months pregnant at the time of my wedding .
Her husband will be in attendance and will want to claim his place as the father of the child .
However , their wife , one of my oldest friends , will also be in attendance with her then - 15 - week - old baby , also born of their shared husband .
While their lifestyle is not for me , I do not find it my place to condemn them , but rather to rejoice in the happiness my sister ’s choice has brought her .
It is the concern of my fiance , however , that if their relationship comes to light , older and more conservative members of his family may look upon us with ill favor or denounce us outright since we did not denounce the three of them , opting instead to invite them to our union .
My own concern is that nobody there is so socially put out that they cannot enjoy themselves and celebrate with us our happy marriage  whether that be the groom , fretting for his family relations ; my brother - in - law , temporarily disavowing a great happiness in his life ; or my fiance ’s family , trying to figure out what the world has come to , or some such .
I agree with my sister that it might not become a direct issue if we did not announce their relationship to one another in introducing them , but as the newborn will be the only child at the wedding , and my sister will be the only ( and obviously ) pregnant woman , the parentage of both seems to be an obvious point of conversation .
It seems that it would disturb the fewest people to have my brother - in - law practice restraint of joy for a few hours , but that it would be a more openly joyous occasion if we were not putting effort into denying the truth , and another source of joy .
I have agreed to abide by your judgment , and I believe that my sister ’s family will , as well .
Dear Gentle Reader :
Since it took Miss Manners three readings of your letter to grasp the situation , she rather doubts that people who are busy drinking champagne and critiquing the wedding dress will be alert enough to understand it .
However , there is a precedent for dealing with the presence of wedding guests of whom others may not approve .
And that is not to deal with it .
You do not tell wedding guests how to present themselves , and you are not responsible for how other guests react to this .
Your sister seems to be in favor of discretion .
Your chance to exercise this admirable trait would be to introduce the lot of them merely as " my sister 's family , " followed by their names .
As more people face dilemmas of proper social conduct at the poly - mundane interface , newspaper columnist Miss Manners ( Judith Martin ) offers some advice , and exhibits her usual discreet aplomb ( week of July 10 , 2008 ) : That 's what I 'd say too .
This is much like the advice Miss Manners gave the last time she addressed a polys - at - the - party concern .

Free minix - like kernel sources for 386 - AT , was the subject of Linus Benedict Torvalds post to comp.os. minix on October 5 , 1991 -- seventeen years ago today .
it began ,
Do you pine for the nice days of minix - 1.1 , when men were men and wrote their own device drivers ?
Are you without a nice project and just dying to cut your teeth on a OS you can try to modify for your needs ?
Are you finding it frustrating when everything works on minix ?
No more all - nighters to get a nifty program working ?
Then this post might be just for you :-)
As I mentioned a month ( ? ) ago , I 'm working on a free version of a minix - lookalike for AT - 386 computers .
It has finally reached the stage where it 's even usable ( though may not be depending on what you want ) , and I am willing to put out the sources for wider distribution .
It is just version 0.02 ( +1 ( very small ) patch already ) , but I 've successfully run bash / gcc / gnu - make / gnu-sed / compress etc under it .
Linus did n't know what he was unleashing with " an OS you can try to modify to your needs " -- yet .
But what started as a fun vetting of one * nix became the largest barn - raising in the history of computing .
( By the way , i remembered this date while on another hunt for information , in Encyclopedia Brittanica , where today Linux ' birthday is the Home Page story .
Oddly , it fails to get a mention in today 's Wikipedia cover page . )
Today that barn is vast world still being terraformed .
Why did Linux succeed where others did not , or did to lesser extents ?
I think Neal Stephenson nails it best in his landmark book , In the Beginning Was The Command Line , the whole text of which you can read here .
Written in the late 1990s , it still rings true today .
A core sample :
Windows 95 and MacOS are products , contrived by engineers in the service of specific companies .
Unix , by contrast , is not so much a product as it is a painstakingly compiled oral history of the hacker subculture .
It is our Gilgamesh epic .
What made old epics like Gilgamesh so powerful and so long - lived was that they were living bodies of narrative that many people knew by heart , and told over and over again -- making their own personal embellishments whenever it struck their fancy .
The bad embellishments were shouted down , the good ones picked up by others , polished , improved , and , over time , incorporated into the story .
Likewise , Unix is known , loved , and understood by so many hackers that it can be re-created from scratch whenever someone needs it .
This is very difficult to understand for people who are accustomed to thinking of OSes as things that absolutely have to be bought .
Many hackers have launched more or less successful re-implementations of the Unix ideal .
Each one brings in new embellishments .
Some of them die out quickly , some are merged with similar , parallel innovations created by different hackers attacking the same problem , others still are embraced , and adopted into the epic .
Thus Unix has slowly accreted around a simple kernel and acquired a kind of complexity and asymmetry about it that is organic , like the roots of a tree , or the branchings of a coronary artery .
Understanding it is more like anatomy than physics .
For at least a year , prior to my adoption of Linux , I had been hearing about it .
Credible , well - informed people kept telling me that a bunch of hackers had got together an implentation of Unix that could be downloaded , free of charge , from the Internet .
For a long time I could not bring myself to take the notion seriously .
It was like hearing rumors that a group of model rocket enthusiasts had created a completely functional Saturn V by exchanging blueprints on the Net and mailing valves and flanges to each other .
But it 's true .
Credit for Linux generally goes to its human namesake , one Linus Torvalds , a Finn who got the whole thing rolling in 1991 when he used some of the GNU tools to write the beginnings of a Unix kernel that could run on PC - compatible hardware .
And indeed Torvalds deserves all the credit he has ever gotten , and a whole lot more .
But he could not have made it happen by himself , any more than Richard Stallman could have .
To write code at all , Torvalds had to have cheap but powerful development tools , and these he got from Stallman 's GNU project .
Yet for all of the successes of LInux and the Net , of half a million open source projects , of immeasurable progress by companies taking advantage of sturdy building material grown in the wilds of hacker culture , businesses still remain , as Walt Whitman so perfectly put it , " demented with the mania of owning things " .
Nine years have passed since Jeremie Miller introduced XMPP ( then still Jabber ) , and Yahoo , Microsoft and AOL still maintain closed instant messaging systems .
Mobile phone companies and equipment providers still make devices and platforms that are purposely incompatible with those of competitors .
Companies still look for ways to use software hardware / software combinations to " lock in " their customers , as if slavery were something any sane customer would want .
There are signs of progress , as there always will be , until World Domination ( a term that showed up more than a decade ago ) is complete .
Until Google introduced the Linux - based Android , Linux - based mobile phones were nearly ( or just as ) closed as those from Symbian and Windows Mobile .
But Nokia bought Linux developer Trolltech in January and Symbian in July -- and then announced its intent to open - source the latter .
Nokia knows that a free customer is better than a captive one .
And that the same goes for developers .
A few months ago , our own Jon Stokes bemoaned the frustration of managing and accessing data strewn across a multitude of personal computing devices .
His description of the challenges of syncing and saving resonated with many of us on the Ars staff and with quite a few readers , too .
As you can see by looking at the comments that some of you posted in response to Jon 's synchronization conundrum , many of us roll our own imperfect solutions and yearn for something better .
For me , that " something better " has arrived in the form of Dropbox , a cross - platform sync tool .
But I did n't discover it until I had tried everything else first .
Needlessly arcane solutions
As a Linux user , I have some pretty nice tools baked into the OS to help me get the job done .
My approach is to store everything on my 4TB home NAS , which I can mount on my laptop via sshfs for secure remote access .
It 's a very seamless solution that works great when I have decent Internet connectivity , but it falls flat on its face when I can't connect or when my connection is unreliable .
I had to augment this approach by using synchronization tools for critical files so that I still have access to important data when the tubes are clogged .
The sweet penguin juice roaring through my veins commanded me to adopt a needlessly arcane solution , so I started putting all of my article drafts into a private Bazaar repository on my personal web server .
Real men use distributed version control systems for everything , right ?
It was unnecessarily excessive and got cumbersome quickly .
I decided to scale back and try rsync , but it still was n't transparent enough for my liking .
Then the penguin juice really kicked in .
I started writing a wacky Python script that would use inotify to detect filesystem changes and automatically perform synchronization under certain conditions .
During my futile struggle to get that hack into a usable condition , Ars Linux community member Whiprush saved me from myself and introduced me to Dropbox , a turnkey synchronization solution that gave me almost everything I wanted .
I began pursuing the path to computing zen by hotboxing my home office dropboxing my files .
Hands on with Dropbox
Dropbox is a cloud storage service with really smooth native platform integration on Linux , Windows , and Mac OS X .
The Dropbox client software will automatically keep files synchronized between multiple computers and the user 's Dropbox web storage space .
It detects when files are modified on the local filesystem and will immediately upload the changes .
The web service then propagates those changes to all other computers on which the user is running the Dropbox software .
The synchronization experience with Dropbox is impressively seamless and requires no user intervention .
Another big win for users is that it works flawlessly across operating systems and provides the same level of fluidity on all three platforms .
After suffering with rsync in Cygwin on Windows , I found Dropbox 's excellent multiplatform support refreshing .
Dropbox shows a small icon in the user 's system tray or notification area to indicate the current status of the service .
It will display a blue arrow icon when it is in the process of synchronizing and a green checkmark icon when syncing is complete .
When data is propagated over from the user 's other systems , the icon will pop up notification bubbles that say which files were modified .
Dropbox synchronization is so fast that it feels almost instantaneous .
After initial synchronization , it will send only the changes made to the files rather than sending the entire file every time .
Dropbox also keeps each set of changes , which makes it possible for users to access previous versions of their files .
The client software also ties itself into the file manager on all three operating systems .
Files and folders that are managed by Dropbox are adorned with checkmark and arrow icons to indicate their synchronization status .
When a file is changed and is being synchronized by Dropbox , the icon overlay changes accordingly until synchronization is complete .
Dropbox also adds a special submenu to the right - click context menu that provides access to some of the service 's special features , such as revisions .
In addition to serving as a synchronization tool , Dropbox can also be used as a quick and easy way to share files with other people .
Files that are placed in a user 's Public folder can be accessed by other people who are given the public URL .
This URL can be obtained through the Dropbox web interface or can be pushed directly to the clipboard by selecting the " Copy public link " item from the Dropbox right - click context menu .
The Dropbox web interface is minimalist , but it has a few really useful features .
The main view is a list of recent events that will show which files have been added and removed .
It also has a very fast file management interface that can be used to browse the files and perform some basic file operations .
You can move , rename , and copy files , view and restore deleted files , and see file revisions .
It will also give you a gallery view of folders that contain images .
Another really nice feature is support for downloading any folder as a compressed zip archive .
During our testing process , we put the service through some rough challenges to see how it handles poor connectivity and change collisions .
When the connection drops , Dropbox will wait until the connection is restored before attempting to synchronize again .
To simulate a collision , I disconnected my laptop from the Internet and made a few modifications to some files in my Dropbox folder .
Then I reconnected the laptop after I changed those same files on my desktop computer .
Dropbox handled the collision by creating copies of the changed files on the laptop and giving them special names to indicate they were conflicted files .
Then it overwrote the originals with the latest version of those files from the cloud .
The filenames of the conflicted files include the name of the computer on which they were modified and the date on which the modification was made .
Dropbox can't merge different versions of modified files , but it makes it easy to see and manage conflicts .
Looking at the implementation
On Linux , the parts of the Dropbox client software visible to the end user are implemented as an open source plugin for GNOME 's Nautilus file manager .
The plugin is , however , just a thin shell and it does n't handle any of the synchronization logic or communicate directly with the Dropbox web service .
The heavy lifting is done by the proprietary dropboxd daemon , which runs in the background and interacts with the Dropbox web service .
Files are stored on Amazon S3 , and each user gets 2 GB of space .
The Nautilus plugin automatically downloads the daemon and its dependencies and installs them in the ~/.dropbox - dist directory .
The plugin uses the daemon as a gateway for communicating with the Dropbox web service .
How it does this is not yet documented , but it is fairly easy to figure out by looking at the code .
According to the Dropbox developers , there are no plans to open the synchronization protocol , but they will document the protocol the plugin uses to communicate with the daemon .
Third - party developers could use this , for instance , to create a KDE file manager plugin .
Dropbox is a real winner .
The company jumped into a software space that is saturated with mediocre offerings and has delivered a better user experience and more cohesive platform integration .
The Dropbox software does have some limitations right now that will make it a bit less palatable for enterprise adoption , though .
There is currently no way to self - host Dropbox storage , so companies that need to manage their own data will have to wait .
The Dropbox FAQ indicates that a self - hosted version could arrive in the future .
Here is some solace if you cannot / will not go to your favorite restaurant due to your new financial circumstances .
Terrence Conran or rather Simon Hopkinson and Matthew Harris , the chefs at his Bidendum Restaurant in Michelin House on Fulham Road in London have decided to share their secret sauce in the Bibendum Cookbook .
They share a few of their recipes in How to Eat Out at Home ( Guardian , October 19 ) .
My favorite has to be their Escargots à la Bourguignonne with butter of course inspired by Chez L'Ami Louis , a Parisian bistrot .
Bon appetit !

From State Street to Lake Michigan , from the South Side to the Loop , the famed Windy City is bracing for something really big today - no matter how Election 2008 turns out .
In Grant Park , ringed by a jeweled necklace of trees turning autumn colors , armies of security officials , police and workers were at work Monday for what this town hopes will be a mega-victory celebration for Illinois Sen.
Barack Obama , the former community organizer whose roots run deep here .
The event is expected to attract possibly a million residents to a city celebrated for its vibrant African American culture , in part because of the potential for history in the making - the possible election of the nation 's first African American president .
The extra cops , set - up , security , transportation and overtime will cost ChiTown an estimated $ 2 million , though the Obama campaign said it is picking up the tab .
But there are also signs that the city is preparing for tougher stuff with the kind of security usually seen in this sports - crazy town at mega-events like the Super Bowl and the World Series .
On Monday morning , teams of workers erected a wall of thick , bulletproof glass around the podium where Obama will address the crowd on election night .
The speaker 's platform in the Hutchinson Field area of the huge public park is within sight of thousands of windows in the downtown region .
For security reasons , photographers on scene were forbidden to take photos of the site until Tuesday morning .
About 70,000 residents , out of the hordes who applied , are expected to have gotten e-mails Monday giving them the golden tickets needed to get to the area near Obama 's address .
But Chicago Mayor Richard Daley has predicted that hundreds of thousands more could descend on the downtown to be part of the scene .
That means the city 's popular watering holes , like High Dive Moonshine , are preparing for election night parties to welcome the overflow .
The 1st Ward Young Democrats expect to crowd Moonshine for a chance to watch the moment on TV together - as they try out the new $ 3 " Change " brew - a special American Harvest beer release created for the occasion .
Win or lose
Indeed , Chicago is getting ready for the onslaught - win or lose .
The city has ordered all firefighters , even off - duty ones , to go home Monday with their safety gear in tow - helmets , oxygen tanks and other apparatus - in case they will be required to respond to immediate emergencies .
Leave has been canceled for all Chicago cops , and some have been assigned to polling places that promise to be particularly busy .
Businesses in the immediate area of downtown have been asked to send their workers home at 3 p.m. to help control gridlock as streets close .
Police ready
Chicago Police Superintendent Jody Weis told the Associated Press that the city 's police force is ready and prepared for response .
" I 'm extraordinarily confident that we can keep Sen . Obama safe , that we can keep the citizens of Chicago safe and that we can keep the neighborhoods safe .
" We always prepare for the worst and hope for the best , " he said .
Still , nerves might be a little frayed with the recent revelations that two white supremacists had been nabbed for allegedly plotting to kill Obama and a number of other African Americans .
Jerry Kellman , the Chicago community organizer who urged Obama to move from New York to Chicago and became an early mentor of his here , said that Chicagoans are proud - and ready - for a special night and hope the city will be the setting for a historic moment that appeals to the best in all Americans .
" At this point in history , we have to trust the Secret Service , the professionals who do that job to keep Barack safe , " he said .
" There 's no question that the political rhetoric has been really irresponsible , " he said , adding that it could cause some to act up or act out in some way , though not necessarily life - threatening .
" You stir this stuff up , in Bosnia or anywhere , and it 's bad for civility and public life , " he said .
Danger is a given
Tony West , the Oakland attorney and longtime Obama friend and fundraiser , said that anyone who runs for the nation 's highest office understands that there are dangers to be dealt with - especially in an election this hard - fought .
He 's confident that whatever happens today , Chicago - and Obama - will be just fine .
" The fact is , he 's got the best protection in the world ... this has been a very intense campaign , and we 've had unprecedented participation by people who have never been interested or involved before .
" And that will involve a lot of feeling , " he said .
Hilary Shelton , the director of the NAACP 's Washington , D.C. , bureau , told the AP , " We 've unfortunately seen there 's a few fringe people who want to create havoc , so it makes sense to have extra security ... the flip side 's that any heavy - handed presence of law enforcement at polls could be intimidating . "
Updated 10:43 a.m. : Before this week , we all assumed that Andy Pettitte would come back to New York or retire .
Last week ’s news that Andy and Joe Torre were talking L.A. upset that balance .
Today , in the Paper That Must Not Be Named , Dodgers GM Ned Colletti confirmed on the record that the team has “ some ” interest in the 36 - year - old pitcher .
This leaves the Yankees in something of a bind as they have a big decision to make after the weekend .
Monday , you see , is MLB ’s arbitration deadline .
By the end of the day , the Yanks must decide whether or not to offer arbitration to Andy Pettitte .
This is a rather complicated decision , and it could play itself out in a variety of scenarios .
The easiest option — and perhaps the most beneficial to the Yanks — would be to offer arbitration to Andy Pettitte and hope that he heads to Los Angeles .
As Mike noted earlier this week , the Yanks would land the 17th slot in the draft and a supplemental pick as well .
But because the Dodgers would be giving up a fairly coveted spot , they may not be so keen to sign Pettitte if the Yanks offer arbitration .
Meanwhile , this decision could easily backfire on the Yanks .
If they offer arbitration and Pettitte accepts and he does n’t sign with the Dodgers and he wants to play for only one more year , Pettitte could actually take the Yanks to arbitration .
While he , as a veteran free agent , would n’t be guaranteed at least 80 percent of his 2008 salary of $ 16 million , players nearly never receive a lower salary in arbitration .
So even if he were to lose , he would still get a payday well above what he could probably receive from the Dodgers or Yankees right now .
Of course , those are two extremes .
Pettitte could accept arbitration and renegotiate with the Yankees .
If the Yankees do n’t offer arbitration , they can still renegotiate with Andy Pettitte , but if he were to sign with Los Angeles , the team would receive no compensatory picks .
This is the decision with which Brian Cashman and the Yankees brain trust must grapple this weekend .
They have to decide if they want Pettitte , if they feel Pettitte might actually go to the Dodgers and if the arbitration decision would n’t come back to haunt them .
It ai n’t easy being a GM .
UPDATE : The Musgrave campaign gave the following comment to The Colorado Independent regarding the NRCC pull - out :
“ This is a clear indication the NRCC believes Marilyn is in s strong position to close this race out with a victory in November , ” said Jason Thielman , Musgrave ’s campaign manager .
“ We have the resources necessary to close strong and deliver our message unlike many other house candidates across the country . ”
In a surprise move , the National Republican Congressional Committee canceled its TV advertising buy in the 4th Congressional District for the last week of the election on Wednesday in what some experts say is clear sign Republican incumbent Rep.
Marilyn Musgrave ’s re-election bid for a fourth term is at risk .
It could also mean that Musgrave ’s challenger Betsy Markey could become the first Democrat elected to the 4th CD in decades .
The NRCC has focused on the 4th in recent weeks by dumping more than $ 700,000 into the race including an additional $ 400,000 in TV airtime to be used in the final week of the campaign — money the NRCC pulled out today by sending letters to Denver TV stations canceling the ad buy .
Both parties have viewed the 4th CD as a clear toss - up throughout the election cycle .
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has poured more than $ 600,000 into the race — including an additional $ 300,000 Tuesday night for more airtime — and independent expenditures totaling nearly $ 2 million have flooded in mostly for use attacking Musgrave .
“ This is pretty interesting news , ” said John Straayer , a political science professor at Colorado State University .
“ It sounds like the Republicans have other races that need the money more than Musgrave and that they are pessimistic about her chances .
If they have internal polling that suggests Markey is sitting on a comfortable lead , something beyond the margin of error , and those numbers have been standing firm in recent weeks and are not going the other way , they might think it ’s time to change the pace and protect other incumbents who appear to be in a better spot . ”
Polling so far has n’t been good for Musgrave this year .
A Roll Call poll by SurveyUSA in August put Markey ahead by 7 percentage points and a more recent poll by EMILY ’s List , a Markey supporter , put Markey up by 9 points .
The EMILY ’s List poll is somewhat skewed being it included a smaller percentage of registered Republicans than the 4th ’s voter demographics .
In addition , Markey ’s campaign also released internal polling in June that showed her up over Musgrave by 4 percentage points .
Musgrave ’s campaign has not released any polling in recent months and no outside groups gauging the race have shown Musgrave in the lead .
Markey ’s campaign seemed optimistic about their candidate ’s standing coming into the final week of the election when contacted by The Colorado Independent Wednesday afternoon .
“ This is a pretty clear indication that Musgrave ’s negative campaign is backfiring on her , ” Markey spokesman Ben Marter said adding they are remain focused on finishing the campaign with the same strategy they have adopted thus far .
“ We ’re going to keep doing what we have been doing .
Working hard , talking to voters , getting Betsy ’s message out there .
There is still two weeks to go . ”
The NRCC has struggled to fundraise this year at the same pace as the DCCC which at times has had a 4 - 1 cash advantage over its Republican counterpart .
With so little money and a number of important House seats to fight for , Straayer said there have been signs the NRCC has been struggling but that it was still surprising to see the party pull out of the 4th CD .
“ They are fighting tough battles everywhere , ” Straayer said .
“ There were a number of incumbents who retired this year and they have a number of seats they are fighting to keep .
The Republican brand is n’t strong right now . ”
Another possibility Straayer said should be considered is the Republican Party could be strategically looking at what congressional seats they can let go of this year but have a good opportunity of reclaiming in 2010 or 2012 .
With more registered Republicans in the 4th CD than Democrats and unaffiliated voters , Musgrave ’s seat could fall into that category , Straayer said .
“ I suspect another thing they are looking at it is what seats they think are going to be recoverable in the reasonably near future , ” he said .
“ You know , a ‘ let ’s look at what seats we can walk away from now and be relatively sure that if things do n’t go well for the Democrats , not Markey personally but the Democrats as a party , if they have some stumbles , that we can recover the seat later . ”
Continuing a trend that started earlier this summer , Musgrave failed to outraise Markey during the third quarter of this year .
Between July 20 and Sept. 30 Musgrave raised a total of $ 599,618 — or $ 119,286 less than Markey , who collected $ 718,904 during the same period , according to FEC filings both campaigns made last week .
The filings do n’t include the money raised during the pre-primary period in the beginning of July .
At the time , Musgrave still had more than double the cash on hand as Markey , though , with $ 798,310 in her campaign war chest compared to Markey ’s $ 381,894 bankroll .
Both campaigns will file their Pre-General FEC filings Thursday but without the NRCC ’s backing , Musgrave will most likely need to spend nearly every penny of her warchest fighting Markey throughout the remaining days of the campaign .
Markey recently banked on House Speaker Rep. Nancy Pelosi to help her fund raise by attending an event in Denver earlier this month with Pelosi , who also sent a letter to supporters saying the cash - strapped Markey is struggling to keep up with the negative advertising Musgrave has employed .
Other big - time Democrats have also sent fundraising letters out to supporters on Markey ’s behalf in recent days including Sen. Hillary Clinton and Paul Begala .
Markey ’s campaign said earlier in the week that the help is being recognized with campaign donations .
Marter , Markey ’s spokesman , said he believes polling that show Markey ahead is indicative of voters ’ dismay over extraordinarily negative campaign tactics Musgrave has employed including a recent TV advertisement that suggested Markey could face jail time for contracts her family business , Syscom Systems , received while Markey was employed with Sen. Ken Salazar .
Musgrave ’s campaign repeatedly raised questions about the contracts that Markey ’s family business , Syscom Systems , received after Markey was employed by Sen. Ken Salazar .
Musgrave has not provided proof for her allegations and said it ’s Markey ’s responsibility to prove her company did not benefit from her position in Salazar ’s office .
The Government Services Agency , led by Republican appointees made by President Bush , said it could not find a conflict of interest between Syscom ’s contracts and Markey ’s service under Salazar .

Virgin Galactic has rather churlishly rejected a $ 1 m offer to allow an unnamed company to shoot a zero - grav grumble flick aboard its SpaceShipTwo vehicle - thereby depriving science of crucial research into how humanity might procreate during the very long haul to the nearest Earth - like planet once we 've finally screwed this ball of dirt we call home .
The cash was slapped on the table " up - front , for a sex - in - space movie " , said the company 's prez , Will Whitehorn , According to Space.com .
He confirmed : " That was money we had to refuse , I 'm afraid . "
The rumpy - pumpy - free Virgin Galactic programme is gearing up to take space tourists aloft aboard SpaceShipTwo at $ 200 k a pop , having apparently already snaffled $ 40 m in deposits from 280 customers keen to enjoy the two - hour jaunt to 62 miles ( 100 km ) .
During the trip , punters will experience around five minutes of weightlessness - just long enough for a quick hump and a money shot , by our reckoning .
The original planned launch date of the service was 2007 , although this has been revised to 2010 .
The first flight of the WhiteKnight Two mothership was recently knocked back to late 2008 at the earliest , while SpaceShipTwo trials begin next year . ®
Dye - Sensitized Solar Cells Reach Highest Efficiency Ever
November 5th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Chinese and Swiss researchers announced earlier this week that they have reached the highest efficiency yet for dye - sensitized solar cells ( Grätzel cells ) .
The photovoltaic cells are cheaper than silicon - based solar cells , but until this week ’s discovery their drawbacks have outweighed their benefits .
In the past , Grätzel cells have been inefficient at converting light into electricity , and their performance dropped after only short exposure to sunlight .
The research team , which included dye - sensitized solar cell inventor Michael Grätzel , used solar cells made with ruthenium - based dye to increase their light - harvesting ability .
The new technique yielded efficiency levels as high as 10 percent — a record for this type of solar cell .
Additionally , the cells retained over 90 percent of their initial output after 1,000 hours in the sun .
While silicon - based solar cells have typical efficiencies of about 12 percent , they are significantly more expensive to produce .
And since the prohibitive cost of silicon solar cells prevents many homes and businesses from committing to solar energy , a cheaper solution should be welcomed .

I want to talk about anger .
Anger may just tank the TARP .
It ’s everywhere , from the measly pages of my blog , to the hallowed halls of Capitol Hill .
The TARP money is n’t going directly to bail out the housing market , and let ’s just say a lot of folks are PO’d .
Look at the responses to my blog regarding the Hope for Homeowners programinitiated last month and the Hope Now program that Fannieand Freddieare now joining with their new “ Streamlined Modification Program ( SMP ) ” :
HOPE -less Program
$ 300 Billion Bail - out Catch 22
$ 300 Billion Bridge to Nowhere
Hopeless for Homeowners
The argument is that a lot of folks do n’t qualify , there ’s a 3 % upfront fee on the FHA insurance , a 1.5 percent fee for the duration of the loan , and a lot of lenders still do n’t want to write down principal , as is required by the program .

Financial Crisis Tab Already In The Trillions
So then we get to the Hill this morning , and what I can only describe as a skewering of Neel Kashkari , the Treasury ’s Interim Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability .
Congressman Dennis Kucinich of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform took Mr. Kashkari to task for changing the rules to the game of Monopoly , TARP edition .
In fact , here ’s a little montage with Kashkari , Kucinich , Cong . Elijah Cummings ( D - MD ) , and Cong. Darrell Issa ( R - CA ) , just the best bits from the testimony :
Kashkari :
The secretary is very passionate about this as well -
Kucinich : Passionate about what ?
Kashkari : Helping homeowners , congressman -
Kucinich : wwww - he is ? in what country ??
Cummings :
You 're on TV .
You ’re the man .
I do n't know how much we 're paying you , but you 're our employee ...
Issa : Y'know , we could go ring around the rosie here , but you are here because Congress feels you played a bait and switch game ...
Kashkari : I do n’t think it 's a good use of taxpayer money to put taxpayer capital into an institution that 's going to fail -
Kucinich : Boy y'know , that statement you just made , you will hear about for the rest of your career .
Cummings : Is Kashkari a chump ?
Not sure what else I could possibly add .

Simply exchange files with WOOF I guess everybody with a laptop has experienced this problem at some point :
You plug into a network and just want to exchange files with other participants .
It always is a pain until you can exchange files with the person vis-a - vis .
Of course there are a lot of tools to tackle this problem .
For large scale communities there are dozens of filesharing networks .
However , they do n't work for small local networks .
Of course you could put your stuff to exchange on a local web server , but who really wants to maintain this ?
Tools like the ingenious npush / npoll are extremely helpful , provided that both parties have it installed , SAFT / sendfile also aims to solve this problem , but needs a permanently running daemon ...
Woof ( Web Offer One File ) tries a different approach .
It assumes that everybody has a web - browser or a commandline web - client installed .
Woof is a small simple stupid webserver that can easily be invoked on a single file .
Your partner can access the file with tools he trusts ( e.g. wget ) .
No need to enter passwords on keyboards where you do n't know about keyboard sniffers , no need to start a huge lot of infrastructure , just do a $ woof filename and tell the recipient the URL woof spits out .
When he got that file , woof will quit and everything is done .
And when someone wants to send you a file , woof has a switch to offer itself , so he can get woof and offer a file to you .
Prerequisites and usage Woof needs Python on a unix'ish operating system .
Some people have used it successfully on Windows within the cygwin environment .
Usage : woof [ - i < ip_addr > ] [ - p < port > ] [ - c < count > ] < file > woof [ - i < ip_addr > ] [ - p < port > ] [ - c < count > ] [ - z| - j| - Z|-u ] < dir > woof [ - i < ip_addr > ] [ - p < port > ] [ - c < count > ] -s woof [ - i < ip_addr > ] [ - p < port > ] [ - c < count > ]
- U woof Serves a single file < count > times via http on port < port > on IP address < ip_addr > .
When a directory is specified , an tar archive gets served .
By default it is gzip compressed .
You can specify -z for gzip compression , -j for bzip2 compression , - Z for ZIP compression or -u for no compression .
You can configure your default compression method in the configuration file described below .
When -s is specified instead of a filename , woof distributes itself .
When - U is specified , woof provides an upload form , allowing file uploads .
defaults : count = 1 , port = 8080
If started with an url as an argument , woof acts as a client , downloading the file and saving it in the current directory .
You can specify different defaults in two locations : /etc/ woofrc and ~/.woofrc can be INI - style config files containing the default port and the default count .
The file in the home directory takes precedence .
The compression methods are " off " , " gz " , " bz2 " or " zip " .
Sample file : [ main ] port = 8008 count = 2 ip = 127.0.0.1 compressed = gz Download woof@github – 2020 - 06 - 24 : I 've finally pushed the code to Github , pushing an python3 port as well .
woof – 2012 - 05 - 31 : Workaround for Python 2.7 , more verbose URL output ( convenience for wget ) , simple client functionality ( woof < URL > ) woof – 2009 - 12 - 27 :
Upload functionality , quite some code cleanup .
woof – 2009 - 02 - 27 : minor fix .
woof – 2009 - 02 - 17 : support for zip ( without temp files ! ) .
woof – 2009 - 02 - 13 : support for bz2 , no dependency on an external " tar " .
woof – 2007 - 01 - 20 : ancient woof version .
The Hissy Fit That Failed
During the press conference that followed the Monday afternoon vote , Deputy Whip Eric Cantor ( R - Va. ) held up a copy of Pelosi ’s speech , saying , “ Right here is the reason , I believe , why this vote failed , and this is Speaker Pelosi ’s speech that , frankly , struck the tone of partisanship that , frankly , was inappropriate in this discussion . ”
Rob Collins , Cantor ’s chief of staff , said on Tuesday that the speech itself did n’t switch votes , but the message that it sent poisoned the bipartisan tone that Boehner and Majority Leader Steny Hoyer ( D - Md. ) set .
“ Her unscripted attacks ran counter to our message of bipartisan unity ... I am not going to say her speech on the floor mattered , but it is a symptom of a larger illness with the Speaker , ” Collins said .
During a Tuesday interview on Fox News , House Republican Conference Chairman Adam Putnam ( Fla. ) did not mention Pelosi ’s floor speech .
Minority Whip Roy Blunt ( R - Mo. ) said on Monday evening the speech was n’t the sole cause for members voting no , but tipped the scales for some who were on the fence .
“ On those kinds of decisions [ members ] are often looking for that final reason to not do what they intended to do , ” he told reporters after the vote .
Shadegg , who mounted failed leadership bids for majority leader , and later , minority whip , said he believes that “ hurt feelings ” following the lost votes caused Boehner and other GOP leaders to lash out at Pelosi in the moments after the 205 - 228 tally .
“ It was embarrassing for leadership of both parties to lose the bill , ” Shadegg said .
“ So they went out and made a stupid claim . ”
During the MSNBC interview , Shadegg did n’t mention McCain , who echoed GOP leaders ’ comments about Pelosi on Monday .
Freshman Rep. Michele Bachmann ( R - Minn. ) , who was among the 133 Republican “ no ” votes , ridiculed leadership ’s statements on Pelosi , saying on Monday , “ We ’re not babies who suck our thumbs . ”
Some conservatives also ripped leadership ’s claims .
Richard Viguerie , a conservative activist , said Tuesday that Republican leaders reacted to the bailout vote “ by giving Nancy Pelosi credit for killing the Bush - Paulson scheme , and by falsely accusing their own members of throwing a temper tantrum . ”
Peter Wehner , a former speechwriter for President Bush , called the insinuation that the vote failed because of Pelosi ’s speech “ lame and adolescent ” on National Review Online ’s The Corner .
“ Can they be serious ?
Do they realize how foolish and irresponsible they sound ?
On one of the most important votes they will ever cast , insisting ‘ the speech made me do it ’ is lame and adolescent , ” he wrote .
“ Watching Boehner , Blunt , and Cantor blame the outcome on the Pelosi speech was an embarrassment . ”

Enough is enough .
Congress is about to waste more money attempting to prop up ailing dinosaurs GM and Ford .
We need to do something about this and we will .
Please read this and act .
First let 's go over the background information .
Time is reporting Pressure for a New Bailout Grows .
Executives of GM , Ford and Chrysler met with House speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate majority leader Harry Reid on how to increase the size of Washington 's aid package to the Big Three .
Though details are still being worked out , the push is for an additional $ 25 billion in federal loan guarantees for Detroit in addition to the $ 25 billion already promised to assist the industry 's shift to green technology .
GM To Big To Fail ?
Bloomberg today cites sources that claim a collapse of GM would cost taxpayers $ 200 billion if the company were forced to liquidate .
The projections also called for the loss of " millions " of auto - related jobs .
GM , Ford , and Chrysler employ 240,000 .
They provide healthcare to 2 million , pension benefits to 775,000 .
Another 5 million jobs are directly related to the three auto companies .
GM has 6,000 dealerships which employ 344,000 people .
According to a recent study by the Center for Automotive Research ( CAR ) , if the domestic automakers cut output and employment by 50 percent , nearly 2.5 million jobs would be lost and governments would lose $ 108 billion in revenue over three years .
Wilbur Ross , a well - known multi- billionaire investor , was on CNBC saying that allowing GM to go bankrupt would throw the country into what sounded like a depression .
Of course , he does have an auto parts company which supplies GM ; so he , as my Dad would say , does have a dog in that hunt .
Unimaginable Consequences
Wagoner states that a GM bankruptcy would have " unimaginable consequences " .
Here is my translation " Wagoner Admits He Has No Imagination " .
Of course with GM shares at $ 3 , that should be readily apparent .
Auto Industry Scare Tactics
New Way Of Doing Business
General Motors Corp. , the world 's biggest carmaker , opened a $ 300 million factory in Russia as it looks to compensate for slumping sales in western Europe and North America .
The plant in the Shushary district on the outskirts of St. Petersburg will produce 70,000 Chevrolet Captiva sport-utility vehicles and the Opel Astra , with plans to manufacture the Chevrolet Cruze compact car next year .
" Our strategy is to become the leading manufacturer in Russia , " Carl - Peter Forster , GM 's chief for Europe , told reporters during the plant opening today .
" For us Russia is not an emerging market .
Russia emerged long ago . "
Top Republican senators oppose automaker bailout
Sens . Richard Shelby of Alabama and Jon Kyl of Arizona said it would be a mistake to use any of the Wall Street rescue money to prop up the automakers .
They said an auto bailout would only postpone the industry 's demise .
" Companies fail every day and others take their place .
I think this is a road we should not go down , " said Shelby , the senior Republican on the Senate Banking , Housing and Urban Affairs Committee .
" They 're not building the right products , " he said .
" They 've got good workers but I do n't believe they 've got good management .
They do n't innovate .
They 're a dinosaur in a sense . "
Added Kyl , the Senate 's second - ranking Republican : " Just giving them $ 25 billion does n't change anything .
It just puts off for six months or so the day of reckoning . "
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - Calif. , said over the weekend that the House would provide aid to the ailing industry , though she did not put a price on her plan .
" The House is ready to do it , " said Democratic Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts , chairman of the House Financial Services Committee .
" There 's no downside to trying . "

Message For Congress
Fax Title : Say No To Auto Bailout
Dear senator / congressional rep
The Auto industry is attempting to employ the same scare tactics used by Paulson to get Congress to approve a $ 700 billion bailout for banks .
Please remember that we were told huge measures were needed to prevent a stock market collapse .
Congress passed the $ 700 billion bailout on Friday October 3 .
Since $ 700 Billion Bailout Passed
The S&P collapsed from 1114 on October 3rd to 848 on November 17th .
This is a drop of 24 % .
Paulson did not use the funds as requested .
Bernanke promised to disclose how taxpayer money would be used but has refused to do so .
Bloomberg has filed a lawsuit against the Fed under the Freedom of Information Act to find out just how Paulson has used the money .
Not a single job was created with the money .
Fannie Mae has announced it may need another $ 100 billion .
Freddie Mac proclaimed it had negative net worth .
AIG received another $ 37 billion .
Cities and Auto companies now want a share of the $ 700 Billion .
There was not a single positive result out of the money that was spent .
The Paulson plan was poorly thought out and poorly executed which is exactly what one would expect when Congress rushes to pass bills without considering alternatives .
Paulson Humiliated
On November 14 Paulson stated " We have in many ways humiliated ourselves as a nation with some of the problems that have taken place here . "
Humiliated Again
We were humiliated again by wasting half of the appropriated $ 700 billion and getting virtually nothing out of it .
Worse yet , Congress violated free market principles to waste that money .
Now Congress is complaining banks do not want to lend .
Of course banks do not want to lend .
Unemployment is rising , credit card defaults are rising , foreclosures are rising , and commercial real estate losses are rising .
Banks need reserves to offset increasing loan loss provisions .
Forcing Banks To Lend Is A Huge Mistake
Forcing banks to lend would be a huge mistake .
All it will do is increase bank losses .
We are in this mess in the first place because banks lent recklessly .
Now the ultimate irony is right in the midst of a recession , certain members of Congress are attempting to force banks to lend .
Stop The Madness !
Consumers are tapped out .
They are not going to buy autos no matter how much money Congress throws at the sector .
World Will Not End If GM Goes Bankrupt
The very best thing that can happen to GM and Ford is they go bankrupt .
The sooner the better .
Congress will then see that the world will not end .
Both companies will reorganize .
Both companies will keep making cars .
The airline industry did not stop flying when it went bankrupt and the auto companies will not stop producing cars if they go bankrupt .
In fact , bankruptcies will eliminate the debt on the books decrease interest payments and make the companies more competitive , if and when they ever get around to producing autos that consumers want instead of what the manufactures want to produce .
The combined market cap of GM and Ford is $ 1.84 Billion + $ 4.30 Billion or a grand total of $ 6.14 Billion .
Spending $ 50 billion on companies worth $ 6.14 billion makes no sense .
Furthermore , GM alone has a negative net worth ( Stockholder 's Deficit ) of $ 60 Billion according to GM's 10Q for the period ended September 30 , 2008 .
If Congress gave GM $ 50 billion , GM would be worth - $ 10 billion !
The Downside In Trying
Barney Frank says
" There is no downside in trying . "
Of course there is a downside in trying .
The downside is however much money Congress is willing to throw at the problem because every bit of it will be wasted .
Paulson gave Citigroup $ 25 billion .
Today Citigroup announced it will shed 50,000 jobs .
Exactly what taxpayer benefit did we get for that $ 25 billion ?
It is high time Congress stops wasting taxpayer money .
Let GM and Ford go bankrupt .
The world will not end and no jobs will be lost that are not going to be lost anyway .
The more money Congress wastes attempting to bail out organizations that deserve to fail , the less money there will be for legitimate uses down the road .
It 's high time that Congress understood that simple economic fact .
I urge you to vote against any bailout for the Auto companies .
To do so would be a further waste of taxpayer money .

Okay , so it ’s not really a blueberry cheesecake but I did n’t know what else to call it J .
It does have some delicious blueberry pie filling on it though .
This is the cheesecake that I made this year for Thanksgiving .
After all , what could be better for Thanksgiving dessert than a cheesecake ?
It was so good and it absolutely got devoured in no time .
The highlight of this cheesecake is the crust .
The crust is a combination of vanilla wafers and 3 different types of nuts – almonds , walnuts , and pecans .
A great way to make the crush is to crush all of the ingredients with a rolling pin .
I feel the addition of lemon juice in the filling makes a huge difference in the overall flavor , and a little vanilla does n’t hurt either .
If you are looking for a delicious cheesecake recipe give this one a try .
You wo n’t be disappointed .
Enjoy .

What David Chalmers calls the “ Hard Problem ” of consciousness has been among the main reasons I started this blog .
If you view it honestly , it is the last remaining fundamental mystery and , were I to be as extreme as Camus in The Myth of Sisyphus , I would go so far as to label it the only problem worth studying ( Camus said that about suicide though ) .
I meant to segue into this topic slowly , by first posting reviews of a bunch of relevant books as anchor points for my views , but blog readers have an unsettling habit of jumping the gun , and derailing the best - laid roll - out plan with untidy comments .
So here we go .
I ’ll frame and circumscribe my approach , state my axiomatic commitments , bluntly partition the landscape into the relevant and irrelevant , and we ’ll get set for exploring the Last Great Mystery .
Why Framing is Hard
When you deal with something as fundamental as consciousness , you have to first formulate the problem of formulating the problem .
In fact , it can take several chapters of a carefully - written book like Chalmers ’
The Conscious Mind to even make a case that there is an actual problem .
That we are not merely talking about confused self - referential processing by a neuro - computer .
That labeling it an ’ emergent ’ property of a complex set of algorithms is misguided at a very basic level .
When it comes to consciousness , there is so much complexity and so many irrelevant ( or at best , marginal ) sideshows that one party or another holds dear ( sneak preview : AI , religion , neuroscience and ‘ humanism ’ ) that a full - blown open debate is impossible .
You will either be reduced to Consciousness 101 level irrelevancies like whether computers can be “ creative ” or have huge dissonances , like that between ( say ) Daniel Dennett and David Chalmers , or between those who view the experiential - report evidence from mystic traditions as legitimate and those who do not .
The 101 level debates are boring , and the advanced debates between polar extremes are irrevocably stalled .
The only hope for interesting progress is to commit to the camp that you resonate with the most , and look for movement there .
Ignore the beginners who are yet to get beyond a few nights of stoned introspection , and ignore your intellectually solid but too - distant peers .
We ’ll bridge that gap in 2025 .
Until then , I ’ll listen , but not engage , certain viewpoints like Strong AI .
So where am I on this spectrum of development of sophistication of views ?
Not 101 certainly .
My bookshelf on consciousness and mysticism groans under a collection of some 30 volumes ( more than half of which I ’ve actually read ) .
I ’ve done a couple of informal talks about the subject .
And I have one data point from a personal “ mystical ” experience ( they are not as rare as you think , you can stop feeling special if you ’ve had one too — I estimate that 1 in 4 or 5 people have had experiences comparable to mine , and they ’re not particularly hard to get to ) .
But more on that later .
So I am not at the 101 level , and 101 level debates bore me to tears .
I am also not a professional though , and have n’t worked years writing volumes on the subject .
So one of the things I will be doing with this theme is exploring ideas at say , a 501 level .
I ’ll eventually post a bibliography if you want to catch up and keep up .
Keep in mind though , that almost everything that has been written is about clearing away clutter that is not relevant .
Surprisingly little has been said on the subject that is relevant in a non-negative - definition sense .
But you have to clear the clutter , and there the literature helps .
I ’ll studiously ignore 101 level questions or at best say “ read Chalmers ” or something along those lines .
This is not because I am snotty about my extensive reading in this area .
It is because even for the talented thinkers in this field , who I frequently cite , providing a careful account of even the most trivial - sounding question , like whether we all experience ‘ blue ’ the same way , can take entire chapters .
And still achieve no progress besides eliminating the sillier wrong answers .
The Framing Problem
So here is the framing problem , which might itself be critiqued , but let ’s not backstep our way to exhaustion .
If you answer this for yourself unambiguously , you will at least know where to begin looking for the real question .
The framing problem is to force yourself to make clear assertions about the following things questions :
Do you or do you not believe that subjective consciousness is a real , as yet - unexplained , mystery ?
( Chalmers estimates that about two thirds of academics engaged in the question believe it is .
Daniel Dennett wrote a book titled “ Consciousness Explained ” that represents the other third who think it has been explained .
That ’s the schism .
Live with it . )
If you answered ‘ yes ’ to Question 1 , which sub-category of stances do you adopt ( the main current candidates being a ) that consciousness is a fundamental property of the universe like mass / time , b ) that it is a an epiphenomenon of brains only , or c ) it has something to do with quantum mechanics that manifests itself due to the peculiar structure of the brain ) .
There are about half a dozen other views which I do n’t view as even being contenders .
What elements of the consciousness debates do you consider relevant , marginally relevant and irrelevant respectively ?
There is a laundry list of things you need to make up your mind about , which I ’ll provide in a minute .
That ’s it .
That ’s the framing problem .
My own commitments have been made : yes to 1 , choice a ) for 2 , and the rest of this post for 3 .
If you believe ‘ no ’ for the first question ( a stance usually , but not exclusively , identified with what is known as Strong AI ) , then I probably have nothing to say to you that has n’t been said already .
It is n’t that your viewpoint is provably unsound — it is just that debate is fruitless at this stage of evolution of both options , and primarily consists of noisy public showboating .
A prime example of this is Daniel Dennett dismissing certain points of view as ‘ you are a mysterian ’ ( a category he made up ) on venues like Slate ’s Meaning of Life TV .
Entertaining , but not particularly helpful in moving the debates forward .
Neither side can completely undermine the other at this stage , but neither does direct engagement help .
Each side has significant internal work to get done first .
Scoping the Specifics
Once you decide you want to roll up your sleeves and do some non-trivial thinking about consciousness , you have some prep - work to do .
In the framing problem , answering question 1 is easy if you have read a couple of books ( or even if you are navigating only by introspection up to this point ) .
Question 2 is tougher if you do n’t know about some of the frames in play , but I ’ll help you along for that in a future post , but Question 3 , fortunately , is a much simpler matter of logical grunt work and figuring out the implications of your foundational commitment from Question 1 .
The grunt work consists in making up your mind about several themes that have been proposed as candidate elements ( or even centerpieces ) of the debate .
Here is the list of the usual suspects , probably incomplete , but covering 90 % of the words you ’ll see and hear in the debates .
You may want to print out this page and pencil in your opinions if you want to follow along this thread of blog posts .
I ’ll elaborate on my own commitments in a minute .
None of this , unfortunately , is a moment ’s work , but you can do an instantaneous self - assessment and evolve that .
I ’ll be addressing at least a few of these themes .
To form a substantial opinion and avoid getting trapped into unnecessary trails of thought that others have mapped and dismissed credibly , you need to do some reading .
Themes List
Neuroscience of the fMRI localization variety ( “ decision making is located in the anteriorus crapulus ” )
Neuroscience of the brain damage / counterintuitive phenomena variety ( as in Oliver Sacks ’ books ) Artificial Intelligence Complexity and ’ emergence ’ ( of the Douglas Hofstadter and Santa Fe varieties )
Foundations of mathematics ( stuff like Godel ’s theorem , Brouwer ’s view of the continuum , and so forth ) ( Human ) Psychology Humanism and ethics Mysticism and mystic experiences ( East or West ; cultural silos are irrelevant .
If you are a Westerner , think about the Christian mystic Hildegrad von Bingen if Vedanta and Zen make you uncomfortable and New Ageism leaves you cold )
Religion of the organized variety with an associated theology and historicism Unsolved fundamental physics problems ( primarily , but not only , quantum indeterminacy )
Western philosophy of mind ( Descartes , Ryle , all the way up to Chalmers ) Language and its phenomenology Other Western metaphysics subfields besides PoM , such as ontology and epistemology Eastern metaphysics , separated from the related theology ( primarily the varieties of Buddhist and Vedantic and non-Vedantic Indian metaphysics — recall that in the West , there was a philosophy - religion split , or more correctly , a theology - metaphysics split , perhaps dating back to about Aquinas , that has no parallel in the East .
So you have to do the separation artificially , since I do think that the split is a useful and necessary operation )
My Commitments
Here are my commitments .
I parse the themes into irrelevant , distraction , useful and fundamental .
A word on the middle two categories is in order .
There are many things that lead to revealing arguments that illuminate some aspects of the mystery of consciousness ( more so for some stances than for others ) , but for some , the illumination comes at the expense of a whole lot of distraction .
Language is an example .
To me , the argument that dogs fall into my definition of ‘ conscious ’ , dogs do n’t have language , ergo , language is irrelevant is sufficient to ignore language as a fundamental feature .
Whatever insight thinking about language provides then , comes at the expense of enormously distracting debates of the sort Steven Pinker likes to get into ( he of “ How the Mind Works ” and acolyte - of - Chomsky fame ) .
Not worth it .
Language , however interesting a subject qua language , is too expensive an indulgence for a spartan attack on consciousness .
So here is my parsed list .
I ’ll justify some commitments , defer some , and simply assert an opinion on others without defending them ( usually because it takes too long and others have done a better job already ) .
Remember , my classification follows from my commitment to answer a ) to Question 2 .
If you answered differently , you will parse differently .
The Irrelevant
Humanism and ethics Religion of the organized variety with with an associated theology and historicism
The Distracting
Almost all of AI , except for occasionally useful thought experiments .
The slug is 0.01 on the consciousness scale , ergo , most talk of AI capabilities is completely distracting .
The 0.01 level scale consciousness of a slug with 127 neurons is just as mysterious as the fact that you can critique Van Gogh and HAL ( as yet ) can ’t .
Let ’s stick with the simpler cases and not go to the more complex cases unless they reveal some subtlety .
Have n’t seen any such revealing subtlety in the reams I ’ve read from AI so far .
Even the famous Searle - Dennett Chinese Room debates are a distraction once you plow through the details .
Neuroscience of the fMRI localization variety .
See Mind Wide Open .
Learning the physical address of something in the brain is not particularly helpful .
All you need from the neuro - morphological research literature is a rough - and - ready understanding of gross structure ( like neocortex versus brain stem ) .
The rest is detail .
Noisy detail .
If something in that world is curious enough and helpful enough to this debate , you ’ll hear about it in a more digestible context from a hard - working philosopher who will filter out the noise for you .
Language and its phenomenology .
This is a hard area for me to dismiss as a distraction , because I hugely enjoy all my reading and thinking in this area , and it is deeply revealing in other ways .
Complexity and ’ emergence ’ ( of the Douglas Hofstadter and Santa Fe varieties ) .
Again , it pains me to have to put this class of literature in the ‘ distracting ’ class , but I can only view my immersion in that for the better part of a decade as a waste of time , at least for the purposes of exploring the consciousness problem .
It is useful for thinking about other things , but not for consciousness .
The Useful
Neuroscience of the brain damage / counterintuitive phenomena variety :
This is useful because it can lead you away from certain pointless lines of thought .
For instance , does the brain construct reality or perceive it ?
The data is in .
It constructs reality .
You do not need to agonize over this .
Read Dennett to understand how ( in particular the Stalinist vs. Orwellian models of how the brain parses sensory data ) .
Understand , internalize , move on .
The mystery is n’t hiding there .
( Human ) Psychology :
Not useful in the way you might think , in terms of what it says about the subject itself ( hint : “ almost nothing ” ) , but in terms of what it tells you about the pitfalls of your own thinking about a topic that is so intimately and trickily entwined with your sense of ( objective psychological ) self .
Mysticism and mystic experiences : most people either ignore ( out of unreasoned suspicion or reasoned skepticism ) , underrate or overrate the importance of evidence from mysticism , so since this is a theme where I take a possibly very unusual stance , I ’ll elaborate in a separate post .
Other Western metaphysics subfields besides PoM , such as ontology and epistemology : these help skewer certain viewpoints like the ‘ Cartesian Theater ’ but are not in themselves directly relevant .
Fundamental
Western Philosophy of Mind ( Descartes , Ryle all the way up to Chalmers ) :
You need this , and you ’ll understand why when you read Chalmers and realize that it takes a hundred pages even to create a secure sandbox for thinking that is insulated from the distracting attacks of , say , Daniel Dennett .
There is a vast , sophisticated and nuanced vocabulary that WPoM brings to the party ( example , “ qualia ” ) and a neat array of powerful thought experiments ( like the Zombie problem and the inverted spectrum ) that clarify a whole bunch of muddy issues .
Eastern metaphysics , stripped of mythological trappings : studiously ( though not conspiratorially as some imagine ) ignored by the Western academy , mainly because it has no clue how to methodologically integrate what Eastern metaphysics has to say .
It is mainly the second rung amateurs from outside philosophy ( primarily neuroscientists who are stuck in synaptic weeds , and some AI folks infatuated with Zen koans ) who introduce these ideas into the Western academy .
To be fair , the few remaining intellectually rigorous Eastern philosophers roundly ignore Western ideas too , besides occasionally whining about credit attribution issues ( I have a friend — sorry to call you out Rashmun ! — who frequently brings up the point that the Mimasaka philosopher Kumarila Bhatta developed the dreaming argument before Descartes .
Yeah , yeah , let ’s move on ! ) .
Unsolved fundamental physics problems ( primarily , but not only , quantum indeterminacy ) .
Chalmers dismisses this as not relevant , and that ’s an area where I break from his views .
I do n’t agree or disagre ; I just think the jury is still out , and that fundamental physics is at least as mysterious as consciousness itself .
Think about it .
Mass , space and time are fundamentally just as confusing as the fact that there happens to be an ‘ I ’ sitting inside your head ( just behind your eyes , apparently ) .
Foundations of mathematics ( stuff like Godel ’s theorem , Brouwer ’s view of the continuum , and so forth )
Whew !
That was quite a trek .
And that was just to get to the starting line .
Hopefully we ’ll make some progress in the next post .

The St. Paul City Attorney ’s office announced Friday it will not prosecute Democracy Now ! journalists Amy Goodman , Sharif Abdel Kouddous and Nicole Salazar .
St. Paul Mayor Chris Coleman also issued a statement Friday that “ the city will decline to prosecute misdemeanor charges for presence at an unlawful assembly for journalists arrested during the Republican National Convention . ”
Troy Anthony Davis was scheduled to die by lethal injection Tuesday .
Two hours before the state of Georgia was to execute him , the U.S. Supreme Court issued a stay until Monday .
It had earlier agreed to hear Davis ’ case on Sept. 29 , but Georgia set his execution date six days before the hearing .
Around 800 people were arrested during the four day Republican National Convention earlier this month .
Dozens were reporters , and one was Democracy Now ! host Amy Goodman , who argues the arrests have a chilling effect on journalists .
New York City , NY – Award - winning journalist and host of Democracy Now !
Amy Goodman is the first journalist to receive the Right Livelihood Award , widely recognized as the world ’s premier award for personal courage and social transformation .
The annual prize , also known as the Alternative Nobel , will be awarded in the Swedish Parliament on December 8 , 2008 .
A little - noticed story surfaced a couple of weeks ago in the Army Times newspaper about the 3rd Infantry Division ’s 1st Brigade Combat Team .
“ Beginning Oct. 1 for 12 months , ” reported Army Times staff writer Gina Cavallaro , “ the 1st BCT will be under the day - to - day control of U.S. Army North , the Army service component of Northern Command , as an on - call federal response force for natural or manmade emergencies and disasters , including terrorist attacks . ”
Disturbingly , she writes that “ they may be called upon to help with civil unrest and crowd control ” as well .
The reviews are in , and the latest U.S. presidential debate , the “ town hall ” from Nashville , Tenn. , was a snore .
One problem is that in a debate it is important for the debaters to actually disagree .
Yet Sens. Barack Obama and John McCain substantively agree on many issues .
That is one major reason that the debates should be open , and that major third - party or independent candidates should be included .
James Bamford : “ The Shadow Factory : The Ultra - Secret NSA from 9/11 to the Eavesdropping on America ”
The Bush administration ’s wiretapping program has come under new scrutiny this week .
Two influential congressional committees have opened probes into allegations US intelligence spied on the phone calls of American military personnel , journalists and aid workers in Iraq .
We speak to James Bamford about the NSA ’s spying on Americans , the agency ’s failings pre-9/11 and the ties between NSA and the nation ’s telecommunications companies .

Guest :
James Bamford , investigative reporter who has been covering the National Security Agency for the last three decades .
He came close to standing trial after revealing the NSA ’s operations in his explosive 1982 book The Puzzle Palace .
His latest book , which comes out today , is the third in his trilogy on the NSA .
It ’s called The Shadow Factory : The Ultra -Secret NSA from 9/11 to the Eavesdropping on America .
AMY GOODMAN : The Bush administration ’s wiretapping program has come under new scrutiny this week .
Two influential congressional committees have opened probes into allegations US intelligence spied on the phone calls of American military personnel , journalists and aid workers in Iraq .
Senator Patrick Leahy and Senator Arlen Specter of the Senate Judiciary Committee and Senator Jay Rockefeller , chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee , say they want Congress to look into allegations from two former military intelligence officials .
The two whistleblowers — Adrienne Kinne , an Army reservist , and David Murfee Faulk , a Navy linguist — spoke last Thursday to ABC News .
While the network claimed that marked the first time the two whistleblowers had come forward , they had both spoken out well before last week .
Blogger David Swanson wrote about them as early as July 2007 , and in her first broadcast interview five months ago , former Military Intelligence Sergeant Adrienne Kinne , detailed the spying on Democracy Now ! back in May .
ADRIENNE KINNE : I was stationed at Fort Gordon , Georgia , and I was actually mobilized shortly after 9/11 with a group of reservists who were eventually sent to Fort Gordon to work a mission , that it was actually a brand new mission .
It was something not like anything I had done in military intelligence previously .
And this new mission involved the intercept of satellite phone communications in Iraq and Afghanistan and basically a huge swath of the region around those two countries .
It was really brand new , and basically there were about twenty of us who were put in charge of this new mission , to stand it up .
In the very beginning , basically what we did was that we would have a front end , which intercepted satellite phone communications in that region , and then it would transmit the satellite phone conversations back to the United States , where it would just fill up this queue in our computer , and we would just go through .
And all the numbers were unidentified .
So , at the beginning , it was just a matter of sifting through thousands upon thousands of unidentified satellite phone communications , as we kind of tried to sort out what phone number belonged to who and kind of go through the process of identifying phone numbers in the search for intelligence that might be related to operations in Afghanistan and , later on , Iraq .
AMY GOODMAN : And when were you listening to Iraq ?
ADRIENNE KINNE :
We started listening to the entire region pretty much immediately .
I think this was December of 2001 .
And I was mobilized from October 2001 through August of 2003 .
So I was working that mission pretty much from December through August of 2003 .
And over the course of my time , as we slowly began to identify phone numbers and who belonged to what , one thing that gave me grave concern was that as we identified phone numbers , we started to find more and more and more numbers that belonged not to any organizations affiliated with terrorism or with military — with militaries of Iraq or Afghanistan or elsewhere , but with humanitarian aid organizations , non-governmental organizations , who include the International Red Cross , Red Crescent , Doctors Without Borders , a whole host of humanitarian aid organizations .
And it also included journalists .
AMY GOODMAN : Former Military Intelligence Sergeant Adrienne Kinne , speaking on Democracy Now ! in May .
She and Navy linguist , David Murfee Faulk , were also interviewed for a new book on the National Security Agency by James Bamford , an investigative journalist and author of two earlier books on the agency .
Bamford is among the plaintiffs in a suit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of journalists , academics , aid workers and lawyers who feared they were targeted by government spying .
A federal appeals court dismissed the case last year after ruling the plaintiffs can’t prove they were monitored .
The ACLU might reopen the suit to include the new revelations by Kinne and Faulk .
James Bamford has been covering the National Security Agency for the last three decades .
He came close to standing trial after revealing the NSA ’s operations in his explosive 1982 book The Puzzle Palace .
His latest book , which comes out today , is the third in his trilogy on the NSA .
It ’s called The Shadow Factory : The Ultra -Secret NSA from 9/11 to the Eavesdropping on America .
Today , we spend the hour with James Bamford .
He joins us from Washington , D.C .
Welcome to Democracy Now !
JAMES BAMFORD : Thanks ,
Amy .
I appreciate it .
AMY GOODMAN : It ’s good to have you with us .
Well , let ’s talk about Adrienne Kinne ’s allegations , spying on Americans and international aid workers in Iraq .
What ’s wrong with this ?
JAMES BAMFORD : Well , there ’s a lot of things wrong with it .
First of all , they ’re wasting their time , when they should be spying on or trying to intercept communications to and from terrorists .
That was one of the complaints that Adrienne had and also Murfee Faulk had , that they did n’t join the military to listen to Americans doing pillow talk , because a lot of this was intimate conversations between Americans and their spouses back in the United States .
They ’ve been separated a long time , and you can imagine what a lot of those conversations dealt with .
They were very personal matters dealing with finance , affection , and so forth .
So they felt that they were morally wrong by eavesdropping on these people and then just wasting government money and wasting their time by listening to things that had nothing to do with the war on terrorism .
AMY GOODMAN : You know , it ’s interesting .
One of the things Adrienne Kinne told us was that she was spying on journalists at the Palestine Hotel .
She knew they were journalists .
She heard what they were saying over time .
Here she was in Georgia , but spying on those people , those journalists , in Iraq .
And she said she saw a document , she saw an email that put the Palestine Hotel on a —as a bombing target , and she immediately went to her superiors , because she was spying on them , she knew that they were journalists .
She said , “ But there are journalists in that hotel . ”
She learned a lot in this spying .
Is this illegal ?
JAMES BAMFORD : Well , you know , it would have been illegal under the old original Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
The way they ’ve sort of contorted the new amendments to the act , it ’s hard to tell what ’s legal and what is n’t , because they ’ve taken the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court largely out of the mix .
And so , much of what is being done is governed by secret rules known as USSID 18 , United States Signals Intelligence Directive 18 , which is above top - secret .
It ’s top - secret code words .
So what is legal , what is n’t legal , it ’s very hard to tell .
And I think that ’s why you really need a congressional committee to really take a look at this .
What really needs to happen is a very in - depth examination of NSA post / 11 — actually , pre-9/11 and post - 9/11 , the kind that was done in the mid-1970s by Senator Frank Church , the Church Committee .
I think that ’s really the only way to get to the bottom of whether NSA messed up before the attacks on 9/11 and whether they ’re doing things that are illegal or improper after 9/11 .
AMY GOODMAN : What other allegations did the Navy linguist David Murfee Faulk make about what he was listening to in Iraq ?
JAMES BAMFORD : Well , he confirmed a lot of what Adrienne was saying .
And it ’s interesting , because they cover such different times there .
Adrienne was there from 2001 to August of 2003 .
David Faulk was there from November of 2003 until November of 2007 .
So you have this time period covered from 2001 to 2007 .
And they were both doing similar things .
They had never met each other .
So these are very independent views of what was going on over there .
And so , you have this continuum from 2001 to 2007 of eavesdropping on Americans .
One of the things that David Murfee Faulk brought up was the fact that not only were they eavesdropping on a lot of these conversations , some of which were very intimate , but they would have sort of locker room chats about what they were hearing , and they would post — or they would notify their co-workers that you should listen to this , what they call “ cut , ” their conversations .
You should listen to this conversation or that conversation .
They ’d laugh about it .
And , you know , I do n’t really think that ’s what the soldiers over there that are fighting really appreciate , the fact that you have Americans back in the state of Georgia laughing over their intimate conversations .
So , the other thing that David Murfee Faulk brought up that I thought was very important and really gave a good insight into what — how some of this activity that ’s taking place in Iraq comes about , you know , when they ’re dropping bombs on houses and neighborhoods and busting down doors and putting people into Abu Ghraib and so forth , how does that come about ?
Why do they bust down this door or drop a bomb on that house ?
And the insight he gave , I thought was very interesting .
He was saying how it ’s these people here that are sitting in this windowless room in the state of Georgia , near Augusta , Georgia , that are listening to these conversations in Iraq , in Baghdad , and they ’re making instantaneous decisions on whether somebody is telling the truth or not .
So they ’re writing out these — they ’re doing these transcripts , and then they ’re writing these little comments saying this person here , Ali , is saying he ’s going to deliver a load of melons to his cousin Mohammed tomorrow .
And then you have somebody making a decision : is he telling the truth , or is n’t he ?
Are these melons , or possibly could they be IEDs ?
And if a person says , “ You know , I do n’t think he ’s telling the truth , ” there ’s a good chance that that house could be blown up or that person could be put in Abu Ghraib , or whatever .
And the point that David Mufee Faulk was making was that the people that are making these decisions , these sometimes life - and - death decisions , do n’t have the proper training .
They ’re trained for sixty - three weeks in Monterey , California in standard Arabic .
And what they ’re listening to a lot of times is dialects that they do n’t really understand , and they ’re listening for nuances that they do n’t really get , and idioms and so forth .
And I think it ’s very dangerous , and what the point he was making was it was very dangerous for — you know , sometimes these are just people right out of high school to — that have never been out of the country , and certainly never been over to the Middle East , to make these sort of life - and - death decisions based on just hearing one conversation out of context .
AMY GOODMAN : And they ’re doing this from Fort Gordon , Georgia .
Are they working for the NSA , the National Security Agency ?
JAMES BAMFORD : Yes .
The way this works — a lot of people do n’t really understand how this whole system works — the NSA is sort of two organizations in one ; the director of NSA wears two hats .
If you ever get a letter from NSA or whatever , it says — the letterhead says , “ National Security Agency / Central Security Service . ”
And the director always signs his name “ Director NSA / Chief CSS . ”
The National Security Agency is largely civilians , and they ’re mostly the analysts and the people who design the sophisticated satellites and do a lot of the technical development work and break a lot of the codes and so forth .
And the people on the front lines , the intercept operators , are almost all military , and some civilians who transition from the military into a private contractor , for example .
So , most of those are the military , but they all come under the same organization .
The military is technically the Central Security Service , which reports to the director of NSA , and the civilians are largely NSA analysts and so forth .
So it ’s the same organization .
Adrienne Kinne , for example , she showed me her certificate that she received when she was there .
In a big print at the top , it said “ National Security Agency , ” and it was an award of achievement for the good work she did while she was there on this NSA mission called Operation Highlander .
AMY GOODMAN : We ’re talking to James Bamford , investigative journalist , author of three books now on the National Security Agency , his last out today , The Shadow Factory : The Ultra -Secret NSA from 9/11 to the Eavesdropping on America .
We ’re spending the hour with him .
When we come back from break , just what is the NSA ?
And then we ’ll talk about what happened in the lead - up to 9/11 and beyond .
Stay with us .
[ break ]
AMY GOODMAN : James Bamford is our guest for the hour , investigative reporter and author of three books on the National Security Agency , his newest book just out today , The Shadow Factory : The Ultra -Secret NSA from 9/11 to the Eavesdropping on America .
Jim Bamford , explain exactly what the NSA is .
I do n’t think most people realize that it is many times larger than , for example , the CIA .
JAMES BAMFORD : And many times more secret .
That ’s why there ’s been hundreds of books on the CIA , and there ’s only been three books on NSA , and I wrote all three .
So it ’s an agency that ’s very , very , very secret .
And the distinction between NSA and the CIA is that the CIA specializes in the type of espionage that most people are familiar with from reading James Bond books and so forth , the human spy , where the agent goes out and hides documents under a tree or tries to develop sources in a foreign country .
That ’s human intelligence , known in the trade as HUMINT .
NSA specializes in SIGINT , which is signals intelligence .
And what that is is eavesdropping .
And that ’s actually where the US gets most of its intelligence .
It does n’t really get most of its intelligence from human spies , because they ’re fairly unreliable and they ’re very rare to find .
But it gets most of its intelligence from eavesdropping on communications , whether it ’s telephone calls or email or faxes , computer transfers of information between computers , any kind of information like that , instant messages .
It intercepts it .
So NSA is the big ear .
And the way it works is , it picks up communications from satellites , it taps undersea and underground fiber - optic cables , it gets information any way it can , and then some of the information is encrypted , and it ’s responsible for breaking those codes and then sending the information that it gets from these intercepts to other agencies .
And that ’s what Adrienne and David Murfee Faulk did .
They were the actual front lines in this sort of electronic war .
They were the intercept operators .
AMY GOODMAN : Jim Bamford , can you talk about how the NSA picked up the very first clues about the 9/11 attacks well before the 9/11 attacks ?
JAMES BAMFORD : Well , the very first clue to the 9/11 attack occurred in late December 1999 , when the NSA picked up a message from a house in Yemen .
The house was being used by bin Laden as his operations center .
He did n’t have much capability to operate out of Afghanistan , so all the phone calls , all the messages , email and all that would go to this house in the city of Sanaa , the capital of Yemen .
NSA had been eavesdropping on that house for a number of years , and in late December 1999 , it picked up a particular intercept , picked up a particular phone conversation .
And the phone conversation said that — send Khalid and Nawaf to Kuala Lumpur for a meeting .
So , NSA picked that up , and they — first of all , they figured that Nawaf and Khalid had to be very important potential terrorists , because they were being assigned by bin Laden out in Afghanistan to go to a meeting in Kuala Lumpur .
That seemed like a terrorist summit meeting .
NSA gave that information to the other intelligence agencies , and the CIA set up a surveillance in Kuala Lumpur , and then they lost them in Kuala Lumpur .
After they lost them , Khalid al - Mihdhar and Nawaf al - Hazmi went to California .
They got in without any problem .
NSA , even though they had the last name of Nawaf al - Hazmi in their computers , they never bothered to check , so they both got in without any problem into the United States .
They went down , and they lived in San Diego .
And they began calling back and forth to that house in Yemen , the house that NSA was eavesdropping on .
So NSA is picking up their conversations to the house in Yemen , translating them and then sending out the conversations to — or summaries of the conversations to the CIA without ever telling anybody that they were in the United States .
And they were in the United States for almost two years .
Al - Hazmi was there from January 2000 to September 2001 .
And again , they ’re communicating back and forth ; NSA is picking up but not telling anybody that they ’re in the US .
AMY GOODMAN : Explain , Jim Bamford —
JAMES BAMFORD : And it got so bad —
AMY GOODMAN : You say that they set up their final base of operations almost next door to the NSA headquarters in Laurel , Maryland ?
JAMES BAMFORD : Well , that ’s the ultimate irony , was they eventually travel across country from San Diego , and they set up their final base of operations — these are the —this is the crew that was about to attack the Pentagon — about a month before , they set up their base of operations in Laurel , Maryland , of all places , that happens to be the same city that NSA is headquartered .
So they set up their base of operations in this Valencia Motel , and almost across the Baltimore - Washington Parkway is NSA headquarters .
The director ’s office is on the eighth floor , and , except for some trees , he could almost see the motel where they ’re staying .
So , NSA is over there trying to find terrorists , and here is the 9/11 terrorists sitting right opposite the NSA on the other side of the parkway making their final plans .
Mohamed Atta flew there for summit meetings .
And they had to take three hotels at one point to put all the people there .
So , as NSA is looking for them , they ’re having their final summit meetings there , and they ’re walking around the Safeway , they ’re exercising in Gold ’s Gym , they ’re eating in the restaurants there , they ’re mingling with NSA employees .
That ’s NSA ’s company town .
It ’s just the ultimate irony that here you have the terrorists and the eavesdroppers living side by side in the month before the final attack .
AMY GOODMAN : You then say , after the attacks , the White House expanded massively surveillance , turning it inward on Americans right here .
Can you talk about how they did it ?
JAMES BAMFORD : Well , first of all , looking back on the pre-attack , it was clear right after the attack that General Hayden , the Director of NSA , realized the big mistake he had made , that these guys not only were in the US , and he never told anybody they were communicating from the other side of the Baltimore - Washington Parkway , and he never let anybody know .
So , obviously , he was very chagrined at the fact that , you know , his actions were contributing factors to the whole 9/11 attack by not being more aggressive in going after their communications and telling people where they were .
So , after 9/11 , to some degree to make up for it , he decided to not protest when the Bush administration , particularly Dick Cheney , began putting pressure on him to begin doing warrantless domestic eavesdropping or warrantless eavesdropping of Americans .
And that was a big mistake .
It would have been much better if he stood up like Jim Comey at the Justice Department did .
He stood up , as well as the director of the FBI .
And even Attorney General John Ashcroft stood up and threatened to resign over parts of this warrantless eavesdropping .
But General Hayden decided to go along with it , and as a result , the NSA began this very intrusive program of warrantless eavesdropping on US citizens , both intrusive and largely useless .
AMY GOODMAN : I wanted to ask you about this documentary that you ’re making for PBS on NOVA and the news that was reported in the Washington Post a few days ago .
FBI special agents Mark Rossini and Douglas Miller have asked for permission to appear in an upcoming public television documentary on pre-9/11 rivalries between the CIA , FBI , National Security Agency .
It ’s your documentary .
The FBI has denied them permission , on grounds the FBI does n’t want to stir up old conflicts .
Talk about what they have to say .
JAMES BAMFORD : Well , the documentary I ’m doing is — it ’s going to be very interesting .
It ’s going to air January 13th .
And what it does is it sort of takes a large part of the book and translates it into imagery , into video .
So we actually go to that house in Yemen .
We actually located that house in Yemen and did video there .
It was fairly hazardous , but we got video of the house .
And we traced the path of these 9/11 hijackers from basically the moment the message came in to the time when they were living opposite NSA in Laurel , Maryland .
As part of this program , we ’re looking at what happened when they were in Kuala Lumpur .
And what happened was , in their flight from Yemen to Kuala Lumpur , the CIA was able to get a copy of the passport , of Khalid al - Mihdhar ’s passport , and the passport had a visa in there for the United States .
It showed that they were n’t just going to Kuala Lumpur ; they were going to Kuala Lumpur and then to the United States .
Well , that was very important information for the FBI .
And at the time , the CIA had this very small unit within its Counterterrorism Center ; it was called Alex Station .
And that was the bin Laden unit .
Those were the people whose sole responsibility was trying to find Osama bin Laden .
And the center was made up mostly of CIA officials , but there were also two FBI agents there that were assigned to that unit .
When that message came in indicating that Mihdhar had a visa to the United States , the two FBI agents protested that they should send a message to the FBI headquarters and notify them .
Mark Rossini was one of the FBI agents , and Doug Miller was the other .
Doug Miller actually wrote up a memo to FBI headquarters saying , we ’ve got to notify FBI that these guys are probably headed towards the United States ; they ’ve got a US visa .
And Mark Rossini also said , we should send this message to the FBI headquarters .
And I interviewed Rossini , Mark Rossini , on — for my book , and I quote him in the book as saying that he was told by the two people in charge of Alex Station at the CIA that he could n’t send the message to FBI headquarters .
He was forbidden to send it to them .
And at one time , when he protested , the deputy — I think it was the deputy head of that station — I could n’t reveal her name in the book , because she ’s still at the CIA , but she put her hands on her hips and said , “ Look , the next attack is going to take place in Southeast Asia , not the United States .
So when we want the FBI to know about it , we ’ll tell the FBI about it . ”
And under the rules that existed , they were n’t allowed to notify the FBI headquarters without CIA permission , since that was a CIA document that contained the information on the visa , on Mihdhar ’s visa .
So , I interviewed Mark Rossini , and he was very angry that he was never allowed to send that message .
Had that message been sent to FBI headquarters —
AMY GOODMAN : And the story goes beyond that .
JAMES BAMFORD : — the FBI would have put a — I ’m sorry ?
AMY GOODMAN : I just wanted to say , the story goes beyond that .
I was saying this was in the Washington Post ; it was actually in the Congressional Quarterly , that they were prepared to say publicly that under pressure from the CIA , they kept the full truth from the Justice Department ’s inspector general , which looked into the FBI ’s handling of the pre-9/11 intelligence in 2004 .
JAMES BAMFORD : Well , not only that , the 9/11 Commission , which did a pretty poor job on a lot of this , they never looked at any of the information that I ’m reporting on the National Security Agency , and they also never interviewed either Rossini or Doug Miller , the two FBI agents in there .
I mean , it seems incredible to me that the 9/11 Commission never interviewed the two FBI agents who were assigned to the bin Laden unit .
So that ’s part of the story that ’s never been told , that the American public just has no idea of some of these things that took place leading up to 9/11 .
AMY GOODMAN : James Bamford , we have to break , then we ’re going to come back to this discussion .
Investigative reporter , his third book in a trilogy on the NSA , out today , The Shadow Factory : The Ultra -Secret NSA from 9/11 to the Eavesdropping on America .
Back in a minute .
[ break ]
AMY GOODMAN : On the issue of the telecoms ’ role in domestic spying , I want to turn to Mark Klein .
He ’s the former AT&T technician who blew the whistle on the involvement of phone companies in the Bush administration ’s domestic surveillance program .
Klein was with AT&T for twenty - two years .
In 2006 , he leaked internal documents revealing the company had set up a secret room in its San Francisco office to give the NSA access to its fiber - optic internet cables .
MARK KLEIN :
We were told one day in late 2002 that an NSA representative was coming to the office to speak to a certain management technician about a special job .
And this turned out to be installing a secret room in the next office I was going to be in the following year .
And that secret room involved a lot of spying equipment .
Only this one management technician could go in there , and the regular union technicians were not allowed to go in there .
But when — in 2003 I was assigned to that office , and I got hold of the documents which were available — they ’re not classified — and the documents showed what they were doing .
They were basically copying the entire data stream going across critical internet cables and copying the entire data stream to this secret room , so the NSA was getting everything .
AMY GOODMAN : That ’s Mark Klein , the former AT&T technician who blew the whistle on the involvement of phone companies in the Bush administration ’s domestic surveillance program .
Jim Bamford , with us for the hour , author of The Shadow Factory , out today , can you talk about how the CIA or the NSA is now working out secret and potentially illegal agreements with the telecom industry in order to access US telecommunications and what exactly Mark Klein is talking about , not just potentially illegal , what they ’ve done ?
JAMES BAMFORD : Sure .
And just before I do that , I ’d just like to thank these people for speaking out .
Having been writing on this topic for twenty - five years , I know how difficult it is for anybody to come out and speak about what ’s going on at NSA ; it ’s a very difficult thing .
So , Mark Klein and Adrienne Kinne and David Murfee Faulk , Mark Rossini , these people , you know , I look at as heroes , because they ’ve come out and pointed a finger at what ’s been going wrong without — you know , there ’s no compensation .
They ’re risking their — the rest of their career or possibly risking the US government by coming out and pointing these fingers .
So , you know , I just have a lot of admiration for these people .
And what Mark Klein was talking about , he was a supervisor for twenty - two years over at AT&T , and he discovered this secret room in this facility in San Francisco , this very tall , ten- , twelve - story building out in San Francisco , which is basically the switch , AT&T ’s switch for their communications in that part of the country , the sort of western part of the country .
And what happened is that during the 1990s and early in the ’80s and the ’70s , the NSA used to collect information by putting out big dishes and collecting satellite communications that would come down .
It was very easy .
They put the dishes out ; satellite transmits the telephone calls and messages , emails and so forth down to earth ; and the satellite picks it up .
And then NSA collects it .
NSA did n’t have to deal with the telecommunication companies at all , because they could get the information independent of the telecom companies .
Then , in the late ’90s , things began to change , and fiber optics became a big thing for telecommunications .
Fiber optics are cables in which the communications are transmitted , not electronically , but by photons , light signals .
And that made life very difficult for NSA .
It meant the communications , instead of being able to pick them up in a big dish , they were now being transmitted under the ocean in these cables .
And the only way to get access to it would be to put a submarine down and try to tap into those cables .
But that , from the people I ’ve talked to , has not been very successful with fiber - optic cables .
So the only other way to really do this is by making some kind of agreement with the telecom companies , so that NSA could actually basically cohabitate some of the telecom companies ’ locations .
And that ’s what happened .
NSA began making these agreements with AT&T and other companies , and that in order to get access to the actual cables , they had to build these secret rooms in these buildings .
So what would happen would be the communications on the cables would come into the building , and then the cable would go to this thing called a splitter box , which was a box that had something that was similar to a prism , a glass prism .
And the prism was shaped like a prism , and the light signals would come in , and they ’d be split by the prism .
And one copy of the light signal would go off to where it was supposed to be going in the telecom system , and the other half , this new cloned copy of the cables , would actually go one floor below to NSA ’s secret room .
So you had one copy of everything coming in and going to NSA ’s secret room .
And in the secret room was equipment by a private company called Narus , the very small company hardly anybody has ever heard of that created the hardware and the software to analyze these cables and then pick out the targets NSA is looking for and then forward the targeted communications onto NSA headquarters .
AMY GOODMAN : So you have these companies , AT&T and Verizon , that are secretly working with the NSA and tapping Americans ’ phone lines , and these companies actually outsource the actual tapping to some little - known foreign companies ?
JAMES BAMFORD : Yeah .
There ’s two major — or not major , they ’re small companies , but they service the two major telecom companies .
This company , Narus , which was founded in Israel and has large Israel connections , does the — basically the tapping of the communications on AT&T .
And Verizon chose another company , ironically also founded in Israel and largely controlled by and developed by people in Israel called Verint .
So these two companies specialize in what ’s known as mass surveillance .
Their literature — I read this literature from Verint , for example — is supposed to only go to intelligence agencies and so forth , and it says , “ We specialize in mass surveillance , ” and that ’s what they do .
They put these mass surveillance equipment in these facilities .
So you have AT&T , for example , that , you know , considers it ’s their job to get messages from one person to another , not tapping into messages , and you get the NSA that says , we want , you know , copies of all this .
So that ’s where these companies come in .
These companies act as the intermediary basically between the telecom companies and the NSA .
AMY GOODMAN : Now , Jim Bamford , take this a step further , because you say the founder and former CEO of one of these companies is now a fugitive from the United States somewhere in Africa ?
JAMES BAMFORD : Well , you know , this is a company that the US government is getting all its tapped information from .
It ’s a company that Verizon uses as its tapping company , its eavesdropping company .
And very little is known about these companies .
Congress has never looked into any of this .
I do n’t know — I do n’t think they even know that there is — that these companies exist .
But the company that Verizon uses , Verint , the founder of the company , the former head of the company , is now a fugitive in — hiding out in Africa in the country of Namibia , because he ’s wanted on a number of felony warrants for fraud and other charges .
And then , two other top executives of the company , the general counsel and another top official of the parent company , have also pled guilty to these charges .
So , you know , you ’ve got companies — these companies have foreign connections with potential ties to foreign intelligence agencies , and you have problems of credibility , problems of honesty and all that .
And these companies — through these two companies pass probably 80 percent or more of all US communications at one point or another .
And it ’s even — gets even worse in the fact that these companies also supply their equipment all around the world to other countries , to countries that do n’t have a lot of respect for individual rights — Vietnam , China , Libya , other countries like that .
And so , these countries use this equipment to filter out dissident communications and people trying to protest the government .
It gives them the ability to eavesdrop on communications and monitor dissident email communications .
And as a result of that , people are put in jail , and so forth .
So —
AMY GOODMAN : And despite all of this —
JAMES BAMFORD : — this is a whole area — I ’m sorry ?
AMY GOODMAN : Despite all of this , these telecom companies still have access to the most private communications of people all over America and actually , it ends up , around the world .
And at the beginning of the summer , the Democrats and Republicans joined together in granting retroactive immunity to these companies for spying on American citizens .
JAMES BAMFORD : Yes .
It looked like they were going to have a fight earlier in February , when the temporary law ran out and came time to either pass a new law or keep the old Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act the way it used to be , with all the protections .
And they did resist for a number of months .
They resisted from February until August .
But in August , the Congress , seeing the election is coming , most of them caved in and decided to just join in the administration ’s bill .
And as a result , you have this fairly open - ended bill that came out that gives a lot of permissions to the NSA to do a lot of this eavesdropping without much accountability .
I mean , it basically neutered the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court , took a lot of powers away from them , and put the powers back at NSA .
So the ultimate problem is when you have NSA as both — as judge , jury and executioner on the eavesdropping .
AMY GOODMAN : Jim Bamford , we only have a few minutes , and I want to get to -–
JAMES BAMFORD : Sure .
AMY GOODMAN : — Bridgetown , Missouri , the AT&T hub there .
What is the NSA ’s role in spying there ?
JAMES BAMFORD : Well , Bridgetown , New Jersey — I ’m sorry , Bridgetown , Missouri is one of the centers for AT&T , because it ’s the —it ’s sort of central in the country , and they could control much of the network of AT&T from there .
And it was there that AT&T actually developed a system by which they could get into fiber - optic communications .
And just like they built this secret — the NSA built this secret room in San Francisco , and Mark Klein said that he had heard that they had built these secret rooms in other places around the country , there was also a secret room built in Bridgetown .
And the worrisome part of that is Bridgeton controls the whole network .
So you have the problem of these secret rooms not just being in San Francisco , they ’re throughout the network , and they ’re in other parts of the country .
And the American public really has no idea what ’s going on , in terms of who has access to their communications , what ’s being done with it .
And is there somebody sitting there — as David Murfee Faulk talked about , in the NSA listening post in Georgia , are there people just sitting there listening to people ’s private conversations and laughing about them ?
AMY GOODMAN : And the building in —
JAMES BAMFORD : One final thing —
AMY GOODMAN : Yes , go ahead , Jim .
JAMES BAMFORD : Yeah , I was just going to mention that it is n’t just the picking up of these conversations and listening to them and laughing about them .
These conversations are transcribed .
They ’re — and then they ’re recorded , and they ’re kept forever .
There ’s a big building in Texas that ’s being built in San Antonio that ’s going to be used to house a lot of these conversations .
NSA is running out of space at Fort Meade , their headquarters , so they had to expand , and they ’re building this very big building .
It ’s reportedly going to be about the size of the Alamodome down there , to store all these — this huge amount of data communications .
And when you think how much information two gigabytes could be put on a small thumb drive , you can imagine how much of information could be stored in a data warehouse the size of — almost the size of the Alamodome .
AMY GOODMAN : We only have a minute , less than a minute , but —
JAMES BAMFORD : Oh , I ’m sorry .
Go ahead .
AMY GOODMAN : — the building in Miami where all communications from Latin America are stored and then a single switch for communications , much of Africa ’s communications ?
And finally , where they ca n’t get cooperation of companies , a specially built submarine designed to sit on the bottom of the ocean floor to tap foreign cables ?
JAMES BAMFORD : A lot of communications are consolidated .
A lot of the international communications in South America all pass through one obscure building in Miami .
And according to the landing rights that the company had to sign , which I read , they basically have to turn over everything that they get to the NSA if the NSA asks for it .
So , you have a problem here today .
I mean , the overall big problem is that there is a tremendous amount of eavesdropping going on .
It ’s all being stored , it ’s all being analyzed , either electronically or by a human .
And the public really does n’t have much of — knowledge of all this that ’s going on right now .
AMY GOODMAN : Jim Bamford , I want to thank you very much for being with us , investigative journalist , author of three books , his latest on the National Security Agency out today , The Shadow Factory : The Ultra -Secret NSA from 9/11 to the Eavesdropping on America .
A couple in South Africa who were having sex on a railway track in Mpumalanga Province have been killed by a goods train , police say .
Spokesman Abie Khoabane said it took place on Friday evening and the victims were yet to be identified .
He told local newspapers that the couple ignored the driver 's shouts as he moved the train into the disused station in Kinross town .
" They continued with their business , " he told the Sowetan paper .
According to South Africa 's Beeld newspaper , the area was deserted with no cars or houses nearby .
The man died at the scene and the woman died later at hospital , the Sowetan reports .
The police have appealed for those with missing relatives to come forward to help with their investigation .
GROWING cannabis becomes legal in NSW today - provided you are a licensed farmer who will harvest hemp for industrial use .
After years of debate , the State Government has approved large - scale hemp farming and will consider licence applications under a new scheme .
Hemp needs little water , grows quickly and the fibrous stems can be used in clothing , cosmetics , livestock and animal feeds , and building materials .
The police - approved cannabis varieties all have low levels of tetrahydrocannabinol , the compound people smoke to get high .
" Industrial hemp has the potential to provide farmers with a much - needed additional fast - growing summer crop option that can be used in rotation with winter grain crops , " said the Minister for Primary Industries , Ian Macdonald .
" It 's a potentially lucrative industry due to [ its ] environmentally friendly nature . "
The new licensing system has been developed to prevent industrial hemp being grown to camouflage illegal crops of marijuana , which looks almost identical although it is cultivated to bear more foliage .
Properties growing industrial hemp will be audited and inspected regularly .
Two hundred people have contacted the department to express an interest in hemp growing .
But the peak farming bodies of Australia and NSW said they did not have policies on hemp growing and were unaware of a major interest in it .

A trader reacts to developments at the Frankfurt stock exchange Wednesday .
Markets around the world are feeling the grip of a deepening global financial crisis .
Japan 's Nikkei index has lost a staggering 24 % in the last 2 weeks .
THE WORLD REELS THE WORLD REELS Markets today : Asia stocks in another big nose - dive Britain : Leaders say recession is likely | Views of Gordon Brown shift amid crisis China : Economy rocks factories World of pain : Japan index nosedives 9.4 % ; fear spreads HONG KONG  Japan 's stock market plummeted 9.4 % — its biggest one - day drop in 21 years —
Wednesday as investors rushed for the exits on deepening fears over the global financial crisis .
Panicked investors dumped stocks across Asia again Wednesday , knocking Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei index down 9.4 % to its lowest close in more than five years .
Hong Kong 's Hang Seng index dropped 8.2 % to 15,431.73 .
Shares fell 5.8 % in South Korea , 6 % in Thailand , more than 10 % in Indonesia , 6.6 % in Singapore .
Nothing policymakers have come up with — not even the $ 700 billion U.S. bailout of Wall Street — has been able to calm markets terrified about a financial contagion that began in the U.S. housing market .
" In a moment of panic , investors need to see something powerful and easy to understand , " said Tim Condon , chief Asian economist for ING bank in Singapore .
Condon and other analysts would like to see a coordinated effort by U.S. and European central banks to pump massive amounts of capital into a fragile banking system .
Even frightened investors would " think twice before swimming against a tsunami of central bank liquidity , " Condon said .
So far , said equity strategist Christopher Wood of CLSA Asia -Pacific Markets , government efforts have been " ad hoc . "
In Hong Kong Wednesday , for instance , the Monetary Authority cut its benchmark interest rate by a full percentage point to 2.5 % to thaw out frozen credit markets .
And Britain announced that it would partially nationalize major banks .
Stewart Ferns , equity strategist for Macquarie Securities in Hong Kong , said stocks are being pushed down by investors scrambling to raise cash to repay cheap loans they 'd used to finance risky investments .
Enticed by unusually strong global economic growth the past several years , many investors would engage in " carry trades , " taking out loans in countries with rock - bottom interest rates ( often Japan ) to invest in markets elsewhere that offered higher potential returns , Ferns said .
Now that those riskier investments are going sour , investors hustling raise cash to repay the loans , often denominated in Japanese yen .
The process is driving down stocks and strengthening the yen — so much so that the U.S. dollar temporarily slipped below 100 yen Wednesday .
A stronger yen hammers Japanese exporters such as Toyota , which saw its shares fall 12 % Wednesday , by making their products more expensive and by shrinking their overseas profits when they are brought back to Japan .
Japanese media reported that Toyota would slash its earnings forecasts in the face of weakening worldwide sales .
CLSA 's
Wood expects to see a unified effort in the U.S. and Europe to pump taxpayer money into weak banks the way Britain did Wednesday , giving governments an equity stake .
" I do n't think you 'll get a sustained rally until there 's a coordinated response , " he said .

Gainesville , Fl : The Gators911 Truth action gets edgy on the corner of the University of Florida campus .
Gators911 recriuted 4 more UF students to the group in the past few weeks .
The Obama win for President has significantly nulled accusations that the 9/11 Truth movement is using the issue as a political hammer to bash Bush and the Republicans .
But now , 9/11
Truth must work harder to hold the Obama team accountable to follow through with Bush ’s broken promise to guarantee a criminal investigation of 9/11 .

In this post I demonstrated how to create IronPython objects and call them from strongly typed .NET code .
So suppose we want to do so with Windows Workflow Foundation where could we use this ?
Well the most obvious place would be a runtime service .
The example below uses a very simple message that needs to be displayed but it is easy to see how to same concept could be applied in other places .
But first the basics .
I have created a very simple custom DisplayMessageActivity like this :
public partial class DisplayMessageActivity : System.Workflow.ComponentModel.
Activity { public DisplayMessageActivity ( ) { } public string Message { get ; set ; } protected override ActivityExecutionStatus Execute ( ActivityExecutionContext executionContext ) { IDisplayMessageService service = executionContext.GetService< IDisplayMessageService >( ) ; service .
Display ( Message ) ; return base . Execute ( executionContext ) ; } }
Next I have created a very simple workflow with only the DisplayMessageActivity and set the Message property to : “ This is the message to show . ” .
You might have noticed in the code above that I am looking for a service of type IDisplayMessageService .
This is pretty simple as well and looks like this :
public interface IDisplayMessageService { void Display ( string message ) ; }
In this case I am using an interface but you could just as well use a concrete baseclass with virtual methods .
For the actual implementation I created two classes in IronPython , the first displays the message on the console while the second uses a MessageBox to display the same message .
The IronPython source looks like this :
import clr clr.AddReference (' PythonWorkflowConsoleApplication1 ' ) from PythonWorkflowConsoleApplication1 import IDisplayMessageService clr.AddReference(" System.Windows . Forms " ) from System .
Windows .
Forms import MessageBox # Display all messages in the console window class ConsoleDisplayMessageService ( IDisplayMessageService ) : def Display ( self , message ) : print message # Display all messages using a Windows.Forms.MessageBox class MessageBoxDisplayMessageService( IDisplayMessageService ) : def Display ( self , message ) : MessageBox .
Show ( message , ' IronPython ' )
Like in the previous example I first import the clr so I can set references to additional assemblies .
Next add a reference to the PythonWorkflowConsoleApplication1 assembly .
This is my sample application that contains the runtime service interface definition .
With this reference set I can import the IDisplayMessageService interface so I can derive from it .
I included two implementations , lets first look at the ConsoleDisplayMessageService as this is the simpler of the two .
All this does is use the Python print function to display the message on the console .
The first parameter , self , is the current object , so this in C # or me in VB .
We make sure this class derives from IDisplayMessageService by specifying this after the class name .
BTW the lines starting with # are comments in Python .
The second class is MessageBoxDisplayMessageService and this actually uses a MessageBox to display the message from the workflow .
First we need to add a reference to the System .
Windows .
Forms assembly and once that is done we need to import the MessageBox type .
Once this is done we can use it like this :
MessageBox .
Show ( message , ‘ IronPython ’ )
Simple enough right .
So now for the trick part , adding the IronPython runtime service to the workflow runtime .
The console main function is as follows :
static void Main ( string [ ] args ) { using ( WorkflowRuntime workflowRuntime = new WorkflowRuntime ( ) ) { AddMessageService( workflowRuntime , DisplayMode . Windows ) ; WorkflowInstance instance = workflowRuntime.CreateWorkflow ( typeof ( PythonWorkflowConsoleApplication1. Workflow1 ) ) ; instance .
Start ( ) ; Console .ReadLine ( ) ; } }
With the AddMessageService ( ) doing the actual work .
Note the second parameter specifies which IronPython class to load .
So the AddMessageService looks like this :
static void AddMessageService ( WorkflowRuntime workflowRuntime , DisplayMode mode ) { string className ; if ( mode == DisplayMode . Console ) className = " ConsoleDisplayMessageService " ; else className = " MessageBoxDisplayMessageService " ; ScriptRuntime runtime = PythonEngine .CurrentEngine .
Runtime ; ScriptScope scope = runtime .
ExecuteFile ( " DisplayMessageService.py " ) ; PythonType pythonType = scope .
GetVariable < PythonType >( className ) ; object service = runtime .
Operations.Call( pythonType ) ; workflowRuntime . AddService( service ) ; }
The basics are the same as in my previous IronPython post .
Depending on the display mode I make a choice of class to load and I use the same code as previous time to create the object .
Finally I add it to the WorkflowRuntime as a runtime service .
This last bit is easy as this accepts every object type as a valid service and only when we call the GetService do we check the actual type .
I used IronPython 2.0 Beta 4 for this example .
More info about IronPython can be found here , the download of version 2 here .
Enjoy !

Thank you so much to everyone who has donated to the atheist bus campaign .
As I write this , the total has just broken £ 83,000 ( without Gift Aid ) – a truly amazing amount to raise in just two days ( even the donation website , JustGiving , told us they 've never experienced this much support for a campaign before ! ) .
You 've helped us hit the national news headlines , give atheists more of a voice , and generate debate on TV , radio and newspapers throughout the world .
It could n't have happened without you , and we 're extremely grateful for all your support .
There 's been an exciting level of debate about the campaign .
Lots of you have asked why the word " probably " is included in the ad slogan , and stated that you 'd prefer the wording to read " There 's no God " .
While I fully understand this view , there 's a vital reason for the " probably " 's inclusion : as with the Carlsberg ads , it 's likely to get us around the advertising regulations ( specifically points 3.1 , 3.2 , 5.1 , 8.1 , 9.1 and 11.1 in the general rules of the CAP Code , which regulates non-broadcast adverts in the UK ) .
In my view , neither version of the slogan breaches the code , but CAP has advised that " the inclusion of the word ' probably ' makes it less likely to cause offence , and therefore be in breach of the Advertising Code . "
There 's another reason I 'm keen on the " probably " : it means the slogan is more accurate , as even though there 's no scientific evidence at all for God 's existence , it 's also impossible to prove that God does n't exist ( or that anything does n't ) .
As Richard Dawkins states in The God Delusion , saying " there 's no God " is taking a " faith " position .
He writes : " Atheists do not have faith ; and reason alone could not propel one to total conviction that anything definitely does not exist " .
His choice of words in the book is " almost certainly " ; but while this is closer to what most atheists believe , " probably " is shorter and catchier , which is helpful for advertising .
I also think the word is more lighthearted , and somehow makes the message more positive .
Many people have asked how the extra funds are going to be used .
While everyone on the campaign team is elated at the amount raised , we genuinely never expected the campaign to skyrocket like this , and had only planned to use any extra money to buy small ads inside buses .
We 're hoping to run the campaign throughout the UK , but outside London we may have to think about using billboards and trains instead of buses , since the company Stagecoach runs many regional bus services and may not accept our adverts as its owner , Brian Souter , is an evangelical Christian .
Whatever happens , every penny of the total is going directly towards the atheist adverts .
If you have an innovative idea about how we could advertise more effectively outside London , an atheist advertising slogan you like which we could use in future campaigns , or a thought about where we should take the campaign from here , please let us know – we 'll read every comment .
Lastly , thank you once again to everyone who has given to the campaign , commented in a debate , blogged about it , linked to a site or story about it , joined the Facebook group , forwarded links to friends , or posted a funny , kind or supportive comment on the JustGiving page .
Atheists have truly pulled together to make ourselves heard , and it 's exciting to imagine what we could achieve in the future .
The sky 's the limit , and as one comment on the donation page said : " I hope this is just the beginning . "

In Thoughts on a New Language I said :
This relates to the whole concept of the " dictionary created by executing a block of statements " .
I find this notion of a " block of statements " being a first - class object appealing .
Imagine a function that , instead of having a return value , simply returns its bound local variables .
I guess Python modules are pretty much that .
But I 'm thinking of the notion within a file .
There are actually three places where Python uses a block of statements to populate a namespace :
modules
function bodies
class definitions
But imagine that it was a first class object .
I 'm not really thinking about syntax yet , but one could imagine
{ x = 5 y = x + 2 }
or
block : x = 5 y = x + 2
as possibilities for anonymous blocks .
To bind the block to a particular variable , we could therefore say :
foo = { x = 5 y = x + 2 }
or
block foo : x = 5 y = x + 2
Now , what if following on from the previous post and ideas from prototype - based languages like Self , Javascript and Lua you could specify a parent to be traversed in case the block did n't have the requested value .
Would there be special syntax for specifying the parent or would it just be a value in the block like __parent__ ?
foo = { __parent__ = bar y = x + 2 }
or
block foo ( bar ) : y = x + 2
In either case , would the evaluation of y be lazy or not ?
What about multiple inheritance , which is n't commonly found in prototype - based languages ?
Also , would we want to have the notion of parameterized blocks ?
With the free variable explicit :
foo(x ) = { y = x + 2 }
or implicit :
foo = { y = x + 2 }
?
And would you then want to be able to bind that free variable at a later date :
foo % { x = 5 } assert foo.y == 7
( just to arbitrarily pick % to use as the operator symbol )
Also , taking a cue from an offhand remark in Steve Yegge 's Universal Design Pattern post about this sort of stuff ( HT : Jonathan Hartley ) imagine you have a monster objects like
orc = { hp = 10 } warg = { hp = 5 }
and you wanted to capture the notion that a boss monster has 2 times the hit points of a normal monster of that prototype .
Would you use inheritance without binding the __parent__ yet :
boss = { hp =
2 * __parent__.hp }
and later :
orc_boss = boss % { __parent__ = orc }
?
Could we use boss ( orc ) as equivalent to boss % { __parent__ = orc } ?
Some interesting possibility here , just playing around with the notion of a block as first class object with inheritance and parameterization .
And another crazy though : could this language have something akin to list comprehensions but for these blocks so you could compactly define them programmatically where appropriate ?
This is a contrived example , but Imagine you have a list of strings and you want to create a block that uses those strings as variable names , all set to an initial value of 1 .
That is , you want to get
{ foo = 1 bar = 1 baz = 1 }
from var_list = [ " foo " , " bar " , " baz " ]
The main challenge seems to be just coming up with syntax for turning strings into variable names .
But imagine ( just for the sake of example ) that ~x meant the variable whose name is the value of x .
Then you could ( possibly ) do something like :
{ ~x = 1 for x in var_list }
This is all just thinking aloud :-)
I am so surprised at how many of you have come to my little web page blog .
People did n’t think I was 82 so I thought maybe you could n’t see the pictures but then someone called me old and fat so I guess you can .
If you are looking for my post about Sarah Palin it appears right before this one .
I guess I hit a nerve with my little story about the Governor , but I just got so mad when my friend Margaret told me she was thinking about voting for McCain and thought Sarah was kind of interesting .
Well , we ’ve survived a lot of differences over the years so I guess we can survive this one .
For those of you calling me names .
Shoot .
I ’m 82 and have been called much worse by much better .
Margaret all but called me a communist for posting it in the first place and told me my sailor mouth would get me in trouble !
I do n’t mind .
Besides I started it by calling that fool from Alaska a bitch .
Surely you could not have watched that debate without realizing she has no idea what end is up .
I remember a girl like that in high school .
Her name was Sally and we used to say that she was n’t right in the head .
I saw Gwen Ifill on a TV program this weekend and she said there really was n’t anything she could do once Palin decided to “ blow me off ” .
Well , call me stupid but I thought debates had rules so that both parties could be evaluated equally .
“ Oh Gosh Joe .
There you go again . ”
Yep .
There he did go again – answering the “ gosh darn ” question that was being asked .
I would like to say I am sorry , but I am not .
That woman is an idiot .
Sarah not Gwen .
I like Gwen most of the time .
A lot of you have asked me to keep writing stuff .
Well , I will watch the debates tomorrow night and if I get mad again , I will write it all down for you here .
One more thing .
The only comments that really made me mad were the fools that came here preaching the bible and all that pro-life crap .
Most pro-life nut cases need to actually get a life and stop worrying about what everyone else is doing .
Sarah Palin had the choice to talk to her daughter about sex .
Her daughter had the choice to listen or not listen .
Her daughter had the choice to have sex or not have sex .
And once she was pregnant she had the choice to keep the baby , put it up for adoption or terminate the pregnancy .
And as much as it scares me that the Palin clan is producing a whole new generation of women like my old friend Sally , the fact is they have a choice .
All I ask is that women respect the right of other women to make their own choice because I remember what it was like when we did n’t have a choice .
Thanks for stopping by .
I mean it .
DIGG THIS
This whole campaign has been dreadfully boring , with gaffe - avoidance techniques squelching all spontaneity , and it does n’t help that the ideological parameters of the election have been so narrowly drawn as to make any thinking person want to shut up both the candidates and the media that cover them so lovingly .
Still , one interesting point has emerged : the archetype chosen to represent mainstream America turns out to be a thorough - going outlaw in the best sense of that term .
In this , he is a symbol of the age .
We can look forward to the creation and emergence of ever more people like this in the coming years , as the state tightens its grip over every aspect of American life .
We will all soon be outlaws .
The whole Joe the Plumber saga began when Joe Wurzelbacher from Toledo , Ohio , confronted Barack Obama about the candidate ’s tax plans .
He wanted to know if Obama would raise his taxes .
In particular , he was planning to buy a company with a revenue of $ 250,000 per year .
“ Your new tax plan is going to tax me more , is n’t it ? ”
Of course the Republicans seized on this and exploited it .
McCain keeps bringing him up in speeches .
Republicans like to talk about taxes .
They always seem to corner the budget - balancing , wealth - distributing Democrats with this topic , even though it is largely a distraction in an age of fiat money when the government can print all the revenue it needs .
Still , the GOP likes the symbolism , so Joe had his 15 minutes of fame as a hero of the Right .
But the New York Times did some digging and discovered — horror — that Joe is doing plumbing without a proper business license .
How dare he call himself a plumber !
A license is required by Toledo , not just one license for a partnership but for everyone who is called a plumber .
Joe has not taken the training courses , is not a member of the union , and cannot legally call himself a plumber .
The press reports on this were explosive , with reporters speaking as if they had caught this guy red-handed and completely discredited him .
But what about the complete absurdity of the idea that you have to have a license in order to have the right to fix someone else ’s sink ?
This is Soviet like , but deeply entrenched in American professional life .
The idea of licensing is that it assures quality standards .
But this is just a cover used by guilds since the Middle Ages .
The real goal of licensing is to create a professional cartel .
Fewer providers means higher wages for those with licenses .
It is all about boosting income by restricting competition .
This is of course a violation of human rights because it impinges on the fundamental freedom of association .
In a market setting , there are plenty of quality controls through professional organizations .
Consumers are free to use them or not .
Many private producers attempt to create cartels through this means , but it is rarely successful .
There are always producers who break with the guild in order to charge lower prices for their services .
This is why they often seek state regulations , such as the requirement that all plumbers have a license .
By the way , this is true of all professions , including lawyering and doctoring .
There was a time when entry into these fields was governed by the free market , and the system worked fine ( contrary to legend ) .
But the big players in these industries sought and obtained state privileges to officially license service providers .
It was an income - boosting tactic and it worked .
By practicing plumbing without a license , Joe is bucking the system in a truly heroic way .
He should n’t be condemned for this .
He should be celebrated as a freedom fighter .
He has a lot more to complain about than just taxes .
It is the state itself in all its incarnations that is his true enemy .
He ought to be demanding answers from the politicians about their regulatory schemes to further restrict competition in a wide range of areas ( banking for example ! ) .
Most ridiculous is the idea that he should n’t be called a plumber because he does n’t have a license .
Here we see how licensing attacks even the use of our language .
If he is doing plumbing , he is a plumber .
Period .
And yet taxes are also close to Joe ’s heart because it also turns out that he is delinquent on his property taxes , which are similarly too high and similarly unjust .
The Ohio Department of Taxation placed a lien against him because $ 1,183 in personal property taxes had not been paid .
In what sense can you say that you really own your home if the state can take it away if you do n’t pay what the state says you ought to be paying ?
This is an attack on private property in the most fundamental sense .
So it turns out that we truly do have an American archetype in Joe Wurzelbacher .
He is an outlaw in the same sense that our founders were outlaws .
He lives outside the regulations of the state because these regulations attack his freedom and property .
It was to end systems such as this that the American revolution came to be .
And yet we find ourselves back in exactly the same system , and one incredibly worse in every way .
It is going to take something different from the election of the Republican to beat back the oppressions that vex his life .
It is not complicated .
It is a right belonging to all people that they can do what they want and keep what they own provided they do not impinge on anyone else ’s right to do the same .
The state is nothing but an organized attempt to deny this right .
Joe has an enemy , but it goes way beyond Obama .

When The Cosby Show premiered in 1984 , many media critics tripped over themselves trying to point out that no " real " 
African - American family lived like the Huxtables .
Cultural relevance and political correctness aside , syndicated reruns have taught us that The Cosby Show endures because it delivered laughs along with warm fuzzies .
The Huxtables provided a loving family atmosphere ( along with an impressively appointed house ) where audiences could escape for 30 minutes each week .
1 . Why Rudy was a girl
The original concept for The Cosby Show called for four Huxtable children — two girls and two boys .
The youngest child , Rudy , was supposed to be a son .
But despite auditioning hundreds of young male actors , the producers still felt that they had n't found " the one . " 
When they opened up the auditions to females , Keshia Knight Pulliam immediately won them over .
The littlest Huxtable child thus became a girl , and Keshia subsequently became the youngest actress ever to be nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Emmy , at the tender age of six .
2 . How the Huxtable family suddenly grew
During the pilot episode , Clair asked Cliff , " Why did we have four children ? " 
And he responded , " Because we did n't want five . " 
Originally , Denise was the oldest , followed by Theo , Vanessa , and Rudy .
But once the series was poised to become a hit , Bill Cosby decided to add an additional older child — one who was away at college and was thus a result of successful parenting .
Enter Princeton student Sondra , the eldest Huxtable child .
Sabrina LeBeauf won the role despite stiff competition from Whitney Houston and future Miss America Suzette Charles .
By the way , Sabrina LeBeauf was only 10 years younger than her TV mom , Phylicia Rashad .
3 . The mystery of the disappearing characters
During the 1986 -1987 season of The Cosby Show , Theo 's close friend and co-conspirator was Walter " Cockroach " 
Bradley .
Carl Anthony
Payne played the role in 12 episodes of the series , and might have featured in more had he not had a falling - out with Bill Cosby .
Payne had decided to grow his hair out , despite Dr. Cosby 's preference for a clean - cut style among the male actors on his show .
When Payne failed to comply , the Cockroach character was summarily squashed .
As for Rudy 's silent chubby friend Peter , who always responded to trouble by running away , his only crime was Time .
He was growing up , and while the writers could come up with story lines to accommodate Keshia Knight Pulliam 's maturation , it was easier to simply eliminate a one - note character like Peter once he outgrew his part .
4 . How the Cos handled his Wild Child
With her typical teenage carefree attitude and her cutting - edge fashion sense , Denise Huxtable became an audience favorite early in the series .
Lisa Bonet , who portrayed the character , received the most fan mail and was the media darling during the first season of the show , particularly amongst male teenagers .
Bonet exhibited unprofessional behavior on the set ( arriving late every day , being argumentative , etc. ) , so Cosby chose to pass the buck by " spinning off "  her character into her own series , A Different World .
Always a cheerleader when it came to touting higher education , Cosby was eager to spotlight the daily lives of students at a predominantly black university .
Bonet thumbed her nose at this opportunity , however , and disrupted things further by announcing her pregnancy and engagement to musician Lenny Kravitz .
Ever - tolerant Cosby temporarily brought Denise back to the Huxtable fold ( until oversized shirts failed to conceal her impending motherhood ) and then sent her character off to Africa to work as a photographer 's assistant .
5. How Bill Cosby 's life subtly intertwined with Cliff Huxtable's
Clair Huxtable 's maiden name was Hanks , which is also the maiden name of Cosby 's real - life wife Camille .
On The Cosby Show , Cliff 's mother 's name is Anna , just like Bill 's real mom .
His TV dad was called Russell in honor of Cosby 's younger brother " “ you may remember him using the name on his comedy albums ( To My Brother Russell , Whom I Slept With ) and also in the animated Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids .
And Cosby 's TV son Theo Huxtable was eventually diagnosed with dyslexia , as was Bill 's late son , Ennis Cosby , who was murdered in 1997 .

UPDATE : Lieberman keeps chairmanship Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday November 18 , 2008
Print This Email This Democrats voted to let Joe Lieberman keep his plum committee post , despite the Connecticut senator 's divisive campaigning on behalf of Republican John McCain 's presidential bid .
" It 's very clear that the vast majority of the Democratic caucus wants to keep Sen. Lieberman as the chairman of his committee , a member of the Armed Services Committee , and that was done , it 's all over with , " Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid told reporters after a Democratic caucus meeting Tuesday .
" Joe Lieberman is a Democrat , he 's a part of this caucus . "
Lieberman maintained his spot as chairman on the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee , despite calls for him to lose that post because of his campaigning for McCain .
Reid , addressing reporters in the US Capitol Tuesday morning , said the caucus was not interested in retribution and wanted to move beyond the campaign .
On a 42 - to - 13 vote , the Democratic caucus approved a resolution that allowed Lieberman to keep his Chairmanship of the Homeland Security Committee and of an Armed Services subcommittee , but removed him as a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee .
The resolution also expressed disapproval of his activities on behalf of McCain .
Speaking to reporters after Reid , Lieberman said he appreciated the Democrats ' " respect for my independence of mind , " although he did express qualified regret for some of the attacks he unleashed on Obama .
" The resolution expresses strong disapproval and rejection of statements I made about Sen. Obama during the campaign , " Lieberman said .
" And in that regard , I said very clearly , some of the statements , some of the things people have said I said about Sen.
Obama are simply not true .
There are other statements that I made that I wish I had made more clearly , and there were some ... that I wish I had not made at all .
And obviously in the heat of campaigns , that happens to all of us .
But I regret that , and now it 's time to move on . "
Before Tuesday 's vote , observers expected that the Independent Connecticut senator would receive little more than a slap on the wrist for the myriad scurrilous attacks he unleashed on President - elect Barack Obama during the campaign .
Lieberman hardly seemed chastised after the Democratic caucus voted to keep him .
He said he agreed to leave the Environment and Public Works Committee to make room for freshmen senators who wanted to serve there .
" In the spirit of cooperation , I said I would do that , " he said .
Lieberman promised that as soon as the 111th Congress convenes he would co-sponsor a bill with McCain to address climate change .
Politico reported that Lieberman 's strong chances to keep his chairmanship earlier in the day .
 My sense is that he will remain in the caucus , and probably 
Im guessing  remain chairman of the Homeland Security committee ,  said Sen. Mark Pryor ( D - AR ) , a junior member close to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - NV ) told Politico .
 Our caucus is not a lockstep caucus .
He obviously supported McCain every way he could , and he is out of sync with the Democrats on Iraq , but if you look at pretty much every other issue , hes a Democrat . 
Lieberman has been a strong supporter of President Bush on issues that go beyond simply keeping troops in Iraq .
He 's supported waterboarding , warrantless wiretapping , and has said it's " crazy " for Guantanamo Bay detainees to have their day in court .
Markos Moulitsas , who has been among the most vocal progressive bloggers seeking Lieberman 's dismissal , called the compromise unacceptable .
Um , what idiot would think that taking away a subcommittee from Lieberman would be seen as a " stinging rebuke " ?
In whose DC - Beltway - addled mind is that even remotely punishment ?
Let Lieberman keep that subcommittee .
No one gives a shit about it .
The only thing that matters , the only thing that Lieberman wants , and the only thing we do n't want him to have -- is the chairmanship of the Homeland Security Committee .
If this is the " starting point " , and given the Senate Democrats ' history of capitulations , expect Lieberman to come out of that meeting as majority leader .
Lieberman detractors also are easing their pending grief with laughter .
A new site launched this week , LaughAtLieberman.com , encourages users to record themselves calling Lieberman 's Senate office an laughing , posting the results to YouTube .
Always one of the most conservative members of the Democratic caucus , Lieberman has been drifting further from the party 's base in recent years .
Despite losing a Democratic primary in 2006 , the senator held onto his seat by running as an independent .
However , he continued to caucus with the party , ensuring that Democrats would control the Senate that year .
Now that Democrats have picked up at least six additional Senate seats , many are clamoring to boot Lieberman from the caucus .
During the presidential campaign he was an early and enthusiastic supporter of McCain , and Lieberman accused Obama of being unprincipled , attacked him over Rev. Wright and questioned his patriotism .
Soon after the election , Lieberman indicated that it would be " unacceptable " to be stripped of his Homeland Security chairmanship , and Democrats apparently would rather let him keep the powerful post than see him flee to the Republican caucus .

Thousands of people rioted on Sunday in Paragominas , Brazil , protesting the government ’s crackdown on illegal logging in the Amazon rainforest .
The protesters burned vehicles , set the offices of the environmental agency Ibama on fire , and stole 14 trucks carrying 400 cubic meters of logs seized from illegal logging activities in the Amazon .
The rioters chased government officials into a hotel and attempted to smash their way in with a tractor , but were forced back by the use of tear gas .
Nobody was injured in the attack .
Brazil ’s Environment Minister , Carlos Minc , has asked for troops from Brazil ’s National Security Force to secure the area and quell the rioting .
He said the government would not back down from their efforts to enforce rules directed towards preventing the illegal logging destroying substantial portions of the world ’s largest rain forest .
“ We will intensify our actions and punish those responsible .
We wo n’t be intimidated ” – Carlos Minc
The Brazilian government launched a deforestation program earlier this year , named the “ Arc of Fire ” , in an attempt to reverse the severe rate of deforestation caused by illegal logging in recent years , and the backlash has been intense .
Riots broke out in February near the city of Tailandia over illegal timber seized from other protected areas , causing the environmental officers to flee the area .
Logging is the main source of income for the residents of these areas , and Ibama official Marco Antonio Vidal said that some of the protesters were logging truck drivers and owners of wood companies .
Many sawmills have been closed , and residents are angry at the loss of income due to the deforestation initiative .
In an interview with the Guardian earlier this year , Roberto Mangabeira Unger , Brazil ’s minister for strategic affairs , said that Brazil needed “ a form of environmental protection which is less and less the result of a police operation and more and more the consequence of a working model of economic and social organisation .
What has happened in some parts of the rich world is that concern about the tropical rainforest has become … a form of escapism . ”

Lincoln and Kennedy
Here 's a little part of US history which makes you go h-m - m-m :
Have a history teacher explain this if they can ?
Abraham Lincoln was elected to Congress in 1846 .
John F. Kennedy was elected to Congress in 1946 .
Abraham Lincoln was elected President in 1860 .
John F. Kennedy was elected President in 1960 .
The names Lincoln and Kennedy each contain seven letters .
Both were particularly concerned with civil rights .
Both wives lost their children while living in the White House .
Both Presidents were shot on a Friday .
Both Presidents were shot in the head .
Lincoln 's secretary was named Kennedy .
Kennedy 's secretary was named Lincoln .
Both were assassinated by Southerners .
Both were succeeded by Southerners .
Both successors were named Johnson .
Andrew Johnson , who succeeded Lincoln , was born in 1808 .
Lyndon Johnson , who succeeded Kennedy , was born in 1908 .
John Wilkes Booth , who assassinated Lincoln , was born ! in 1839 .
I was corrected on this and he was born on 183 8
Lee Harvey Oswald , who assassinated Kennedy , was born in 1939 .
Both assassins were known by their three names .
Both names are composed of fifteen letters .
Lincoln was shot at the theater named ' Kennedy . '
I was corrected on this and the theater was named Ford at the time of the assassination .
Thanks H.!
Kennedy was shot in a car called ' Lincoln . '
Booth ran from the theater and was caught in a warehouse .
Oswald ran from a warehouse and was caught in a theater .
Booth and Oswald were assassinated before their trials .
And here 's the kicker ...
A week before Lincoln was shot , he was in Monroe , Maryland .
A week before Kennedy was shot , he was with Marilyn Monroe .
Interesting Fact about the Pope John Paul II death Pope was living 85 years - sum of those numbers = 13 Pope died on 2.04.2005 - sum of those numbers = 13 Pope died at 21.37 - again - sum is equal .... 13 13 ... that 's Maria 's number - only that time Holy Mother was showing herself to 3 children in Fatima on 13th May 1981 - Pope was wounded and that time was saved by Holy Mother on 13th Pope went to the hospital for the first time on 13th died the last child of three from Fatima to whom Holy Mother showed up Pope died on 02.04.2005 at 21.37 .. add all those numbers ....
2+4+2+5 = 13 2+1+3+7 = 13 13+13=26 26 years of pontificate ...... Coincidence ?
or it had to be like this ?
in the end ...... he died in 13th week of the year ... and when you multiply the time of his death 21 x 37 ... you will have 777 Pope was living exactly 31 thousands days ... if you reverse figures ... you will get again 13 !!!
World Cup Brazil last won the world cup in 1994 .
Before that they won it in 1970 .
Add 1970 and 1994 , it equals 3964 .
Germany last won in 1990 .
Before that they won in 1974 .
Add 1990 and 1974 , it equals 3964 .
Argentina last won the world cup in 1986 .
Before that they won it in 1978 .
Add 1978 and 1986 , it equals 3964 .
So going by this logic ,
The winner of the 2002 world cup is the same as the 3964 - 2002 = 1962 world cup .
The 1962 world cup was won by Brazil .
It was really Brazil who won !!!

A small asteroid exploded over Africa this week following what astronomers said was the first firm prediction of an incoming space rock .
It did not strike Earth .
The asteroid was about the size of kitchen table , astronomers estimated , and they think the explosion ( caused by the pressures of slamming into the atmosphere ) left nothing but perhaps a few small bits to fall to the surface .
No photographs of the explosion have been reported , owing to the remote location of the object 's path over Sudan .
But the explosion was recorded by an infrasound array in Kenya .
Peter Brown at the University of Western Ontario estimated , based on the infrasound data , that the asteroid exploded at 0243 UT with an energy of somewhere between 1.1 and 2.1 kilotons of TNT .
On Monday , NASA researchers and other scientists announced that the space rock , named 8TA9D69 , would enter the air at 10:46 p.m. ET ( 0246 UT ) on Oct. 7 over northern Sudan .
Such events occur a few times every year , but never before had one been predicted .
The object was expected to create a very bright fireball that , for anyone who might have seen it , would have been far more dramatic than the typical shooting star resulting when small debris streaks through Earth 's atmosphere .
" A typical meteor comes from an object the size of a grain of sand , " Gareth Williams of the Minor Planet Center explained just before the highly anticipated event .
" This meteor will be a real humdinger in comparison ! "
There has been one visual confirmation of the exploding fireball , according to Spaceweather.com .
Jacob Kuiper , a general aviation meteorologist at the National Weather Service in The Netherlands , told pilots to keep an eye out .
" I have received confirmation that a KLM airliner , roughly 750 nautical miles southwest of the predicted atmospheric impact position , has observed a short flash just before the expected impact time 0246 UTC , " Kuiper said .
" Because of the distance it was not a very large phenomenon , but still a confirmation that some bright meteor has been seen in the predicted direction . "
The rock was discovered by an ongoing survey at Mt. Lemmon run by the University of Arizona as part of the NASA - funded Catalina Sky Survey for near - Earth objects .
Interaction with other people is vital to human development .
Social relationships and networks can act as protective factors against the onset or recurrence of mental illness and enhance recovery from mental disorders ( WHO , 2005 ) .
Tables 6 and 7 provide information on the social networks that people have access to and the frequency of contact with their family and friends .
The prevalence of 12 - month mental disorders was very similar for people who did and did not have contact with their family .
Of the 15.9 million people who had contact with their family , one in five ( 20 % ) had a 12 - month mental disorder .
Of the 121,800 people who had no contact with their family or no family , just under a quarter ( 23 % ) had a 12 - month mental disorder .
However , the prevalence of 12 - month mental disorders for people who did and did not have contact with their friends was quite different .
Of the 15.7 million people who had contact with their friends , one in five ( 20 % ) had a 12 - month mental disorder , but for the 352,500 who had no contact with friends or no friends , 38 % had a 12 - month mental disorder .
Of the people who had contact with their family , those who had family members to rely on or family members to confide in were less likely to have a 12 - month mental disorder .
One in three people with no family members to rely on ( 33 % ) or confide in ( 33 % ) had a 12 - month mental disorder , compared with around one in six people with three or more family members to rely on ( 17 % ) or confide in ( 15 % ) .
Of the people who had contact with their friends , those who had friends to rely on or friends to confide in were also less likely to have a 12 - month mental disorder .
Around a quarter ( 25 % and 22 % respectively ) of the people with no friends to rely on or confide in had a 12 - month mental disorder , compared with 18 % each for the people with three or more friends to rely on or confide in .
There are lots of things I think a good programmer should understand , and understand well .
One , of course , is that OOP amounts to BSE for programmers .
Another , and the topic of today , is that good programmers should know how to manipulate bits in their sleep .
( No , not those bits ! )
It goes without saying that in order even to be called a programmer one must know the truth tables of the basic operations of Boolean algebra ( and , or , xor , and negation in particular ) backwards and forwards .
What I ’m thinking of here though is that programmers should be able to do bitwise arithmetic on two ’s complement numbers as if their lives depended on it .
( Which it does , for e.g. graphics programmers , as low - level twiddling and other clever optimization is their livelihood . )
Basic bit manipulations
Before moving on to some more advanced stuff , let ’s start out with the very basics of bit manipulation .
Given a binary 2 ’s - complement number x , we have the following useful identities :
Identity Example Identity and explanation x 00101100 x , the original value ~x 11010011 ~x , complement of x -x 11010100 -x = ~x+1 , negation of x ( this you MUST know about 2 ’s - complement arithmetic ! ) x & -x 00000100 x & - x , extract lowest bit set x | -x 11111100 x | -x , mask for bits above ( AND including ) lowest bit set x ^ -x 11111000 x ^ - x , mask for bits above ( NOT including ) lowest bit set x & ( x – 1 ) 00101000 x & ( x – 1 ) , strip off lowest bit set x | ( x – 1 ) 00101111 x | ( x – 1 ) , fill in all bits below lowest bit set x ^ ( x – 1 ) 00000111 x ^ ( x – 1 ) = ~x ^ -x , mask for bits below ( AND including ) lowest bit set ~x & ( x – 1 ) 00000011 ~x & ( x – 1 ) = ~ ( x | - x ) = ( x & - x ) – 1 , mask for bits below ( NOT including ) lowest bit set x | ( x + 1 ) 00101101 x | ( x + 1 ) , fills in lowest zero bit x / ( x & - x ) 00001011 x / ( x & - x ) , shift number right so lowest bit set ends up at bit 0
If you ’re not used to twiddling bits these identities may not seem immediately obvious , but a few minutes with pen and paper and you should be able to see how any one of them works .
Several of these should be committed to memory , including , at the very least , how to extract or strip off the lowest bit set .
From the above identities we can derive some truly fabulous expressions , like e.g. - ~x for x + 1 , and ~-x for x – 1 !
( These are cool in a geeky way , but please do n’t use these expressions in your code , unless you ’re writing an entry for IOCCC . )
In addition to geeking out , we can also do some really useful stuff with these identities , as I will show next .
A problem requiring advanced bit -fu
Once you know a large number of the identities above ( and you should ) , you are equipped to solve problems that would otherwise be nontrivial .
Let us consider the interesting problem of creating a function uint NextKBitNumber ( uint ) which given an unsigned integer with K bits set , returns the immediately larger unsigned integer also with K bits set .
“ Huh , ” you say ?
Well , as always , the first thing to do is to understand the problem , so let ’s study some data .
Let ’s start with a 5 - bit number , with 2 bits set .
From combinatorics we know there should be ( 5 choose 2 ) = 10 alternatives .
We can easily list them by hand :
0 0 0 1|1
0 0 1|0 1
0 0 1|1 0
0 1|0 0 1
0 1|0 1 0
0 1|1 0 0
1|0 0 0 1
1|0 0 1 0
1|0 1 0 0
1|1 0 0 0
As you can see , I inserted a vertical bar on each line to highlight an obvious recurring pattern : the lower bit travels from right to left until it becomes adjacent with the upper bit .
At that point we bump the upper bit one position to the left , and reset the lower bit back to the rightmost position .
Let ’s verify this pattern for three bits set .
Here we have 7 - bit numbers , with 3 bits set :
0 0 0 0 1|1|1
0 0 0 1|0 1|1
0 0 0 1|1|0 1
0 0 0 1|1|1 0
0 0 1|0 0 1|1
0 0 1|0 1|0 1
0 0 1|0 1|1 0
0 0 1|1|0 0 1
0 0 1|1|0 1 0
0 0 1|1|1 0 0
0 1|0 0 0 1|1
0 1|0 0 1|0 1
0 1|0 0 1|1 0
0 1|0 1|0 0 1
0 1|0 1|0 1 0
0 1|0 1|1 0 0
0 1|1|0 0 0 1
0 1|1|0 0 1 0
0 1|1|0 1 0 0
0 1|1|1 0 0 0
1|0 0 0 0 1|1
1|0 0 0 1|0 1
1|0 0 0 1|1 0
1|0 0 1|0 0 1
1|0 0 1|0 1 0
1|0 0 1|1 0 0
1|0 1|0 0 0 1
1|0 1|0 0 1 0
1|0 1|0 1 0 0
1|0 1|1 0 0 0
1|1|0 0 0 0 1
1|1|0 0 0 1 0
1|1|0 0 1 0 0
1|1|0 1 0 0 0
1|1|1 0 0 0 0
OK , so the low bit still travels from right to left and gets bumped back to bit 0 after it becomes adjacent with another bit , but there ’s clearly more going on here : sometimes we have two bits bumped back .
Studying the bit patterns for a while should make it apparent that what happens ( conceptually ) is that once the lowest bit has become adjacent with a sequence of one or more bits it “ jumps ” those bits to the next higher zero bit and all the bits that were jumped are bumped back to bit 0 .
Followed that ?
Good !
Let ’s see how we can implement this logic using the bit manipulations from above .
First attempt
We can accomplish the left - shifting of the lowest bit by extracting the lowest bit set ( using b = x & - x ) and adding this onto the original number ( t = x + b ) .
This also takes care of the “ jumping over ” part , but in doing so it clears out all the bits we jumped past so we need to add those back in .
We can create those bits by taking the lowest bit in t ( using c = t & - t ) , dividing it by b to shift it down , and then creating the appropriate mask m = ( c / b >>
1 ) – 1 by shifting by two ( as we counted one bit too many ) and subtracting one ( to form the mask ) .
The final result is then r = t | m .
That was a mouthful , so let ’s look at an example :
Operation Example Operation and explanation x 01011100 x , the original value b = x & -x 00000100 b = x & - x , extract lowest set bit b in x t = x + b 01100000 t = x + b , shift lowest set bit to the left , here causing “ jump ” past two adjacent one bits c = t & -t 00100000 c = t & -t , extract lowest set bit c in t c / b 00001000 c / b , shifts c down by factor of b m = ( c / b >>
1 ) – 1 00000011 m = ( c / b >>
1 ) – 1 , form bitmask for the ( two ) bits we jumped past r = t | m 01100011 r = t | m , form final result
That took 9 operations .
Now that we know how to do it , can we do better ?
Let ’s see .
Second attempt
It should be clear that we have to perform the division to shift c down to form the mask for the bits we jumped past , but can we perhaps somehow avoid the shift and subtract part in forming the mask ?
Let ’s look at a different way of computing c and m .
Going back to the table at the top of the article , we see that we can try c = t ^ ( t – 1 ) instead .
That forms all bits below the lowest bit set in t so after dividing and shifting , we no longer need to subtract one in forming m.
( But we do have to shift by two instead of by one after making this change . )
Here ’s the updated table of operations :
Operation Example Operation and explanation x 01011100 x , the original value b = x & -x 00000100 b = x & - x , extract lowest set bit b in x t = x + b 01100000 t = x + b , shift lowest set bit to the left , here causing “ jump ” past two adjacent one bits c = t ^ ( t – 1 ) 00111111 c = t ^ ( t – 1 ) , mask for bits below ( AND including ) lowest bit set in t m = ( c >>
2 ) / b 00000011 m = ( c >>
2 ) / b , form bitmask for the ( two ) bits we jumped past r = t | m 01100011 r = t | m , form final result
Now we ’re down to 8 operations , can we do better ?
Third and final attempt
Turns out we can do better !
We do n’t really need to create one bits all the way down to bit 0 as we did with c = t ^ ( t – 1 ) in the previous attempt .
We only need to create enough one bits so that after we shift them down to reside at bit position 0 , we have the same number of bits as we jumped past .
This realization allows us to use c = x ^ t instead , which shaves off yet another operation , resulting in the final code :
Operation Example Operation and explanation x 01011100 x , the original value b = x & -x 00000100 b = x & - x , extract lowest set bit b in x t = x + b 01100000 t = x + b , shift lowest set bit to the left , here causing “ jump ” past two adjacent one bits c = x ^ t 00111100 c = x ^ t , form “ sufficiently long ” sequence of one bits , for shifting down m = ( c >>
2 ) / b 00000011 m = ( c >>
2 ) / b , form bitmask for the ( two ) bits we jumped past r = t | m 01100011 r = t | m , form final result
That ’s 7 operations .
Can we do better ?
I do n’t think so , but feel free , go ahead , prove me wrong !
Improving your bit-fu
The above problem was just a brief taste of the nifty stuff you can do once you ’ve truly grokked bit manipulation .
And if you think “ bit tricks ” are just esoterica , think again .
For example , the vector units on the PlayStation 2 do not have an xor instruction .
In the traditional discrete math , logic , or abstract algebra class you probably learned that ( A xor B ) = ( ( not ( A ) and B ) or ( A and not ( B ) ) so you could synthesize xor in 5 instructions .
Ah , but no !
The experienced bit manipulator knows that you can do it in 3 instructions as ( A xor B ) = ( ( A or B ) − ( A and B ) ) .
( That ’s the kind of stuff you pull to get PS2 VU code fast enough to do games like God of War and God of War 2 . )
You can also find lots of applications of these sort of “ tricks ” in my book , used to optimize e.g. spatial partitioning methods to make them industrial strength ( for collision detection , visibility determination , and other applications ) .
If you want to become one with the bit , other than lots of practical workouts in the bit-gym , the best printed resource is unarguably Henry Warren Jr’s Hacker ’s Delight which I highly recommend ( also listed on my recommended list ) .
BTW , the above problem is discussed on page 14 of Hacker ’s Delight ( though not quite in this much detail . )
Agenda
Science , Technology and Innovation for a New Generation
“ Let us be the generation that reshapes our economy to compete in the digital age .
Let 's set high standards for our schools and give them the resources they need to succeed .
Let 's recruit a new army of teachers , and give them better pay and more support in exchange for more accountability .
Let 's make college more affordable , and let 's invest in scientific research , and let 's lay down broadband lines through the heart of inner cities and rural towns all across America . ” — Barack Obama Presidential Announcement Speech in Springfield , IL 02/10/07
The Problem
We need to connect citizens with each other to engage them more fully and directly in solving the problems that face us .
We must use all available technologies and methods to open up the federal government , creating a new level of transparency to change the way business is conducted in Washington and giving Americans the chance to participate in government deliberations and decision - making in ways that were not possible only a few years ago .
America risks being left behind in the global economy : Revolutionary advances in information technology , biotechnology , nanotechnology and other fields are reshaping the global economy .
Without renewed efforts , the United States risks losing leadership in science , technology and innovation .
As a share of the Gross Domestic Product , American federal investment in the physical sciences and engineering research has dropped by half since 1970 .
Too many Americans are not prepared to participate in a 21st century economy : A recent international study found that U.S. students perform lower on scientific assessments than students in 16 other economically developed nations , and lower than 20 economically developed nations in math performance .
Only one - third of middle class physical science teachers are qualified to teach in that subject , and only one - half of middle school math sciences have educational background in that subject area .

Restore Scientific Integrity to the White House : Good policy in Washington depends on sound advice from the nation 's scientists and engineers and decision - making based on the needs of all Americans .
Obama and Biden will restore the basic principle that government decisions should be based on the best - available , scientifically - valid evidence and not on the ideological predispositions of agency officials or political appointees .
Prepare All our Children for the 21st century economy
Make Math and Science Education a National Priority : Obama and Biden will recruit math and science degree graduates to the teaching profession and will support efforts to help these teachers learn from professionals in the field .
They will also work to ensure that all children have access to a strong science curriculum at all grade levels .

Improve and Prioritize Science Assessments : Science assessments need to do more than test facts .
They need to measure a student 's higher order thinking skills including inference , logic , data analysis , interpretation , forming questions and communication .
Barack Obama and Joe Biden will work with governors and educators to ensure that state assessments measure these skills .

Pinpoint College Aid for Math and Science Students :
In 2007 , Barack Obama introduced the National STEM Scholarship Database Act , which would launch an innovative online database to coordinate information on financial aid opportunities available in science and technology fields through the federal government and public or private resources .
Access to this information is especially crucial for first generation college students who might otherwise receive limited guidance in how to successfully pursue , and finance , a degree in science or technology .

Increase Science and Math Graduates : Obama and Biden will improve science and math education in K through 12 , to prepare more students for these studies in college .
They will work to increase our number of science and engineering graduates and encourage undergraduates studying math and science to pursue graduate studies .
They will also work to increase the representation of minorities and women in the science and technology pipeline , tapping the diversity of America to meet the increasing demand for a skilled workforce .
The challenges of the 21st century can only be met by combining many skills from people with many backgrounds .
America 's diversity is a clear competitive advantage if we use it .
Prepare Adults for a Changing Economy
Lifelong Retraining : Obama and Biden will reauthorize the Workforce Investment Act , and increase resources for community colleges and lifelong learning initiatives to ensure our citizens can continue to gain new skills throughout their lifetimes .
Obama and Biden will also modernize and expand the existing system of trade adjustment assistance to include workers hurt by changing trade patterns .
They will also create flexible education accounts that workers can use to retrain .
And they will expand and fully fund apprenticeship programs to help workers get credentials and skills in crafts that reward that investment with a middle class income and benefits .

Employ Science , Technology and Innovation to Solve Our Nation ’s Most Pressing Problems
The 21st century tools of technology and telecommunications have unleashed the forces of globalization on a previously unimagined scale .
They have “ flattened ” communications and labor markets and have contributed to a period of unprecedented innovation , making us more productive , connected global citizens .
By maximizing the power of technology , we can strengthen the quality and affordability of our health care , advance climate - friendly energy development and deployment , improve education throughout the country , and ensure that America remains the world ’s leader in technology .

When most people go to a landmark or tourist attraction , they take home a little kitsch to remind them of their trip .
Michael Hughes prefers to re-do the attraction – inverting it in his own unique way and reversing the roll of the reminder and that which one is normally reminded of .
Born in Britain and now living in Germany , Michael Hughes is a freelance photographer who has gained international attention lately with his quirky photographs of tacky souvenirs perfectly lined up with monuments and landmarks .
The attention has been so great , in fact , that the photographer was offered a book deal .
He is n’t just about the souvenirs , though – visit his site to see some of his other fascinating projects and click below to learn more about this hilarious project .
Severe disruptions to Air France flights are expected after pilots begin a four - day strike against legal changes to the retirement age .
Two - fifths of the airline 's long haul flights and half of all other services were cancelled as a result .
Disruption to flights operated by partner airlines , including Brit Air and CityJet , will not be as great though the strike is thought will cost the airline 100 m euros ( $ 127 m ; £ 86.1 m ) .
In an open letter to the carrier 's pilots , chairman Jean - Cyril Spinetta called the strike " dangerous " , given the financial and economic crisis that has severely affected the airline industry .
With the cost of the strike equal to one of the carrier 's 777,300 fleet , he threatened that the strike could have a detrimental impact on careers .
Further havoc for passengers was caused by a fifth day of wildcat strikes by air crew employed at loss - making Italian airline Alitalia in protest against its proposed sale to the Cai investor group , which would lead to job losses .

Bench Press 2008 At - Risk Survivor
Confirmed True by Darwin
That was how 41 - year - old Xian found himself face down on a bench , and calling for help in the middle of the night .
The lonely man had noticed that the steel sit - up benches in LanTian Park had numerous ventilation holes , and thought it might be possible to use them for sexual gratification .
Enticing orifices .
Once Xian became aroused , he found he was stuck and could not remove himself from the hole in the bench .
Quite understandably , he panicked .
Police received a call from a disturbed man , and arrived to find poor Xian trapped face - down on the bench .
Doctors were summoned to the scene .
They tried , but emergency workers had to cut the entire bench free and take him to the hospital .
Four painful hours later , doctors finally separated Xian from his bench .
It is certainly possible that the lack of blood flow easily could have caused sufficient damage that doctors would have been forced to remove his penis .
This is a bad date that Xian will never forget .

Could memories be stored by making modifications to your DNA ?

REMEMBER your first kiss ?
Experiments in mice suggest that patterns of chemical “ caps ” on our DNA may be responsible for preserving such memories .
To remember a particular event , a specific sequence of neurons must fire at just the right time .
For this to happen , neurons must be connected in a certain way by chemical junctions called synapses .
But how they last over decades , given that proteins in the brain , including those that form synapses , are destroyed and replaced constantly , is a mystery .
Now Courtney Miller and …
The sun is setting and its dying rays cast triangles of light on to the bodies of the Indian workers .
Two are washing themselves , scooping water from tubs in a small yard next to the labour camp 's toilets .
Others queue for their turn .
One man stands stamping his feet in a bucket , turned into a human washing machine .
The heat is suffocating and the sandy wind whips our faces .
The sprinkles of water from men drying their clothes fall like welcome summer rain .
All around , a city of labour camps stretches out in the middle of the Arabian desert , a jumble of low , concrete barracks , corrugated iron , chicken - mesh walls , barbed wire , scrap metal , empty paint cans , rusted machinery and thousands of men with tired and gloomy faces .
I have left Dubai 's spiralling towers , man-made islands and mega-malls behind and driven through the desert to the outskirts of the neighbouring city of Abu Dhabi .
Turn right before the Zaha Hadid bridge , and a few hundred metres takes you to the heart of Mousafah , a ghetto - like neighbourhood of camps hidden away from the eyes of tourists .
It is just one of many areas around the Gulf set aside for an army of labourers building the icons of architecture that are mushrooming all over the region .
Behind the showers , in a yard paved with metal sheets , a line of men stands silently in front of grease - blackened pans , preparing their dinner .
Sweat rolls down their heads and necks , their soaked shirts stuck to their backs .
A heavy smell of spices and body odour fills the air .
Next to a heap of rubbish , a man holds a plate containing his meal : a few chillies , an onion and three tomatoes , to be fried with spices and eaten with a piece of bread .
In a neighbouring camp , a group of Pakistani workers from north and south Waziristan sit exhaustedly sipping tea while one of them cooks outside .
In the middle of the cramped room in which 10 men sleep , one worker in a filthy robe sits on the floor grinding garlic and onions with a mortar and pestle while staring into the void .
Hamidullah , a thin Afghan from Maydan , a village on the outskirts of Kabul , tells me : " I spent five years in Iran and one year here , and one year here feels like 10 years .
When I left Afghanistan I thought I would be back in a few months , but now I do n't know when I will be back . "
Another worker on a bunk bed next to him adds : " He called his home yesterday and they told him that three people from his village were killed in fighting .
This is why we are here . "
Hamidullah earns around 450 dirhams ( £ 70 ) a month as a construction worker .
How is life , I ask .
" What life ?
We have no life here .
We are prisoners .
We wake up at five , arrive to work at seven and are back at the camp at nine in the evening , day in and day out . "
Outside in the yard , another man sits on a chair made of salvaged wood , in front of a broken mirror , a plastic sheet wrapped around his neck , while the camp barber trims his thick beard .
Despite the air of misery , tonight is a night of celebration .
One of the men is back from a two - week break in his home village in Pakistan , bringing with him a big sack of rice , and is cooking pilau rice with meat .
Rice is affordable at weekends only : already wretched incomes have been eroded by the weak dollar and rising food prices .
" Life is worse now , " one worker told me .
" Before , we could get by on 140 dirhams [ £ 22 ] a month ; now we need 320 to 350 . "
The dozen or so men sit on newspapers advertising luxury watches , mobile phones and high - rise towers .
When three plastic trays arrive , filled with yellowish rice and tiny cubes of meat , each offers the rare shreds of meat to his neighbours .
All of these men are part of a huge scam that is helping the construction boom in the Gulf .
Like hundreds of thousands of migrant workers , they each paid more than £ 1,000 to employment agents in India and Pakistan .
They were promised double the wages they are actually getting , plus plane tickets to visit their families once a year , but none of the men in the room had actually read their contract .
Only two of them knew how to read .
" They lied to us , " a worker with a long beard says .
" They told us lies to bring us here .
Some of us sold their land ; others took big loans to come and work here . "
Once they arrive in the United Arab Emirates , migrant workers are treated little better than cattle , with no access to healthcare and many other basic rights .
The company that sponsors them holds on to their passports - and often a month or two of their wages to make sure that they keep working .
And for this some will earn just 400 dirhams ( £ 62 ) a month .
A group of construction engineers told me , with no apparent shame , that if a worker becomes too ill to work he will be sent home after a few days .
" They are the cheapest commodity here .
Steel , concrete , everything is up , but workers are the same . "
As they eat , the men talk more about their lives .
" My shift is eight hours and two overtime , but in reality we work 18 hours , " one says .
" The supervisors treat us like animals .
I do n't know if the owners [ of the company ] know . "
" There is no war , and the police treat us well , " another chips in , " but the salary is not good . "
" That man has n't been home for four years , " says Ahmad , the chef for the night , pointing at a well - built young man .
" He has no money to pay for the flight . "
A steel worker says he does n't know who is supposed to pay for his ticket back home .
At the recruiting agency they told him it would be the construction company - but he did n't get anything in writing .
One experienced worker with spectacles and a prayer cap on his head tells me that things are much better than they used to be .
Five years ago , when he first came , the company gave him nothing .
There was no air conditioning in the room and sometimes no electricity .
" Now , they give AC to each room and a mattress for each worker . "
Immigrant workers have no right to form unions , but that did n't stop strikes and riots spreading across the region recently - something unheard of few years ago .
Elsewhere in Mousafah , I encounter one of the very few illegal unions , where workers have established a form of underground insurance scheme , based on the tribal structure back home .
" When we come here , " one member of the scheme tells me , " we register with our tribal elders , and when one of us is injured and is sent home , or dies , the elders collect 30 dirhams from each of us and send the money home to his family . "
In a way , the men at Mousafah are the lucky ones .
Down in the Diera quarter of old Dubai , where many of the city 's illegal workers live , 20 men are often crammed into one small room .
UN agencies estimate that there are up to 300,000 illegal workers in the emirates .
On another hot evening , hundreds of men congregate in filthy alleyways at the end of a day 's work , sipping tea and sitting on broken chairs .
One man rests his back on the handles of his pushcart , silently eating his dinner next to a huge pile of garbage .
In one of the houses , a man is hanging his laundry over the kitchen sink , a reeking smell coming from a nearby toilet .
Next door , men lie on the floor .
They tell me they are all illegal and they are scared and that I have to leave .
Outside , a fistfight breaks out between Pakistani workers and Sri Lankans .
The alleyways are dotted with sweatshops , where Indian men stay until late at night , bending over small tables sewing on beads .
A couple of miles away , the slave market becomes more ugly .
Outside a glitzy hotel , with a marble and glass facade , dozens of prostitutes congregate according to their ethnic groups :
Asians to the right , next to them Africans , and , on the left , blondes from the former Soviet Union .
There are some Arab women .
Iranians , I am told , are in great demand .
They charge much higher prices and are found only in luxury hotels .
Like the rest of the Gulf region , Dubai and Abu Dhabi are being built by expat workers .
They are strictly segregated , and a hierarchy worthy of previous centuries prevails .
At the top , floating around in their black or white robes , are the locals with their oil money .
Immaculate and pampered , they own everything .
Outside the " free zones " , where the rules are looser , no one can start a business in the UAE without a partner from the emirates , who often does nothing apart from lending his name .
No one can get a work permit without a local sponsor .
Under the locals come the western foreigners , the experts and advisers , making double the salaries they make back home , all tax free .
Beneath them are the Arabs - Lebanese and Palestinians , Egyptians and Syrians .
What unites these groups is a mixture of pretension and racism .
" Unrealistic things happen to your mind when you come here , " a Lebanese woman who frequently visits Dubai tells me as she drives her new black SUV .
" Suddenly , you can make $ 5,000 [ £ 2,800 ] a month .
You can get credit so easy , you buy the car of your dreams , you shop and you think it 's a great bargain ; when you go to dinner , you go to a hotel ... nowhere else can you live like this . "
Down at the base of the pyramid are the labourers , waiters , hotel employees and unskilled workers from India , Pakistan , Sri Lanka , Ethiopia , the Philippines and beyond .
They move deferentially around the huge malls , cafes , bars and restaurants , bowing down and calling people sir and madam .
In the middle of the day , during the hottest hours , you can see them sleeping in public gardens under trees , or on the marble floors of the Dubai Mosque , on benches or pieces of cardboard on side streets .
These are the victims of the racism that is not only flourishing in the UAE but is increasingly being exported to the rest of the Middle East .
Sometimes it reminds you of the American south in the 1930s .
One evening in Abu Dhabi , I have dinner with my friend Ali , a charming Iraqi engineer whom I have known for two decades .
After the meal , as his wife serves saffron - flavoured tea , he pushes back his chair and lights a cigar .
We talk about stock markets , investment and the Middle East , and then the issue of race comes up .
" We will never use the new metro if it 's not segregated , " he tells me , referring to the state - of - the - art underground system being built in neighbouring Dubai .
" We will never sit next to Indians and Pakistanis with their smell , " his wife explains .
Not for the first time , I am told that while the immigrant workers are living in appalling conditions , they would be even worse off back home - as if poverty in one place can justify exploitation in the other .
" We need slaves , " my friend says .
" We need slaves to build monuments .
Look who built the pyramids - they were slaves . "
Sharla Musabih , a human rights campaigner who runs the City of Hope shelter for abused women , is familiar with such sentiments .
" Once you get rich on the back of the poor , " she says , " it 's not easy to let go of that lifestyle .
They are devaluing human beings , " she says .
" The workers might eat once a day back home , but they have their family around them , they have respect .
They are not asking for a room in a hotel - all they are asking for is respect for their humanity . "
Towards the end of another day , on a fabulous sandy beach near the Dubai marina , the waves wash calmly over the beautiful sand .
A couple are paragliding over the blue sea ; on the new islands , gigantic concrete structures stand like spaceships .
As tourists laze on the beach , Filipino , Indian and Pakistani workers , stand silently watching from a dune , cut off from the holidaymakers by an invisible wall .
Behind them rise more brand - new towers .
" It 's a Green Zone mentality , " a young Arab working in IT tells me .
" People come to make money .
They live in bubbles .
They all want to make as much money as possible and leave . "
Back at the Mousafah camps , a Pakistani worker walks me through his neighbourhood .
On both sides of the dusty lane stand concrete barracks and the familiar detritus : raw sewage , garbage , scrap metal .
A man washes his car , and in a cage chickens flutter up and down .
We enter one of the rooms , flip - flops piled by the door .
Inside , a steelworker gets a pile of papers from a plastic envelope and shoves them into my lap .
He is suing the company that employed him for unpaid wages .
" I 've been going to court for three months , and every time I go they tell me to come in two weeks . "
His friends nod their heads .
" Last time the [ company ] lawyer told me , ' I am in the law here - you will not get anything . "
Economically , Dubai has progressed a lot in the past 10 years , but socially it has stayed behind , " says Musabih .
" Labour conditions are like America in the 19th century - but that 's not acceptable in the 21st century . "
One of the most successful ways to bring in new subscribers to your blog is to give away a bonus when people sign up .
In this post Brian Armstrong from StartBreaking Free.com shares some tips on getting free books to give away on your blog .
If you ’re like most people , you have n’t had time to write a great book to give away as a sign - up bonus .
Well , today I ’m going to show you two very easy ways to get such a book :
Create your own with an e-book template
Use someone else ’s book that is in the public domain ( you ’d be amazed how many great books are out there for free ! )
Create Your Own eBook In 48 Hours With An E-book Template
About a year ago I stumbled across these excellent e-book templates which were being given away by Eben Pagan ( he is a successful internet marketer and deserves all the credit for these , I did n’t create them ! )
They have a professional design in nine different colors , come with instructions , and make it super easy to get a book done quickly .
Here are the steps which I ’ve personally used to create an eBook in less than 48 hours :
Use a “ top 10 ” formula .
Writing a book from scratch sounds hard but anybody can come up with 10 tips in their niche .
Even if it ends up being only 20 or 30 pages that ’s ok for an eBook .
Create a catchy title based on the top 10 theme , such as “ 10 Ways To Raise Your Grades By Studying Smarter , Not Harder ” or “ 10 Secrets To Making Money Online ”
Come up with the 10 tips by brainstorming and looking at the best posts on your blog .
Put the tips in a logical order and include several sub -points under each one .
Now plug your tips and sub-points into the template and write a paragraph or two under each one ( copy and paste text from blog posts you ’ve already written when appropriate ) .
Summarize your main points in an introduction and conclusion and you ’ve got a book !
Use Adobe Reader to convert it to a PDF for distrbution .
You should also familiarize yourself with Microsoft Word ’s “ styles ” to keep your formatting consistent .
If you want to change how a subheading looks , for example , you should n’t change it manually .
Instead , you should edit the “ subheading style ” and it will apply your changes to all the subheadings .
This will save you a lot of time down the road .
Finally , upload your PDF to your server and find a way to automatically send your eBook to new subscribers .
In Feedburner you can include this link in the confirmation email ( login to Feedburner and go to Publicize -> Email Subscriptions -> Communication Preferences ) .
Similar options exist for Aweber and other newsletter providers .
Some people also include the link in the bottom of every RSS post .
Second Option : Get Free Books To Give Away !
The second , and perhaps easier , method is to use a book that someone else has already written .
There are an amazing number of books in the public domain ( and also under the creative commons license , more on this later ) which you can give away on your site .
For example , in my niche of entrepreneurship , I paid good money for three books years ago that I heard were excellent :
Think and Grow Rich , The Richest Man In Babylon , and The Way To Wealth .
Imagine how surprised I was to discover that all three of these books were now available online for free !
I found PDF copies using the method I describe below and started giving them away on my website .
My subscribers started going up immediately !
So how do you find these books ?
Well , according to Wikipedia …
In the United States , all books and other works published before 1923 have expired copyrights and are in the public domain .
In addition , works published before 1964 that did not have their copyrights renewed 28 years after first publication year also are in the public domain …
Many books which are not in the public domain can still be found under the creative commons license .
The Creative Commons license is somewhere in between a full copyright and a public domain work .
Many times , the work can still be given away for free , but you are not allowed to sell it and you must pay attribution to the original author .
This still works fine for our sign - up bonus however .
I ’ve had the most success finding public domain and creative commons works at a site called Scribd.com .
They have tons of PDF ’s of various works .
And it ’s easy to see the the copyright at the bottom of each page .
Many of them use the creative commons terms like “ attribution ” ( meaning you must keep the original author ’s name in there ) or “ non-commercial ” ( meaning you ca n’t sell it ) .
It ’s probably a good idea to familiarize yourself with these terms by visiting the creative commons definitions page .
Once you ’d found a PDF you like , you can download it directly from Scribd.com and use it in the same way described above .
Conclusion
Now you have no excuse NOT to give away a great sign - up bonus for your new subscribers !
Set aside some time this week to get this together , and start watching your subscriber numbers climb !

Proposition 8 is simple and straightforward .
It contains the same 14 words that were previously approved in 2000 by over 61 % of California voters : " Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California . "
Because four activist judges in San Francisco wrongly overturned the people 's vote , we need to pass this measure as a constitutional amendment to RESTORE THE DEFINITION OF MARRIAGE as a man and a woman .
Proposition 8 is about preserving marriage ; it 's not an attack on the gay lifestyle .
Proposition 8 does n't take away any rights or benefits of gay or lesbian domestic partnerships .
Under California law , " domestic partners shall have the same rights , protections , and benefits " as married spouses .
( Family Code § 297.5 . )
There are NO exceptions .
Proposition 8 WILL NOT change this .
YES on Proposition 8 does three simple things :
It restores the definition of marriage to what the vast majority of California voters already approved and human history has understood marriage to be .
It overturns the outrageous decision of four activist Supreme Court judges who ignored the will of the people .
It protects our children from being taught in public schools that " same - sex marriage " is the same as traditional marriage .
Proposition 8 protects marriage as an essential institution of society .
While death , divorce , or other circumstances may prevent the ideal , the best situation for a child is to be raised by a married mother and father .
The narrow decision of the California Supreme Court is n't just about " live and let live . "
State law may require teachers to instruct children as young as kindergarteners about marriage .
( Education Code § 51890 . )
If the gay marriage ruling is not overturned , TEACHERS COULD BE REQUIRED to teach young children there is no difference between gay marriage and traditional marriage .
We should not accept a court decision that may result in public schools teaching our kids that gay marriage is okay .
That is an issue for parents to discuss with their children according to their own values and beliefs .
It should n't be forced on us against our will .
Some will try to tell you that Proposition 8 takes away legal rights of gay domestic partnerships .
That is false .
Proposition 8 DOES NOT take away any of those rights and does not interfere with gays living the lifestyle they choose .
However , while gays have the right to their private lives , they do not have the right to redefine marriage for everyone else .
CALIFORNIANS HAVE NEVER VOTED FOR SAME -SEX MARRIAGE .
If gay activists want to legalize gay marriage , they should put it on the ballot .
Instead , they have gone behind the backs of voters and convinced four activist judges in San Francisco to redefine marriage for the rest of society .
That is the wrong approach .
Voting YES on Proposition 8 RESTORES the definition of marriage that was approved by over 61 % of voters .
Voting YES overturns the decision of four activist judges .
Voting YES protects our children .
Please vote YES on Proposition 8 to RESTORE the meaning of marriage .

PROP .
8 DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH SCHOOLS There 's NOT ONE WORD IN 8 ABOUT EDUCATION .
In fact , local school districts and parents -- not the state - - develop health education programs for their schools .
NO CHILD CAN BE FORCED , AGAINST THE WILL OF THEIR PARENTS , TO BE TAUGHT ANYTHING about health and family issues .
CALIFORNIA LAW PROHIBITS IT .
And NOTHING IN STATE LAW REQUIRES THE MENTION OF MARRIAGE IN KINDERGARTEN !
It 's a smokescreen .
DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIPS and MARRIAGE AREN'T THE SAME .
CALIFORNIA STATUTES CLEARLY IDENTIFY NINE REAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MARRIAGE AND DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIPS .
Only marriage provides the security that spouses provide one another - - it 's why people get married in the first place !
Think about it .
Married couples depend on spouses when they 're sick , hurt , or aging .
They accompany them into ambulances or hospital rooms , and help make life - and - death decisions , with no questions asked .
ONLY MARRIAGE ENDS THE CONFUSION AND GUARANTEES THE CERTAINTY COUPLES CAN COUNT ON IN TIMES OF GREATEST NEED .
Regardless of how you feel about this issue , we should guarantee the same fundamental freedoms to every Californian .
PROP .
8 TAKES AWAY THE RIGHTS OF GAY AND LESBIAN COUPLES AND TREATS THEM DIFFERENTLY UNDER THE LAW .
Equality under the law is one of the basic foundations of our society .
Prop. 8 means one class of citizens can enjoy the dignity and responsibility of marriage , and another cannot .
That 's unfair .
PROTECT FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS .

OUR CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION -- the law of our land -- SHOULD GUARANTEE THE SAME FREEDOMS AND RIGHTS TO EVERYONE --NO ONE group SHOULD be singled out to BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY .
In fact , our nation was founded on the principle that all people should be treated equally .
EQUAL PROTECTION UNDER THE LAW IS THE FOUNDATION OF AMERICAN SOCIETY .
That 's what this election is about -- equality , freedom , and fairness , for all .
Marriage is the institution that conveys dignity and respect to the lifetime commitment of any couple .
PROPOSITION 8 WOULD DENY LESBIAN AND GAY COUPLES that same DIGNITY AND RESPECT .
That 's why Proposition 8 is wrong for California .
Regardless of how you feel about this issue , the freedom to marry is fundamental to our society , just like the freedoms of religion and speech .
PROPOSITION 8 MANDATES ONE SET OF RULES FOR GAY AND LESBIAN COUPLES AND ANOTHER SET FOR EVERYONE ELSE .
That 's just not fair .
OUR LAWS SHOULD TREAT EVERYONE EQUALLY .
In fact , the government has no business telling people who can and cannot get married .
Just like government has no business telling us what to read , watch on TV , or do in our private lives .
We do n't need Prop .
8 ; WE DON'T NEED MORE GOVERNMENT IN OUR LIVES .
REGARDLESS OF HOW ANYONE FEELS ABOUT MARRIAGE FOR GAY AND LESBIAN COUPLES , PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BE SINGLED OUT FOR UNFAIR TREATMENT UNDER THE LAWS OF OUR STATE .
Those committed and loving couples who want to accept the responsibility that comes with marriage should be treated like everyone else .
DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIPS ARE NOT MARRIAGE .
When you 're married and your spouse is sick or hurt , there is no confusion : you get into the ambulance or hospital room with no questions asked .
IN EVERYDAY LIFE , AND ESPECIALLY IN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS , DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIPS ARE SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH .
Only marriage provides the certainty and the security that people know they can count on in their times of greatest need .
EQUALITY UNDER THE LAW IS A FUNDAMENTAL CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEE .
Prop. 8 separates one group of Californians from another and excludes them from enjoying the same rights as other loving couples .
Forty - six years ago I married my college sweetheart , Julia .
We raised three children -- two boys and one girl .
The boys are married , with children of their own .
Our daughter , Liz , a lesbian , can now also be married -- if she so chooses .
All we have ever wanted for our daughter is that she be treated with the same dignity and respect as her brothers -- with the same freedoms and responsibilities as every other Californian .
My wife and I never treated our children differently , we never loved them any differently , and now the law does n't treat them differently , either .
Each of our children now has the same rights as the others , to choose the person to love , commit to , and to marry .
Do n't take away the equality , freedom , and fairness that everyone in California - - straight , gay , or lesbian -- deserves .
Please join us in voting NO on Prop .
8 . SAMUEL THORON , Former President
Parents , Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays JULIA MILLER THORON , Parent Rebuttal to Arguments Against Proposition 8 is about traditional marriage ; it is not an attack on gay relationships .
Under California law gay and lesbian domestic partnerships are treated equally ; they already have the same rights as married couples .
Proposition 8 does not change that .
What Proposition 8 does is restore the meaning of marriage to what human history has understood it to be and over 61 % of California voters approved just a few years ago .
Your YES vote ensures that the will of the people is respected .
It overturns the flawed legal reasoning of four judges in San Francisco who wrongly disregarded the people 's vote , and ensures that gay marriage can be legalized only through a vote of the people .
Your YES vote ensures that parents can teach their children about marriage according to their own values and beliefs without conflicting messages being forced on young children in public schools that gay marriage is okay .
Your YES vote on Proposition 8 means that only marriage between a man and a woman will be valid or recognized in California , regardless of when or where performed .
But Prop. 8 will NOT take away any other rights or benefits of gay couples .
Gays and lesbians have the right to live the lifestyle they choose , but they do not have the right to redefine marriage for everyone else .
Proposition 8 respects the rights of gays while still reaffirming traditional marriage .
Please vote YES on Proposition 8 to RESTORE the definition of marriage that the voters already approved .

The head of failed US investment bank Lehman Brothers has told Congress that he took home about $ 300 m in pay and bonuses over the past eight years .
Richard Fuld , whose firm went bankrupt last month , made the statement during testimony before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee .
The panel is holding its first hearing into the cause of the financial crisis .
It is being held amid renewed market turmoil , with shares plummeting further in Europe and the US .
Committee chairman Henry Waxman opened the hearing by saying the credit freeze threatened the entire economy .
" To restore our economy to health , two steps are necessary , " he said .
" First , we must identify what went wrong .
Then we must enact real reform of our financial markets . "
' Feeling horrible '
Turning to Mr Fuld , Mr Waxman asked whether it was true he had received $ 480 m ( £ 276.2 m ) in pay and bonuses since 2000 - and whether this figure was fair .
Mr Fuld replied that the correct total was about $ 300 m ( £ 172.6 m ) .
" We had a compensation committee that spent a tremendous amount of time making sure that the interests of the executives and the employees were aligned with shareholders , " he said .
Mr Waxman also criticised Mr Fuld for requesting multi-million dollar bonuses for departing executives just days before last month 's collapse .
" In other words , " he added , " even as Mr Fuld was pleading with [ Treasury ] Secretary [ Henry ]
Paulson for a federal rescue , Lehman continued to squander millions on executive compensation . "
Mr Fuld said he took " full responsibility for the decisions that I made and for the actions that I took " and defended his actions as " prudent and appropriate " based on information he had at the time .
" I feel horrible about what happened , " he added .

From the WSJ : Reliance on Exports Hurts Asia
The meltdown in Asian stock prices on Friday stemmed in part from the growing realization that the heavy reliance on exports that has driven Asia 's powerful growth is now turning into the its worst enemy .
The evaporation of consumer spending in the U.S. and Europe is starting to hit deeply at Asian manufacturing titans that thrive on sales to the rest of the world , and that are now rapidly scaling down their capital spending .
So much for decoupling .
It 's hard to believe this comes as a surprise ...
The global economic dam has now cracked wide open .
Water is pouring everywhere .
The bursting of the dam is a fitting tribute to Paulson 's and Bush 's $ 700 billion boondoggle to add liquidity to banks .
The public was overwhelmingly against the plan ( and rightly so ) as were close to 200 economists .
Paulson , Bush , Trichet , and Brown all goaded Congress to waste $ 700 billion of taxpayer money on grounds there would be a global meltdown if the plan was not passed .
Congress had it right the first time .
The $ 700 billion bailout helped bust the dam .
Neither the Bush administration nor the fools in Congress voting for the bailout bothered to figure out you cannot patch a failing dam by adding water .
Liquidity measures cannot and will not work , when the disease is the Fed , reckless Congressional spending , and fractional reserve lending carried to extreme .
I talked about this earlier today in Cancerous Activity of the Fed and Treasury .
Too Big To Bail
I have written about this on many occasions .
I called it " Too Big To Bail " .
It is too big to bail .
Look at the share price of GM and Ford .
Look at the stock market .
What about all those Credit Default Swaps on Lehman that still have not been sorted out ?
What about the currency crisis in Latin America ?
Let 's stop mid-rant and take a look at the Currency Crisis .
Currency Intervention In Latin America
Banks in Brazil and Mexico have stepped in with currency interventions in foolish attempt to strengthen their currencies vs. the US dollar .
Chile is expected to follow suit .
We have now come full cycle .
Money poured into Latin America and places like Iceland driving their currencies to insane levels vs. the US dollar .
Capital flows are now reversing .
Earlier today Iceland took over its biggest bank and closed its stock market .
Iceland ’s Prime Minister stated : " What we have learned from this whole exercise over the last few years is that it is not wise for a small country to try to take a leading role in international banking . ”
In my opinion , currency intervention is exactly the wrong thing to do .
For more on Iceland and currency intervention , please consider Latin American Banks Attempt to Save Currencies .
Potential For Bond Market Revolt
Because Paulson has stepped into overdrive attempting to pour water on a busted dam , there is a potential beginning of a bond market revolt .
Treasury yields have climbed for three straight days showing unwillingness of investors to finance this mess .
The long bond is still at 4.10 , close to historic lows , but yields on the 10 - year treasury have shot up close to 50 basis points .
Obviously , this will not help the housing market one bit .
$ 50 billion in treasuries were auctioned in the past three days .
What about financing the remaining pieces of this boondoggle ?
Global Coordinated Rate Cuts
On Wednesday , the Fed , ECB , Bank of England , Bank of Canada , and Sweden 's Riksbank all cut rates by 50 basis points .
My response is Global Coordinated Rate Cuts Wo n't Solve Economic Crisis .
Fed Scared To Death Over Libor
One of the reasons central bankers panicked into mass rate cuts is a huge mass of adjustable rate mortgages is about to reset .
The rate cuts were a big attempt to force down LIBOR .
Rate cuts failed big time to stem the surge in LIBOR .
Inquiring minds can see a chart of the TED spread in Cancerous Activity of the Fed and Treasury .
Most ARMs mortgages are tied to LIBOR or 1 - year treasuries .
The latter is no problem but LIBOR based mortgages are another matter indeed .
One Year Treasuries
One Year Libor
One Month Libor
The above charts courtesy of MoneyCafe .
The charts are a bit stale .
The current 1 year treasury rates is down to 1.26 % and LIBOR rates are slightly higher than the above charts .
Interest only loans are typically tied to 1 - month LIBOR , while those in most other ARMs are tied to 1 - year LIBOR .
Those in LIBOR based ARMs with teaser rates about to reset are going to be obliterated .

Liquidity works until it does n't and the above chart is stunning proof .
There was no legitimate fundamental reason for GM to rally from 16 to 42 .
The market is acting as if GM 's debt is worthless , which of course it should be and will be unless the government ( taxpayer ) steps in to guarantee it .
It 's important to remember there is something like $ 1 trillion bet on GM credit default swaps should GM go under .
Who is going to cover that bet , if and when it blows up ?

Those funds will now have to toss Ford and GM .

Future Is Frugality
The world is on the backside of Peak Credit .
The backside is deflation and The Future Is Frugality .
Global Recession Headed Our Way
I wish to end with what I said in Global Coordinated Rate Cuts Wo n't Solve Economic Crisis .
The world is heading for a global recession and a sure bet is that it will be blamed on a subprime crisis in the US .
The reality is the greatest liquidity experiment in history is now crashing to earth .
The root cause of this crisis is fractional reserve lending , and micromanagement of interest rates by the Fed in particular and Central Banks in general .
The Fed started the party by slashing interest rates to 1 % , but Central Banks everywhere drank the same punch to varying degrees .
The Greenspan Fed lowering interest rates to 1 % fueled the initial boom , but like an addict on heroin , the same dose a second time will not have the same effect .
The Fed , the ECB , etc. could have slashed rates to 0 % today and it would not have mattered one bit .
The reason is simple :
There is no reason for banks to go on a lending spree with consumers tossing in the towel , unemployment rising , and rampant overcapacity everywhere one looks with the exception of the energy sector .
Consumers are tapped out , not just in the US , but in nearly every country on the planet .
We had our party , and a fine party it was .
However , the party is over and the bill is now past due .
The price is a global recession .
That price must be paid no matter what Central Banks do .
Congressional investigators have found alarming weaknesses in security procedures at two top laboratories that work with the world ’s most dangerous biological agents and diseases .
As the country races to open more labs to develop vaccines and treatments for exotic diseases and potential biological weapons , the government clearly has a lot more work to do to ensure that dangerous materials cannot fall into terrorists ’ hands .
The Government Accountability Office evaluated perimeter security at all five of the country ’s so - called Biosafety Level 4 facilities .
These are the only labs allowed to work with pathogens for which there is no cure or treatment , such as the Ebola virus and smallpox .
Three of the labs had all or nearly all of the 15 security controls that the G.A.O. deemed important .
The other two  one reportedly operated by the Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research in San Antonio , the other by Georgia State University in Atlanta  lacked the vast majority of the recommended controls .
Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , which regulates the facilities , contends that security differences stem from the different level of risk at each site , the defects identified are hard to defend .

VAST numbers of marine " jelly balls " now appearing off the Australian east coast could be part of the planet 's mechanism for combating global warming .
The jellyfish - like animals are known as salps and their main food is phytoplankton ( marine algae ) which absorbs the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide in the top level of the ocean .
This in turn comes from the atmosphere .
Mark Baird of the CSIRO said salps were notoriously difficult for scientists to study in the laboratory and consequently little attention has been paid to their ecological role until recently .
Nihilism
Nihilism , in my view , is the removal of all value to things except what I will call the inherent , leaving that term for later definition .
When people wail about Satan , or the war against terrorism , or the great quest for equality , you can look those straight in the eye and say , " These have no value except what we impose upon them . "
By the same token , when people tell you how important it is to see the latest movie , go to that exclusive party , or own a fancy car , you can similarly dismiss the concerns .
Nihilism is a removal of all except the inherent .
It is a gateway philosophy , as I see it , meaning that it is the initial realization on a course of learning .
In contrast to the " devotional " philosophies such as Christianity , where all who come and recite an oath are considered to have received wisdom , the philosophies of life that are not a charade embrace esoteric views .
Esotericism says that wisdom comes to those who seek it , and in varying degrees ; there is no magic threshold to cross after which one can write the holy sign on one 's forehead and be considered knowledgeable .
Infinite learning and infinite potential pitfalls instead await .
When one embraces nihilism , one has undertaken the first step of this initiation , by removing all value externally imposed , including by other humans .
Herein begins discovery .
Nihilism
Rejection of all inherent value frees us from a fascination with both materialism and moralism .
These beliefs assert that what exists has ultimate value , and therefore that it is an end in itself and not a means to a life process .
Nihilism asserts the opposite , and thus begins a path which leads us past fear of death to a heroic worldview .
In a diseased time , such as the current era , the individual is constantly assaulted by a barrage of imaginary reality , including morality , politics , economics and social factors .
Any mind which wishes to become aware beyond this barrage must find a persistent means of removing this , and the best method is nihilism : denying all value except the meaning of experience and outcome .
{ snip }
Most belief systems operate by establishing some form of " objective " linear truth by which adherents must abide , and thus proscribe nihilism as a destruction of all that holds such belief systems together .
The proper name for this form of belief system is politics , as it operates by inducement and coercion to create uniform behavior among a disparity of people .
{ snip }
From the point of view of such systems , there are two realms for the human individual , the subjective ( mind ) and objective ( body ) , so divided because the subjective is limited wholly to the perceptions of the individual , and the objective to physically verifiable events such as the realm in which the body exists .
The derivation of truth , and attainment of goals in the language of truth , is a process of uniting mind and body that transcends subject / object division .
These perceptions are not objective in that they originate and end in the individual , but are stimulated by and acted upon within objective space .
The individual , and its thoughts , are part of the mechanism of life .
For this reason , moral distinctions such as " mind your own business " and " thou shalt not kill " are meaningless , since they presuppose the barrier between subject and object , and mind and body , to be absolute .
{ snip }
In the modern ( post - liberal ) view , at this point humanity would diverge into as many different goalsets as exist individuals , but to an idealist , because all values are based on adaptation to the same objective reality , what is present are many viewpoints with the same basic values interpreted according to the ability of each individual .
" Rationality " is a word used to express the degree of correspondence between an intended course of action ( mind ) and its consequences ( body ) .
Much as a highly refined mind can describe the structure of an idea , or predict the results of an experiment , or throw an unhittable pitch , rationality varies with intelligence , experience and discipline of the individual .
This line of thought shows the idealist how there is only one reality , often called " ultimate " reality , based in the physical world , including the workings of each mind with its specific degree of rationality .
It is known to us through metaphor , meaning the consistency of its operation according to abstract rulesets , and therefore whether its mechanism is mind or body is irrelevant ; its operation can be measured and predicted without knowing its composition .
Love and Nihilism
Nihilism remains one of the most controversial topics of the modern era , for a good reason : science has supported a form of nihilism by steadily revealing more of the underpinning behind natural processes , making things that once seemed to be unique objects appear as a collaboration of different effects .
Slowly the post - animist ideas of the things we refer to with nouns being unique and of a consistent content are being exposed as structures of granular objects intersecting according to natural laws and constraints .
This process threatens many of the social and emotional constructs used commonly in human society with a destabilization based not in the threat to the concept in question , but to the concept archetype from which those concepts emerge .
Despite this recent condition , nihilism is an eternal question in the human experience .
As the definition above illustrates , there is a split in the meaning of the word .
The most common meaning in our current society is a conflation of the lack of inherent value with a fatalism and aimlessness in intellectual choice - making ; the second meaning is one in which an epistemological sandblaster is applied to all new input to remove social , mental , moral , emotional and political conditioning from the meaning , perception and differentiation of objects .
It is the second meaning in which the word is used here , since fatalism and passivity are so well known as separate phenomena there is no need to confuse them with what can be revealed as a separate phenomena .
{ snip }
As research probes further into the complexities of the human mind , it becomes clear that the mind is far from being a composite thing which is an actor upon its world through thoughts ; rather , thoughts compose the mind , in the form of connections and associations wired into the tissue of the brain , creating circuitry for future associations of like stimulus .
The schematic of this intellectual machine builds separate routing for situations it is likely to encounter , based on grouped similarities in events or objects .
In this view of our computing resources , it is foolish to allow pre-processing to intervene , as it creates vast amounts of wiring which serve extremely similar purposes , thus restricting the range of passive association ( broad - mindedness ) or active association ( creativity ) possible within the switching mechanism of the brain as a whole .
{ snip }
The " positive " effects of nihilism on the mind of a human being are many .
Like the quieting of distraction and distortion within the mind brought about by meditative focus , nihilism pushes aside preconception and brings the mind to focus within the time of the present .
Influences which could radically skew our perceptions - emotions , nervousness , paranoia , or upset , to name a few - fade into the background and the mind becomes more open to the task at hand without becoming spread across contemplations of potential actions occurring at different levels of scale regarding the current task .
Many human errors originate in perceiving an event to be either more important than it is , or to be " symbolically " indicative of relevance on a greater scale than the localized context which it affects , usually because of a conditioned preference for the scale of eventiture existing before the symbolic event .
Nihilism as a philosophical doctrine must not be confused with a political doctrine such as anarchism ; political doctrines ( as religions are ) remain fundamentally teleological in their natures and thus deal with conclusions derived from evidence , where nihilism as a deontological process functions at the level of the start of perception , causing less of a focus on abstracting a token ruleset defining the implications of events than a rigorous concentration on the significance of the events as they are immediately effecting the situation surrounding them .
For example , a nihilistic fighter does not bother to assess whether his opponent is a better fighter or not that the perceiving agency , but fights to his best ability ( something evolution would reward , as the best fighter does not win every fight , only most of them ) .
As a result of this conditioning , nihilism separates the incidence of events / perceptions from causal understanding by removing expectations of causal origins and implications to ongoing eventiture .
This may seem like a minor detail ; it is .
However , it remains a detail overlooked by the Judeo - Christian " Western " nations , and as a result , our cognitive systems are bound up in conditioned preconception and moral preprocessing , separating us all too often from a pragmatic recognition of the course of change brought about by events , and thus hamstringing our ability to give these events context in processing .
Consequently , forms of social and political manipulation remain unchecked because to people conditioned in this form of perceptual preprocessing , the error of this poor mental hygiene is not only invisible but essential for cognitive process .
Nihilism
Nihilism is the theory that meaning beyond the immanent is irrelevant .
Nihilism is the foundation of objectivism .
Through removing external value one sees what is actually there , which , given the workings of the universe , has equal value and is thus equally impermanent .
Nihilism is beauty .
The brand of nihilism that we advocate is not merely a flippant rejection of societal norms or an angry reaction caused by being powerless under the weight of a capitalistic society whose leaders alone determine values , potentials and human futures based on their economic reward to those in power .
Rather , our nihilism is a cautious and studied result in which every value asserted by society has been inspected and has never failed to ring hollow .
Nihil
Nihilism ( from the Latin nihil , nothing ) is a philosophical position that argues that existence is without objective meaning , purpose , or intrinsic value .
Nihilists generally assert that objective morality does not exist , and that no action is logically preferable to any other in regard to the moral value of one action over another .
Wikipedia
Nihilism does not deny existence is without objective meaning , purpose , or intrinsic value ; it denies that existence is without anthrocentric " objective " ( subjective , moral judgment ) meaning , purpose , or intrinsic value ( moral value , from moral judgments ) .
Nihilism denies the should / ought in favor of the is / could be .
While the article makes a good point that nihilists deny that any action is morally preferrable to another , the big point that it misses is that nihilists deny morality ( should / ought ) in favor of practicality .
Nihilists can believe in the value of life so long as it is not anchored in human judgments , but in logic and immanent values ( Platonic forms ) .
Nietzsche noted the " death of God " and the atrophy of traditional absolutist morality in his time .
However , he never advocated nihilism as a practical mode of living and was typically quite critical of what he described as the more dangerous nihilism , the rejection of the material world in favor of a nonexistent " heaven " . [ 7 ] [ 6 ]
His later work displays a preoccupation with nihilism .
Nietzsche characterized nihilism as emptying the world and especially human existence of meaning , purpose , comprehensible truth , or essential value .
He hints that nihilism can become a false belief , when it leads individuals to discard any hope of meaning in the world and thus to invent some compensatory alternate measure of significance .
Nietzsche used the phrase ' Christians and other nihilists ' , which is consistent with Christianity in general as Nietzsche describes nihilism , though as nihilism is now commonly construed , Christian philosophy is its opposite .
Negative Nihilism : Removal of all value , including the ability to have value .
Positive Nihilism : Removal of all non-inherent valuations ( judgments , categories , social logic ) so that immanent values can be perceived and reconstructed .
We so need the lie drug .
The collective desperation for myth is palpable ... send us a savior to correct our behavior !
Anyone who can live without the lie drug is a true nihilist .
A nihilist can interface reality with all its beauty and unpleasant consequences with their personal sense of the tangible because the two are the same .
Freydis
Nihilism has both a metaphysical and a moral meaning .
Metaphysically , it means that nothing is , i.e. , not that there is absolutely nothing , which would be absurd , but that there is no unchanging ground , no eternal God or Being such as the Western tradition since Plato has imagined to underlie the flux of experience .
Thus , the innumerable things that according to our experience so evidently “ are , ” in fact only seem to be and are actually constantly changing , constantly becoming something other than what they are in a chaotic and utterly unpredictable way .
Without some unchanging ground or foundation to this flux , however , it is difficult to see how truth , justice , and morality are possible .

" That comes from the Latin nihil , ' nothing , ' so far as I can judge ; consequently that word designates a man who who recognizes nothing . "
" Say , ' who respects nothing , ' " put in Pavel Petrovitch , and devoted himself once more to his butter .
" Who treats everything from a critical point of view , " remarked Arkady .
" And is n't that exactly the same thing ? " inquired Pavel Petrovitch .
" No , it is not exactly the same thing .
A Nihilist is a man who does not bow before any authority whatever , who does not accept a single principle on faith , with whatever respect that principle may be environed . "
" And dost thou think that is a good thing ? " interrupted Pavel Petrovitch .
" That depends on who it is , dear uncle .
It is all right for one man and very bad for another . "
" You do n't say so .
Well , I see that that is not in our line .
We people of the old school assume that without principles it is impossible to take a step or breathe .
. . .
We shall content ourselves , therefore , with admiring these gentlemen -- what do you call them ? "
" Nihilists , " replied Arkady , with distinctness .
SHSU
Nihilism is the belief that all values are baseless and that nothing can be known or communicated .
It is often associated with extreme pessimism and a radical skepticism that condemns existence .
A true nihilist would believe in nothing , have no loyalties , and no purpose other than , perhaps , an impulse to destroy .
{ snip }
Early in the nineteenth century , Friedrich Jacobi used the word to negatively characterize transcendental idealism .
IEP
I 've always defined nihilism not as " believing in nothing " but " not believing in the value of anything . "
Subtle difference .
You can't not believe in reality and exist for long .
You can however claim , like the Russian nihilists did , that nothing has any meaning and you might as well just do whatever .
Then there 's the Vijay Prozak definition , which is that we should just do away with belief in judgments made by others , and stick to strict logic and the clear differences between stupid and genius actions .
He also tries to define it elsewhere :
In this piece , he differentiates between human judgments which are subjective and designs , patterns , mechanisms which are objective .
His point is that a nihilist reduces the value of everything so he can re-assess it all , saving the latter and pitching out the former .
Interestingly , this piece also describes nihilism as an esoteric philosophy .
It 's a gateway to other ideas that removes the human illusion , lets us see " ultimate reality , " and then see how the world is mind - correlative or " idealistic , " ( see The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy , whose entry for " idealism " is excellent ) .
Then , the logic goes , once we 've seen that physical reality and thoughts use the same abstract organizational system -- what Plato refers to as " forms " since they are neither material , nor judgment , but composed of matter and recognized by judgment -- we become realists , or those who see reality and want to make it function on its own terms , because we realize that addressing reality on anythingits own terms is delusional activity .
One more aspect of the Prozakhian definition :
And then there 's the ( related ) site Nihil.org which has this definitional spectrum :
So that 's how nihilism is defined in Prozakhistan .
What are other definitions ?
Although this dictionary is notoriously plagiarized from the research notes of graduate students and blighted by basement - dwellers , they offer a very generic and plodding definition :
This conflicts with the Prozakhian definition in two ways : Wikibloviation continues :
God , as separate from material life , was what replaced the traditional morality , which was a form of moral attention and not a moral binary , mirroring dualism of heaven and earth , of good and evil .
The word nihilists use for Nietzsche 's nihilism is " fatalism , " meaning people who believe life is pointless and need to reward themselves with little uplifts : pity , material rewards , religious promises , political identities .
Fatalists are common and show up in just about all forms .
We could divide nihilism into two categories : Positive nihilism is found in agnostic , atheist , Hindu , Buddhist and pagan value systems .
Freydis at counterorder.com offers us another view of nihilism :
The search for collective myth , in the Joseph Campbell sense , is a cornerstone of postmodernism .
People cannot connect the past to the future , so have no idea what to do in the present .
I think what Freydis is describing , however , is what Prozakhians would refer to as " social reality , " or the network of social half - truths we use to describe reality in quasi- euphemism , hiding that which threatens the human individual so we can all just get along .
It 's formed of good intentions ; it has the worst results , like all good intentions not mated to hard , scientific - philosophical reality .
Postmodernism , after all , is the search for a narrative .
In this flux , we have no center -- like the sun rotating around the earth -- on which to base our need for morality and truth , justice , etc .
Of course , we could just look at nature , see how it works , and then state our preference for which of the possible outcomes to our actions we would prefer .
We might even find a " meta- value " better than truth , justice and morality .
A very basic definition .
I like the statement of relativity ( not relativism ) : " it is all right for one man , and very bad for another .
" The venerableshows us another aspect : Wait , transcendental idealism ?
Where did we last hear of that ... oh , it 's what Vijay Prozak was endorsing .
Why was he doing that ?
Because transcendental idealism , like Plato 's cave - dwellers seeing sunlight for the first time , is a scientific form of transcendentalism , one that denies values in favor of looking at reality itself , adapting to that reality , and finding beauty within it instead of projecting beauty or the human form upon it -- and thus requiring its destruction ( dominance of nature leading to ecocide ) .
Their definition is partially correct .
All values are baseless -- unless corresponding to reality .
And here we come full circle with our definition of nihilism : in a dying time , when values are bad and have become divorced from reality , nihilism is like the wolves that gather to carry away the weak and diseased , to slaughter the unwary and oblivious , and in general to do horrible things to individuals that strengthen the population as a whole .
Clearly humanity -- with seven billion people , and only a half billion capable of an occasional clear thought or sincere intention -- needs nihilism now and urgently .

Presidential poiltics meets mobile technology US Democratic candidate Barack Obama is set to turn the iPhone into a political recruiting tool with an application aimed at getting the vote out .
The software has a " Call Friends " option to help organise contacts in swing states .
A note about the software on Mr Obama 's blog said : " This tool is designed to help you become more directly involved in our campaign to change the country . "
The free application was developed by volunteers in less than three weeks .
" This really has the potential to help the campaign , " said Jason Grigsby , one of the project leaders .
" The use of mobile technology to get out the vote and get people involved is a way for the grass roots to really make an impact . "
In a recent blog entry the campaign wrote : " With only 33 days left , it 's more important than ever to call your friends and family to make sure they are registered and voting for Barack . "
The blog also said that it hoped the " Call Friends " feature would " generate thousands of additional personal contacts " - that would then be turned into votes .
' New wave '
Other features include making notes on which friends have been called , who they are supporting , and if they need a reminder on election day .
The website said the total amount of calls the application made were tallied but no information left the phone , so the privacy of friends and users were protected .
The Obama camp has been praised for how it has used technology
The application also passes on up - to - date news from the campaign , plus video , photos and talking points to help convince friends to vote for the candidate .
Raven Zachary , another co-developer , told the BBC : " The iPhone is one mobile platform and there are millions of voters who do n't have the iPhone .
" But we are at the beginning of a new wave of mobile technology and we are seeing with the Obama campaign how he uses technology .
This will become the norm moving forward . "
Declan McCullagh , chief political correspondent at news site CNET told the BBC : " It 's a pretty slick iPhone application .
" Having your friends sorted by battleground states is something I have n't seen any other politician come up with before .
This is a glimpse of the future of high - tech politicking . "
" This is an indicator of how mobile technology can impact political change , " said Raven Zachary Jonathan Wight , another developer who worked on the project , said he did not believe John McCain 's camp would have time to better their efforts .
" It took us less than three weeks and if they have n't started coding already they wo n't catch up . "
Senator Obama has proved a fan of technology in his campaign and made headlines when he announced his choice of Joe Biden for vice - president via a text message .
Both Mr Obama and Mr McCain have turned to the web to raise money , to YouTube to air adverts and to Facebook to raise their profiles among the social networking set .

What are these ?
Never in modern memory have Americans been so gloomy about their future .
A record 90 % of registered voters say the country is seriously off on the wrong track , according to the most recent ABC News poll .
A long economic slump lasting well into 2009 looks likely ( see What 's Next For the Economy ? ) .
SLIDE SHOW : 10 Things That Are Going Right 15 Things to Know About the Panic of 2008 How to Cope With the Financial Crisis But take heart .
The editors of Kiplinger 's Personal Finance and Kiplinger 's forecasting came up with ten things going right these days .
See if you agree : Advertisement - Article continues below 1 . Oil Loses Its Swagger : With the U.S. and global economy hurting , oil prices have dropped more than 50 % in just three months , from $ 147 a barrel in July to the $ 65 - 70 range .
Remember $ 80 - $ 100 fill - ups at the pump ?
The national average for a gallon of gasoline is below $ 3.00 again , from $ 4.11 in March , and should stay below $ 3.50 through next year .
Prices for home heating oil and natural gas are also headed lower this winter than last .
2 . A Tipping Point for the Auto Industry : After years of talk and false starts , finally , all the major carmakers are furiously developing hybrid and alternative - fuel vehicles that could lessen our dependence on foreign oil .
Meanwhile , desperate dealers are offering unheard - of incentives on new , gas - fired models .
For example , Toyota is offering $ 1,000 cash back and 0 % financing on the 2009 Camry , the most popular car in America .
Do n't drive much ?
If you 've always wanted an SUV or truck , the discounting on some models is extraordinary .

3. Interest Rates Are Low and Headed Lower :
The prime rate is at 4.5 % , which is driving down interest rates on home - equity lines of credit and some consumer loans .
The interest rate on a traditional 30 - year fixed - rate mortgage is averaging 6.5 % , the highest it 's been since the summer of ' 07 , but still not too far from the historic low of 5.8 % reached in 2003 - 05 and 1963 - 65 .
And although credit - card companies are cutting personal spending limits , rates are dropping , too .
The average rate on credit - card purchases fell to 11.89 % in the first week of October , down from 12.13 % in September , according to LowCards.com , which tracks 1,260 credit cards .
4 . Homes Are More Affordable : Real estate , which was overpriced during the housing bubble , has returned to earth .
That 's especially good news for first - time home buyers who were priced out of the market .
While scare stories persist of credit drying up , the reality is more a return to traditional lending standards that had been thrown overboard - recklessly in many cases - by lenders .
That means to qualify you usually need a 20 % down payment , sufficient annual income , good credit and a tolerable load of debt .
Advertisement - Article continues below 5 . Your Bank Savings Have Never Been Safer :
The $ 700 - billion federal rescue plan more than doubles the amount of federal deposit insurance on individual bank accounts , to $ 250,000 from $ 100,000 .
Uncle Sam is also now providing providing unlimited FDIC insurance on non-interest - bearing accounts , covering virtually all of the nation 's small businesses .
Plus , a new temporary federal insurance program covers the full value if your money - market - fund shares fall below a net asset value of $ 1.00 ( called " breaking the buck " ) .
The program provides coverage for shareholders for the amount they owned on September 19 , 2008 .

6. Stocks Are on Sale , and Many Bonds Offer Terrific Yields :
The current bear market is approaching the 1973 - 74 and 2000 - 2002 downturns , the two worst retreats since World War II .
That 's the bad news .
The good news : Individual blue chips are selling at bargain prices .
For example , shares of AT&T ( symbol T ) sell for about eight times estimated 2009 earnings and yield 6 % .
Networking giant Cisco Systems ( CSCO ) sells for only ten times earnings estimates for its July 2009 fiscal year .
Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ ) , as steady an Eddie as you 'll find , sells for just 13 times '09 forecasts , and Google ( GOOG ) is going for less than 15 times estimates .
Triple - A- rated tax - free bonds , an extraordinarily safe investment , are paying 5 % - plus for ten years and 6 % for 20 .
That 's more than the Treasury offers for bonds of the same maturity .
Advertisement - Article continues below 7 . The Miracle of Technological Innovation Continues : Been to Best Buy , Sam's or Costco lately ?
For $ 799 , you can now buy a 42 - inch , high - definition flat - panel TV that will knock your socks off .
Throw in another $ 200 , and you can get a surround - sound system to truly transform your den into a home theater .
A top - of - the - line PC with more memory than you 'll ever use now costs $ 1,000 ; high - end laptops with all the bells and whistles go for $ 1,200 , down from $ 2,000 - $ 4,000 five years ago .
And giant leaps in handheld devices , such as Apple 's new iPhone , have revolutionized the way people interact with the world .

8. Prosperity Reigns in the Heartland :
The fall harvest is shaping up as one of the best ever , despite the destructive weather and floods in the Mississippi River corridor since last spring .
Exports of U.S. farm products will increase more than 40 % by value this year .
And recent years of high profits have allowed farmers to pay down debt so low that it accounts for a measly 9 % of their assets -- providing all the credit they 'll need for 2009 operations .
At home , while food prices jumped sharply earlier this year , the weak economy is now expected to slow further price increases .
( Consider Maine Lobster , now selling for only $ 5.99 a pound ) .
Advertisement - Article continues below 9 . A New Tone and Direction in Washington :
Whether it 's Barack Obama or John McCain who enters the White House in January , election of a new chief executive should provide at least 100 days of galvanizing certainty for markets , and a new direction and sense of purpose for the country .
10 . Shoppers Can Expect Great Gift Buys
This Holiday Season : Retailers depend on robust end - of - year sales to turn a profit , but for 2008 , the National Federation of Retailers forecasts holiday spending will increase only 2.2 % from last year .
That wo n't even beat inflation .
It 's good news for bargain hunters , though .
Both brick - and - mortar and online retailers are gearing up to offer huge discounts to boost sales .
For example , Deal News predicts a DUAL Core Intel Laptop will go for as low as $ 299 on Black Friday , the day after Thanksgiving , and a Canon Power Shot SD1100 ( recommended in our Simple Tech picks ) will go for a very low $ 139 .
So chin up .
We 've been through hard times before .
To quote Rudyard Kipling , " If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs ... "

Afghan President Hamid Karzai speaks during a meeting of the General Assembly on the Culture of Peace at the United Nations in New York November 12 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Shannon Stapleton
KABUL ( Reuters ) - Afghan President Hamid Karzai said Wednesday he would bring down U.S. planes bombing villages if he could , in a sign of growing tension between Afghanistan and its Western backers as the Taliban insurgency grows in strength .
As Western dissatisfaction with Karzai has grown over his failure to crack down on corruption and govern effectively , the Afghan president , facing elections next year , has hit back over the killing of dozens of civilians in foreign air strikes .
In recent weeks , Karzai has repeatedly blamed the West for the worsening security in Afghanistan , saying NATO failed to target Taliban and al Qaeda sanctuaries in Pakistan and calling for the war to be taken out of Afghan villages .
“ We have no other choice , we have no power to stop the planes , if we could , if I could ... we would stop them and bring them down , ” Karzai told a news conference .
He said that if he had something like the rock attached to a piece of string , known as a chelak in Dari , used to bring down kites in Afghanistan , he would use it .
“ If we had a chelak , we would throw it and stop the American aircraft .
We have no radar to stop them in the sky , we have no planes , ” he said .
“ I wish I could intercept the planes that are going to bomb Afghan villages , but that ’s not in my hands . ”
Afghanistan has suffered its worst violence this year since U.S. - led and Afghan forces overthrew the Taliban in 2001 , with at least 4,000 people killed , around a third of them civilians .
Despite the presence of 65,000 foreign troops backing 130,000 Afghan security forces , Taliban insurgents have grown increasingly confident in their traditional heartland in the south and east and have also extended their influence close to the capital , Kabul .

" Fish " Machine Turns Ocean Vibrations into Energy
November 24th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Tidal power is already on its way to becoming a viable energy source , but a University of Michigan engineer believes that slow - moving ocean and river currents could also be renewable energy providers .
The VIVACE ( Vortex Induced Vibrations for Aquatic Clean Energy ) machine is the first device that can harness water moving slower than 2 knots — a notable ability since most water currents move slower than 3 knots .
In contrast , turbines and water mills need 5 to 6 knots to operate .
VIVACE relies on vortex induced vibrations , or undulations that a rounded object makes in a flow of fluid .
The kinks in the current ’s speed caused by the object ’s presence causes eddies ( vortices ) to form on the opposite side of the object .
The vortices then push or pull the object perpendicular to the current .
According to developer Michael Bernitsas , VIVACE copies the natural movements of fish , which curve their bodies to glide between vortices created by the fish in front of them .
While the current version of VIVACE is a cylinder attached to springs , future versions will have a fish - like tail and scales .
Bernitsas believes that the machine ’s energy will cost about 5.5 cents per KWh — less than both wind and solar power .
The VIVACE pilot project will be deployed in the Detroit River within the next 18 months , and hopefully we ’ll see a commercialized version of the machine soon after .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The man who authorities allege carried out the 2001 anthrax mailings that killed five people sent himself an e-mail saying he knew the attacker 's identity , according to court documents released Wednesday .
Former biodefense researcher Bruce Ivins killed himself in July , authorities say .
Bruce Ivins , who authorities say killed himself in July as the Justice Department prepared to charge him in the anthrax case , is alleged to have sent the e-mail to himself last September .
An FBI agent quotes the message in an affidavit accompanying applications for search warrants for Ivins ' e-mail accounts .
" Yes !
Yes !
Yes !!!!!!!
I finally know who mailed the anthrax letters in the fall of 2001 .
I 've pieced it together !
Now we can finally get this over and done with , " the e-mail reads .
In it , the former biodefense researcher says he plans on turning information over to his lawyer and that his lawyer would then give it to authorities .
The e-mail does not say who Ivins believed was responsible .
" I 'm not looking forward to everybody getting dragged through the mud , but at least it will be over , " the e-mail reads .
" Finally !
I should have it TOTALLY nailed down within the month .
I should have been a private eye !!!! "
The documents -- which the Justice Department says are the last Ivins - related search warrants that had yet to be released to the public -- also contain new details about allegations that Ivins wanted to kill his co-workers .
Do n't Miss FBI director seeks outside review of anthrax investigation
The details are in an account of a July 9 group therapy session during which Ivins allegedly said he was a suspect in the anthrax investigation .
According to an FBI agent 's account , Ivins was " angry at the investigators , the government , and the system in general . "
" He said he was not going to face the death penalty , but instead had a plan to kill co-workers and other individuals who wronged him , " the account reads .
" He said he had a bullet - proof vest , and a list of co-workers , and added he was going to obtain a Glock firearm from his son within the next day , because federal agents are watching him and he could not obtain a weapon on his own . "
The FBI agent also alleges that Ivins said during the session that he had walked around the " ghetto " areas of Frederick , Maryland , near his home , late at night " hoping that someone would try to hurt him so that he could stab them with a sharp pen . "
That description is similar to something Ivins allegedly wrote on YouTube referencing a winner of the television game show " The Mole . "
Authorities said Ivins '
YouTube message read : " The least someone could do would be to take a sharp ballpoint pin or letter opener and put her eyes out , to complete the task of making her a true mole ! "
General details of the therapy session have previously been reported .
After the meeting , social worker Jean Duley contacted authorities and Ivins was taken into custody .
He was released after being evaluated at two hospitals .
Notes allegedly written by Ivins at the time of his hospitalization were found in the trash at his home after his death .
According to the FBI , he wrote about the stresses in his life and the possibility of facing prison time .
Ivins ' attorney , Paul Kemp , maintains Ivins did n't carry out the attacks and says the new documents prove nothing .
" There is simply nothing new here , nothing that is proof against Dr. Ivins , " Kemp said Wednesday .
The anthrax probe continues , Justice Department spokesman Dean Boyd said .
" We are working to close the investigation soon , " Boyd said , adding that " investigative efforts " and " administrative measures " need to be finished .
The anthrax attacks occurred less than a month after the September 11 , 2001 , suicide attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people in New York , Washington and Pennsylvania .
Letters filled with bacterial spores were sent to Senate Democratic leaders and news organizations .
Those who died were Washington postal workers , a New York hospital worker , a supermarket tabloid photo editor in Florida and a 94 - year - old woman in Connecticut .
Scientists from inside and outside the FBI said they traced a strain of anthrax from the envelopes and victims to a batch of anthrax in Ivins ' lab at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute in Fort Detrick , Maryland .

Wednesday , 22 Oct , 2008 Current Events
Wal - Mart Stores Inc. , an American public corporation , declared that the recent child sicknesses in China caused by over toxic milk products necessitate setting up new requirements for Chinese suppliers .
It is worth mentioning that the United Nations in their turn published a report that suggests China to improve its food safety system .
It also underlines that enterprises should bear the responsibility for the quality of their products .
Mike Duke , vice chairman of Wal - Mart 's international division said the company is looking for " greater transparency from our supplier partners " .
This means Chinese suppliers will have to submit detailed information including names and location about every business enterprise involved in production of goods sold by Wal - Mart .
This kind of cooperation should give the possibility to solve problems quickly and effectively .
As Duke said , new standards will be applied to apparel in the first place , after which they will be used on all the products .
Wal - Mart 's decision is well founded as there were several scandals concerning product safety violation which signals that China may lose its largest retailer if necessary measures are not taken .
Last year , the scandal arose because of high levels of industrial toxins detected in different products .
As for China , it is still recovering after a hideous disclosure when the chemical melamine which is usually used in production of plastics and fertilizers was found in baby food in order to increase nitrogen content and to sell it as a high - protein product .
This negligence caused four baby deaths and about 54,000 incidents of infantine diseases .
However , cases of contamination continued .
Poisonous substances were found in powered and liquid milk , yogurt and other products .
Safety hazard made several countries remove Chinese products made with milk from sale in order to test them for melamine .
Thousands of cribs manufactured in China were recalled after the deaths of two babies as it was suspected that these cribs did n't have safety pegs .
According to health experts , large quantities of melamine can give rise to formation of kidney stones and even cause kidney failure .
In its report , the United Nations paid attention to an integral food safety law that should be introduced in order to control the whole industry .
It recommended China to focus on high - risk areas of the food chain to avoid recontamination .
" The national system needs urgent review and revision , " U.N. Resident Coordinator in China Khalid Malik said .
The report said that China also needs an integrated regulatory authority as well as an agency providing people with reliable information .
Government officials said late Tuesday that in the southern Chinese territory of Macau three more children suffered from kidney stones .
Thus the total number of sick children makes seven now .
As it turned out , two girls consumed milk produced by Chinese dairy Yili Industrial Group Co .
It was confirmed that those products contained melamine .
According to the Agriculture Ministry , melamine was found in five egg products imported in South Korea from China .
As a result of this South Korea prohibited imports of the products .
The ministry as well as Drug Administration plan to collect and destroy the imported products .
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration reported that less than 2.5 parts per million of melamine can be harmful if detected in baby food .
It is interesting to note that only one of the five products in South Korea contained a portion higher than that level .

Relentless expense reductions at America ’s newspapers this year have failed to stay ahead of falling sales and uncontrollable fixed costs , eviscerating the industry ’s profitability and suggesting that more drastic cuts may lie ahead .
The average profitability of newspapers tumbled 18 ½ times faster than sales fell in the third quarter of this year , according to an analysis of a dozen companies that segment their financial statements in sufficient detail to isolate the performance of their newspaper divisions .
In a three - month period when advertising and circulation sales among the 12 publishers dropped by an average of 10.3 % from the prior year ’s level , the average operating profits of the group in the third quarter plunged by a staggering 198.3 % .
The term “ operating profits ” refers to what is commonly called EBITDA , a newspaper ’s earnings before interest , taxes , depreciation , amortization and one - time events like severance programs or accounting adjustments to write down the value of acquisitions that in retrospect are deemed to be overpriced .
The respective sales and earnings drops at each of the 12 companies are presented in the table below .
Click the image to read the fine print .
The steep plunge in profits suggests that the industry may have to be more aggressive at cutting expenses in the future , if it intends to either halt or reverse the earnings collapse .
The need would be seem to be particularly acute for the companies that borrowed heavily in recent years to finance acquisitions .
Because GateHouse Media , Journal Register , Lee Enterprises , McClatchy and Tribune Co. are committed to steadily increasing principal and interest payments to satisfy their debts , they would appear to be candidates for some of the most draconian expense cutting .
But they are not alone .
Heavy cutting may lie ahead , as well , for three companies that suffered not just earnings declines in the third period but outright losses .
They are A.H. Belo , whose operating loss of $ 12.8 million represented a 189.9 % drop in earnings from the same quarter in 2007 ; the newspaper division of the Washington Post Co. , which lost $ 10.6 million for a 220.6 % drop from the prior year , and the Sun - Times Media Group , which lost $ 7.8 million , representing a 1523.5 % decline from the prior year .
The losses at these three companies significantly skew the average earnings performance of the dozen companies covered in this analysis .
Even when you back out the trio's losses , however , the average drop in operating profits at the remaining nine companies is 51.8 % , or five times greater than the 10.3 % decline in sales .
Among the nine companies that did post operating profits in the quarter , several reported enormous drops in their margins .
EBITDA skidded 91.2 % at Tribune , 87.7 % at Journal Communications and 78.7 % at New York Times Co. Every publisher covered in this analysis has been cutting expenses throughout the year , concentrating notably on headcount and newsprint consumption .
In some markets , ad production , customer service , printing or delivery have been outsourced in the face of disintegrating ad sales and sharply rising costs for newsprint , energy and health care .
A few papers have eliminated print editions on some or all of the days of the week .
Other publishers are talking about shutting down newspapers altogether Notwithstanding these efforts , not one publisher in the group of 12 was able to prevent its profits from falling faster than its revenues .
As discussed previously here , many publishers until now had been more profitable than many Fortune 500 companies .
If the deteriorating economy leads to a further ad sales decline in the fourth quarter and beyond – which seems increasingly likely – publishers will have only two alternatives : Cutting significantly more expenses or accepting lower profitability .
With profits already seriously pinched , publishers may have no choice but to take up their hatchets before the year is out .
Zia ul - Haq : the Pakistani Dracula with the dead raccoon eyes .
Well , time to ease out of my chair and get back to work , because people have been yelling at me to finish off that “ Islamablog ” series I started about the hotel bomb in Islamabad .
I warned you it was going to be a sample of what real - time war - nerding is about , and this time , durn it , it turned to be about me getting frustrated with how many possible angles there were here .
I started to feel like it ’d be easier for me to make a short list of everybody who definitely did n’t have a reason to bomb the Islamabad Marriott instead of trying to decide which of the two zillion good reasons was responsible for the bombing .
In fact , why not ?
Here ’s my short list of who did n’t bomb the Marriott and why :
Lindsay Lohan , because she ’s happy with her DJ girlfriend and when she ain’t she ’s busy trying to get Michael Phelps ’s cell number .
That ’s what I do n’t get : did n’t somebody explain “ gay ” to this airhead ?
Ca n’t her butch DJ friend slap a little sense into her , whack her around a few times and lay out the rules , “ Oi , girlie , the first rule of lezz club is no bloody men , eh ? ”
No standards any more , that ’s what it is .
In my day , dykes were dykes , damn it .
OK , OK , we both know I ’m just procrastinating because — OK already !
I got bored with the hotel .
That ’s the real lesson , I guess : to be a serious war nerd you have to go down a lot of blind alleys , you have to research a lot of stuff that just does n’t cook up right , or not on time anyway .
Pakistan is shaking out right now , but it ’s not done yet .
It ’s not a damn microwave .
Most likely what happened at the Marriott was payback for some massacres on the border last month , but I ’d barely got that figured out when the leader of the Pakistan Taliban died — died a natural death , too , which is pretty disgraceful .
If there was anybody who should have had help collecting on his life insurance , it was this guy Baitullah Mehsud .
But no , he kicked it on his own .
Another fat guy with kidney trouble , like me .
Come to think of it , that ’s a much , much worse way to go than a Predator - launched TOW coming through your mud roof .
Compared to dying of kidney trouble , a TOW is like God ’s mercy with a rocket booster .
Pakistan is one of those places that wo n’t sit still long enough to write up .
When that neocon professor said history was finished , they should have made him do a year as visiting professor at Karachi U .
That would ’ve sobered him up fast .
History never gets done in Pakistan .
The whole country ’s a disaster .
One of those classic British - made disasters .
One thing I ’m learning in this business is the Brits messed up more places on this planet than anybody realizes , and somehow they got away with it .
That ’s what really amazes me about them , the way they got away with it .
They realized after WW II that their power was terminally broke , and decided to quit India before Gandhi took it away from them — because if you ’ve got any pride at all , losing to a little half - naked vegetarian who looks like the old “ Keep on truckin ’ ” cartoon is just not an acceptable outcome .
But the Brits wanted to be sure they had two states to play with , not just a single united India .
That was old colonial policy for them , and it worked time after time : set up two tribes that hate each other next to each other and let the games begin .
( They almost managed to do that to us in 1863 — if Gettysburg had gone the other way , I hate to think where we ’d be now . )
So Mountbatten ’s agents teased the Indian Muzzies into demanding their own religious state when British India broke up in 1947 , funded all the militant Muslim parties and set up the Muzzie leader Jinnah as equal partner to the Hindus .
Then they signed this ridiculous deal that made one country , “ Pakistan , ” out of two parts of British India that happened to have Muzzie majorities .
The two parts , “ West Pakistan ” and “ East Pakistan , ” were two thousand klicks apart , believe it or not — one was the old Punjab and the other way over against the Burmese border .
The most densely populated cities in India were between them .
And that was supposed to be one country .
Of course it did n’t work , “ East Pakistan ” turned into Bangladesh in 1971 and got itself crooned about by the other dead Beatle , George Harrison .
He got people to send lots of money so the Bangladeshis could fund more babies to pop out onto the sandbars and mud islands on a floodplain that they call home .
Wonderful , George .
Could n’t ’ cha’ve died a little sooner ?
Cuz that ’s what the world needs , more Bangladeshis .
Meanwhile , back in “ West Pakistan , ” which is now just plain Pakistan , there was plenty of history brewing up , so much that the Pakis did n’t have much time to cry over the loss of Bangladesh , if you can call it a loss .
There was all kinds of strife in the Punjab , and all of it is still going on .
Most of it was old hate between local tribes , but there was a new hate too : the hate between the Muslim immigrants who ’d poured across into Pakistan from Hindu India and the people who ’d always lived in the Punjab .
The thing that tickles me about this is the weird similarity to what was going on in Israel at just the same time : a huge bunch of immigrants landing in a just - created religious state and pissing off the people who were there before .
Funny how that was happening in the new Jewish state and the same thing was going on in this brand - new all - Muslim state .
Religion was supposed to be the glue that would hold Pakistan together , which is also a funny notion .
Religion is the best , most proven way to get people to kill each other in all of history .
Even the Buddhists have whacked heretics around now and then for not being kindly and passive enough .
“ You there , be nicer ( BASH ! )
Stop eating that chicken !
SMACK ! ” Just about the only people who do n’t have a long record of smacking unbelievers are the Hindus , and that ’s mainly because they ’ve got a smorgasbord religion that will swallow anything .
They see a bunch of new crazy beliefs coming , they do n’t feel threatened the way Christians or Muzzies do , they just start rubbing their bellies , “ Oh boy , all U can eat !
Order up some new clay fer statues , Ma , and go buy some new paint ! ”
Before the new Muslim immigrants , called “ Muhajir , ” arrived in the Punjab in 1947 , there were already feuding tribes there —
Hell , there ’s been constant war there since Alexander came through–and if you look under the headlines you ’ll see they ’re still there , still at it .
Southern Pakistan used to be called “ Sind , ” and the Sindhi are still the big tribe in the south .
One reason Benazir Bhutto got whacked is because she ’s Sindhi , from their big political royal family — the Bhuttos are like the Sindhi Kennedys , except she was the only goodlooking one .
( And she was , I ca n’t deny it , when Benazir was young she was a real looker , just google her circa 1980 and see for yourself . )
The Sindhi are Muslim , sure , but they ’re not insane the way the immigrant Muzzies were .
That ’s what happens when you invite all the crazy - ass Muzzie fanatics from all over the Indian subcontinent to settle in your nice sleepy ol ’
Punjab , you get a lot of crazies running stuff and pissing off the locals .
The Baluch , the desert tribe that had been living next door to the Sindhi , were n’t that thrilled with the newcomers either .
Benazir ’s husband , Asif Ali Zardari , is Baluch himself , and his marriage to Benazir was a classic medieval pact between two threatened tribes , kind of a common front against the immigrants .
The difference is that the Sindhi are semi-peaceful people , but the Baluch are classic big - turbaned desert marksmen .
There ’s a lively little Baluch insurgency going , keeping itself in the locals ’ good graces by picking off a Pakistani Army patrol now and then .
That ’s how guerrilla groups send their Christmas cards , you know , by picking off a squad or so every few months by way of saying , ‘ Do n’t forget us , y’all ! ”
They ca n’t do much more because the Muhajir immigrants and their Punjabi allies have the old tribes way , way outnumbered .
Worse yet , a lot of them were city people who had a huge advantage over the sleepy local tribes , the Sindhi and Baluch .
( Another way it was weirdly like the Israelis , who were mostly educated , Western city people vs. sleepy Palestinian farmers . )
The wild card is the Pashtun , who live in northwest Pakistan and southern Afghanistan .
The Pashtun are trouble , period : always have been and always will be .
Boy - raping , women - hating , war - loving maniacs .
In fact I always think that if my good friend Victor Davis Hanson really wanted to see what life was like in his precious little ancient Greece he should go live with the Pashtuns for a while , as long as he could last anyway .
They ’re really “ classical values ” types , selling girls like cattle and making lovey - dovey eyes at little boys when they ’re not looting the nextdoor village .
For the first twenty years of Pakistan ’s history the Pashtun were the hillbillies , but just like the USA , they ended up taking center stage .
And in almost exactly the same way , too : because some Karl Rove genius figured out how easy it is to lead ultra-religious hicks by the nose if you talk about God , or Allah , all the time .
The guys running Pakistan do n’t really believe in Allah ; they believe in money and torture , that ’s about it .
But the Pashtun still take all that Allah crap seriously , and since Pakistan ’s supposed to be this pure Islamic state ( “ Pakistan , ” believe it or not , means “ land of the pure ” — seriously !
Most corrupt evil place on earth and that ’s what it means ! ) , stirring up the Pashtun hicks is as easy as saying “ Allahu akbar ! ”
It ’s as simple as going down to Alabama and saying “ Jesus loves the USA ! ”
The guy who made that his winning formula was General Zia ul Haq .
He ’s a real candidate for nastiest critter ever to slide over the earth .
I mean , yikes .
He even looked like some bad alien had slid into his nostrils , had those dead raccoon eyes and Dracula mustache .
Zia “ Islamized ” Pakistan .
As if it was n’t Islamic enough already , like way too Islamic .
It was like a crackhead showing up in rehab and the doctor screeching , “ What this man is suffering from is a lack of free crack !
Give him crack , stat ! ”
That was Zia ’s version of “ Pakistan : ER ” : “ Give this Islamic state more Islam until Koranic scraps come out of its ears , stat ! ”
There were a few hundred madrassa , aka “ suicide bomber academies ” in Pakistan when Zia took over in 1977 .
By the time he died in a plane crash in 1988 , there were four thousand of these malignant little tumors all over the country .
That suited the CIA fine , at first , because — well , because they ’re idiots , mainly — but also because , after 1979 Zia ’s intel service , the ISI , and the CIA were best buds , shipping weapons into Afghanistan and opium out to fund the Pashtun groups fighting the Russians .
Nobody had the sense to see that the Russians were on their last legs , whereas the Muzzies were just getting all godzilla ’d up .
Ever hear of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar ?
Total nutcase , Pashtun leader , and the answer to your question , “ Where did my tax dollars go during the Reagan years ? ”
Zia was a classic representative of the insane Muhajir elite , and his enemies were the leaders of the not - as - totally - insane “ native ” groups , the Sindhi and the Baluch .
Their top leader was Benazir Bhutto ’s father , ex -Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto .
The Bhuttos are n’t just Sindhi , they ’re also guilty of being Shia , which drives the Sunni Muhajir loonies even loonier .
So that made Benazir ’s dad the root of all evil to a pious Muzzie like Zia .
And that ’s why Zia had Bhutto senior hanged in1979 , just as the campaign to heat up the Pashtuns along the Afghan border was picking up steam .
Fastforward through a whoooooooole lotta blood and assassinations to December 2007 and Bhutto ’s daughter Benazir is back in town after all kinds of ups and downs , campaigning for office saying she ’ll take Pakistan on a slightly - less - insane tack , be slightly - less - loony about Islam , and slightly - less - whacko about women showing themselves outside the crib…and whaddaya know , some updated version of Zia , same mustache even , I ’d bet , whacks her while she ’s waving to the crowd in Rawalpindi , which just happens to be the most Muhajir , most Islamic town in the country , the real Selma Alabama of Muhajir / Jihadi looniness .
And durn it , even that wo n’t discourage these pesky people , because next thing you know her Baluch husband Zardari is in power , talking about clamping down on those extremist jihadis — and wham , a few hours later the Marriott blows up .
That ’s what I mean , see : Pakistan never changes but it ’s always updating , never getting any better but always updating , like Windows with minarets .
Makes it damn hard for a War Nerd to get settled in and take his time with a story .
You can start just about any time going back in history to explain why the Marriott blew up , see .
I decided for simplicity ’s sake to start with the Pakistan / India split in 1947 in this column but damn , I ’ve been reading Indian history from the 1700s and there were about a half dozen bloody decisive battles between the Muslims and the Hindu Maratha and the newcomer Brits just in the 1750s and 1760s alone — even back then the Brits were perfecting their technique , playing Hindu-vs . - Muslim games .
Oh , and the Persians were knee - deep in it too — ca n’t forget the Persians .
I ’m telling you , God damn , it just wo n’t stop .
So really , when you talk about why things are heating up in the Punjab now , the real history - based answer is , what heating - up ?
This is a slow news day by Punjab standards .

Kris Kuksi in His Kansas Art Studio
Kris Kuksi : The Art of the Grotesque
Kris Kuksi is a Kansas artist who quite obviously has an extremely strong distaste for the stereotypical images of American life and pop culture , feeling that he has instead always belonged to the “ Old World . ”
His “ grotesque ” works of art are about a new wilderness , refined and elevated , visualized as a cultivation emerging from the corrupt and demoralized fall of modern - day society .
Kuksi’s art conjures up places where new beginnings , new wars , new philosophies , and new endings exist .
Kuksi feels that in the world today , much of mankind is too often comprised of merely frivolous and fragile beings driven primarily by greed and materialism .
His twisted and distorted art is aimed at exposing the fallacies of contemporary man , which he hopes might suggest a new order of awareness to the viewer .
Kuksi ’s work has received several awards and prizes and has been featured in over 100 exhibitions in galleries and museums worldwide , including at the Smithsonian ’s National Portrait Gallery .
His art can also be seen in a number of international art magazines , book covers and theatrical posters .
Kris ’ art is featured in both public and private collections in the United States , Europe and Australia .

Rev. Arnold Conrad , in delivering an invocation at a rally today for John McCain in Davenport , Iowa , apparently did n't get the word from the candidate about elevating the tone at such gatherings .
Conrad , who appeared before the crowd before McCain had arrived , offered a prayer that seemed to urge divine intervention to prevent Barack Obama from winning the presidential election -- and cast the outcome as a referendum on differing religions .
The Times ' Maeve Reston was at the event , and she passed along the key passage from Conrad 's words :
I would also pray Lord that your reputation is involved in all that happens between now and November , because there are millions of people around this world praying to their God -- whether it 's Hindu , Buddha , Allah -- that his [ McCain ’s ] opponent wins for a variety of reasons .
And Lord I pray that you would guard your own reputation , because they ’re going to think that their god is bigger than you , if that happens .
So I pray that you would step forward and honor your own name in all that happens between now and Election Day .
Oh Lord , we just commit this time to you , move among us , make your presence very well felt as we are gathered here today in Jesus 's name I pray .
Some in the crowd greeted the prayer with applause .

Theora Codec is Finalized -- Could Have a Big Impact on Video
by Ostatic Staff - Nov. 05 , 2008
Related Blog Posts 8 Free , Open Source Tools for Video Playback and Encoding
As ZDNet is reporting , the open source Ogg Theora video codec has completed its beta phase and is available in an official version 1.0 .
On2 Technologies is the commercial player behind this , and the Xiph Foundation drives the open source effort .
" Theora is a video codec with a small CPU footprint that offers easy portability and requires no patent royalties , " says a statement from Xiph ( you 'll find the download links there too ) .
Here 's why this matters .
Theora is actually much more widely used than many people realize .
Upcoming releases of Mozilla Firefox and the Opera browser will support it natively , and Wikipedia uses Theora for all of its video .
It 's very much an open source darling , and we 've really liked the Mac version of Simple Theora Encoder , as Lisa discussed here .
An official version 1.0 of the Theora codec is a signal that the codebase is stable and ready for adoption in many more projects .
Theora is capable at this point of single - pass encoding and decoding at multiple bitrates .
Also as ZDNet points out :
" Since the codec is unencumbered by royalties , it can be offered as a W3C standard , bringing video inside the Web standards world without relying on a plug - in .
It also means you can plug a DVD player into a Linux box and support a codec with the same basic license structure as the operating system . "
Video and media playback issues have long been a sore spot for Linux users , so this bodes well .
It 's also notable that two of the top browsers out there will support this codec natively .
I wo n't be surprised to see Google Chrome follow suit , and I expect Theora to have a pronounced impact on the growing world of online video .
Because I would never want anyone to get all over my case for wearing an Obama shirt ( Which I WOULD wear if he'd ever ship the damn thing to me thankyouverymuch ) , I think it is only fair to allow her to wear whatever shirt she wants to .
Kids can be affected by opinions though .
I distinctly remember my fifth grade teacher telling me that a woman could never be president .
I went home and asked my mom about it , thinking there were laws in place that did n't allow women to be president .
My mom lost her mind .
She tried so hard to get that teacher fired .
That was many , many years ago - but I still remember it like it was yesterday .
Examples of the manipulated faces used in the experiment .
The images on the left are masculinised , the ones on the right are feminised ( Image : Benedict Jones )
Everyone loves a pretty face – except those women who might see it as a threat .
With eyes on the competition , women of childbearing age rate other attractive women consistently lower than women who have entered menopause , according to a new study .
“ It ’s almost as if they ’re putting down other attractive women , ” says Benedict Jones , a psychologist at Aberdeen University , UK , who led the study of 97 middle - aged women .
Numerous studies have looked at how fertility affects women ’s preferences for men ’s faces , bodies , voices , and even sweaty shirts .
Yet few researchers have flipped the coin to examine how fertility changes competition for mates within sexes , says Jones .

He and his colleagues showed pre- and post - menopausal women pictures of men and women , digitally manipulated to make them more masculine or more feminine looking .
Their software systematically enhances male features such as a wide jaw and heavy brow or female attributes such as wider eyes and more arched eyebrows .
“ It ’s not going into Photoshop and mucking about to make the jaw a few pixels wider and the eyes a few pixels bigger , ” he says .
Try a simplified version of the image software here
Mating drive
The women , who ranged between 40 and 64 years of age , then picked between the masculinised and feminised versions of 40 males and females .
No matter their menopausal status , women favoured masculine - looking men .
Yet when rating other women , women still able to have children rated feminine faces as slightly less attractive than menopausal women .
Competition between fertile women seems like the best explanation , Jones says .
“ It ’s quite well established that as women go through menopause they shift from a mating - oriented mindset to more family - oriented mindset , ” he says .
“ I think it ’s a good first step , ” says Mark Prokosch , an evolutionary psychologist at Elon University in North Carolina .
However , he is n’t yet convinced that rating other women is the best way to capture sexual competition between women .
“ It ’s still a question of whether rating a face as being less attractive equates to this heightened sense of competition , ” he says .

The inmate hid in a cardboard box and was taken out of the prison by courier A manhunt is under way in western Germany for a convicted drug dealer who escaped by mailing himself out of jail .
The 42 - year - old Turkish citizen - who was serving a seven - year sentence - had been making stationery with other prisoners destined for the shops .
At the end of his shift , the inmate climbed into a cardboard box and was taken out of prison by express courier .
His whereabouts are still unknown .
The chief warden of the jail told the BBC this was an embarrassing incident .
The prison authorities in Willich , near Duesseldorf , said the man , who was tall and broad - shouldered , had hidden in a box that was about 150 cm by 120 cm .
For years I had been asking for more security guards from the government - but now they 'll have to listen
Chief warden Beate Peters
When the weekly express courier arrived to pick up several boxes of merchandise , the one containing the prisoner was also loaded into the back of the lorry .
Shortly after it had passed through the prison gates , the inmate made his dash for freedom by cutting a big hole in the tarpaulin of the lorry and jumping off .
The driver alerted the police after he noticed the tarpaulin flapping in the breeze .
Lying low
The jail 's chief warden , Beate Peters , said the man must have had accomplices outside the prison .
" As soon as the prisoner jumped off the back of the lorry his friends would have picked him up , " she told the BBC .
" We have no idea where the fugitive is hiding .
We assume that he is still in the county and is lying low before making his move . "
Ms Peters said fellow convicts must also have known of his plan but that they would not talk because of a " code of honour " and because it is a criminal offence in Germany to help somebody escape from jail .
She said the incident showed that security needed to be beefed up urgently , something she had been lobbying for in the last few years .
" I was not surprised that an escape happened on my watch .
For years I had been asking for more security guards from the government .
But now they 'll have to listen . "

A little more than a year ago , I sat down with the CEO of what used to be a $ 1 billion company -- a well - known business that I can almost guarantee you 've heard of .
Here are some of the highlights of the conversation :
" We have to invest year after year to maintain our competitive advantage . "
Ouch .
" There 's little that we do that no one else can do . "
Are you kidding ?
" We continually have to adjust for some kind of ' vaporization ' effect with respect to our write - offs . "
Agghhhh ! %$ ) ( @ no !
Out of journalistic considerations , I can't tell you the name of the stock .
But the simple truth is that since the interview , shares have dropped 80 % anyway -- so people are definitely getting the picture .
Dime a dozen
You might be able to find the stock if you looked hard enough .
Actually , you could probably find dozens more in a similar predicament .
While I thought the exec honorable for his candid truth telling -- a big plus in my book -- it 's not good enough for any investment of mine .
The point here is universal :
If the person I interviewed sounds anything even remotely like the CEO of a company in your portfolio , dump that stock .
Now .
A lasting competitive advantage is a vital element of a great business .
Without it , a company 's brief edge in sales or technology or whatever will disintegrate like a finely built sand castle on the beach .
Remember when all your Internet search needs were handled by access providers like Time Warner 's ( NYSE : TWX ) AOL ?
Soon , enhanced search engines popped up like metacrawler , ask.com , and Yahoo ! ( NASDAQ : YHOO ) .
Eventually , Google came in to steal the show -- and that was only a few years ago .
You see , this is a business in constant flux .
None of these companies has consistently held a significant defensive moat .
The point here ?
Once consumers are able to identify a superior product , nothing stops them from flocking to it .
Even successful foreign search properties like Baidu.com ( NASDAQ : BIDU ) -- despite their massive user bases -- will have to address this fundamental problem at some point , if they want to be long - term players .
A deadly trap
No matter how good a product or a service is , if it can be replicated by others , it 's not worth much .
In time , competitors will squeeze margins , batter revenue growth , and produce a red ocean of competition .
The company will need to invest more and more each year , only to receive a smaller piece of the earnings pie in return .
That 's precisely why a company like Intuitive Surgical has delivered greater - than - 700 % gains in the past five years .
No one is even close to replicating the company 's Da Vinci technology .
And it explains why companies like Boeing ( NYSE : BA ) and Airbus continually fight an expensive battle for market share and industry supremacy .
Clearly , the whole mystery of large - scale flight is n't stumping too many engineers -- so the secret to success for them these days includes squeezing margins as much as possible , and seizing lucrative contracts .
That puts a lot of pressure on a business model .
Instead , examine businesses like Walt Disney ( NYSE : DIS ) and Johnson and Johnson , which own incredibly valuable intellectual property that consumers clamor for , generation after generation .
Assets like these create significant defenses against lower - cost producers and upstarts new to an industry .
Investing legends will tell you the same thing .
Among others , Warren Buffett has made billions identifying companies that leverage products or brands whose edge was not in danger .
UnitedHealth ( NYSE : UNH ) and Washington Post ( NYSE : WPO ) come to mind specifically .
Buffett 's track record confirms that looking for these types of businesses is a fundamental characteristic of a successful long - term investment .
Back to the horror story
I knew going into the CEO interview that I did n't really like the company 's position in the industry .
So when I got a sense that he was willing to talk , I pushed harder .
I asked him whether the company had any kind of ringer in the pipeline -- perhaps a blockbuster project in one important segment that investors could look forward to .
His response ?
" There 's no killer application . "
Man .
Sell this stock .
The Foolish bottom line
If you own shares of a company that has no real barriers to hungry competition , and it does n't have anything in the works for the future , then what do you have ?
Not that much , really .
Instead , focus on the companies that do .

Author : Murdoch ' absolutely despises ' the ' bullying ' Bill O'Reilly Muriel Kane
Published : Friday November 28 , 2008
Print This Email This A new book about media mogul Rupert Murdoch , whose News Corp. owns Fox News , is to be released next week .
Its most sensational revelations involve what the author describes as Murdoch 's loathing for leading Fox commentator Bill O'Reilly .
Politico received a pre-publication copy of Michael Wolff's The Man Who Owns the News and reported on Friday that Murdoch is not only embarrassed at times by his ownership of Fox News , but that he " absolutely despises " O'Reilly , who is that network 's top-rated personality .
" The embarrassment can no longer be missed , " Wolff writes of Murdoch .
" He barely pretends to hide the way he feels about Bill OReilly .
And while it is not that he would give Fox up -- because the money is the money ; success trumps all -- in the larger sense of who he is , he seems to want to hedge his bets . "
Wolff adds that Fox CEO Roger Ailes shares Murdoch 's opinion .
" It is not just Murdoch ( and everybody else at News Corp. s highest levels ) who absolutely despises Bill OReilly , the bullying , mean - spirited , and hugely successful evening commentator , but Roger Ailes himself who loathes him .
Success , however , has cemented everyone to each other . "
According to Wolff , Murdoch 's desire not to be defined solely by his ownership of Fox underlay his purchase last year of the Wall Street Journal , which " was in no small way about wanting to trade the illiberal -- the belligerent , the vulgar , the loud , the menacing the unsubtle -- for the better - heeled , the more magnanimous , the further nuanced . "
The 77 year old Murdoch , who is generally viewed as conservative but not ideological , has made a few surprising moves recently , including a highly visible truce last summer with the Obama campaign .
But when Wolff went so far as to suggest -- in an article published in October 's Vanity Fair -- that " Rupert Murdoch is becoming a liberal -- sort of , " Murdoch grumpily denied any such thing .
Wolff comments , " He was nt a liberal !
Who said that ?
He was , stubbornly , what he wanted to be , what he decided he would be . "

See , we told you not to get too excited .
The first state exit polls have crossed our transom and they look like Obama 's margins are tighter than recent polling in key states Pennsylvania , Virginia , North Carolina and Florida .
So hold your breath .
The US government is sending $ 1 billion to “ rebuild ” Georgia  no , not the Georgia located in the southern United States , where home foreclosure rates are double the national average , but the one located in the Caucasus , along Russia ’s southern frontier , where the President of the country launched a reckless invasion of a rebellious province , murdered thousands , and got his ass kicked by the rebels and their Russian protectors .
Now we ’re sending him a billion dollars  by way of a reward .
Meeting in Brussels , Western donors pledged “ more than $ 1 billion more than the World Bank ’s target . ”
The announcement , as reported by the New York Times , “ came as a financial crisis rattled the economies of donor nations .
The United States pledged the largest amount , $ 1 billion over three years .
An additional $ 642.8 million will be allocated by the European Commission over the next two years .
Jose Manuel Barroso , the president of the European Commission , said the pledge should send  a strong signal to the world ’ that its members stand with Georgia .
 The international community believes in and upholds certain values and norms of conduct , and those include the peaceful resolution of disputes , ’ Mr. Barroso said . ”
Who is sending a signal to whom  and for what purpose ?
On the surface , none of this makes any sense .
To begin with , all the damage to civilians and infrastructure was done by the Georgians .
They bombed the city of Tskhinvali , capital of the rebel province of South Ossetia , destroying the city center , killing thousands , and rendering many thousands more homeless .
Rebuild Georgia ?
It ’s the Ossetians who need the rebuilding  not that anything or anyone on this earth can rebuild their broken lives .
This is one humanitarian catastrophe that has gone completely unacknowledged in the West : indeed , justice is not only denied , but inverted : the Georgians , the villains in this instance , are being sent the aid .
Sounds like an incentive to commit yet more aggression  not that Saakashvili needs any encouragement .
He refuses to include the Ossetians or the rebel Abkhazians in any negotiations , and his government has broken off meetings with the Russians over the terms of a peace accord .
Faced with protests over his increasingly authoritarian rule , as well as a backlash against his hot - headed recklessness in starting the war to begin with , the region ’s star “ democrat ” and staunch US ally is even now maneuvering to launch yet another provocation against Moscow .
It would be a welcome diversion from his growing internal problem .
With the West and much of the world undergoing a financial paroxysm of unprecedented proportions , what in the name of all that ’s holy are we doing sending a billion bucks to some godforsaken ex-Soviet republic on the edge of nowhere ?
The Europeans are sinking , too , and yet they ’re chipping in .
What ’s the story ?
The signal that is being sent here , both by the US and Europe , is that we will fight , if necessary , to extend Western influence into the Caucasus .
The gauntlet is thrown  and Putin is sure to pick it up .
Some of the Europeans may be a little skeptical of admitting Georgia ( and Ukraine ) into NATO , but the US government and its European allies are giving the Georgian government unconditional support in its ongoing efforts to confront the Russians in their own “ near abroad . ”
The Russians , for their part , are acting much as we did when the French  still suffering from the aftereffects of the French Revolution in its Napoleonic phase set up Maximilian I as “ Emperor ” of Mexico and threatened to extend their sphere of influence north of the Rio Grande .
This signal of support for Tbilisi is for the benefit not only of the Russians , and the Georgian government , but is also meant to reassure big Western investors who have already poured billions into the lucrative Ceyhan - Tbilisi - Baku oil pipeline , which is competing with the Russians in transporting oil from the central Asian stans to the European market .
The Western oil giants , locked out of the Russian market by Putin , are desperate to outflank the Russkies and bypass Middle Eastern suppliers .
Billions in profits hang in the balance .
The CTB pipeline is yet another investment that is threatening to go south , bigtime , as regional tensions threaten to disrupt the free flow of oil over the troubled lands it snakes through .
Like AIG , Bear - Stearns , and the rest of the lords of Wall Street , this concern is “ too big to fail , ” and you can bet that the US government will take every possible action  including military action  to protect the banks who are underwriting the project .
As the response of Western governments to the financial meltdown makes all too clear , here in the West we have socialism for investment bankers and their partners - in - crime , and “ free enterprise ” for the rest of us , who work hard , pay taxes , and live by the rules .
Oh , but not to worry : they ’re rebuilding Georgia  with your tax dollars .
The costs are socialized , and the profits are privatized  that ’s what they call “ democratic capitalism , ” or , in Europe , “ social democracy . ”
In both cases , foreign policy is merely an overseas projection of domestic political arrangements .
In detailing how the aid money is going to be spent , the Times ‘ reporting on the donors ’ powwow implicitly rationalizes the expenditure :
“ After hostilities broke out on Aug. 7 , transportation routes from Georgia ’s main Black Sea port were cut off , and dozens of importers defaulted on contracts .
The stock market plummeted , and Georgians made a run on banks , wiping out $ 165 million in deposits at the Bank of Georgia .
The country ’s scenic Black Sea resorts , once popular with Russians , sit largely empty . ”
Hefty costs , but who ought to pay ?
Why , the perpetrator of the violence , namely Mikhel Saakashvili .
Instead , he ’s being sent a big fat check .
Welcome to the Bizarro World of American foreign policy .
As Mark Ames points out in The Nation , the evil - authoritarian - Russia - attacked - poor - little - democratic - Georgia narrative has been completely debunked  check out Der Spiegel ‘s “ Did Saakashvili Lie ? ” ( short answer : yes ) .
As Antiwar.com reported as the crisis broke out , and subsequent reports confirm , the evidence is indisputable that the Georgians attacked the Russians first , killing over a dozen Russian peacekeepers legally stationed in South Ossetia in the course of a massive and deadly assault on the Ossetian capital .
Not that the Western media , so easily manipulated by Georgia ’s amen corner , is acknowledging their initial “ error , ” as Ames notes .
“ Ever since I went down to South Ossetia to see the war for myself , I ’d developed a kind of sick curiosity to see just how the Times and all the others were going to extricate themselves from the credibility - hole they ’d dug .
I had a feeling it was going to come , because Saakashvili was not only a blatant liar but an incredibly bad liar .
I was in South Ossetia at the close of the war  I saw the destruction that the  freedom - loving ’
Georgians wreaked , and the bloated , rotting corpses on the streets of the province ’s capital city , Tskhinvali  so I was particularly interested in how long the sleazy tale of good vs. evil would last , and how the major media would squirm their way out of their biggest journalistic fiasco since the Iraqi - WMD blooper .
Would the Times let their ombudsman out of the cage for another fake apology ?
 Oops !
Who ’da thunk our esteemed newspaper coulda screwed up this big twice in a row , dragging America into yet another war all on account of our inability to do our job as journalists ?!
Look , we just want to say we ’re sorry and move on , m’kay ?
So , have you moved on yet ?
Because we have ’. ”
The lies spread by the mainstream media in the service of the War Party are bought and paid for by the corporate sponsors of the Russia encirclement project that has been the linchpin of our adversarial stance toward Moscow since Yeltsin ’s demise and Putin ’s rise .
Having failed to pulverize the shattered Soviet colossus into the smallest possible splinters , the Western powers are now confronted with what they regard as a “ resurgent ” and inevitably revanchist Russia  which means that the Russians are no longer dirt poor and ruled by gangsters with American bank accounts .
It also means they are n’t going to be pushed around in their own back yard  at least not without putting up a heckuva fight .
Whether South Ossetia is Georgian , Russian , or none of the above  why is this any of our business ?
Who among us is qualified to untangle the interwoven threads of claims and counter - claims , extending back over hundreds of years , and come up with a just solution to the question of what constitutes Georgian “ sovereignty ” ?
Certainly no one who works for the US government .
Before one penny of “ aid ” is sent to Georgia , we should be asking : who will get this money ?
The Times gives us a breakdown :
“ The World Bank had estimated that Georgia would need $ 3.25 billion “ to cover budget support , social sector support and infrastructure development . ”
Most of the aid , roughly $ 3.7 billion , will go to social and construction programs .
An additional $ 850 million will be invested in the private sector , where donors hope it will offset the sharp drop in foreign direct investment . ”
None of this money is going to South Ossetia : it is all being funneled through Saakashvili and his cronies , who would rather leave the shattered infrastructure of bombed - out Tskhinvali as it is today , a stark reminder of what may very well reoccur should the Ossetians persist in going their own way .
If anyone rebuilds , it will have to be the Russians .
The private sector aid will be used to buy up Georgian assets on behalf of Western corporate interests .
The difference between the World Bank figure and the number announced in Brussels  nearly half a billion  will cover bribes , covert action operations carried out by Western intelligence agencies , and other incidentals .
When challenged , proponents of foreign aid programs invariably reply : yes , but look at the minuscule numbers !
Why , foreign aid is less than one percent of the total overseas budget , including , one supposes , military expenditures  but so what ?
The point is that these programs do real harm , in most cases achieving the exact opposite of their intended purpose .
And in this particular case , the entire package is premised on a lie , and a freshly debunked one at that .
What ’s really going on here is that the West is rewarding Saakashvili for his recklessness , and inciting him to commit fresh assaults .
This course guarantees war .
Despite having only a 2 megapixel camera , the iPhone continues to be the most popular cameraphone used on Flickr .
Yeah yeah , we all know that the iPhone camera does n’t have the ability to zoom or autofocus , and that other cameraphones might shoot in higher quality , but that has n’t stopped iPhone users from snapping away to their hearts content .
October 2008
As you can see , the Nokia N95 , with its 5 megapixel camera , seems to be stagnating as the iPhone continues its climb .
But things were more closely matched even as recently as this past August .
August 2008
And here were the most popular camera phones on Flickr in May of 2008 .
Keep in mind that this data does n’t indicate that the iPhone is the best or even necessarily the most used cameraphone out on the market .
It could very well be that a disproportionate number of Flickr users happen to use iPhones .
Another factor behind the data could be the ease with which iPhone users can automatically send their photos to Flickr .
Critics like to harp on the fact that the iPhone camera is n’t up to par with other cameraphones on the market , but they do n’t realize that when it comes to taking important quality photos , the majority of consumers would never dream of using a cameraphone in the first place .
Cameraphones are mostly used for quick snapshots where ease of use and convenience are more important than the ability to zoom in , for example .
People who are serious about capturing events in high photo quality use dedicated cameras .
But for everyone else who just wants to take quick pictures of people on the street , protest marches , and shots of New York City at night , the iPhone seems to work just fine .
About these graphs ( Via Flickr ) :
These graphs show the number of Flickr members who have uploaded at least one photo or video with a particular camera on a given day over the last year .
The graphs are “ normalized ” , which is a fancy way of saying that they automatically correct for the fact that more people join Flickr each day : the graph moving up or down indicates a change in the camera ’s popularity relative to all other cameras used by Flickr members .
There are only five things of significance about the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 ( EESA ) , in my opinion ( although we do not yet have the final version ) :
Drafted in haste , it will have many and serious unintended consequences .
Its provisions are largely irrelevant to our economic problems , intended to treat the symptoms .
Our leaders have no “ plan B ” ; this is a “ hail Mary ” pass .
The economic impact will be minor , or even less than minor .
The next program ( EESA - 2009 ? ) , taken by the new Administration after another 4 + months of weakening , will be the first important response to this crisis .
The government ’s responses so far to this crisis are like beads on a string ; each larger than the one before it — but all broadly similar .
Government approval for fraudulent accounting , to hide the extent of the problem ( Section 128 , suspending market pricing of assets ) .
Happy talk — do you remember the Treasury ’s Hope Now alliance , in October 2007 ?
Cheap financing and bailouts for injured financial institutions .
The goal of this plan — assuming that there is in fact a plan behind this , and not just ad hoc grasping at straws — is probably to buy time for the economy ’s natural mechanisms to work .
Unfortunately this misunderstands the key aspects of our situation :
The scale of the problem , the post - WWII debt supercycle , and Time is our enemy , as the global economy slows and the US economy slides into what looks like a severe recession .
A sufficiently large solution requires an agreement with our foreign creditors .
The last is the key to understanding our government ’s actions .
They do not want to open such negotiations , hence can take only small actions buttressed by “ Rube Goldberg ” financial machinations .
We cannot pay our current debts and need sums far larger than our currently massive borrowing .
This requires an agreement with our creditors to do the following :
extend the maturity of our current loans , rather than just rolling them over and over , provide large loans to fund both our current account deficit ( running at 4 - 5 % of GDP ) and the needed restructuring costs ( this and the next EESA , plus large fiscal deficit during the recession ) , provided at low interest rates ( or eventual payment becomes impossible ) , with the first payments due in 3 – 5 years .
This will end our pretensions to be a global hegemon .
Plus , our creditors will want concessions .
For example , China will want a sphere of influence that includes Taiwan .
Precedents in US History
America has had four major financial events .
The government successful responded twice , and failed twice .
(1) Alexander Hamilton convinced the Founders to honor the revolutionary war debts , and successful arranged the means to do so .
(2) FDR ’s New Deal mitigated the effects of the Great Depression , but failed to end it .
His solution was to end gold convertibility for US citizens , and greatly expand both government spending and regulation .
After a bounce , the economy slid back down in 1938 .
The Depression was ended by WWII .
(3) Johnson ’s “ guns and butter ” over - spending resulted in collapse of the Bretton Woods system .
Nixon ’s solution was to end gold convertibility for other nations , and increase government regulation and spending .
Some examples : price controls , affirmative action ( the Philadelphia Plan ) , the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( OSHA ) .
He proposed , but the Democratic Congress refused to approve , national health care and a national minimum income ( the Family Assistance Plan ) .
These measures stabilized the economy for a few years , although at the cost of rising inflation — leading to the next crisis .
(4) Fed Chairman Volcker plus Presidents Carter and Reagan responded to the accelerating decline of the US economy by forced restructuring ( high rates , the 1980 - 82 recession ) plus far - reaching deregulation .
This resulted in a quarter - century of economic growth with decreasing inflation .
The fifth crisis
This forms a break with previous US history , as we can not solve it alone .
Years of insane financial management have left us
addicted to foreign borrowing , which we cannot suddenly stop without severe withdrawal pains , and
over - indebted , unable to resolve our problems without foreign assistance .
Leaders with steady hands and clear minds can steer us out of this storm .
Our job is to elect the right people and support their actions ( including criticism where deserved ) .
Prayer might also help .

A few of the most important posts warning about this crisis
This crisis has long been forecast by many , including in articles on this site .
Even now that we are in the whirlwind , these provide valuable background material on its causes — and speculation about the results .

Here are some of those posts .
The real downside of the green - profit narrative has been that it created the assumption in many people ’s minds that the solution to climate change and other environmental dilemmas is technical , and that policy makers and industrialists will implement it for us , so that the way we live does n’t need to change in any fundamental way .
That ’s never been true .

Could Melting Ice Caps Reduce Global Warming ?
September 11th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
New Scientist reports a controversial study that melting ice caps could actually weaken the greenhouse effect .
Stanford University scientists studied satellite data from 1998 to 2007 to evaluate changes in sea surface temperatures and quantities of sea ice and phytoplankton ( increased phytoplankton activity removes atmospheric carbon ) .
What they found is startling — phytoplankton grew more in areas where ice was disappearing .
Essentially , the melting northern polar ice cap is opening up a new carbon sink that can soak up carbon dioxide .
Right now , however , the sink is only able to account for 0.7 percent of our total annual carbon emissions .
For productivity to rise further , more nutrients need to be brought to the Arctic surface waters .
But this is unlikely — the arctic does n’t contain many surface water nutrients .
While melting ice caps may mean a slight reduction in greenhouse gases , they also mean a drastic change in the Arctic food chain .
And we may not care about atmospheric CO2 levels if our cities are flooded due to climate change .
So even if melting ice caps have a slight silver lining , we should n’t necessarily encourage their demise .

Associated Press
October 8 , 2008
NEW YORK ( AP ) — Wall Street extended its huge decline Wednesday as an emergency interest rate cut failed to alleviate investors ’ fears that the paralysis in the credit markets will set off a global recession .
The Dow Jones industrials , already down 875 points this week , fell another 200 , and all the major indexes were down sharply .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The rate cut by the Federal Reserve and other leading central banks failed to convince investors that credit markets would soon relax and that banks would begin lending more freely to businesses and consumers .
The Fed lowered rates by a half - point , saying in a statement that the turmoil in financial markets posed a further threat to an already shaky economy ; it was joined in the rate cut by the European Central Bank , Bank of England , The Bank of Canada , the Swedish Riksbank and the Swiss National Bank .
But interest rate changes take months to work their way through the economy , and while investors clearly were happy with the central banks ’ actions , they were also well aware that in the near term , banks remain reluctant to lend because of fears they wo n’t be paid back .

Note :
All the circuits described in this article must be used for experimental purposes only and must not be used for any illegal activity .
These circuits are very powerful , in that they are very hard to detect and will pick - up the slightest whisper and transmit the information 3 km and more .
Because of this , government laws are very strict and will come down very heavily on any mis-use .
The purpose of this article is to compare different circuits and explain the features that contribute to a good design .
Some of these circuits ( the best of each design ) are available from Talking Electronics in kit -form and / or ready assembled .

FM TRANSMITTERS
The first group of circuits we will discuss are FM TRANSMITTERS .
They can be called SPY TRANSMITTERS , FM BUGS , or a number of other interesting names .
They all do the same thing .
They transmit on the FM band in the range 88MHz to 108MHz .
Most of them can be adjusted to transmit above or below the band and you need a radio that will pick up these frequencies , to detect them .
Since the FM band is almost entirely filled with radio stations , we will be providing details on how to adjust a radio so it will scan EITHER above the band or below the band .
Most radios can only be adjusted 10 MHz above or below but this will be enough to provide a " blank " space for your transmitter .
FM transmission provides perfect quality and when one of these transmitters is used in a house and received on a good quality radio , you cannot tell if the person is actually talking in the next room or via an FM link , through a radio .
This means all the FM bugs have the same perfect audio , but some circuits will detect fainter sounds and others will transmit further .
Some circuits can be handled without drifting off - frequency and others are designed to be very small or fit on top of a 9v battery .
By building these circuits you will learn an enormous amount about high frequency , audio and getting the maximum output with the least current .
This is the main aim of this article .
It will add a number of " building blocks " to your understanding of electronics .
Before I start , there are two things that particularly annoy me .
The first is a circuit diagram with C1 , R1 etc and a parts list identifying the values .
Circuit diagrams like this are obviously drawn by a non-electronics person .
The whole concept of looking at a circuit diagram and seeing the values gives the reader an indication of how each section will work .
A section may be operating very lightly with high value components or it may be working very hard with low value components .
The whole idea of providing a circuit diagram with marked components is to give the reader an immediate understanding of how the circuit is operating .
The second thing that annoys me is the labelling of parts on a PC board as R1 , C1 etc .
Again , the board has been designed by a non-technical person .
Why design a board without component values ?
Do they think the values will change ?
How can you assemble a board without referring to a circuit diagram ?
The whole purpose of well - designed PC board is to build it without referring to any other data .
Keep this in mind when designed your own boards .
Also , do n't name your boards " A51/834-2 . "
Give then a name you can remember or one that refers to the application it will perform .
Let 's start : 1 TRANSISTOR CIRCUITS
There are a number of 1 transistor FM transistors on the market in kit-form and already assembled .
These circuits are interesting to look at but do not really perform very well .
1 . They do not have a good transmitting range .
2 . They do not detect low - level sound , and
3 . They do not operate very well on 1.5v .
No transmitter can be expected to operate very well on 1.5v .
If you want to use a single cell , use a lithium cell as it produces 3v .
4 . Some have a coil etched on the PC board .
No FM transmitter will perform very well with a coil etched on the board .
Why use 1.5 v ?????
Transistors do not operate very well below 0.9v and the collector load resistor needs a small voltage so it can perform its task ( the same applies to an emitter resistor ) and thus the lowest voltage for a circuit is 1.5 v .
If only a single cells is used , there is no allowance for a voltage - drop as the cell becomes depleted .
Always use 3v as the lowest supply voltage .
THE SIMPLEST CIRCUIT
The following circuit is the simplest FM circuit you can get .
It has no microphone but the coil is so MICROPHONIC that it will pick up noises in the room via vibrations on a table .
The circuit does not have any section that determines the frequency .
In the next circuit and all those that follow , the section that determines the frequency of operation is called the TUNED CIRCUIT or TANK CIRCUIT and consists of a coil and capacitor .
The transistor and components surrounding the tuned circuit simply keep the tuned circuit operating at its RESONANT FREQUENCY .
This circuit does not have this feature .
The transistor turns on via the 47 k and this puts a pulse through the 15 turn winding .
The magnetic flux from this winding passes through the 6 turn winding and into the base of the transistor via the 22n capacitor .
This pulse is amplified by the transistor and the circuit is kept active .
The frequency is determined by the 6 turn coil .
By moving the turns together , the frequency will decrease .
The circuit transmits at 90MHz .
It has a very poor range and consumes 16 mA .
THE SIMPLEST BUG
The components soldered to the 2 cells
Rear view of the simplest bug
After making a transmitter , you will want to know if it is transmitting .
In the case above , the circuit will only produce a carrier and this will be heard on the radio as a " quiet spot . "
Rather than chasing up and down the dial , Talking Electronics has produced a piece of test equipment to let you know the bug is transmitting and the approx frequency of transmission .
It is called FIELD STRENGTH METER MkII .
The photo below shows the Field Strength Meter near the bug .
The plastic knob on the trimmer allows adjustment without affecting the detecting circuit .
Simply turn the knob ( with the two antennas near each other ) and the 3 LEDs on the project will illuminate .
Field Strength Meter and Bug
So far we have seen an unstable circuit in action .
Placing a finger near the bug will change the frequency .
This is totally unsuitable .
A ONE TRANSISTOR CIRCUIT
The next circuit uses a TUNED CIRCUIT or TANK CIRCUIT to create the operating frequency .
This is clearly shown in the diagram .
For best performance the circuit should be built on a PC board with all components fitted close to each other .
The photo below shows the circuit using a coil etched on the board .
This type of coil is totally unsuitable .
It does not have a high " Q " and the range is very poor .
The board cannot be touched as the capacitance of your body causes the circuit to drift .
A wound coil will improve the stability considerably .
See photos below for the details of a wound coil .
A one transistor circuit
Do not use an etched coil
Here is the 1 - transistor circuit produced by Darren Dazaro on a home - made PC board and heat - shrunk so the air - trimmer is adjustable via a small hole .

BAD LAYOUT
Here is a circuit with a very bad layout .
The circuit may work but it relies on a " Q - factor " from the coil and capacitor in the tank circuit to produce a high voltage .
This high voltage gives the circuit a good range .
Firstly the coil and capacitor should be near each other .
The coil should not have long leads .
and a 22n capacitor should be across the supply to give the circuit better performance .
The value of C2 is too high .
It should be 10 p .
The coil should be 5 turns .
The electret mic should not be connected directly to the base of the transistor .
As you can see , the circuit is full of faults .
You can learn a lot from other people 's mistakes .
A BAD DESIGN
This circuit is completely different to all the other designs in this section .
It is a common - emitter design , whereas all the circuit we are presenting are common - base designs .
The circuit has not been tested and you can build it and compare the output with some of our designs .
Two mistakes on the circuit are :
The top 10n is not needed as the emitter is held rigid by the lower 10n .
10 p on the base does nothing .
A PNP DESIGN
Before we go to an improved design , here is an unusual circuit using a PNP ( BC 557 ) transistor .
Firstly , PNP transistors do not work as well as NPN transistors .
I would reverse the 4k7 and electret mic as the voltage between base and 0v rail is very small and the 4k7 is not biasing the transistor - it is not needed !
The range will be 50 to 100 metres and the current is about 3 mA .
Note : A reader built this circuit .
It did not work !!
Try putting the 47 p across the coil .
The 33 p may need to be reduced to 10p .
It is just a BAD design , but a good challenge to see if you can get this type of design to work .
Simple 1 transistor FM Transmitter
The 22n is not shown .
This is a later addition .
Here is a 1 - transistor PNP circuit that transmits the phone conversation : AN IMPROVED DESIGN
This design uses a " slug tuned coil " to set the frequency .
This means the slug can be screwed in and out of the coil .
This type of circuit does not offer any improvement in stability over the previous circuit .
( In later circuits we will show how to improve stability .
The main way to improve stability is to add a " buffer " stage .
This separates the oscillator stage from the output . )
The antenna is connected to the collector of the transistor and this " loads " the circuit and will cause drift if the bug is touched .
The range of this circuit is about 200 metres and current consumption is about 7 mA .
The microphone has been separated from the oscillator and this allows the gain of the microphone to be set via the 22 k resistor .
Lowering the resistor will make the microphone more sensitive .
This circuit is the best you can get with one transistor .
THE COIL
I have particularly avoided mentioning the actual value ( inductance in microhenry ) of the coil because it is less than 1uH and is about 0.65 uH .
That is 65 nH ( 65 to 80 nano Henry ) .
A coil of this inductance will be very hard to measure on an inductance meter , but if you want to measure it , here is the secret :
Place a 1uH inductor on the inductance meter and read the value .
Now add the 65nH inductor and the reading will increase to 1.65 uH .
But a few turns of wire and a few circles of trackwork on a Printed Circuit Board will produce the same 65 nH reading but the coil will produce a much better result in the transmitter .
This is all to do with a term called EFFICIENCY or " Q " of the coil and in the controlled conditions of these oscillators , the best coil will " deliver back " nearly 100 % of the energy it is supplied .
This result in a waveform in the antenna of nearly twice the voltage of the supply .
The other secret in producing a good output is to have the capacitor and coil " match " each other .
In other words , the energy delivered back from the coil is the same as the energy delivered back from the capacitor .
That 's why the capacitor should be 39 p and the coil 5 or 6 turns .
You can use 47 p and a coil of 5 or 6 turns .
Stretching the coil reduces the inductance and this is how the two are matched together and produce a frequency somewhere in the region of 85MHz to 110MHz .
For 39 p and 65 nH the resonant frequency will be 100MHz from a calculator .
But this may be different in a circuit due to the effect of the transistor .
For 47 p and 70nH the resonant frequency will be 88MHz .
MORE STABILITY
If you want more stability , the antenna can be tapped off the top of the tank circuit .
This actually does two things .
It keeps the antenna away from the highly active collector and turns the coil into an auto - transformer where the energy from the 8 turns is passed to a single turn .
This effectively increases the current into the antenna .
And that is exactly what we want .
The range is not as far but the stability is better .
The frequency will not drift as much when the bug is held .
As the tap is taken towards the collector , the output increase but the stability deceases .
LOW - VALUE EMITTER RESISTOR
The next circuit has been picked out for its low emitter resistor on the oscillator .
This resistor does not have to be a very low value as the transistor is working at its maximum potential , due to the high frequency and a low emitter resistor will simply consume more current without improving the output .
The emitter resistor is too low
Two photos of the bug
STEREO TO MONO
To combine two channels to a mono output , the following circuit can be used : INDUCTOR
Some time soon you will come across a circuit with an inductor in the emitter .
This can be in a transmitting circuit or receiving circuit .
Let 's look at what is does and how it works .
The following circuit is a common - base COLPITTS circuit and oscillates at 303MHz .
The components that set this frequency are : the length of the track on the PC board ( shown in thick black ) and the value of the capacitor across this track .
The component that makes this a " common - base " circuit is the capacitor on the base .
The 1n has a capacitive reactance of less than ONE OHM at 303MHz !
This means the base will not move up and down during the time when the stage is oscillating .
The circuit turns ON via the 22 k resistor and this is because it puts a voltage on the base that is 0.7v higher than the emitter .
The current delivered by the 22 k can now turn the transistor ON a certain amount - BUT it is not allowed to turn the transistor ON fully .
If it did , the other components in the circuit ( that turn the transistor ON - by an increased amount ) would not be needed and there would be no components in the circuit to turn it OFF .
So , we have the first part of the cycle where the 22 k starts to turn the transistor ON .
Before we go any further , we have to mention the second way a transistor can be turned ON .
If we hold the base of a transistor rigid and " pull " the emitter lead towards the 0v rail , the " gap " between the base and emitter will increase and although this increase may be only a few millivolts , it will cause the transistor to turn on MORE .
Now , there is one more thing we have to cover .
When the voltage on the collector falls , due to the transistor turning ON , the energy in the 3p3 will be passed to the emitter to reduce the voltage on this lead .
But there is more to this .
When the transistor turns ON , the relatively high voltage across the 3p3 will be converted to a much lower voltage to push the emitter lead a few millivolts lower but the current it will deliver will be considerable .
The emitter lead is considered to be a very low impedance lead and it requires a considerable current to move it lower .
Let me explain the capacitor phenomenon again :
You already know about this phenomenon , but have forgotten .
If you take a large electrolytic and charge it on a 12 v battery with a resistor in series , the capacitor will take a long time to charge and the current - flow will be quite small .
Now take the electrolytic and short the 2 leads on the shaft of a screwdriver .
You will see a bright flash and the screwdriver will be " burnt . "
That 's because the electrolytic is capable of receiving a low current over a long period of time and releasing a high current for a short period of time .
The 3p3 is doing the same thing .
The low impedance of the " emitter circuit " is due to two things .
It is due to the junction inside the transistor and the 100 ohm resistor .
If we were able to remove the 100 ohm resistor , the impedance of the " emitter circuit " would increase - but obviously the circuit would not work .
If the impedance of this part of the circuit is increased , the 3p3 will be able to turn the transistor ON more and thus the overall amplitude of the circuit will increase .
That 's exactly what the inductor does .
It effectively moves the 100 ohm resistor away from the emitter lead so the 3p3 sees the " emitter circuit " as a higher impedance .
How does it do this ?
Firstly you have to understand how an inductor works when placed in this type of circuit .
The circuit above is called an LC HIGH PASS FILTER .
It only allows high frequency signals to pass through the filter .
The signal enters from the left and the left lead of the first capacitor rises and falls and passes this action to the right plate .
The incoming signal is not reduced by the capacitor if the signal has a high frequency .
This means the incoming signal appears on the top of the inductor with very little attenuation .
When the signal rises , a small amount of current enters the inductor and produces magnetic flux .
This flux is called EXPANDING FLUX and it cuts all the other turns of the " coil " and produces a voltage in these turns that is of opposite polarity to the incoming voltage .
Say the incoming voltage is 10 v .
The inductor will produce a voltage of 9.999v and this means only 1 millivolt is available to deliver a current into the inductor .
The end result is this : only a very small current will flow into the inductor .
Exactly the same thing will happen when the voltage is falling .
The inductor will have very little " grip " on the voltage and it will allow the voltage to " pass over " the inductor without reducing its amplitude .
The " out " capacitor will pass the amplitude without reducing it and so the incoming waveform will pass though this circuit without being effected .
If the waveform has a low frequency , the first capacitor will attenuate it and the inductor will reduce it and the " out capacitor " will reduce it .
The output will be almost zero .
Now , how does the inductor in the 303MHz circuit work ?
It allows the signal from 3p3 to enter the emitter lead and have very effect on attenuating the amplitude .
If the inductor were just a short length of wire , it would not have the same effect and a lot of energy from the 3p3 would be passed to the 100 ohm resistor .
I know the two circuits are not identical , but the basics are still the same .
The addition of an inductor DOUBLED the range of another transmitter circuit we were testing in the laboratory and when you realise the extra power needed to do this ( about 8 times ) , its effectiveness is very impressive .
Look at it this way :
Pretend the signal from the 3p3 is a waveform going down a large pipe that has sticky honey on the top and bottom of the pipe .
As the waveform hits the top and bottom , it get suck to the honey an eventually its amplitude is reduced .
Now replace the honey with la bright shiny pipe .
As the wave reaches the top and bottom of the pipe it bounces off with very little loss and the amplitude is hardly affected .
It will get to the end with very little attenuation .
Unless you can see the operation of a circuit as things that " move " you will not be able to diagnose or improve these circuits .
It 's because most lecturers do n't understand these circuits , that they cannot impart a visualization that the students will remember .
One very clever lecturer said to the class : DO YOU KNOW ?
DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU KNOW ?
In other words , half - understanding is : NO UNDERSTANDING .
2 TRANSISTOR CIRCUITS
The next progressive step is to add a transistor to give the electret microphone more sensitivity .
The electret microphone contains a Field Effect Transistor and you can consider it to be a stage of amplification .
That 's why the electret microphone has a very good output .
A further stage of amplification will give the bug extremely good sensitivity and you will be able to pick up the sound of a pin dropping on a wooden floor .
Many of the 1 transistor circuits over - drive the microphone and this will create a noise like bacon - and - eggs frying .
The microphone 's used by Talking Electronics require a load resistor of 47 k for a 6 v supply and 22 k for a 3 v supply .
The voltage across the microphone is about 300 mV to 600 mV .
It will produce an audio waveform of about 2 - 20 mV .
Only a very simple self - biasing common - emitter stage is needed for the audio amplifier .
This will give a gain of approx 70 for a 3 v supply .
The next circuit shows this audio amplifier , added to the previous transmitter circuit .
This circuit is the best design using 2 transistors on a 3 v supply .
The circuit takes about 7 mA and produces a range of about 200 - 400 metres .
2 Transistor FM Transmitter
Five points to note in the circuit above :
1 . The tank circuit has a fixed 39 p and is adjusted by a 2 - 10 p trimmer .
The coil is stretched to get the desired position on the band and the trimmer fine tunes the location .
2 . The microphone coupling is a 22n ceramic .
This value is sufficient as its capacitive reactance at 3 - 4k Hz is about 4 k and the input to the audio stage is fairly high , as noted by the 1 M on the base .
3 . The 1u between the audio stage and oscillator is needed as the base has a lower impedance as noted by the 47 k base - bias resistor .
4 . The 22n across the power rails is needed to keep the rails " tight . "
Its impedance at 100MHz is much less than one ohm and it improves the performance of the oscillator enormously .
5 . The coil in the tank circuit is 5 turns of enameled wire with air core .
This is much better than a coil made on a PC board and is cheaper than a bought inductor .
The secret to long range is high activity in the oscillator stage .
The tank circuit ( made up of the coil and capacitors across it ) will produce a voltage higher than the supply voltage due to the effect known as " collapsing magnetic field " and this occurs when the coil collapses and passes its reverse voltage to the capacitor .
The antenna is also connected to this point and it receives this high waveform and passes the energy to the atmosphere as electromagnetic radiation .
When the circuit is tightly constructed on a PC board , the frequency will not drift very much if the antenna is touched .
This is due to the circuit design and layout as well as the use of large - value capacitors in the oscillator .
If low value capacitors are used , the effect of your body has a greater effect on changing the frequency .
THE VOYAGER
The only way to get a higher output from two transistors is to increase the supply voltage .
The following circuit is available from Talking Electronics as a surface - mount kit , with some components through - hole .
The project is called THE VOYAGER .
Voyager on a 9v Battery
All the elements of good design have been achieved in this project .
The circuit has a higher output than the 3v circuit above , but most of the voltage is lost across the emitter resistor and not converted to RF .
The main advantage of this design is being able to connect to a 9v battery .
In a technical sense , about half the energy is wasted as the stages actually require about 4 v - 5 v for maximum output .
The Voyager has been copied by many kit -makers but none has surpassed its performance .
Here is a " knock - off " of our older design .
It is mounted flat on a 9v battery :
Here are 2 more two - transistor circuits using a 9v supply .
We have also included the technical limitations of the circuits :
DAVID'S DESIGN : Faults with this circuit :
1 . Very low microphone load resistor .
2. 4u7 not needed from microphone .
22n is sufficient .
3. 3p3 is very low for BC 547 .
May need to be higher .
- 10 p preferred .
4. Bridge biasing of audio stage is not needed .
Simple biasing is adequate .
5 . Base biasing of oscillator is very wasteful in current .
6. 22n is very high for base bias of oscillator - restricts incoming audio .
EMITTER CAPACITOR
The circuit above has a 56 p on the emitter .
This capacitor has no effect on improving the operation of the circuit and merely requires the capacitor connected between the collector and emitter to be increased to counter the losses delivered to the 56p .
The two 56 p on the output do not improve the performance as they are equivalent to 28 p across L2 and this forms a tuned circuit .
The aim of the output stage is to be untuned so that any frequency can be selected for the oscillator .
If the output is " tuned " it will only have gain at one particular frequency and will have to be re-tuned every time the main frequency is altered .
A BIRD'S NEST DESIGN Faults with this circuit :
1. Load resistor for microphone is very low - should be 47 k
2.10u on output of microphone is not needed - 22n is sufficient .
3. Current through audio state is very high .
Load resistor should be 47 k
4 . Base biasing of oscillator very wasteful .
5. Load resistor for oscillator ( emitter resistor ) is very low
6. Feedback capacitor for oscillator should be 10p .
7 . No ceramic in tank circuit .
Adding a ceramic makes it easier to adjust
the trimmer capacitor .
8 . No capacitor across the battery .
See the layout below :
Birds - nest of above circuit showing how tight the circuit can be made .
There is nothing wrong with a bird 's nest .
It is very easy to experiment with
components and wiring that can be seen and changed without having to
work on a PC board .
The only problem with the bird 's nest above is
the lack of an earth plane .
When you have an earth plane , the signal
can push against the large mass of an earth rail ( or battery ) so that it
can push the signal out the antenna .
The circuit on proto - typing board - a quick way to build a project .
The oscillator components must be kept near each other ,
otherwise the circuit will not oscillate !
So one of Gov. Sarah Palin ’s best friends is gay .
Her pal “ happens to have made a choice that is n’t a choice that I have made , ” Palin told Katie Couric last week .
That language resurfaced in the vice presidential debate , when Palin insisted that she was “ tolerant ” of Americans “ choosing relationships that they deem best for themselves . ”
Calling homosexuality a choice is the time - tested way politicians signal their belief that it is the wrong choice .
Which is why Palin ’s comments prompted predictable anger from gay rights advocates .
Typical was a Washington Post opinion piece saying that “ no one would choose to be part of a marginalized group whose members have to sue their way to basic rights . ”
But insisting that homosexuality is wholly involuntary does little to defend gays and lesbians from social disapproval .
After all , the subtext of the “ choice ” debate is that opposing gay rights is only appropriate if gays select their sexuality , since it is unfair to punish someone for something one does not control .
Yet this reasoning raises a larger question :
Why should equal treatment of gays and lesbians hinge on whether they have chosen or inherited their identities ?
Whether our DNA or our free will are “ at fault ” really only matters if being gay is a bad thing .
It is past time to retire the question of whether being gay is a choice -- not because it ’s been settled but because it never made sense in the first place .
Indeed , when it comes to other aspects of our identity and behavior , we generally do n’t dwell on the question of choice .
To ask whether a practicing Catholic or a professional dancer has “ chosen ” to be a Catholic or a dancer seems bizarre , not because we entirely deny that an element of choice is involved but because we recognize that the lives we lead are the layered products of our experiences and passions , our convictions and longings , our judgments and follies .
What causes people to become vegetarians , athletes , poets , stockbrokers or bank robbers ?
Most people , if we bother to think about it , probably believe such identities are the result of responses to impulses and convictions that shape people ’s actions over time .
How the impulse or conviction got there , no one is certain , but there ’s surely an element of chance involved .
A person chooses to become a teacher , but the desire to teach and the conviction that says being a teacher is right and good -- these cannot sensibly be reduced to a simple act of human will .
Yet too many Americans continue to view sexual orientation as just that .
At the same time , they cast other spheres of identity -- particularly religion -- as matters of unchosen conviction and deep principle .
In fact , the parallels between sexual orientation and religious faith may be more marked than their differences .
Religious Americans often speak of a surge of emotion from deep within them , of hearing a calling from something outside of themselves and of following the dictates of their conscience .
Likewise , gays and lesbians frequently describe same - sex attractions as an undeniable force or a deep - seated feeling that they must respect if they are to be true to themselves .
How one responds to these stirrings may be largely a matter of choice , just as one may choose whether to act on a belief or whether to practice a faith .
But American institutions properly protect our right to practice the religion that speaks to our soul .
Why not champion a homosexual ’s right to honor erotic , romantic and emotional callings in the same way , so long as doing so does n’t harm others ?
The concept of choice should be no more -- and no less -- applied to sexual orientation than to our religious , political or vocational identities .
It is this understanding of choice that embodies the noblest meaning of American freedom .
It is a conception of freedom that invites us to choose to do what we think we ought -- to act in accordance with our deepest convictions .
And it ’s a notion of freedom with a long and celebrated history in American culture .
The Pilgrims did not come to America seeking license -- permission to do anything they pleased -- but liberty -- the right to exercise their judgment as they saw fit .
The freedom celebrated by Thomas Jefferson was the freedom to practice civic virtue , to behave the way one thought one should , not to live and let live .
Ralph Waldo Emerson counseled self - reliance -- not so we could indulge our whims but so we could intuit our true callings and choose to pursue the paths that made us most ourselves .
If Palin ’s gay friend is like other gays and lesbians , her sexual orientation is neither a choice to be tolerated nor a sentence to be served .
It ’s an expression of her freedom to be herself , a freedom that , as Palin said in the debate , “ is always just one generation away from extinction . ”

A former colleague of the US Vice - President , Dick Cheney , has pleaded guilty to funnelling millions of dollars in bribes to win lucrative contracts in Nigeria for Halliburton , during the period in the Nineties when Mr Cheney ran the giant oil and gas services company .
Albert Stanley , who was appointed by Mr Cheney as chief executive of Halliburton 's subsidiary KBR , admitted using a north London lawyer to channel payments to Nigerian officials as part of a bribery scheme that landed some $ 6bn of work in the country over a decade .
The guilty plea , announced yesterday , came after a four - year investigation by US attorneys and threatens to stir up old controversies just as eyes are trained on the Republican party convention .
Mr Cheney , who pulled out of an address to the convention because of Hurricane Gustav earlier this week , led Halliburton from 1995 until returning to government in 2000 .
He had previously been Defence Secretary under the first President George Bush , and the links with Halliburton have been a constant thorn in the side of the current administration as the company has gone on to win billions of dollars of contracts in Iraq and other US military spheres .

The corruption scandal which exploded back into life yesterday centres on more than $ 180 m channelled into Nigeria via intermediaries between 1994 – before Mr Stanley 's employer was acquired by Halliburton – and 2004 .
Prosecutors allege that the payments were vital to a KBR - led consortium securing a succession of construction projects related to a liquefied natural gas plant at Bonny Island , on the Atlantic coast of Nigeria .
KBR suspended Stanley in 2004 after $ 5 m was found in his Swiss bank account .
The investigation – which began in 2004 and has involved investigators in Nigeria , Switzerland , France and the UK , as well as the US – has turned up handwritten notes by a former KBR executive that bribes may have reached the former Nigerian dictator Sani Abacha , whose regime was accused of human rights abuses .
Bringing its legal action yesterday , the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission – America 's corporate watchdog – said Stanley and others met high - ranking Nigerian government officials and their representatives on at least four occasions to arrange the bribe payments .
To conceal the illicit payments , Stanley and others approved entering into sham contracts with two " agents " to funnel money to the Nigerian officials .
Investigations by French officials several years ago revealed that one of the agents was Jeffrey Tesler , a small - time solicitor based on a run-down high street in Tottenham , north London .
Mr Tesler has long - standing ties in Nigeria , and worked as consultant to KBR 's Nigerian joint venture .
Mr Tesler was identified in yesterday 's legal actions only as " the UK agent " , and has not been charged with any crime .
Attempts to contact Mr Tesler last night were unsuccessful .
Stanley admitted one count under the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act – which outlaws bribery by executives and companies operating in the US , regardless of where in the world the corruption is taking place – and a further count of fraud .
He faces 10 years in jail , and has agreed to pay $ 10.8 m in restitution .
He has also agreed to co-operate with the authorities as they continue their investigation into the bribery scandal .
Mr Cheney appointed Stanley to run KBR in 1999 , when the subsidiary was created after Halliburton 's acquisition of UK - controlled MW Kellogg , where Stanley had been an executive .
There is no suggestion that Mr Cheney knew at the time of the acquisition , or subsequently , that bribery was involved in the Nigerian contracts .
" The Department of Justice is committed to aggressively enforcing the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act , " said acting assistant Attorney General Matthew Friedrich .

You would think that a 39 city protest involving thousands of people might warrant a national wire story , maybe a mention on cable news , but no .
Reporters do n’t understand the issue and therefore they ignore it .
Of course this can be said for most of the important issues that affect people ’s lives .
Hence we get wall - to - wall coverage of the Obama daughter ’s educational preferences .
Fiddling while Rome burns seems almost understated .
There was some local coverage ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ) and the Russians were all over it .
Most of it misses the point , but what are you going to do ?
A few months ago this was n’t even an issue and many of us owe Ron Paul a considered debt of gratitude for raising it to prominence .
Maybe one day , some reporter might even realize he ’s sitting on the biggest story of the last hundred years ; the looting of the American people to the tune of 95 % of our money ’s value .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Maybe that industrious reporter will open a history book and learn that the dangers of central banking were well understood by such radical fringe players as Thomas Jefferson and John F. Kennedy .
He might learn that Woodrow Wilson realized that he had enabled the eventual destruction of America with the signing of the Federal Reserve Act writing , “ I am a most unhappy man .
I have unwittingly ruined my country . ”
He might even figure out that this system impoverishes our most vulnerable citizen ’s by destroying their purchasing power and enslaving them in unnecessary welfare systems that need naught ever to have existed .
He might learn that inflation is a means of paying for aggressive wars indirectly and therefore avoiding the direct cost of taxation which would raise opposition among the people .
He might also discover that the Constitution demands that our government control our nation ’s money supply and that the Federal Reserve is a private bank that not even members of congress are allowed to oversee .
If he is really sharp , he might also figure out that fractional reserve banking and fiat money systems must necessarily fail over time and we have reached the end of the line .
With a little evaluation , he may conclude that central banking has led us to the point of the complete collapse of the international economic order and the end of the dollar and our way of life with it .
Man Writes Calligraphy Using His Own Tears !
Truly defying some natural laws , this Chinese man can write calligraphy with water he shoots from his own eyes .
Ru Anting , aged 56 , actually sucks up the water with his nose and then sprays it through his tear ducts !
Ru told the press that he has had this special talent since he was a child .
He discovered it quite by accident while swimming one day in a local river .
“ Sometimes I would swallow water while swimming , and once I accidentally discovered the water I swallowed could be shot out through my eyes .
My friends were all shocked to see it . ”
This weird skill lay dormant until the 1990s when he lost his job in a local fertilizer factory where he had worked for more than twenty years .
He then began to hone his spraying talent and after three years of intensive training , he found he could shoot water from his eyes accurately up to 10 feet !
Ru has demonstrated his strange talent at the Lotus World Park in Shanshui city , Guangdong .
He wrote the following four characters on a board covered with red paper : Fu Ru Dong Hai , which translates into fortune as vast as the sea .
Kleenex anyone ?

About This Blog
I started this blog to cover the 2008 presidential campaign -- specifically , to compare the candidates ' records , plans , and statements on special needs issues .
I worked in the Clinton Administration , including the White House , but this was never intended to be a partisan blog -- I did n't want to see any of the candidates play politics with these issues and wanted to look beyond the rhetoric .
After the election , I decided to continue the blog to encourage others to keep informed and involved .
Economic trouble has spread far beyond the United States to major countries in Europe and Asia , threatening American businesses with the loss of foreign sales and investment that have become increasingly vital to their sustenance .
Only a few months ago , some economists still offered hope that robust expansion could continue in much of the world even as the United States slowed .
Foreign investment was expected to keep replenishing American banks still bleeding from their disastrous bets on real estate and to provide money for companies looking to expand .
Overseas demand for American goods and services was supposed to continue compensating for waning demand in the States .
Now , high energy prices , financial systems crippled by fear , and the decline of trading partners have combined to choke growth in many major economies .
The International Monetary Fund expects global growth to slow significantly through the end of this year , dipping to 4.1 percent from 5 percent in 2007 .
“ The global economy is in a tough spot , caught between sharply slowing demand in many advanced economies and rising inflation everywhere , ” the I.M.F. declared last month in its official World Economic Outlook .
Enlarge By Randi Weiner , The Journal News Employees and patrons of the Nyack , N.Y. , Starbucks left mementos and prayers in honor of Fleming Taylor , a homeless man who frequently sat in this chair .
NYACK , N.Y . 
Nearly every day during the past year , Fleming Taylor walked into the Starbucks on Main Street as the doors opened , sat in the same purple velvet chair , read and discussed what was in The Wall Street Journal with other regulars , and left only when the store closed in the evening .
Now the chair where the 62 - year - old Taylor sat is cordoned off with black ribbon and filled with bouquets and notes announcing his death .
Orangetown Police Lt. Joseph Holahan said about 10:45 a.m. Wednesday , officers were sent to 80 1/2 Main St. in Nyack after someone reported a man 's body in the stairwell .
The death did not appear to be suspicious .
Holahan said he could not confirm the man 's identity because it was unclear whether all his relatives had been informed .
Starbucks employees and acquaintances , however , identified the man as Taylor , and said he apparently was homeless and lived beneath the stairs where he was found .
Since then , the chair where he sat has become a small shrine , visited by those who knew Taylor and a point of interest in the coffee shop for those who did n't .
" I 'm a regular Starbucks customer , and I think it 's very nice , " said Dan Rostan , 56 , of Nyack .
Mark Horwitz , assistant manager of the Starbucks store , said Taylor was a quiet and well - mannered man who was a fixture at the coffee shop .
" Lots of college students used to chat with him .
He was very friendly , very warm - hearted .
People in town would buy him a Starbucks gift card and he won $ 40 on a single - dollar lottery ticket .
He paid for everything , he was a paying customer , " Horwitz said .
" He just seemed to be one of those people who fell through the cracks .
He had money , but not enough to live in Nyack . "
Starbucks employees learned of Taylor 's death Wednesday , and one , Keyla Santiago , asked to do something in his honor , Horwitz said .
That 's when the shrine was created .
People have been adding to it since .
Lydia Meehan , Mallory Merryman and Jonas Black , 14 - year - olds who knew of Taylor through the employees , were among several people who left mementos on the chair .
" He really was just a quiet guy , " said Black of Nyack .
" It 's interesting that lots of people care about someone like him .
People like this in different cities just slip beneath the radar , and nobody knows about them .
It 's nice that in Nyack , everybody is treated as part of a big community family . "
Oleg Khaghani , 47 , of Valley Cottage and Gene Homicki , 62 , of Nyack , knew Taylor for years .
Both men said he was a gentleman who did n't publicize his homelessness .
" If any single word described him , " Khaghani said , " it was ' dignified . ' " Guidelines :

Abortion is illegal in Brazil except in cases of rape or risk to the mother Brazilian police are investigating more than 1,200 women suspected of having had abortions in a clinic in the state of Mato Grosso Do Sul .
Some 150 women have been charged and at least 30 have been sentenced to do community work .
Abortion in Brazil is illegal except in cases of rape or when the life or health of the mother is at risk .
The large - scale investigation has prompted protests from human rights organisations and women 's groups .
The family planning clinic at the centre of this controversy operated for more than 20 years in the Brazilian city of Campo Grande before closing in 2007 .
At one point , the police were said to be considering several thousand cases of suspected abortions , but many of these fell outside the time limit permitted for legal action .
Controversial investigation
The authorities only became aware of the clinic following a television interview , which led to a police investigation that could eventually involve more than 1,200 women and some of their partners , as well as medical staff .
To gather evidence , Judge Aluizio Pereira dos Santos is said to have interviewed husbands , ex-boyfriends and relatives of some of the women accused of having abortions .
Human rights and women 's organisations have complained that the process has been humiliating for those involved , and has included demands for intimate medical examinations .
At least 30 women have already been sentenced to community work in creches or schools for disabled children .
The judge was reported by the newspaper O Estado de Sao Paulo as saying that other women who had to work to support their children , or who helped them deal with physical or mental disability , would act as a role model for those found to have had illegal abortions .
The investigation first attracted controversy when for a period the medical records of thousands of women were made available to the public .
The judge was said to have considered this practice to be normal , but the documents were later withdrawn .
Earlier this year , the prosecutor who initiated the legal action said the issue of abortion needed to be addressed by Brazil 's Congress and society , but that while the legislation was unchanged he was obliged to act .
The government has said it wants to see a debate over abortion but there is little sign that the law is about to be changed .

Does McCain even understand the insinuations he is putting out there ?
Or does he understand all too well and want to win anyway ?
If he wins this way , he will be unable to be president of all Americans .
He is delegitimizing his own presidency in advance :
And why does McCain keep missing the point on Lewis ?
John Lewis said the crowds at McCain 's and Palin 's events recalled the crowds at George Wallace's .
And they do .
He was n't calling McCain a segregationist - McCain 's umbrage is at a straw man .
And Obama did distance himself from the Wallace comparison almost immediately .
SO McCain is lying about that too .
Is there any shred of his reputation he cannot still trash ?
We want to hear what you think about this article .

New LED Light Bulb Lasts 30 Years
October 23rd , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Looking for an energy - efficient yet attractive alternative to CFL light bulbs ?
Check out Frog Design ’s innovative LED bulb .
It ’s shaped like a regular bulb instead of a LED — and best of all , it lasts for 30 years .
Frog Design ’s high - powered LED uses less power than a CFL and has a pleasant light output .
Since the bulb is shaped traditionally , it can fit into any light socket .
The heat generated by the LED is absorbed by its aluminum base — thus eliminating the issue of excess heat shortening the its life .
Will Frog Design ’s LED live up to the hype ?
I suppose we ’ll have to wait for the bulb ’s release to find out .

Ever baked a fresh homemade loaf of bread ?
A " no - knead " bread recipe published in the NY Times last year is a super - simple method for even the biggest bread - baking newbs .
The blogger at Apartment 2024 gave the recipe a try , and from the resulting mouth - watering photos the spur - of - the - moment project looks like it was a great success .
All you need is flour , yeast , salt , cornmeal and about 24 hours .
As the recipe 's name promises , there 's no kneading involved — time does all the work .
For more scrumptious no - knead bread photos , check out the nokneadbread tag on Flickr .

The Famous No-Knead Bread [ Apartment 2024 ]
SEPTEMBER 11--Last week we brought word of the arrest of Kenneth Smith , a Florida man busted for wearing baggy pants that exposed his boxer shorts .
Well , it turns out that the Riviera Beach cops have been rather diligent in enforcing a new city ordinance targeting droopy shorts and trousers , according to police reports .
Since officers began their crackdown last month , they have arrested at least 11 other baggy pants perps ( of that group , two are juveniles ) .
Mug shots of eight of the other nine arrestees , aged between 18 and 36 , can be found here .
As seen in a series of Riviera Beach Police Department probable cause affidavits , each of the males was nabbed after officers determined that low - slung pants or shorts had resulted in the exposure of between two and five inches of the individual offender 's boxer shorts .
While most of the busts occurred without incident , a few of the arrestees appeared bewildered that they were being arrested for a trouser - related offense .
One of the juveniles , in fact , cursed out Officer J. Thornton and said , according to one affidavit , " Your a cracker and ain't got shit better to do . "
First - time violators of ordinance 12-3043 face a fine of up to $ 150 .
Repeat offenders could be sentenced to a maximum of 30 days in jail .

Rolls - Royce Designing Energy - Efficient Propeller Engine
October 20th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Propeller planes are n’t exactly known as the pinnacle of aircraft luxury , but a new propeller engine currently being designed by Rolls - Royce makes up in efficiency what it lacks in comfort .
The company claims that the engine could save an airline three million dollars and 10,000 tons of CO2 per year if it is introduced on 100 - 200 seater planes .
The Rolls - Royce design uses two sets of propellers that rotate in opposite directions near the engine ’s rear .
This effectively reduces the energy wasted when propellers twist the air instead of pushing it backwards .
Additionally , the open rotor engines do n’t have a casing around the propeller , thus reducing weight and drag .
Open - rotor designs are normally very noisy , but Rolls - Royce both increased the number of blades on the plane ’s rotors and made the blades thinner than usual .
This resulted in rotors that turn at a slower speed while still maintaining a high efficiency — all with reduced noise .
Other companies working on similar open - rotor designs include General Electric , Pratt & Whitney , and Snecma .

We all run out of money .
What do we do ?
Well if we were open minded girls we could just ring up the producer of a website and participate in a date on the casting couch .
It ’s rather disgraceful to see women being degraded for a moderate modeling fee , but they keep face .
At least they are not whores .
See what they do on the casting couch .
Are they really going to have sex with the guy behind the camera ?
The following is an excerpt from " What Matters , " the latest book by " Day in the Life " series creator David Elliot Cohen .
For more information , see whatmattersonline.com
This 4 - year - old girl in Ghana walks 2 1 / 2 miles twice each day to carry water for her family .
Water is the key to life .
It is fundamental to all human activities .
Water grows the food we eat , generates the energy that supports our modern economies and maintains the ecological services on which we all depend .
Yet billions of people worldwide still lack access to the most basic human right : safe , clean , adequate water .
As you would expect , the vast majority of these people are among the poorest in the world , living in sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia .
Brent Stirton 's images tell many stories if you know how to read them -- from the tragedy brought by lack of safe water or too much water , to the joy and life - changing effects that a new water system can offer .
Hear the author describe Stirton 's images in an audio slideshow »
Modern society began to flourish only when humans figured out how to deliver reliable water supplies to larger and larger concentrations of people , and how to remove the accumulations of waste that cities produce , thus reducing outbreaks of water - related diseases .
Those services , which most of us take for granted , are still pipe dreams for vast populations in the poorest places on the planet .
This failure to meet the basic human need for water has direct , tangible and unacceptable consequences : drink dirty water and you get sick .
Witness the father caring for his son afflicted by a guinea worm parasite .
See the girl wasting away from cholera .
Look at the consequences of arsenic poisoning on Bangladeshi villagers .
And know that all of these diseases are completely preventable .
More than half the population of our modern , " civilized " world still suffers from water services inferior to those of the ancient Greeks and Romans .
As a result , water - related diseases continue to be a serious problem in many parts of the world .
Water - related diseases fall into several types or classes , but the three that are most clearly associated with the failure to provide safe water and sanitation are waterborne , water - washed and water - based diseases .
Waterborne diseases include those transmitted by drinking contaminated water , particularly contamination by pathogens from human excreta .
These include most of the enteric and diarrheal diseases caused by bacteria , parasites and viruses .
Waterborne diseases also include typhoid and more than thirty species of parasites that infect the human intestines .
Evidence also suggests that waterborne diseases contribute to background rates of other diseases that are not detected or explicitly reported as outbreaks .
Water - washed diseases occur when there is insufficient water for washing and personal hygiene or when people wash with contaminated water .
These include blindness caused by trachoma and diarrheal diseases passed from person to person .
Water - based diseases come from hosts that live in water or require water during part of their life cycle .
These diseases are passed to humans when the hosts are ingested or come into contact with skin .
The most widespread types are dracunculiasis , or guinea worm disease , in which a worm up to a meter long eventually and painfully emerges from the victim 's skin ; and schistosomiasis , a blood infection from a parasitic flatworm that causes chronic debilitation as well as liver and intestinal damage .
Schistosomiasis , which currently infects 200 million people in seventy countries , is so prevalent in certain African and East Asian communities that the process of overcoming disease is considered an important rite of passage .
Clean , safe water and sanitation have successfully eliminated most of these water - related pathogens in wealthier nations .
But they remain a major concern in much of the developing world .
According to the World Health Organization , there are on the order of 250 million cases of water - related diseases annually , excluding common diarrheal diseases .
In 2000 , the United Nations estimated there were more than four billion cases of diarrhea annually and more than two million deaths a year .
Even these horrifically large numbers may be too small ; the true extent of these diseases is unknown , and many cases of water - related illnesses remain undiagnosed and unreported .
Disease is only one consequence of the lack of safe water .
Look at Stirton 's photo of the little girl carrying a heavy load of water on her head .
There is more to this than meets the eye .
The girl is indeed " little " -- she is 4 years old , and she is beginning what may be an entire childhood devoted to hauling water .
She is not going to school .
She wo n't learn how to be a leader in her community .
She will be deprived of some of the most basic benefits of society -- all because there is no local source of clean , reliable and safe water .
Stirton photographed a girl , not a boy , because it is the girls who bear this burden throughout the developing world .
And her burden is heavy , because water is heavy -- eight pounds per gallon , a kilogram per liter .
My own work suggests that the minimum basic water requirement just for cooking , cleaning , drinking , bathing and simple sanitation is 50 liters per person per day -- which means 50 kilograms , or more than 100 pounds of water , per person every day .
Carrying just five gallons -- enough for basic drinking and cooking alone -- means carrying 40 pounds of water .
Go outside and try to carry water now .
Get a five - gallon container and carry it around the block where you live .
It will open your eyes and strain your back .
And five gallons is what disappears down the drain when you take a shower for two minutes -- if you are using an efficient showerhead .
Even if girls do get to go to school , unless the school has water and sanitation , they spend much of the day not in class but hauling water to the school .
And they often drop out at a young age rather than face the prospect of puberty with no privacy , no sanitation and no proper hygienic facilities .
As with so many of the world 's problems , Bangladesh often gets the worst of the water crisis , as Stirton 's pictures suggest .
Much of the country lives in fear of either too much water or not enough .
Floods ravage the country during the monsoons , but inadequate or unsafe water supplies plague millions of villagers the rest of the year .
Prior to the 1970s , most rural Bangladeshis relied on surface water ponds and shallow hand - pumped wells .
But industrial effluents and poor or nonexistent sewage systems polluted this water , leading to millions of water - related diseases and deaths .
The proposed solution was to dig nearly four million deep tube - wells to provide access to the presumably less - contaminated water table .
And indeed , these wells helped reduce illness and death from cholera and dysentery .
Overlooked , however , was the possibility that this groundwater could also be contaminated . \
But in the 1990s , more and more villagers began to be diagnosed with symptoms of toxic poisoning from naturally occurring arsenic .
Bangladesh has now learned that millions of people may have traded one waterborne illness for another .
Getting people to change their drinking - water habits is hard : as Khushi Kabir , a Bangladeshi NGO director , said , " It took a long time to get people to use tube - well water , and it will take a long time to get them to change [ again ] . "
As if to underscore the challenge , Salim Uddin Mondal , a Bangladeshi villager , when told that his precious groundwater well was contaminated with arsenic , said , " If I die , I will die , but I will not go to fetch water from another man 's house . "
In a hydrologic quirk of fate , Bangladesh is also vulnerable to cataclysmic flooding , and Stirton has captured the pain and suffering that takes Bangladeshi lives and livelihoods .
The risk of flooding will rise even further in Bangladesh as climate changes become more severe .
Sea - level rise will increase the risk of tidal surges , while changing rainfall patterns and rapidly melting Himalayan glaciers will increase the risks of flooding along the region 's major rivers .
Water also means food , and lack of water means lack of food .
The poorest countries do n't have sufficient infrastructure to buffer droughts or shortfalls of rain or runoff .
This can mean the difference between enough food and death from starvation , weakened immune systems and competition over resources , as Stirton 's poignant photo of a Zambian farmer so tellingly reveals .
There are clear solutions to all of these problems , but new ideas , technologies , tools and , most importantly , concerted effort will be needed to provide universal access to safe , reliable and affordable water to the world 's poor .
During the late twentieth century , traditional centralized water systems received most of the limited international funding given to water projects .
While these systems often brought substantial benefits to many urban users , their high cost also meant that insufficient capacity could be built to satisfy all users and needs .
And the technical complexity of these systems often meant that insufficiently trained personnel could not maintain operations .
Throughout the developing world , we see the skeletons of expensive water systems that were built but never operated , or that operated briefly before failing .
In order to address the overall affliction of poverty , including unmet needs for basic water supply and sanitation , the United Nations and the international community announced the Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs ) in 2000 .
These included the goal of reducing by half the number of people unable to obtain or afford safe drinking water and sanitation by 2015 .
Achieving the MDGs is a laudable objective , but even if they can be achieved , hundreds of millions of poor people will still lack basic water services .
Moreover , we are more than halfway to the target date of 2015 , and the levels of financial and institutional commitment to water issues have not been adequate .
There now seems to be little chance that the MDGs will be met particularly as they pertain to water .
This must be considered one of the most serious public health crises we face , and it deserves far more attention and resources than it has received so far .
The price for our failure to provide universal safe water and sanitation will be paid by the poorest populations of the world in sickness , lost educational and employment opportunities , and , for a staggeringly large number of people , early death .
This is morally unacceptable in a world that values equity and decency .
But at present , it appears unavoidable unless we can muster the will and commitment to provide clean , safe water for all .

Planning a wedding is no small task .
If you ’ve just started planning your wedding , then you ’re probably already feeling overwhelmed .
There ’s so much to arrange , buy , and coordinate .
Getting married is an exciting , beautiful time , but planning the wedding itself can be a hassle as well as figuring out how to provide your guests with an emailed list .
If you need a breath of fresh air as you plan , add the following ten things to your checklist .
Knowing what to decide , and when to decide it , can make your wedding planning an easier experience .
The Budget
One of the first things to figure out before your wedding day is your budget .
Some brides might have enough to create a magazine - worthy wedding , but you ’re probably working with much less .
Necessity is the mother of invention , and small - budget weddings are often sweeter , friendlier , and more unique .
Before you make any of the following decisions , you need to know what you ’re working with .
Are you on your own ?
Are your parents contributing ?
Are your soon - to - be in - laws contributing ?
Collect your data and stick to your budget .
The Tone
Every wedding has a different tone , and before you start the rest of your plans , you should decide what the tone of your wedding will be .
Are you going for country ?
Regal ?
You might want to set up bounce houses and serve food carnival - style , or you might opt to have guests seated indoors with white linen and silver .
The rest of your plans will revolve around the tone you ’re going for , so decide with your partner what you want your wedding to feel like .
This marquee from Cap Marquees will definitely help you to underline the tone of your special day .
Do you want to break every tradition in the book , or do you want to celebrate in a time - honored way ?
The Size
Next up : you have to decide how big you want your wedding to be .
Guest lists get complicated since if you invite this person you should technically invite that person .
Remember that not every guest will make it , especially if your wedding is out of town .
If you need a small wedding , see how much you can limit your guest size .
If size is n’t an issue , make sure you can find a reception venue to fit everyone on your list .
The Reception Venue
The toughest part of wedding planning , for many , is finding the reception venue .
If a place is not too expensive , it ’s ugly or it ’s already booked .
You ’ll probably have to think outside the box when you ’re planning your wedding .
If you ’ve got plenty of time before the big day , pick the venue ASAP and book it .
If you have a shorter engagement , look at park shelters , big backyards , or church basements , and find your supplies at a place like this event rental company in Randall , OH .
Where Guests Will Stay
You might be in the same city as most of your guests , but every wedding involves a few out - of - town attendees .
If you ’re planning a destination wedding , it will be even more important to plan accommodations .
Offer a hotel discount for guests , send them a list of nearby motels , or encourage camping or RVing for the more adventurous folks .
One extra-special touch you could consider is to provide your guests with an emailed list or hard - copy binder of local restaurants and things to do while they ’re in town .
Depending on where you end up tying the knot , your guests could remember your wedding not just because of the beautiful ceremony but also because they had the chance to surf Hawaii or had an enjoyable experience in North Bend , OR while they waited for the wedding to begin .
Who ’s Walking You Down the Aisle
If you ’re a bride , you ’re probably considering having someone walk you down the aisle .
If you and your father have a good relationship , you ’ll probably ask him , but you may be estranged or he may be deceased .
That makes your decision more complicated .
Choosing your mom instead is always a worthy solution , and you might also pick a relative , mentor , or sibling to walk with you .
You can even walk down the aisle alone .
Or maybe you want to take this opportunity to find out more about your family –DNA testing in New York can help uncover who your parents and grandparents are if they have n’t been part of your life before now .
A wedding offers a great opportunity to dig into your heritage and bring your family together !
The Music
The music at your wedding might seem like a small decision , but it ’s more complicated than it sounds .
If you ’ve chosen a traditional tone for your wedding , your music should lean towards the classical side .
On the other hand , if you ’re going all - out on breaking traditions , you might have rock music at the wedding ceremony .
You also have to choose between live music ( a friend who ’s a pianist or a full band ) and playing recordings .
Make sure you have someone experienced working sound if you choose recordings , and cut down the songs to where you want them so you do n’t run into any bugs .
The Dress
If you ’re a bride , deciding on your dress might be a huge part of your wedding day .
You may have some idea of what you ’re looking for , or you may have no idea at all .
Remember to choose your dress based on what you ultimately want : if you want a style that ’s less flattering than another , but you feel right , go for it .
Do n’t let friends or family talk you out of the dress you ’re really hoping for .
On the other hand , stick to your budget !
It ’s not worth getting in debt over an outfit you ’ll ( hopefully ) only wear once .
Who ’s Running the Show
Before your big day , pick someone ( besides you ) to keep things running smoothly .
This might be an aunt , the maid of honor , a friend , or a professional .
You should be able to enjoy every moment of your wedding day without worrying about what comes next .
Make a good plan , and then let it go .
Designate someone responsible whom you trust to deal with any disasters and keep the wedding running according to plan .
The Honeymoon
Last , but not least , the final decision you have to make is where to spend your honeymoon .
Some couples choose to spend more money on their wedding and take a modest honeymoon ; other couples want the exact opposite .
Decide with your partner what ’s more important to you , and make sure you include that in your step - one budget .
Once you know your budget , you can start looking for the perfect destination .
Do you want a cabin in the woods ?
A castle in Ireland ?
Combine both of your interests and passions to choose the perfect honeymoon spot .
Even though weddings certainly require a good amount of planning , in the end , you will remember yours as one of the most magical and special days of your life .
Once you break down the event into these categorical to - do ’s , the whole thing is way less overwhelming and way more enjoyable .
Remember to think ahead , stick to your own tastes and preferences , and , of course , have fun !
Even moreso than the Times , Fox News can't seem to let go of trite and clichéd red state - blue state dichotomies , even in the face of Barack Obama 's bountiful harvest of " red " electoral votes .
Exhibit A : Bill O'Reilly warning Daily Show host Jon Stewart not to visit the " center - right " South on pain of death , and criticizing his " Greenwich Village ... crew . "
We would n't be speaking in some kind of code here , would we Bill ?
And your viewers are used to you referring to them as a bunch of bloodthirsty animals ?
Ah right , they get the " joke . "

Big six fast - food chains pledge to slash fat and salt in historic anti-obesity shift
Historic shift : KFC is one of sixth fast food chains that has signed up to the anti-obesity drive
Six of the country 's biggest restaurant chains have pledged to serve more salad and slash levels of fat and salt in their products in an historic shift .
Burger King , KFC , McDonald's , Nando's , Subway and Wimpy have signed up to the anti-obesity drive by the Government 's Food Standards Agency ( FSA ) .
Fast food chains Burger King and Wimpy have pledged to run trials on using frying oils that contain less saturated fat .
Burger King is also introducing a new healthy apple dessert as an alternative to ice cream .
Subway promised a review of its entire menu to reduce salt levels by 15 per cent by June next year .
Staff will also stop offering to add salt to fillings .
The firm is also to offer side salads with its rolls and aims to reduce saturated fat levels in its standard creations .
Wimpy has introduced five new salads to its menu and also offers jacket potatoes and salads as alternatives to fries with its children 's meals .
The biggest chain , McDonald 's , said customers will be able to order Big Macs without sauce and fries without salt .
It is running a trial on fruit smoothies as an alternative to sugary fizzy drinks and has pledged to introduce more fruit and veg options backed by popular children 's cartoon characters .
Both Nandos and KFC are promising a review of their most popular menu items to reduce both levels of fat and salt .
The FSA is putting pressure on restaurant chains to radically change their menus , moving from fried food to fruit , vegetables and salad .
The Government watchdog has already won commitments from catering firms .
It is also in talks with the country 's largest pub , family restaurant and coffee shop chains .
It estimates that Britons are eating 20 per cent too much saturated fat every day , which is contributing to some 200,000 deaths a year from coronary heart disease .
It has set itself a target to reduce the proportion of food energy from saturated fat from an average of 13.3 per cent to 11 per cent by 2010 .
This , it claims , would prevent 3,500 premature deaths a year .
Head of nutrition at the FSA , Rosemary Hignett , welcomed the pledges from the six restaurant chains .
' Eating out should be fun and we do n't want to change that , but we believe restaurants can help make it easier for us to take healthier choices when dining out , ' she said .
' These companies ' commitments , together with the positive work that many have been doing for a number of years , show just how much is possible .
We hope that other restaurant chains will be able to emulate this exciting work ' .
The FSA has no legal power to force restaurants to change their recipes .
However , it has the backing of the Health Secretary , Alan Johnson , and the ability to shame firms that refuse to fall into line .
The organisation wants restaurants to publish nutrition information on the menus in their high street outlets to help people choose healthy options .
Currently , most of the major chains are unwilling to go beyond putting the information on calories , fat , salt and sugar on their websites .
Earlier this year , a Cabinet Office report on future food policy outlined the need for restaurants to include more nutrition information on their menus .
It said : ' We need to help consumers to access healthier choices when eating out , and need to provide information that considers both the health and environmental aspects of food . '
It justified the measures , saying : ' Changes in eating patterns would bring huge health gains here in the UK .
' Poor diet is known to influence the risk of cancer , heart disease and other conditions .
' The importance of nutrition for mental health and well - being is gradually becoming clearer .
' Around 70,000 fewer people would die prematurely each year in the UK if diets matched the nutritional guidelines on fruit and vegetable consumption , and saturated fat , added sugar and salt intake . '
Chairman of the FSA , Dame Deirdre Hutton , said : ' We are used to seeing nutritional information in supermarkets and we would like to enable people to make the same informed choices when they eat out as well . '
It said restaurants should replace unhealthy dishes , like fried foods , with healthy options .
Dame Deirdre said : ' It 's about more than just providing information - we 're working with major contract caterers , restaurant , pub and sandwich chains to encourage them to offer a wider range of great tasting healthier options . '
The British Hospitality Association says that small independent restaurants , which are constantly changing their menus , will find it difficult to provide nutrition information .

Is calling Obama black ( black dominating his ethnic identity as opposed to " mixed " or " black and white " ) an example of how this country has not progressed ?

Thanks again Jay , after I watched it I went back to the posts you did in January when you were hitting on the politics really hard , quote from your piece on tolerance fatigue - " every voter always says they do n't like negative campaign ads but historically negative campaign ads have ALMOST always worked " .
With the bad week the GOP ticket just had it would be good to get your view on tolerance fatigue part 2 .

Posted by : DJStylus at October 13 , 2008 3:50 PM
Definitely killed it Jay .
I have officially resigned from attacking idiotic right - wing supporters of McCain .
The research I 've done , and the news I 've been reading as of late indicates a strong victory for Obama .
Evidently , the electorate is nearly an overwhelming majority in support of Barack Obama .
And that 's what really matters in modern elections , the electoral vote as opposed to the popular vote .
Analysts say the only thing that could shift it back to McCain would be a highly catastrophic event , and even then the connection between the Bush Admin . and McCain and all the crap that transpired along with it will make it extremely difficult for the Republican party to extend its power .
On top of all of that , Barack Obama will be airing a 30 - minute long presentation on national television just days before Election Day .

Posted by : Steven Klassen at October 13 , 2008 4:57 PM
Hilarious , great video Jay .
With that being said , there is a part of it that 's scary , and that 's the fact that McCain has allowed people to begin to say these things .
Once he started with the Bill Aires relation rhetoric which gave way to many people , already under the impression that he 's a muslim , now believing he 's a terrorist .
McCain , as a party leader of the Conservatives needs to step in and say " My friends , we have to kill this shit . "
Because especially with Sarah Palin 's incessant hate - mongering , this election is turning more from Democratic - Republican to Black - White .
And McCain does have ethics , maybe his campaign doesn't , and Palin certainly does n't but if they end the campaign like this , with so much hostility and negativity that just ruins their parties reputation even further than Bush already did .
So it 's up to McCain , to get all of his Republican slaves to ... shut the fuck up .
Obama '08 .

Per Wikipedia , " The roof is on fire " originated with Rock Master Scott and the Dynamic Three ( who were African American ) as a single in 1984 .
It gained widespread popularity from the re-mix performed by the Bloodhound Gang ( white ) .
Can we put that issue to rest and just go with the general awesomeness of this video ?
I love it so much I keep trying to find new people to show it to - and my standard for passing things on is pretty high .

Yes , this video is dead on and absolutely hysterical ... uh ... only if it were n't so " true " .
I do n't know if I should laugh or cry .
I have relatives who are hard core , over the top right wing bible thumping conservative Mennonites .
Yes ... concientious objectioning peace loving PLAIN Mennonites ( think " Amish Lite " ) .
They believe those lies about Obama .
All of it .
Hook line and sinker .
They believe it as if it were written in stone by God himself .
No amount of proof or discussion could convince them otherwise .
Any argument against these " truths " are just lies directly from the devil himself .
When McCain speaks to them it might as well be Jesus himself returned to lead the nation to the Christian heaven .
If Jesus returned tomorrow and supported McCain they would not even blink .
Saddly ... they felt exactly the same way about Bush .
These are MENNONITES .
Not your average run of the mill Christians .
They make Sarah Palin look like an alcoholic hedonistic drug addicted child murderer .
They do n't cut their hair , shave their legs , where makeup .
80 year old women with hair long enough to reach their ankles ( of course it 's kept up in a bun with a covering ) .
And NOW ... they support war and love John McCain .
they do n't see any hypocrisy in this whatsoever .
This video could be shown to people like that and they would AGREE WITH IT , not ever suspecting that it was intended as humor .
They are that clueless .
They are quite frankly ... that stupid .
I could send them a link to this and they would not understand .
I 'm not kidding .
I 'm serious ... no really ... they would n't get it .

Hey Jay ,
What 's happening ... is your little hater acting up again ?
There has been so much in the news ... Political wise .
I keep checking back to see what your thoughts are .
Like the previous poster am not American but we seem to tune in for different reasons .
As much as I like / Love Hip Hop and grew up in Hip Hop ... I am drawn to your political outburst .
( Perhaps moving to Turkey is off the table . :-) )
Anyhow as the election draws near ... Days to go .
Tell that little hater to get out of your way !
Cause folks like me can't be in your hood to experience what 's happening ... we can only depend on unfiltered rants like yours to vicariously experience the political vibrations of the folks living it .

The gun used to kill Toronto police officer Todd Bayliss in 1994 was stolen .
The World War II souvenir was taken from a locked closet .
A handgun implicated in the Boxing Day 2005 shooting of student Jane Creba was also procured by illicit means , among countless other examples , criminologists say .
That 's why gun amnesty programs , such as the novel one by Toronto police that begins today , are so important .
" It 's one of the many measures that can help , " Ryerson professor and gun control advocate Wendy Cukier said yesterday .
" When guns are removed from homes , it reduces the chance they are misused or stolen ...
That can have an impact on public safety . "
The amnesty program , Pixels for Pistols , is a joint endeavour with the 26 - store Henry 's camera chain , based on Church St. in Toronto .
For four weeks , Toronto residents who hand over a gun , legal or not , will receive a digital camera , either a Nikon Coolpix S52 or a Coolpix P60 , listed at $ 230 and $ 190 on the Henry 's website .
The offer includes photography lessons .
Henry 's is asking that no one show up at a store with a gun .
Toronto police advise those wanting to turn in a firearm to call ( 416 ) 808-2222 to arrange pickup .
They say gun owners across Ontario have been inquiring about the exchange program , which is available only to locals .
Among the callers was John Hope , who keeps a trigger lock on the 9 - mm Beretta stowed in his Bracebridge home .
He says he 's eager to give up the gun so it does n't land in the wrong hands – a criminal or suicidal teenager , say .
Since he can't trade it for a camera , he now plans to throw it into the middle of a lake .
" There 's no way someone 's going to go down 200 feet to get a gun he does n't know is there , " he said .
Cukier said the interest shown in the program suggests support for the police effort .
Surrendering of guns tucked away in homes , she said , gets them out of harm 's way .
About 30 per cent of guns reaching the black market have been stolen , York University criminologist James Sheptycki said .
" And guns have a long life , " he said .
" They remain dangerous weapons for 50 years .
At least . "
OCTOBER 15 --Meet Kathleen Allmond and her son Tony Ray .
According to cops , the duo cremated Allmond 's 84 - year - old mother Ramona last December in a backyard barbecue pit at their secluded northern California home .
Ramona Allmond , who suffered from dementia , apparently died in the home she shared with her 50 - year - old daughter and grandson .
Investigators allege that after Ramona 's death , Allmond and Ray continued to collect her Social Security checks and retirement benefits for 11 months ( which resulted in the pair 's arrest Sunday for embezzlement , as well as elder abuse and conspiracy ) .
Foul play is not suspected in Ramona 's death .
Tehama County Sheriff 's Department deputies learned of Ramona 's demise after a relative requested a welfare check on the woman , who had not been heard from for about a year .
Allmond and Ray , 30 , cremated Ramona in a small concrete pit that they had used weeks earlier to cook the family 's Thanksgiving dinner .
Allmond and Ray are each being held in the Tehama County jail in lieu of $ 30,000 bail .

John McCain enlisted Sarah Palin in part to bolster his standing with the Republican party ’s religious base .
Unfortunately for McCain – and Palin – some Catholic leaders are questioning the Alaska governor ’s spiritual tolerance .
Frank L. Cocozzelli , head of CrossLeft , and his peers today released a statement today scrutinizing Palin ’s association with the New Apostolic Reformation , a movement Cocozzelli claims has a “ long , strong streak of anti-Catholicism . ”
… Bishop Thomas Muthee , who has spoken repeatedly at the Wasila Assemblies of God Church and personally blessed and anointed Governor Palin in 2005 , engages in what NAR terms “ spiritual warfare ” – with an aim to de-Catholicize communities and nations .
“ Brazil is occupied by Catholics , ” declared Muthee in a militant sermon he gave on March 14 , 2004 at a United Kingdom church , ‘ but people are being saved anyway ! ” C. Peter Wagner says that the Roman Catholic Church is under the sway of a great demon he calls the “ Queen of Heaven . ”
Top NAR leaders go on spiritual warfare expeditions to try to decrease the power of this “ demon . ”
…
“ As a Catholic , ” said Cocozzelli , “ I am deeply concerned about Governor Palin ’s ongoing involvement with Pastor Ed Kalnins and Bishop Thomas Muthee , both of whom are engaged in the anti-Catholic New Apostolic Reformation movement . ”
In fairness , we do not know what Governor Palin believes .
But her involvement with this movement requires us to ask , Does Sarah Palin share this view of Catholicism ?
Does she view Catholicism as demonic or anything other than a legitimate , international faith ?
CrossLeft goes on to demand that Palin either make clear she does n’t agree with NAR ’s beliefs and to explain why she associates with the “ religious bigots of the NAR movement . ”
That ca n’t be good ….
One of the most important developments in human civilisation was the practice of sustainable agriculture .
But we were not the first - ants have been doing it for over 50 million years .
Just as farming helped humans become a dominant species , it has also helped leaf - cutter ants become dominant herbivores , and one of the most successful social insects in nature .
According to an article in the November issue of Microbiology Today , leaf - cutter ants have developed a system to try and keep their gardens pest - free ; an impressive feat which has evaded even human agriculturalists .
Leaf - cutter ants put their freshly - cut leaves in gardens where they grow a special fungus that they eat .
New material is continuously incorporated into the gardens to grow the fungus and old material is removed by the ants and placed in special refuse dumps away from the colony .
The ants have also adopted the practice of weeding .
When a microbial pest is detected by worker ants , there is an immediate flurry of activity as ants begin to comb through the garden .
When they find the pathogenic ' weeds ' , the ants pull them out and discard them into their refuse dumps .
" Since the ant gardens are maintained in soil chambers , they are routinely exposed to a number of potential pathogens that could infect and overtake a garden .
In fact , many of the ant colonies do become overgrown by fungal pathogens , often killing the colony , " said Professor Cameron Currie from the University of Wisconsin - Madison , USA .
" Scientists have shown that a specialized microfungal pathogen attacks the gardens of the fungus - growing ants .
These fungi directly attack and kill the crop fungus , and can overrun the garden in a similar fashion to the way weeds and pests can ruin human gardens . "
A curious observation was that some worker ants had a white wax - like substance across their bodies .
When they looked at it under a microscope scientists discovered that this covering was not a wax , but a bacterium !
These bacteria are part of the group actinobacteria , which produce over 80 % of the antibiotics used by humans .
The bacteria produce antifungal compounds that stop the microfungal pathogen from attacking the garden .
This discovery was the first clearly demonstrated example of an animal , other than humans , that uses bacteria to produce antibiotics to deal with pathogens .
" Research in our laboratory has revealed a number of interesting properties between the bacteria and the pathogenic fungus .
The bacteria appear to be specially suited to inhibiting the pathogenic fungi that infect the ants ' fungus garden , " said Professor Currie .
The interaction between the ants and their fungus crop , and the ants and the bacteria is known as a mutualistic relationship .
In general a mutualism is established when both members of the interaction benefit from the relationship .
In the ant–fungus mutualism , the ants get food from the fungus .
This mutualism is so tight that if the fungus is lost , the entire colony may die .
In return , the fungus receives a continuous supply of growing material , protection from the environment , and protection from disease - causing pests .
So what do the bacteria get out of producing pesticides for the ants ?
" For starters , they get food .
Many species of fungus - growing ants have evolved special crypts on their bodies where the bacteria live and grow .
Scientists believe that the ants feed the bacteria through glands connected to these crypts , " said Dr Garret Suen , a post - doctoral fellow in Professor Currie 's lab .
" Also , the bacteria get a protected environment in which to grow , away from the intense competition they would face if they lived in other environments such as the soil . "
" Interestingly , the tight association between ant , bacteria and pathogen will sometimes result in the pathogen winning .
This interplay has been described as a chemical ' arms race ' between the bacteria and fungus , with one side beating the other as new compounds are evolved , " said Professor Currie .
" At the moment , we are beginning to understand the chemical warfare at the genetic level , and it is likely that these types of interactions are more prevalent in nature than previously thought . "
So how exactly does an ant go about forming partnerships with a fungus and a bacterium ?
No one really knows .
With new advances in molecular and genetic technologies , such as whole - genome sequencing , Professor Currie and Dr Suen hope to discover how these associations were established , and to understand how these interactions resulted in the remarkable fungus - growing ability of the ants .

I am afraid that the experiments you quote , M. Pasteur , will turn against you .
The world into which you wish to take us is really too fantastic .
La Presse , 1860
It ’s just a theory .
Not evolution .
Germ theory .
Just a theory , one of many that account for the etiology of diseases .
I should mention my bias up front .
I am , as some of you are aware , an Infectious Disease doctor .
My job is simple : me find germ , me kill germ , me go home .
I think there are three causes of disease : wear and tear , genetic , and germs .
Perhaps a bit of an exaggeration , but not much .
My professional life for the last 22 years has been spent preventing , diagnosing , and treating the multitudinous germs that a continually trying to kill or injure us .
It is a fundamentally futile job , as in the end I will be consumed by the organisms I have spend a lifetime trying to kill .
I would have though that the germ theory of disease was a concept that was so grounded in history , science and reality that there would be little opposition to the idea that germs ( a broad term for viruses , bacteremia , fungi , parasite etc ) cause infections and some other diseases .
Wrong .
There are people who deny the validity of germ theory .
Add there are people who deny gravity .
And evolution .
Opponents of germ theory come in two flavors :
Germ theory deniers .
Those who propose alternative mechanisms of disease .
There is great overlap between the two categories , and the division serves more as a literary device for the sake of exposition than a true description of reality .
Germ Deniers
The germ deniers put forth as their patron Saint Antoine Bechamp , a contemporary of Louis Pasteur .
Bechamp lived from 1816 to 1908 , the dawn of modern medicine and the beginning of microbiology .
No one had a clue in the 1800 ’s as to the cause and treatment of diseases and there were many speculations and experiments performed in an attempt to understand and treat diseases .
Most people had a life expectancy less than 50 years and the predominant cause of morbidity and morality was infectious .
Since we do not die young of infections and we get to live long enough to die of cancer , heart and vascular disease .
Before the 1900 ’s , if you could understand what caused infections , you could understand most diseases .
The foundations of microbiology and infectious diseases are based on the work of Pasteur and Robert Koch .
Like Darwin , the insights of Pasteur and Koch are not the end of understanding of infectious diseases , but the beginning .
The world is far more complicated and subtle than Pasteur and Koch could appreciate with the scientific tools of the time .
Pasteur , of course , performed the experiments that proved that germs existed and were a cause of some diseases .
His name is well known and lives on in pasteurization , the heating of milk to kill microorganisms and prevent the spread of disease , one of many contributions he made to medical sciences .
His insights , which lead to antibiotics , hygiene , and vaccines have undoubtedly prevented more morbidity and mortality than any human in history .
Another contemporary of Pasteur was Robert Koch , who , among many accomplishments formulated Koch ’s postulates , conditions that were to be met to prove the infectious cause of disease :
The organism has to found in all cases of the disease
The organism has to prepared and maintained in a pure culture
The organism had to be capable of producing the original infection , even after several generations in culture
The organism retrievable from an inoculated animal and cultured again .
Modern biochemistry and molecular techniques have refined Kochs postulates .
We ca n’t always grow the organism but we can isolated its DNA .
Given the species specificity of some germs , we cannot always infect animals to prove causation .
I doubt anyone would want to prove the cause of Ebola by re-inoculating a human with cultured virus .
Also , there is great variability in the ability of many germ strains to cause disease and great variability in the hosts immune system to combat diseases .
Some germs are more virulent than others .
Some people are some or less susceptible to disease , and the last 10 years have seen an explosion in understanding of the variability in the human immune system ( polymorphism ’s ) that explain why some people get ill from a given pathogen and others do not .
The combination of germ theory and Koch ’s postulates , improved and refined by biotechnology , are still the cornerstones of infectious diseases .
Pasteur , Koch and their contemporaries began the science of infectious diseases and microbiology , a field that has lead to more benefits to mankind than perhaps any other .
What do the germ deniers offer as a alternative to Pasteur et. al. ?
The theory of Antoine Bechamp and others called pleomorphism ( 1 ) .
CELLULAR THEORY ( BECHAMP )
Disease arises from micro-organisms within the cells of the body .
These intracellular microorganisms normally function to build and assist in the metabolic processes of the body .
The function of these organisms changes to assist in the catabolic ( disintegration ) processes of the host organism when that organism dies or is injured , which may be chemical as well as mechanical .
Microorganisms change their shapes and colours to reflect the medium Every disease is associated with a particular condition .
Microorganisms become “ pathogenic ” as the health of the host organism deteriorates .
Hence , the condition of the host organism is the primary causal agent .
Disease is built by unhealthy conditions .
To prevent disease we have to create health .
Bechamp ’s hypothesis was , at the time , no more or no less reasonable than other ideas .
Unfortunately for him , a century and a half of research has demonstrated that there he was wrong on all the particulars of his ideas , except for 7 and 8 .
Postulates 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 6 are all flat out false .
From 1950 to November 2nd 2008 at 9:50 am PST , there were 909 , 599 citations on Pubmed relating to infections .
How many papers and experiments were done in the 100 years prior to 1950 I do not know , but it is a safe bet that germ theory is supported by over a million studies and experiments .
A Pubmed for terms to support pleomorphism finds zero references .
Germ theory is as confirmed a concept as science can offer .
Cellular theory lost the battle to experiment .
Reality and science supports the ideas of Pasteur , not Bechamp .
Alternative practitioners are drawn to the concepts of Bechamp because the reason for disease is that the body fails .
Alternative providers are all about supporting health to allow the body to heal itself .
Bechamp lends credibility to many alternative practices .
Here is where it gets weird .
Rather than look at the mountains of evidence to support germ theory and the complete lack of evidence to support pleomorphism as the reason for the dominance of germ theory , they resort to paranoid sounding conspiracy theories .
The Whale is a good source for this kind of thinking and is representative of what you will find if you browse the web :
How did Pasteur ’s ideas become the foundation of organized medicine ?
Politics .
Pharmaceutical economics .
Early in his career , Pasteur was decorated by the Emperor Napoleon .
His position as a scientist was thereby secured , even though he was only a chemist and had no credentials at all in medicine or physiology …..
For the first time in history , things were coming into focus .
Discoveries were being made about fundamental issues , but in a piecemeal fashion .
It was perfect timing for an opportunist to take advantage of the general uncertainty and lack of understanding and to claim that he understood all the issues involved , and furthermore had thought of them first .
Pasteur was noted for his habit of playing both sides of the fence on issues he did n’t understand , and then later , to quote the parts of his earlier writing that supported the later finding , always with the claim that he had been there first .
Only the scientists understood the complexities of these emerging ideas .
The royal court and the press just knew that something was going on , and though they did n’t know what , were going to act as though they did .
And for them , a chameleon like Pasteur was the perfect frontman .
Politics never changes .
The same type of thinking that imprisoned Galileo long ago for discovering that the earth went around the sun , the rulers ’ eternal attempt to control the minds of their subjects , these are the forces that cast Pasteur , an ambitious opportunist , into a position he may not have deserved – the supposed Trailblazer in the science of modern biomedicine .
Funny how things often do n’t really get “ discovered ” until the commercial aspects of that discovery have been worked out .
or
Béchamp ’s research revealed that the inner condition of a person ’s cellular terrain determined whether disease would manifest or spread in the body .
He proved through rigorous scientific method that disease was not due to germs attacking the body from the outside as Louis Pasteur later convinced the world .
What you eat , breathe , drink , and bathe in are the primary factors that determine your body ’s inner condition .
Instead of incorporating Béchamp ’s discoveries to bring about a health revolution in the world and save countless lives , greedy , power hungry industrialists decided to ostracize his work and put their dollars behind Louis Pasteur ’s “ Germ Theory of Disease ” because it was a way for them to build a colossal pharmaceutical / medical empire for profit .
No pharmaceutical company in the world today cares one iota about curing disease .
They want to control disease and focus on symptom suppression so they can make huge profits by getting you to become a lifelong user until you die from their poison .
That ’s why they go to war against disease with all their “ anti ” this and “ anti ” that medications instead of addressing the inner condition of a patient and re-establishing homeostasis in the body . ( 2 )
This is weird not only because it denies over a million interrelated studies that confirm germ theory , but Pasteur ’s fundamental ideas were confirmed about 60 years before the discovery of penicillin .
That is just how subtle and clever big Pharma is : they suppressed a theory because they knew that 60 years in the future they would make a fortune selling antibiotics .
Someone needs to send Big Pharma the JREF million dollar prize .
Then there are HIV deniers , who live in a bizarro world of their own .
My medical career started with the onset of the HIV epidemic .
I have seen HIV go from zero understanding about the disease and a 9 month life expectancy to amazing detail about the biochemistry and pathophysiology of HIV and an almost normal life expectancy for many AIDS patients .
There are 191,000 plus articles on Pubmed concerning HIV research .
The astounding accumulation of data to support HIV as a cause of AIDS and the benefits of applying that understanding to the treatment of AIDS is triumph of the modern medical - industrial complex .
It is why I have one AIDS patient die this century after a decade of AIDS deaths .
Application of germ theory saves lives .
Millions and millions of lives .
Of course , that is just what they told me to say .
Alternative mechanisms of disease
There are a multitude of alternative mechanisms of disease : blocked chi in acupuncture , blocked innate intelligence in chiropractic , toxin build up in the colon , etc etc .
What these alternative therapies share is a lack of appreciation or understanding of germ theory .
Since germs cannot be seen , and since it is not germs but their alternative theory that causes disease , why would you expect alternative providers to behave as if germs exist ?
The result of believing that germs do not exist is infections .
The germs will always win .
Acupuncture and Infections
Acupuncture is unique compared to most alternative practices in that it is invasive and because acupuncturists actually do something to accomplish nothing .
Stick needles into people and you can drag in all kinds of germs .
I have a healthy respect for needles and the damage they can cause by practitioners who understand germ theory .
A review of adverse events associated with acupuncture demonstrated that “ Infection accounted for 204 primary reports and 91 secondary reports .
Over 60 % of these cases were hepatitis B .
The next most common infection was of the external ear , as a complication of auricular acupuncture ( 3 ) . ”
Cellulitis , bacteremia , endocarditis , empyema , osteomyelitis , endophthalmitis , abdominal abscesses , epidural abscesses and infected joints are well described complications of acupuncture .
Blood borne pathogens such as HIV , hepatitis C and hepatitis B are associated with acupuncture .
Mycobacterium abscesses and Mycobacterium chelonae outbreaks have occurred due to acupuncture .
Needles are dangerous , and while the body has good defenses against infectious complications of minor trauma , the defenses fail on occasion .
One would think acupuncturists would clean the skin before needle insertion , but a review of skin disinfection for acupuncture states : “ Disinfection of clean skin before injection is not generally considered necessary and observations of lack of infection following injections without prior skin disinfection support this ( 4 ) . ”
Another review suggests that “ none the less , good infection control is essential ” but that assumes the practitioner understands and appreciates germ theory as a cause of infectious diseases .
Infection after penetrating trauma is uncommon , a rare event under most circumstances .
I would guess that many reading this have evidence of minor skin trauma right now and are not infected .
It is what the immune system is for .
One of the lessons you learn in medicine is there is a difference between what one can get away and what is the best practice for all patients .
Most of the time you do not need to wash your hands or prep the skin or do any of the procedures that decrease the risk of infections .
Most of the time you can get away with being sloppy .
But the more you practice infection control procedures , the greater the odds that the patient will avoid infection .
Of course , there is the underlying assumption that you think germs cause disease .
If not , why bother ?
There are a smattering of infections treated with acupuncture ( UTI , skin infections , arthritis ) in the medical literature ; one can only wonder why .
I suppose the acupuncture will support immune health a foster the innate healing process .
I would rather kill bacteria .
But then , I would .
Chiropractic and Infections
Two studies have cultured chiropractic exam tables and found pathogens , including methicillin resistant staphylococcus .
Apparently chiropractors are not particularly fastidious at disinfecting their exam tables .
Why would they ?
Germs are not necessarily the cause of disease in their world view .
I am particularly drawn to one of the conclusions : “ Rudimentary behavioral changes to improve chiropractic clinic infection control are needed . ” Rudimentary .
Not an enthusiastic vote that the education chiropractors received in school was in infection control .
I note chiropractic schools offer microbiology , and again I wonder why .
It would not appear to be for the purpose of learning rudimentary infection control .
But why should they feel inclined towards good infection control practices ?
The cause of disease is not germs , it is due to blocked innate intelligence .
It maybe less of an issue currently , but chiropractors long opposed germ theory and a google using chiropractor and germ theory as search terms finds no shortage of chiropractors who oppose the concept of germs causing disease .
Given the huge variability in chiropractic practice , it is difficult to know if such lack of understanding of germ theory is typical of the field or not .
Other practices
There was an outbreak of colonic amoebiasis associated with colonic irrigation .
Thirty six people developed the disease and 10 required colectomy .
“ Tests of the colonic - irrigation machine after routine cleaning showed heavy contamination with fecal coliform bacteria .
The severity of disease in this outbreak may have been related to the route of inoculation . ”
Colonic irrigation is done to cleanse the colon of toxin build up that causes disease .
It is an idea for the cause of diseases that has no bearing on reality and colonic irrigation is useless for removing toxins or curing diseases .
Why concern yourself with germs and their transmission to others , since they are not a cause of disease .
It is no surprise that the cleaning was not optimal
Moxibustion has been associated ( and yes I know association is not causation ) with a spinal epidural abscess and with a Pasturella abscess .
The other complication of moxibustion is burn injury , which is fertile soil for infections .
It is no surprise that this procedure would be associated with infection .
Naturopathic care is associated with a case of prosthetic valve endocarditis with P. acnes after unnecessary vitamin injections .
Other alternative modalities have fewer or no reported infections associated with them probably because they do not do anything .
The recent 50 facts about homeopathy suggested “ The chances of contracting MRSA or C. Difficile at a Homeopathic Hospital are extremely rare . ”
Of course it is .
An intervention that does nothing cannot have an infectious complication .
Doing nothing results in nothing .
What unites many alternative practitioners is their opposition to vaccines .
Germs do n’t cause disease , so why prevent infections with vaccines ?
Like many practices with alternative medicine practitioners , it is difficult to know how pervasive anti-vaccine sentiments are .
CAM also lends support to the “ anti-vaccination movement .
In particular , sections of the chiropractors , the ( non-medically trained ) homoeopaths and naturopaths tend to advise their clients against immunization .
The reasons for this attitude are complex and lie , at least in part in the early philosophies which form the basis of these professions ( 5 ) . ”
In other words belief in magic prevents understanding of infectious diseases and germ theory .
Chiropractors often advise against vaccination and do not vaccinate their own children .
There is a contingent chiropractors of who are against vaccines , but to what degree they represent chiropractors as a whole I can not say .
Since Chiropractors are not required to use evidence to base their practice , there appears to be fewer standards and greater variability as to what what constitutes chiropractic practice .
Attitude by health care professionals can influence decisions to vaccinate , and 27 % of chiropractors in one survey advised against childhood vaccination ( 7 ) .
In another series where a fictitious patient asked for vaccination advice on the internet , of 93 homeopaths and chiropractors , “ no homeopath and only one chiropractor advised in favor of the MMR vaccination ( 8 ) . ”
Advice from chiropractors , homeopaths , naturopaths and other alternative practitioners against vaccinations abounds on the web , it is difficult to tell from the published studies if this dangerous advice is the norm for these practitioners or the deviant recommendations of the more extreme of the already irrational .
The studies are few and small in number , but disturbing in their implications .
Chiropractors and naturopaths are pro childhood infection .
Anti-vaccination is often spun as an issue of choice “ Concerning immunization information , a much higher proportion of faculty ( 91 % ) and students ( 80 % ) than practitioners ( 62 % ) felt chiropractors should provide both pro and con information to patients ( 6 ) . ”
It may be that the biggest source of infections from alternative medicine practitioners is not what they do but what they do not do .
The only studies I can find on vaccine refusal concerns religious exemptions .
I wonder how many who refuse vaccinations do so because of information obtained from chiropractors , homeopaths , naturopaths and other alternative practitioners .
I looked for , and could not find , studies that examined how compliant various alternative providers are with rudimentary hand hygiene and other infection control recommendations .
In science based medicine , where germs are an accepted etiology of disease , compliance with hand hygiene has historically been poor .
Rates for hand washing have typically been less than 50 % in a group of people who allegedly think germs exist .
Thanks to intensive education and focus this century , hand hygiene rates have gone up at all my hospitals .
It has been gratifying to see as the compliance with infection control has increased , the rates of hospital acquired infections have dropped .
The last 19 years that I have been the Chair of our Infection Control committee has seen the continuous and relentless decline in infections at all my hospitals .
That is one of the side effects of applying evidence based medicine and germ theory to the hospital : infections decrease .
Any useless anecdotes from readers ?
Did your chiropractor wash her hands ?
Your naturopath ?
Your primary care doc ?
If not , you should perhaps seek care elsewhere .
All of the infections associated with alternative medicine modalities are unusual .
I also suspect that the infectious complications associated with alternative medicine are under reported because it takes time and effort to report cases .
I have seen a handful of infections ( and other complications ) associated with alternative therapies and have neither the time nor inclination to report them formally to a journal .
I am certain someone will mention in the comments all the morbidity and mortality us real doctors cause on a regular basis .
Health care is not , unfortunately , risk free , and I know all too well the improvements that could be done to improve patient safety .
I also know the enormous strides we have made in preventing hospital acquired infections during my career .
I used to be able to make a living off hospital acquired infections and the last 19 years have shown a steady decrease in nosocomial infections at my hospitals to the point where some have not had a nosocomial pneumonia in over a year .
In medicine we have to weigh the risks of what we do with the benefits we hope to gain .
In the world of alternative medicine , there is all risk with no benefit .
See http://whatstheharm.net/ for more anecdotes ( not data ) .
Beliefs in disease causation have consequences .
Believing that germs do not cause disease does n’t affect the germs .
They are out there waiting for the opportunity to invade and try and kill you .
