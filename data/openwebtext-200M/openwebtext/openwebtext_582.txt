Introduction
The film can cannon is a simple project that can be made with things that you have laying around .
I used to make them when I was a kid .
The cannon only takes a few minutes to put together .
When finished , you have a small hand held cannon that can fire peas , marbles and other small , round objects .
What you need
An empty film can
A rubber band ( not necessary )
A balloon
A cutter
How to make it
Cut the bottom off the film can so that it is open in both ends .
Make sure that you make a nice cut .
The edge of the can should n't be sharp and pointy .
You might want to use a sand paper to make the edge smooth , but it is not necessary .
Slip the balloon over the end of the film can that you just cut off .
This is the tricky part of the project .
Inch the balloon all the way over the can .
Pull the balloon through the film can .
Depending on how narrow the balloon is , you might need to put one or a few rubber bands around it to prevent it from slipping off when you fire the cannon .
Using the cannon
Put the ammo in the balloon , pull back and fire !
Ms. Silverstein was a healthy 24 - year - old law student when she suddenly developed heart failure from a virus and required an emergency heart transplant .
“ Sick Girl ” is the harrowing account of her 17 - year journey through our health care system , told in unflinching detail .
Despite being a transplant surgeon , I flinched a lot while reading her story .
Ms. Silverstein is often at odds , angry even , with her doctors .
And her behavior mystifies some of her doctors in the same way patients have sometimes mystified me .
As I read through “ Sick Girl , ” I found myself flipping between Ms. Silverstein ’s and her doctors ’ points - of - view .
I thought back to my own reactions to patient choices , then combed through Ms. Silverstein ’s prose in an attempt to understand her  and my patients ’  motivations .
I also began to think more and more about one patient in particular , a young woman I ’ll call Donna .
I met Donna early on in my transplant training when it was a habit of mine to wander through the wards at night .
She was always wide awake , so I began to stop by her room to chat .
There , in the middle of the night , we would talk about our favorite books and movies , clothes and relationships , until my beeper went off and pulled me away .
But I never asked Donna about her decision , a decision that both horrified and intrigued me .
Given a liver transplant a decade earlier , Donna had been one of the great patient success stories .
On her regular follow - up visits , she had delighted the clinic staff with her wicked sense of humor , sartorial style and seemingly “ normal , ” un- transplant - like life .
How to wall - mount your TV : a step by step guide
Looking to wall - mount your television ?
Here 's everything you need to get started – and how to get outside help too if you need it .
If you could gather all the food you needed for a single day in a half hour of work , then your food would be very cheap .
If you lived in a less productive natural environment and had to spend eight hours a day gathering all of the food you needed , then your food would be very expensive .
In order to produce an economic output , you have to invest production resources .
At a minimum some amount of human labor must be invested .
There is no such thing as a labor - free production process .
Even if you lived in a sparsely inhabited tropical paradise filled with streams jumping with large tasty fish and heavily laden fruit trees growing profusely in the natural forests , you would still have to spend some amount of time gathering fruit and fish .
This is a guest post by Roger Brown , known as Roger K , whose graduate work was in physics .
In reading about net energy and EROEI , he realized that energy balance alone is insufficient for characterizing the economics of energy production .
In this post , he develops a multi-variable approach to account for the cost of other production resources .
This post is the first publication of his innovative ideas .
A summary is available at the end of the post .
Notice that a natural scale for labor costs exists due to the fact that , on average , the labor of one human being supports one human being .
The smaller the percentage of total time that is spent gathering food , the lower the cost .
This natural scale may be inapplicable to a subset of individuals within a society if income inequality exists .
To take an extreme case , suppose that an absolute monarch is served by an army of slaves .
The slaves support themselves at a subsistence level by means of their work , and the king appropriates all of their excess productivity .
The king 's wealth depends upon the sum of all the excess output that he appropriates from his slaves .
If the army of slaves is large enough , the king could still be rich even if the excess wealth provided by each slave is small .
That is the king could be wealthy even if the labor cost of production was high in the sense described above .
However , for society as a whole the natural scale of labor cost still applies .
Insofar as economic production depends primarily on labor , average income is high or low depending on the labor cost of producing economic output .
Of course other inputs besides labor may be important , but in many cases the cost of these inputs can be reduced to labor costs .
Continuing the relatively simple example of a hunter - gatherer society , if wood is used for cooking , then the cost of that wood is the labor required to gather it .
If wood is abundant in the locations where you are doing your hunting and gathering , then the labor cost will be low .
If wood is relatively scarce then the labor costs will be high .
If clay pots are used for cooking and eating , then the cost of production can be reduced to the labor cost of gathering clay , forming pots , and firing them .
And so forth .
Special considerations arise when the input to the production process is the same as the output of the process .
Consider gathering food .
You have to burn calories in the process of obtaining calories .
If the amount of calories burned exceeds some background rate of energy consumption , then the excess calories reduce the net benefit of the food gathering process .
To take a specific example suppose that , on average , one particular food gathering technique produces 1000 calories and burns 200 excess calories in an hours worth of effort .
Then the net energy production per hour is 800 calories .
Now suppose that a second food gathering process exists which burns only 100 calories per hour and produces 500 calories .
In this case the net energy production per hour is only 400 calories .
In spite of the fact that the second food gathering process has the same ratio of output energy to input energy as the first process it is more labor intensive , and therefore economically inferior to the first if labor is a limiting factor of production .
Of course energy balance plays a role in determining the labor efficiency of energy production .
In order to quantitatively analyze this labor efficiency I introduce the following notation :
O = Output energy
P = Energy input to the production process
N = O - P =
Net output energy
R = Non energy resource input to the energy production process ( in this case labor hours )
The labor efficiency of energy production is the net energy produced divided by the labor hours expended :
Labor Efficiency = N/R .
This equation can be rewritten as :
[ 1 ] Labor Efficiency = ( N/ O ) / ( R/O ) = µ/r
Where µ = N/O and r = R/O .
The variable µ is the fraction of the output energy which is left over after the input energy has been subtracted out .
I call this number the energy utilization rate .
It is the fraction of the output energy which is available to produce goods and services other than energy .
The rest of the output energy must be diverted to producing a new batch of energy or the economy will come crashing down into ruins .
The variable r is the resource intensity ( or resource cost ) of gross energy production .
It is the amount of resource ( in the case given above , labor hours ) that has to be expended to produce 1 unit of output energy .
In the example given above both food gathering processes have µ=0.8 but have different values of r ( 0.001 hours / calorie and 0.0005 hours / calorie respectively ) .
So far I have been talking about the case where labor is a limiting factor of production .
If labor were not a limiting factor of production , might it not be true that energy balance is the only relevant factor in energy production ?
The answer to this question is no .
Some non-energy resource is always relevant to the economics of energy production .
Of course it is possible for other non-energy related factors of production such as supplies of fresh water or of arable land to be limiting factors of production , but the only case in which some non-energy related factor of production is not relevant to the economic quality of energy production is the case of energy production by magic .
For example , to return to the case of a sparsely populated tropical paradise , suppose than when you wake up in paradise each morning , manna from heaven sufficient for your day 's nutritional needs has appeared on the ground beside you .
This is truly free energy production and , as such , negates the need for economic analysis .
If all that you need is provided without effort , then economics , defined as the practice of apportioning the use of scarce resources , does not exist .
Even if you had to clap your hands once before the manna appeared , the difference between this process and absolutely free energy is too small of be of any practical importance .
If , on the other hand , every time you clap your hands a small amount of energy appears , and you need to clap your hands for several hours a day to produce a useful amount of energy , then economic analysis can be applied to this process .
The net energy produced per hour of labor is an important parameter in analyzing the economics of this process .
Yes , the energy balance matters .
If clapping your hands burns up a significant amount of excess energy , then this energy must be accounted for in determining the productivity of this process , and it is accounted for by the factor µ in the above expression for the labor efficiency of energy production .
Energy and Labor Optimization of Economic Output
Now I wish to discuss the optimization of the apportionment of a scarce resource in economic production , and in particular , the apportionment of labor .
Therefore I will consider an economic system in which the only limiting factor of production apart from energy is labor .
One might object that this is not a realistic case since raw materials are always required in addition to energy and labor .
However , labor is always limited since , on average , the labor of one human being supports one human being , whereas the supply of raw materials could be effectively infinite .
Even if you had an endless copper mine , the amount of time it takes to extract and smelt a given amount of ore limits how much copper you can produce in a given period of time .
So my assumption is that raw materials are available in large abundance relative to any short to intermediate term use we might have for them and the amount we produce is limited by how much labor we choose to expend in extracting them .
I will also assume that energy production is only limited by the amount of labor dedicated to the energy extraction process .
If we dedicate a larger fraction of our labor hours to extracting energy our net energy increases , but the number of labor hours available for utilizing this energy in the manufacture of useful products and services decreases .
In some sense labor is the only real cost in this system .
We do not give economic output to coal deposits or to deposits of metal ore .
We give economic output to people who extract useful outputs from these deposits .
Of course in the real world we do give economic output to the ' owners ' of natural resources in the form of economic rent , and we give money to the providers of capital in the form of interest .
Such costs are not labor costs .
However , I would argue that rent and interest are political costs and not real physical costs .
That is to say that no physical reason exists why rent and interest have to be paid in order produce economic output .
Of course , I have been assured over and over again by a variety of people that any attempt to eliminate rent and interest will inevitably result in the creation of a monstrous , inefficient , socialist bureaucracy .
This claim may or may not be correct , but at present I am inquiring into the physical basis of wealth so that I will ignore these non-physical costs of producing wealth .
To be concrete suppose that you are alone on an island and are therefore producing all of your own economic output .
In this case no one exists to receive payments of rent and interest .
A fuel source is available that provides µ/r units of energy per hour of labor with no limit on how much energy can be obtained other than the number of hours worked .
The question which I wish to enquire into is what fraction of total labor time should be dedicated to producing energy and what fraction should be dedicated to using that energy to produce useful goods and services .
In order to answer this question we must consider the use of technology in the process of economic production .
The primary function of technology is to improve the productivity of labor .
A hunter armed with bows and arrow will gather more meat per hour of hunting than one armed with a spear .
A root gatherer armed with a digging stick will collect more kilograms of roots per hour than one using only his or her hands .
Wheeled carts will allow a human being to transport a larger amount of mass per hour than ordinary human locomotion .
And so forth .
Adding external energy sources to the mix further improves labor productivity .
If a horse is used to transport the hunter , he can cover more ground in a given period of time and take more game .
If an ox is attached to a wheeled cart then the amount of human effort required to transport a given mass of material drops dramatically .
The use of fossil fuels did not qualitatively change the direction technological improvement to economic production .
Their use merely accelerated the rate of improvement in productivity .
In my view it is impossible to separate productivity into separate contributions made by labor , tools , and energy .
There is no such thing as a labor free process .
No matter how automated the machinery used , someone has to build and maintain the machines , extract and deliver the energy which runs the machines , and so forth .
Energy does not ' replace ' labor ;
It creates a more productive synergy of labor and tools .
Properly speaking one can only speak of the productivity of a given economic synergy and not the productivity of the individual components of that synergy .
Labor productivity can be used as a metric , but labor productivity cannot really be separated from the overall productivity of all inputs to the production process .
In order to discuss this productive synergy I will introduce a concept which I call the average productivity function P . I define P as the average productivity per hour of labor in the non-energy producing sector of the economy .
I will assume that P=P[ E ] where E is the energy per worker hour available in the non-energy producing sector of the economy .
What form might the function P [ E ] take ?
One possibility is that it is a linear function of E .
In this case , if I double the energy per worker hour I double my productivity .
If I triple the energy per worker hour I triple my productivity , and so forth .
It is easy to show , however , that if productivity increases linearly with E forever , then an absurd conclusion will be reached .
Suppose that I work a total of H hours and I spend a fraction f of those hours obtaining energy and fraction 1 - f using that energy to provide useful goods and services .
The net energy available for the production of useful goods and services is :
Net Energy = H×f×µ/r
Since the hours worked in the non-energy producing portion of the economy are H× ( 1 - f ) the energy per worker hour is given by :
[ 2 ] Energy / Hour = E = ( µ / r ) ×f/( 1-f )
If the average productivity is linearly proportional to C×E ( where C is a constant ) , then the total production will be proportional to H× ( 1 - f ) times this number :
Total Production = C×H×( µ/r ) ×f
From this equation we see that total production increases with f without having a maximum .
That is , if I worked at harvesting fuel all year along until one hour before I knocked off for my New Year 's Eve celebration , I would be more productive in the remaining hour than if I had stopped gathering fuel at any earlier time .
This conclusion is obviously absurd .
One can reach the same conclusion by considering a factory that employs 1000 people .
If 999 people are fired the remaining employee has 1000 times as much energy available per hour as he or she did before the layoff , so that under the assumption of a linear relation between energy per hour and productivity one employee could match the output of 1000 employees .
Therefore a strictly linear relation between energy / hour and productivity is not possible .
As energy use per hour increases , the marginal return on additional energy use per worker hour must decrease .
The graph below depicts qualitatively the general form that P [ E ] must take :
I have depicted P[ E ] going to zero as E goes to zero .
One could also have P intersect the E=0 axis at a positive value corresponding to some background level of productivity obtainable with human muscle power only .
The E axis has the same units as µ/r , the net energy produced per hour of labor in the fuel producing process .
The units of this axis are not important as one can define a new energy / hour scale by setting E’=k ×E where k is a constant .
Any point on the P[ E ] curve can be reached for any energy source with a positive value of µ/r by simply making the hours spent in the non-energy producing part of the economy arbitrarily small .
However , at each point on the P[ E ] curve , only one value of µ/r makes the total productivity a maximum at that point .
That is to say that for a given function P[ E ] of the form shown , there is an optimum operating point for an energy source of a given quality as measured by µ/r .
The total production will equal P times the hours spent in the non-energy producing portion of the economy .
That is the total production is given by :
Production = H× ( 1 -f ) ×P
From the expression for E given above ( equation [ 2 ] ) we can solve for f in terms of µ/r :
f = E/( E+µ/r )
Therefore P [ E ] × ( 1 - f ) can be expressed as a function of E . The particular function given is P [ E] =ln ( E+1 ) .
On the following graph I show the P [ E ] × ( 1 - f ) vs. E for three different values of µ/r. I have chosen the values of µ/r so that the maxima correspond the E=24 , 130 , and 800 ( The same values marked in the previous figure ) .
Note how slowly the maximum total production drops off compared to the energy per worker hour E .
This slow drop - off is a consequence of the shape of the productivity curve P [ E ] .
Of course the function P [ E ] =ln ( E+1 ) is just an arbitrary function that has the right qualitative behavior , so that no quantitative conclusion can be reached from this particular example .
However , a more general result can be derived from the differential geometry of the P[ E ] curve without knowledge of the complete function P [ E ] .
In order to derive this result it is convenient to regard P[ E ] as a function of f via the equation E = ( µ / r ) ×f /( 1-f ) .
In figure 3 I show P× ( 1 - f ) as a function of f for the same three values of µ/r .
It can be seen that the three values of E chosen correspond to f=0.15 , 0.20 , and 0.30 respectively .
That is as the quality of the energy source ( as measured by µ /r ) decreases then the fraction of labor dedicated to extracting fuel increases .
Again this example depends on the specific properties of the function ln( E+1 ) .
A general result for the values of µ/r and f which maximize the total productivity = P×H × ( 1 - f ) can be derived by taking the derivative with respect to f and setting it equal to zero .
The total hours worked is constant , so that maximizing P× ( 1 - f ) is sufficient to solve the problem .
I give the proof in an appendix and here I merely state the results making reference to the following figure :
At a given point on the P[ E ] curve the value of µ/r which maximizes the total production is given by :
µ /r = [ P / ( dP/dE ) ] -
E
This equation can be rewritten as :
( dP/dE ) × [ ( µ / r ) +E ] = P
Inspection of the figure shows that µ/r is equal to minus the intersection of the tangent line with the E axis :
µ/r = E0
The fraction of labor dedicated to fuel extraction which , combined with the value of µ/r given above , maximizes production at the given point on the P[ E ] curve is given by :
f = ( dP/dE ) / ( P/E )
This number is the ratio of the slope of the tangent line to the slope of the chord from the origin .
The chord from the origin corresponds to a linear increase in productivity / hour with energy / hour .
As I showed previously , with such a linear dependence labor productivity can be increased without bound so that f would have no maximum .
The above result shows that the maximum occurs when f is equal to the ratio of the marginal increase in productivity with increasing E to the average increase in productivity with respect to E .
The equation for f can be rewritten as follows :
f = [ E × ( dP/dE ) ] /
P
Inspection of the figure shows that E×( dP /dE ) is equal to P - P0 where P0 is the intersection of the tangent line with the P axis .
Thus f is given by :
f = ( P - P0 ) / P = 1-( P0/P)
The total production achieved at this operating point is :
Production = H×P × ( 1 -f ) = H×P0
H×P is the total production that would be achieved at the given value of E if free energy were available so that all labor effort could be dedicated to producing useful goods and services .
Therefore P0 is the effective productivity per hour achieved for all labor hours including those dedicated to producing fuel .
The following figure shows the tangent line and chord to the P[ E ] curve for the case that f=0.15 .
The above results make it clear that within the parameters of this simplified economic model , the characteristic of a high quality energy source is that a small amount of effort spent gathering fuel drives the economy to a point where the marginal return on further energy use is small .
Without such a small marginal return on additional use of energy , total production could be further increased by dedicating more resources to further energy extraction .
This conclusion is independent of knowing the explicit form of the P[ E ] function .
Thus the idea that that we could substantially back off our energy use while maintaining reasonable levels of productivity is supported by this model .
Up to now I have been talking as if the labor efficiency of energy production were an unchanging constant , and as if the productivity function P[ E ] was a fixed and eternal mathematical form .
Neither of these statements is correct .
In the early days of fossil fuel use the labor efficiency of fuel production was being increased steadily both through the discovery of newer higher quality reservoirs of fuel and through advancing extraction technology .
The productivity function P[ E ] also depends on the quality of non-energy resources available ( ore grades , etc. ) as well as on the general advancement of technological knowledge , on the quantity and variety of the existing set of physical tools , and on the built up infrastructure of society generally .
The economic problem that we are faced with now is a potentially large degradation in the quality ( e.g. higher labor and other resource intensities and lower energy balance ) of the energy sources available to us and potentially a degradation in the quality of other resources as well ( e.g. the necessity of using lower grade metallic ores ) .
These changes will put a large burden on our technological prowess to maintain increasing levels of productivity .
Some people claim that in the era of cheap energy , we were careless about energy use , so that a lot of low hanging fruit exists with respect to improvements in energy efficiency .
If our economic goal is to produce physically and psychologically healthy human beings with a minimum consumption of resources , this claim may well be true .
But if our goal is to produce growth in the traditional economic sense , this conclusion is questionable .
The above analysis suggests that even in the days of cheap energy , energy use was limited by the marginal utility of energy , so that a high motivation for increasing the efficiency with which energy is converted into economic value has always existed .
If oil is such a unique , valuable , possibly irreplaceable resource , then why have we been using it to tool down the freeway at high speed encased in tons of metal ?
If that same energy could have produced a lot more value in some other part of the economy , why did n’t it naturally flow there ?
The answer to this question may well be that in a culture in which the lawn , jet airplane tourism , home theater systems , etc. have become part of normal life , SUVs and luxury cars are the highest value marginal use of that form of energy that we could come up with .
Yes , as energy prices rise , the most marginal uses will disappear first .
It is far from clear , however , that we will necessarily be able to produce equal or larger value elsewhere in the economy .
In any event , it is clear that in a growth oriented economy we will always push out along the curve of marginal utility as swiftly as we can .
No matter how clever we are at increasing our manufacturing efficiency , the tendency of the economy will be to push up against the limits of available energy resources as fast as possible .
If on the other hand , if we were to decommit from the goal of continuous growth and instead try to maintain a given quality of life with a minimum consumption of resources , then the combination of backing off on total per capita energy use along with efficiency improvements might allow us to maintain a decent quality of life even in the face of decreasing energy quality .
Multiple Resource Costs of Energy Production
I will now consider the role of other resources than labor used in the production of energy .
I now suppose that multiple non-energy resources R0 , R1, R2 ... , Rn are input to an energy production process that outputs a total amount of energy O .
As before I will assume that the energy input is P so that the net energy output is N=O - P .
I will assume that R0 is labor since no such thing as a labor free production process exists .
If the other non-energy inputs have labor and energy embedded in their production , I assume that these inputs are included in P and in R0 .
You might ask if the embedded labor and energy have been subtracted from the input of a given resource is there any cost left over ?
In some cases the answer is no , while in other cases opportunity costs exist that are not captured in the embedded energy and labor .
For example we cannot create high quality soil and arable land merely by the application of energy and labor , and since the supply of land and soil are finite there are opportunity costs associated with using these resources to produce energy rather than food .
As another example , consider the water required to process oil shale in the relatively arid American west .
There are opportunity costs associated with using the available supply of water to produce fuel that cannot be captured by the labor and energy costs of delivering the water to the shale processing site .
I mentioned embedded energy above , and before proceeding with an analysis of the benefit to cost ratio of energy production in the case of multiple input resources , I want to introduce a concept which I have found helpful in clarifying the role of embedded energy .
I call this concept the working reserve of energy .
In order to run our economy effectively we need piles of coal , pipelines full of natural gas , tanks of refined petroleum fuel , stockpiles of uranium fuel rods , etc sitting around available for use by various economic producers .
Energy producers pull fuel out of these stockpiles , but unlike other producers they also put fuel back into these same stockpiles , which I call the working reserves of energy .
In order for the economy to keep running on an ongoing basis the energy producers must keep the reserve full .
That is they must not only replace the fuel that they themselves remove but also the fuel removed by all other economic producers .
Withdrawals of fuel by energy producers can be direct or indirect .
That is they can directly purchase fuel to run their machinery , or other producers can draw out fuel and create output which they sell to the energy producers for use in the fuel extraction process .
This indirect withdrawal of fuel from the working reserves is embedded energy .
So now let us consider the benefit to cost ratio of producing energy under the simple assumption of the economic equivalence of all forms of energy which is generally ( though incorrectly ) used for energy balance calculations .
Since multiple input resources are involved we need some method of converting resource quantities into units of a universal scale of value .
Whether it is truly possible to objectively define such a scale in the real world may be doubted , but we cannot make progress in economic analysis without assuming that it exists .
Therefore I will assume that the value of a unit of energy is Ve and the opportunity cost of dedicating one unit of a non-production resource Ri to the energy production process is Ci .
The benefit of energy production in our universal scale is then given by :
Benefit = Ve×( O - P ) = Ve×N
Where O is the gross output energy , P is the energy consumed in the production process ( both directly and indirectly ) and N=O - P is the net energy produced .
You might try to argue that Ve×O is the benefit of the energy production process , but this claim is false .
The very last time you run an energy production process you can claim the whole output as a benefit , since you do not have to reinvest any of the energy to produce more energy .
But the extra energy P that you get from this last batch is balanced by the energy P that you had to beg , borrow , or steal to process your first batch .
In between , the production energy used in processing any particular batch of energy is not available to the rest of the economy .
The cost of producing the net energy N is given by :
Cost = C0×R0 + C1×R1 + ...+ Cn×Rn
The opportunity costs Ci are not the same as market prices .
For one thing embedded labor and energy cost have been subtracted out ( except for C0 which is the opportunity cost of dedicating a unit of labor to the energy production process ) .
As I pointed out previously , a finite resource such as land or fresh water may have opportunity costs associated with their use which are not captured in the embedded labor and energy .
Note that input energy is not included as part of the cost .
It subtracts from the benefit but does not add to the cost .
This claim may require some further explanation .
As I mentioned previously , when the first batch of energy is produced from a new energy production process the input energy P must obtained from somewhere .
Either some energy producer must process some extra energy , or the use of energy elsewhere in the economy must be curtailed .
This initial input of energy is a cost .
However , after the first batch of energy is processed and the output is placed in the working reserves , the energy producer has effectively provided the input for his or her next batch of energy .
( I am assuming a positive energy balance . )
For succeeding batches of energy no other energy producer has to provide extra energy .
No other economic process has to forego the use of energy .
Finally , when the last batch of energy is processed the initial input energy is recovered .
Therefore society has incurred no net energy cost from the existence of this process .
The benefit to cost ratio is given by :
Benefit / Cost = ( Ve×N ) / ( C0×R0 + C1×R1 + ...+ Cn×Rn )
Dividing the numerator and denominator of this expression by the gross output energy O gives an interesting expression for the benefit to cost ratio :
Benefit / Cost = ( Ve×N / O ) / ( C0×R0/O + C1×R1/O + ...+ Cn×Rn/O )
I rewrite this equation as :
Benefit / Cost = ( Ve×µ ) / ( C0×r0 + C1×r1 + ...+ Cn×rn )
Where µ=N/O and ri=Ri/O. Clearly µ is the energy utilization rate discussed earlier .
The values ri=Ri/O I call the resource intensities or resource costs of gross energy production .
The value ri represents the amount of resource required to produce 1 output unit of energy .
The values µ and r0 , r1 , ... , rn are physical parameters that depend on the nature of the energy producing process .
In particular r0 is the labor intensity of energy production which I discussed previously .
The parameters Ve , C0 , C1 , ... , Cn are not physical parameters and are not constants .
They are complex functions of the operation of the entire economy , among other things depending on the total scale of the economy and on the quality of natural resources available .
Nevertheless if one takes a snapshot of the economy at a particular instant of time Ve , C0 , C1 , ... Cn may be regarded as approximately constant with respect to the extraction of a marginal unit of net energy and may therefore be used ( assuming one really knew how calculate them ) to estimate the benefit to cost ratio .
Note that with respect the physical parameters of energy production , two different ( though often related ) effects can lower the benefit / cost ratio .
The energy balance as represented by the energy utilization rate µ rate can go down , or the resource intensities of energy production can go up .
Often times both effects occur at the same time .
Oil produced from oil shale has a lower energy balance than conventional oil and the labor and fresh water intensity of producing a barrel of oil from this source is much higher than for conventional oil .
In order for an energy production process to provide any economic benefit the benefit / cost ratio must be greater than 1 , which implies that :
( C0×r0 + C1×r1 + ...+ Cn×rn ) / Ve < µ
The left side of this equation is the ratio of the non-energy cost of producing a unit of energy to the value of the unit of energy so produced .
Since not all of the energy produced is available for the production of useful goods and services the upper limit on this cost ratio is µ rather than 1 .
If this ratio is much smaller than 1.0 , then very small values of µ can be economically justified .
I call this limit the magic wand limit of energy production .
If large quantities of energy could be harvested with trivial expenditures of labor and other non-energy related resources , then net economic value could be produced even with very small energy balances .
On the other hand , if this ratio is >=1 then the energy production process in question is economically useless no matter how good the energy balance may be , since the value of the non-energy resources consumed is equal to or greater than the value of the energy produced .
For example , suppose you found a magical energy crop which grew and harvested itself without human intervention .
The energy rich sap of some species of tree flowed out of the trees through underground channels and filled a natural reservoir .
You go to the reservoir once a year and find that it is full of fuel .
If dedicating that land to energy production meant that you would starve to death , then you would not give a damn about the perfect energy balance ( or the infinite EROEI if you prefer ) .
Remember that the opportunity costs
Ci are not constants .
For example , if you use currently fallow land to produce fuel the opportunity cost of dedicating that land to energy production could be close to zero .
On the other hand , if biofuel production is ramped up to the level where a large fraction of farm land is being dedicated to the production of fuel , then the opportunity cost of dedicating additional land to producing fuel could become quite high , so that even if the physical aspects of energy production as measured by the energy utilization rate µ and the land intensity of energy production remain constant , the benefit to cost ratio may drop significantly .
As another example , consider the labor cost of producing oil from tar sands .
I have read that in Canada general labor costs are rising as tar sands production rises , so that people trying to hire retail clerks or food service personal are having to pay higher wages because of the competition from energy production .
On average the labor of one human being supports one human being so , that if the fraction of total labor dedicated to energy extraction becomes significant , it can affect overall economic production .
Resource Costs of Energy Production and the Overall Scale of the Economy
Finally I want to discuss in more detail the relation of energy balance to the overall scale of the economy mentioned at the end of the last section .
In this discussion I will make use of the concept of the working reserve of energy which I introduced earlier .
The figure below shows hypothetical working reserves of energy for two economies run off of two different fuel sources with different energy balances ( µ=0.5 and µ =0.9 respectively ) .
I have represented the size of the reserves by the total area of a series of squares .
The energy to the left of the vertical bar is used in the energy extraction process ( directly or indirectly ) .
The energy to the right of the vertical bar is used to produce useful goods and services .
Energy producers naturally put energy into the reserves as well as taking it out .
At the end of the effective lifetime of the reserves they are still full because the energy producers have put back all of the energy that was taken about by all varieties of producers .
If we assume the that working reserves of both fuels are intended to represent energy available for the same time period , then the second energy source provides nine times the net energy of the first energy source in the same time period .
Can we therefore conclude that the relative economic value of these energy sources is in a ratio of nine to one ?
The answer to this question is not straightforward .
The next figure shows the working reserves for the same two energy sources for the case where they are both providing the same amount of net energy .
In order to get from case 1 to case 2 the size of the working reserves and the total rate of fuel production for the energy source with µ=0.5 has been expanded by a factor of 9 .
Naturally this large expansion in energy production could not take place over night .
It would take a substantial period of time to grow energy production by this amount .
In order to achieve such growth one would have to dedicate to energy production a fraction of the total energy larger than the energy utilization rate µ ( =0.5 ) .
So if growth is referred to a yearly time period , then dedicating 54 % of the total available energy to the production of more energy would result in an energy production growth rate of 4 % per year .
As energy production grew the total non-energy resource cost of energy production would also grow .
That is , if labor , land , and water are being used to produce energy , we would have to continuously expand the amount of these resources being dedicated to this process .
If there are negative externalities associated with energy production and consumption these are also growing as energy production grows .
These resource costs and the negative externalities determine the economics of a given fuel source and not the disappearance of energy during the production process per se .
Of course , the energy balance does affect these resource costs since , all other things being equal , a smaller energy balance implies a larger total energy extraction and a larger resource cost to produce the same amount of net energy .
The resource cost multiplication factor can be derived as follows .
Recall that the cost of producing energy is given by :
Cost = C0×R0 + C1×R1 + ... + Cn×Rn
Where R0 is the labor input and Ri are other resources whose costs cannot be reduced to the embedded labor and energy .
We are interested in the cost per unit of net energy produced so we divide by N and do a bit of algebra :
Cost / N = ( O/N ) × { C0 ×R0/O + C1×R1/O + ... + Cn×Rn/O}
Recalling that Ri/ O=ri ( the resource intensity of energy production ) we find :
Cost / N = ( O/N ) × { C0×r0 + C1×r1 + ... + Cn×rn}
The quantity in curly brackets is the cost of production of 1 unit of gross output energy , so that the required cost multiplication factor due to the energy balance is ( O/N ) = 1 / µ .
For the two energy sources depicted in the above figure the values of ( O/N ) are 2.0 and 1.11 respectively .
The ratio of these two numbers is the same as the ratio of the size of the required working reserves .
In general , a fuel source with a low energy balance will be more likely to run into problems of scale than one with a high energy balance as energy production is ramped up to produce a given amount of net energy .
The real problem with biofuels is not low energy balance per se , but the large requirements of land , water , and soil as production is ramped up to high levels .
Of course , the real cost of the scaling up a given energy source cannot be determined in any simple way from the energy balance .
This cost depends on many complex interactions in the total economic system .
Economics cannot be reduced to calculating energy ratios .
Appendix : Derivation of the values of labor efficiency of energy production ( =µ /r ) and of the fraction of labor dedicated to energy production ( =f ) which maximize the total productivity
We wish to maximize the following function :
Taking the derivative with respect to f and setting it equal to zero we find :
We rewrite this equation as :
[ 1 ]
I have shown previously that the energy per worker hour E is given by :
[ 2 ]
Taking the derivative with respect to f we find :
[ 3 ]
From equation [ 2 ] we see that :
[ 4 ]
Substituting this expression for µ/r into equation [ 3 ] we find :
[ 5 ]
If we substitute equation [ 5 ] into equation [ 1 ] and multiply by f we find :
Solving for f we find :
[ 6 ]
Referring to the figure below we see that the fraction of labor dedicated to energy production which will maximize the total production ( = P×H × [ 1 - f ] ) is given by the ratio of the slope of the tangent line to the slope of the chord drawn from the origin .
To find the corresponding value of µ/r we substitute the above expression for f into equation [ 4 ] .
For notational simplicity we set dP/dE = S .
We then find :
This equation can be rewritten as follows :
[ 7 ]
Equation [ 7 ] can be rewritten as follows :
Inspection of the figure makes it clear that
[ 8 ]
To prove that these values of f and µ/r correspond to a maximum of the function P× ( 1 - f ) it is necessary to show that the second derivative of this function with respect to f is less than zero .
The algebra involved is fairly tedious so I will just state the result :
when f and µ/r take on the values given by equations [ 6 ] and [ 7 ] above .
Since f and 1 - f are both greater than zero and the second derivative of P with respect to E is negative for a curve of the shape shown in the figure , we can conclude that P × ( 1 - f ) is a maximum at the values of f and µ/r given above .

Obama rejects McCain call to delay debate RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday September 24 , 2008
Print This Email This By BETH FOUHY
NEW YORK ( Associated Press )  Republican John McCain said Wednesday that he wants to postpone Friday 's debate to deal with the nation 's financial problems , but Democrat Barack Obama said " it 's more important than ever " that the country hear from its next president .
The White House rivals maneuvered to claim the leadership role on the financial crisis that has overshadowed their campaign , leaving the question of whether they will hold their first debate Friday in doubt .
Obama said he would go ahead with his debate preparations , while McCain said he would stop all advertising , fundraising and other campaign events to return to Washington and work for a bipartisan solution .
" It 's my belief that this is exactly the time when the American people need to hear from the person who in approximately 40 days will be responsible for dealing with this mess , " Obama said in a news conference in Clearwater , Fla .
" It 's going to be part of the president 's job to deal with more than one thing at once . "

A few weeks ago we wrote about the biggest record collection in the world being up for sale due to the health and financial problems of it ’s owner .
As it happens , another really interesting record collection has come up for sale .
How would you like to own a 45 copy of the Beatles ’ 1964 hit “ Ai n’t She Sweet ” with picture sleeve ( worth $ 500 ) , or the Beach Boys ’ 1961 hit “ Surfin ’ Luau ” ( worth $ 200 ) ?
Well how about owning every 45 rpm single from the Billboard Top 100 from January 1 , 1955 until December 31 , 1990 ?
Neiman Marcus has acquired an incredible collection of 45 ’s covering 35 years of music history .
It includes hits by Sly & the Family Stone , Hendrix , Janis Joplin , Frankie Avalon , Bobby Darrin , and everyone else you could think of .
A lot of the records are very rare and some are even signed by the original artists .
A total of 18,400 45 ’s are in the lot .
Strangely , Neiman Marcus is a fashion & apparel retailer , so I ’m really not sure how they came to be selling this collection .
I contacted them for more information , but did not get a response before I posted this .
Hopefully , whomever buys this will keep the collection together as a unit , as it ’s value as a historical archive far outweighs it ’s monetary value .
Price ? oh , only $ 275,000 .
[ Python - Dev ] if - syntax for regular for - loops

The exact same argument could be used for list comprehensions themselves .

Not only do LCs make it obvious to the reader that " all this loop does is build a list " , but the speed increases from doing the iteration in native code rather than pure Python are also non-trivial - every pass through the main eval loop that can be safely avoided leads to a fairly substantial time saving .
Generally speaking , syntactic sugar ( or new builtins ) need to take a construct in idiomatic Python that is fairly obvious to an experienced Python user and make it obvious to even new users , or else take an idiom that is easy to get wrong when writing ( or miss when reading ) and make it trivial to use correctly .
Providing significant performance improvements ( usually in the form of reduced memory usage or increased speed ) also counts heavily in favour of new constructs .
I strongly suggest browsing through past PEPs ( both accepted and rejected ones ) before proposing syntax changes , but here are some examples of syntactic sugar proposals that were accepted .
List / set / dict comprehensions ============================
( and the reduction builtins any ( ) , all ( ) , min ( ) , max ( ) , sum ( ) ) target = [ op ( x ) for x in source ] instead of : target = [ ] for x in source : target.append(op(x ) )
The transformation ( " op( x ) " ) is far more prominent in the comprehension version , as is the fact that all the loop does is produce a new list .
I include the various reduction builtins here , since they serve exactly the same purpose of taking an idiomatic looping construct and turning it into a single expression .
Generator expressions ===================== total = sum ( x*x for x in source ) instead of : def _g( seq ) : for x in source : yield x*x total = sum ( _g ( x ) ) or : total = sum ( [ x*x for x in source ] )
Here , the GE version has obvious readability gains over the generator function version ( as with comprehensions , it brings the operation being applied to each element front and centre instead of burying it in the middle of the code , as well as allowing reduction operations like sum ( ) to retain their prominence ) , but does n't actually improve readability significantly over the second LC - based version .
The gain over the latter , of course , is that the GE based version needs a lot less * memory * than the LC version , and , as it consumes the source data incrementally , can work on source iterators of arbitrary ( even infinite ) length , and can also cope with source iterators with large time gaps between items ( e.g. reading from a socket ) as each item will be returned as it becomes available .
With statements
=============== with lock : # perform synchronised operations instead of : lock.aqcuire ( ) try : # perform synchronised operations finally : lock .release ()
This change was a gain for both readability and writability - there were plenty of ways to get this kind of code wrong ( e.g. leave out the try - finally altogether , acquire the resource inside the try block instead of before it , call the wrong method or spell the variable name wrong when attempting to release the resource in the finally block ) , and it was n't easy to audit because the lock acquisition and release could be separated by an arbitrary number of lines of code .
By combining all of that into a single line of code at the beginning of the block , the with statement eliminated a lot of those issues , making the code much easier to write correctly in the first place , and also easier to audit for correctness later ( just make sure the code is using the correct context manager for the task at hand ) .
Function decorators =================== @classmethod def f( cls ) : # Method body instead of : def f( cls ) : # Method body f = classmethod(f ) Easier to write ( function name only written once instead of three times ) , and easier to read ( decorator names up top with the function signature instead of buried after the function body ) .
Some folks still dislike the use of the @ symbol , but compared to the drawbacks of the old approach , the dedicated function decorator syntax is a huge improvement .
Conditional expressions =======================
x = A if C else B instead of : x = C and A or B
The addition of conditional expressions arguably was n't a particularly big win for readability , but it * was * a big win for correctness .
The and / or based workaround for lack of a true conditional expression was not only hard to read if you were n't already familiar with the construct , but using it was also a potential buggy if A could ever be False while C was True ( in such case , B would be returned from the expression instead of A ) .
Except clause =============
except Exception as ex : instead of : except Exception , ex : Another example of changing the syntax to eliminate potential bugs ( in this case , except clauses like " except TypeError , AttributeError : " , that would actually never catch AttributeError , and would locally do AttributeError=TypeError if a TypeError was caught ) .
Cheers , Nick .
P.S. There 's a fractionally better argument to be used in favour of allowing an if condition on the for loop header line : it does n't just save a newline or improve consistency with comprehensions and generator expressions , it saves an * indentation level * .
And that gain is exactly the rationale that was used to begin allowing : try : ... except : ... else : ... finally : ... instead of requiring the extra indentation level : try : try : ... except : ... else : ... finally : ...
However , even that argument is greatly weakened in the for / if case by the fact that the indentation level is being saved by moving the if condition up and to the right after the for loop details , whereas in the try - statement case there were absolutely no downsides ( the redundant try keyword was simply dropped entirely ) .
So I 'm personally still - 1 when it comes to incorporating an if clause directly into the for loop syntax - it 's only necessary in the GE / LC case due to the fact that those do n't support statement - based nesting .
( Tangent : the above two try / except examples are perfectly legal Py3 k code .
Do we really need the " pass " statement anymore ? ) --

Spain 's Supreme Court has overturned the convictions of four people found guilty of involvement in the 2004 Madrid train bombings .
The four were among 21 people convicted last year over the attacks , which killed 191 people .
The court also upheld the acquittal of an Egyptian suspected of masterminding the attacks , because he had already been convicted of the offence in Italy .
However it convicted and jailed one of those originally found not guilty .
The Spanish man , who was sentenced to four years in prison , had earlier been cleared of helping to supply the explosives used in the Madrid attacks .
Mastermind boast ?
The Egyptian man , Rabei Osman Sayed Ahmed , had been cleared of involvement in the bombings in October .
Rabei Osman Sayed Ahmed had already been convicted in Italy
As he had already been sentenced to eight years in prison in Italy for belonging to a terrorist organisation , the court ruled he could not be convicted again for the same crime .
Prosecutors had argued that Sayed was appealing against the Italian judgement and technically had not been convicted .
Sayed 's lawyers in that case are challenging key evidence - a recording in which he apparently boasts of masterminding the bombings .
They say the voice heard is not his , and that it has been mistranslated .
Al - Qaeda inspired Last October , a Spanish court cleared three men of masterminding the attack and acquitted seven others , while convicting 21 people for involvement in the attack .
Many victim support groups were angered by the acquittals and said the sentences handed down were much lower than those requested by the state attorney .
The decision to overturn some of those convictions due to insufficient evidence will not please these groups , says the BBC's Danny Wood in Madrid .
Jesus Ramirez , a survivor of the attacks , said he accepted the court ruling even if he did not agree with it .
" Even though we may oppose it in our hearts , they have more information and have weighed the evidence and made a decision , " he told the Associated Press .
The train bombings killed 191 people and injured 1,800 Meanwhile , Luca D'Auria , Sayed 's Italian lawyer , expressed satisfaction at the verdict .
" Both myself and ( Sayed's ) Spanish lawyer have always imagined it would end this way - I am extremely satisfied , " he said .
The Madrid bombing - in which 10 rucksack bombs tore through four packed commuter trains on 11 March 2004 - was Europe 's most deadly terror attack since the 1988 Lockerbie bombing .
Analysts say the attacks changed the course of Spanish politics because in an election three days later voters ditched a conservative government that at first blamed the bombs on the Spanish separatist group Eta .
Spanish investigators said the bombers were part of a local Islamist militant group inspired by al - Qaeda , but had no direct links to the terror organisation .
They had acted to avenge the presence of Spanish troops in Iraq and Afghanistan , said investigators .

TrueCrypt 6.0 : Better Software for the Paranoid
by Ostatic Staff - Jul. 07 , 2008
You and I may have taken the 4th of July off , but the folks over at TrueCrypt did n't .
Instead , they pushed out version 6.0 of their on - the - fly encryption utility , with more options than ever for protecting - and hiding - the critical data on your hard drives .
Available for Linux , OS X , and Windows , the software is licensed under its own TrueCrypt license , which is not OSI - approved .
The basic idea behind TrueCrypt is " plausible deniability " - that someone who examines your hard drive , even someone who demands and gets your password , should n't be able to find all of the encrypted data .
They employ a variety of strategies to achieve this , starting with the fact that you can hide a TrueCrypt - encrypted file system inside of any file .
You can also put a " hidden volume " on the drive - a TrueCrypt volume inside another TrueCrypt volume , which is statistically indistinguishable from random noise .
TrueCrypt can use a variety of algorithms for its encryption , including AES , TwoFish , Serpent , and combinations of these .
The developers have been good about dropping support for algorithms that have been significantly weakened over the software 's lifetime .
There are two significant upgrades in version 6.0 .
First , TrueCrypt now performs parallel encryption and decryption operations on multi-core systems , giving you a phenomenal speedup if you have more than one processor available .
Second , it now has the ability to hide an entire operating system , so even if you 're forced to reveal your pre-boot password to an adversary , you can give them one that boots into a plausible decoy operating system , with your hidden operating system remaining completely undetectable .
TrueCrypt is n't necessarily for people who have illegal secrets to hide .
If you travel with your laptop , and it contains any sensitive information - from your address book to company records - serious encryption is your best protection in case of theft .
Remembering a few passwords , and installing a well - tested open source package that uses them , is a small price to pay for peace of mind .

You Say Desperation
But I just watched ABC Nightly News with incredulity .
They said the McCain campaign said it had a “ great week . ”
The anchor turned to Stephanopoulos and said “ Is that true ? ” George said , “ Yes it is .

Oh and they played the “ The One ” ad with no irony or commentary to the effect that it was the fourth straight negative ad .
New bombshell for McCain as blonde lobbyist is forced to deny having an affair with him
John McCain ’s bid for the White House suffered another bombshell last night after a female lobbyist broke months of silence to deny having an affair with the Republican candidate .
‘ I did not have a sexual relationship with Senator McCain , ’ said 41 - year - old Vicki Iseman .
The top Washington lobbyist was speaking for the first time since allegations surfaced in February suggesting the couple had been close before his first run for the presidency in 2000 .
Rumours of an affair between Mr McCain and Vicki Iseman surfaced in February
The timing of the denial has left McCain aides deeply suspicious .
Coming just 18 days before the November 4 election , Iseman ’s remarks threw the scandal back into the spotlight just as Mr McCain was fighting to keep up with rival Barack Obama ’s surging campaign .
Iseman defended herself to the National Journal magazine , saying : ‘ I never had an affair or an inappropriate relationship with Senator McCain , and that means I never acted unethically in my dealings with the senator . ’
Iseman , who is a partner in the lobbying firm of Alcalde & Fay , told the magazine : ‘ I have never even been alone with Senator McCain . ’
When the story broke , the allegations of sex and influence - peddling caused a sensation .
John McCain addresses the annual Al Smith Dinner at the Waldorf Astoria in New York last night
The New York Times said that in 1999 , McCain aides worried that the Arizona senator and the lobbyist may be having a fling .
The newspaper did n’t publish any evidence of a relationship .
Mr McCain furiously denied the story and described Iseman as merely a friend .
‘ At no time have I ever done anything that would betray the public trust , ’ he said at the time .
Since then , Mr McCain 's relationship with the media has grown increasingly cool .
In the run-up to the election , the story had been largely forgotten and his second wife , Cindy , has been ever - present at his side during campaign events .
Barack Obama speaks as John McCain looks on at the dinner last night
Now he faces the prospect of being thrown back on the defensive just at a time when he was launching an all - out attack to gain ground on his Democrat opponent .
Iseman reportedly claimed : ‘ The New York Times set out to write a story about a ' romantic relationship ' in exchange for legislative favours .
Make the lobbyist a prostitute - pretty heady stuff .
The only problem was , they were wrong on all counts . ’
The latest twist on the campaign came as the FBI confirmed they were launching a nationwide probe into the activities of ACORN , the left - wing activist group accused of faking voter registrations by using bogus names like Mickey Mouse .

Obama camp : ' Disgusting lies , ' ' not worthy '
Sensing , perhaps , a turn in the media against McCain 's stunts , Obama spokesman Bill Burton puts out a scorching statement :
“ We will take no lectures from John McCain who is cynically running the sleaziest and least honorable campaign in modern Presidential campaign history .
His discredited ads with disgusting lies are running all over the country today .
He runs a campaign not worthy of the office he is seeking , ” said Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton .

We 've shown before that since his naming as Tim Russert 's interim replacement how completely one - sided Tom Brokaw has been in terms of Republican framing .
But this truly takes the cake .
After letting McCain spokesman ( and Official WATB ) Steve Schmidt let loose with a bunch of lies ( more on that later ) against Obama that campaign manager David Axelrod easily shows for the crap it is , Tom Brokaw in the interest of fairness cites an NBC / WSJ poll that says that more Americans think McCain is " best equipped " to be Commander in Chief .
AXELROD : What has happened is , as Sen .
Obama predicted from the beginning , that we got distracted in Iraq and now Osama bin Laden , who is the person who attacked the United States , killed 3,000 American citizens is now resurgent .
He is stronger and that is the result of the misbegotten decisions of John McCain and he stubbornly wants to continue , even as the Iraqis wo n't take responsibility , sitting on $ 79 billion of their own surplus , while we spend $ 10 billion a month .
It does n't make sense .
We can't take more of the same , Steve .
BROKAW : In fairness to everybody here , I 'm just going to end on one note and that is that we continue to poll on who is best equipped to be Commander in Chief , John McCain continues to lead in that category , despite the criticism from Barack Obama by a factor of 53 to 42 percent in our latest NBC / WSJ poll .
See , here 's the problem , Tom .
I have the latest NBC / WSJ poll ( .pdf ) taken September 19 - 22 .
Guess what ?
THOSE NUMBERS AREN'T IN THERE .
Pulled out of thin air , or an orifice of your choice .
In fact , in the MSNBC.com political coverage of this poll , the headline read : Obama Up 2 in NBC / WSJ Poll .
So where exactly are these numbers , Tom ?
If you go to Gallup , the lead is even stronger ( 50 to 42 % ) , which is pretty close to the numbers you attributed to McCain .
So Tom Brokaw -- in the interest of fairness to whom exactly , I 'm unclear , since he is deliberately MISinforming the public -- tries to mitigate Axelrod 's deft defense of Obama 's judgment by lying and saying that most people believe McCain is still better equipped to be Commander in Chief .
You can leave a comment at the Meet The Press Comment Form on Brokaw 's campaigning on behalf of McCain .
And by the way , Schmidt 's assertion that McCain called for Rumsfeld 's resignation ?
Big fat , stinking lie .
From the Obama campaign :
2008 : McCain spokesman admits he never called for the resignation of Rumsfeld .
" A McCain spokesman acknowledged this week that that was not correct .
' He did not call for his resignation , ' said the campaign 's Brian Rogers . "
[ Washington Post , 2/16/08 ] 2006 : McCain Refused to Join Calls For Rumsfeld 's Resignation , Said He Would Work With Rumsfeld .
" But the president has the right and earned the right as the president of the United States to appoint his team -- and he has confidence in Secretary Rumsfeld .
I will continue to work with Secretary Rumsfeld as much as I can as long as he is secretary of Defense .
We have to , because we need to win this war . "
[ East Valley Tribune , 4/15/2006 ] 2004 : McCain Refused To Call For Secretary Rumsfeld 's Resignation .
McCain would not call for Donald Rumsfeld 's resignation , saying that the President " can have the team that he wants around him . "
McCain said that he respected Bush 's decision to keep Rumsfeld around .
McCain said , " I respect the president .
The president of the United States was re-elected by a majority of the American people , and I respect his right .
And I will work with the president obviously and with the secretary of defense . "
[ MSNBC.com ,
12/15/04 ; CNN.com , 12/5/04 ] 2001 : McCain Echoed Rumsfeld on Case for War. During a November 2001 episode of ABC's Nightline Bush 's Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , former CIA Director James Woolsey and Senator John McCain all made the case for invading Iraq , using the same misleading rhetoric .
Rumsfeld said , " there is no question but that there has been a good deal of interaction between the terrorists in the Philippines and the al - Qaeda and people in Iraq . "
Woolsey agreed , saying " there 's good evidence that [ Iraq ] has been involved in terrorist acts against the United States since -- and quite possibly -- September 11th and even possibly the anthrax . "
Given a chance to oppose Rumsfeld 's strategy at the start , McCain echoed the Administration line : " There has been significant involvement on the part of the Iraqis and Saddam Hussein in the acts of terror that have been committed in the past . "

Full transcript :
BROKAW : I 'm going to end on two notes here , if I can , very quickly .
We have a crowded agenda this morning .
Let 's go back to this business of winning in Iraq if we can .
In fact , a number of people in the Republican side have said we 're winning , but in an interview with the BBC , Gen .
David Petraeus said he did not know that he would ever use the word " victory " about Iraq .
This is not the sort of struggle where you take a hill , plant the flag and go home to a victory parade , it 's not war with a simple slogan .
So is n't it misleading in many ways for Sen.
McCain to say we are winning , we 'll come home when we have declared victory ?
SCHMIDT : Well , absolutely not .
Here 's what victory means in Iraq : it means an Iraqi government that is able to protect its borders and it means an Iraqi government that is able to protect its people that moves forward on its path towards democracy .
This country was losing this war .
Sen .
McCain stood up to the Bush administration , called for the firing of Don Rumsfeld with his political career to advocate a strategy almost by himself that has led us to the edge of victory there .
Sen . Obama opposed that strategy .
In that debate , you heard not one time from Sen .
Obama the words ( sic ) victory .
We must win this war .
This country does n't have a choice .
Sen .
Obama 's judgment on issues of security to this country , whether it is in Iraq or calling Iran a tiny threat or saying that ...
AXELROD : Tom ...
SCHMIDT : ... he would sit down unconditionally with the Iranian President , without preconditions make the world more dangerous .
It is a fundamental consideration for the American people .
AXELROD : It is ... it is ... it is ludicrous to assert after four years of mistake after mistake after mistake , when he did n't challenge Mr. Rumsfeld , when he did n't challenge the Bush policy , when he cheerleaded for it to then say that he was a critic of ...[ crosstalk ] ... just a , just a , just a second , just a second , Steve ...
SCHMIDT : He did challenge Secretary Rumsfeld ...
AXELROD : ... I let you speak , let me finish .
SCHMIDT : Not true ...
AXELROD : What has happened is , as Sen .
Obama predicted from the beginning , that we got distracted in Iraq and now Osama bin Laden , who is the person who attacked the United States , killed 3,000 American citizens is now resurgent .
He is stronger and that is the result of the misbegotten decisions of John McCain and he stubbornly wants to continue , even as the Iraqis wo n't take responsibility , sitting on $ 79 billion of their own surplus , while we spend $ 10 billion a month .
It does n't make sense .
We can't take more of the same , Steve .
BROKAW : In fairness to everybody here , I 'm just going to end on one note and that is that we continue to poll on who is best equipped to be Commander in Chief , John McCain continues to lead in that category , despite the criticism from Barack Obama by a factor of 53 to 42 percent in our latest NBC / WSJ poll .

Posted by David Earls
November 12 , 2004 : Typographer.org has been on a break for the last few months .
New articles are in the pipeline and will be posted soon .
Designing graphics for television is what I do during daylight hours here in London .
But television provides very specific challenges ( and , of course , opportunities ) for setting type .
Designers are increasingly working across multiple media , and those coming from a print background especially may have a culture shock and need to learn some new rules .
Hopefully , the following will help !
History explains all
Firstly , lets look at the technology , its history , and its inherent problems - feel free to skip this part if your eyes start glazing over by all means , but it relates directly to the advice given later , and gives the context of why the advice works .
Television is actually a pretty old technology , and many of the issues I deal with daily are as a result of that fact .
The basic standards are PAL , NTSC and SECAM .
SECAM was developed by the French in a political decision to protect its manufacturing base .
Interestingly , many eastern block countries adopted SECAM for political motives - NTSC is an American system , and PAL was an improved derivative of it .
What better way to delay cultural imperialism than using an incompatible television system ? :)
For our purposes , if you are designing for SECAM , treat it as PAL .
Why the different standards ?
Well , its all originally to do with electricity supplies - in most cases , you 'll find NTSC used in countries with a 60 Hz power supply , and PAL in those with a 50 Hz power supply .
It made things easier for the electrical engineers in a time when analogue was king - the power supply frequency was basically used as a clock , allowing the engineers to time when the next frame of video should be displayed .
As a result , we have different frame rates across the globe .
PAL displays a higher resolution image ( with superior colour ) at 25 fps ( frames per second ) and its lesser parent NTSC works at 30 fps ( well , 29.97 actually , since colour was introduced ) .
What does differing frame rates across the world got to do with typography ?
This is all important , trust me .
So , why does a 60 Hz screen create a 30 fps image and not 60 fps ?
Well , television screens are , for the most part , interlaced screens .
That means that an image is made up of two passes , called fields .
So for example , if an image is made up of , say , 20 lines , then it might be that firstly all the odd line numbers are show , then all the even numbers .
This has two positive effects - field - based video and animations can take advantage of the slight time delay to make fast movement appear smoother to the eye , and secondly , a higher resolution image can be displayed on a low resolution screen , fooling the eye still further .
The downside is that certain types of image will flicker .
Think about it - if you had a pattern made up of alternate white and black lines ( like oh so many trendy websites in the 90s ) , then on a television , it would display as a frame of white , followed by a frame of black .
This is why edges of high contrast can flicker ( buzz or vibrate , as we like to call it in the industry ) on screen .
Next up , safe guides .
I am typing this on my boyfriend 's iBook - its perfect LCD is sharp as nails from edge to edge , and I can see every single bit of the image .
Televisions do n't work in the same way , unfortunately .
Firstly , there is the issue of overscanning .
Televisions , to completely fill the screen no matter what , deliberately display images that go just beyond the edge of the visible screen .
This is called overscanning ( duh ! ) and needs to be taken into consideration for anyone working with television output .
The area of the screen that is generally regarded to be safe for an image is called Action Safe - any critical action within a television signal that must be seen by the viewer is kept within this action safe area .
Next up , televisions , being clunky old CRTs , are not consistently sharp like LCD and other newer display technologies - at the edges , CRTs lose focus and definition .
This is very important for typography as type that otherwise is perfectly readable on screen can blur into an unreadable nonsense .
Therefore , within the action safe area , there is another , smaller area called Title Safe , where it is generally regarded to be safe from loss of focus .
We 've talked about different resolutions , we 've discussed interlacing and fields , and how different countries use different standards with different frame rates , along with overscanning and safe zones , but no word of type ...
On with the type
1 : Love it or hate it , all type on television should be anti-aliased , with no exceptions .
If it is not , the contrast between the type and the backdrop will cause flickering due to interlacing .
2 : Avoid fonts with thin horizontal lines - again , they will flicker like crazy on a television screen due to interlacing , even when anti-aliased and softened .
Try and choose fonts that have at very least two pixels depth on any horizonal lines .
3 : ( Assuming a nominal resolution of 72 pt ) Dont use a font smaller than 18pt ever ever , and try and keep to above 21pt as much as possible .
Besides the issues mentioned in points 1 and 2 , remember the context in which television images are displayed .
You are probably less than a metre ( 3 feet ) from your computer monitor , but you �re likely to be quite a bit further away when watching Friends or Newsnight .
The only possible exception to this is porn , of course .
4 : Pick fonts with a large x -height - that will allow you to experiment with smaller sizes ( below 28 pt ) but remain readable .
5 : Don�t use finely seriffed fonts - the serifs will break down on screen unless they 're set very large indeed .
Slab or wedge serifs are often good alternatives for television though - experiment , but always check on a broadcast monitor or television before committing .
6 : If you are designing for a 16:9 ratio widescreen television , remember that the end design will be anamorphic ( squished ) and will lose some effective vertical resolution .
Try not to choose overly thin , narrow typefaces as they may disintegrate at smaller sizes .
Not the arena to be playing with movie poster fonts !
While we are on the subject , if your widescreen design is shown on a 4:3 ratio normal television letterboxed ( reduced in size so there is a black bar on the top and bottom , rather than having the sides cut off ) , bear in mind that type will be smaller and potentially less readable .
You may want to compensate for this .
7 : For static screens or overlays , Gaussian blur the end screen by " 0.3 " in Photoshop ( or whatever you use ) : this will help with flickering by reducing the contrast between the background and the type .
8 : Be careful of red type , especially if its highly saturated and for use on NTSC systems .
It has a tendency to bleed .
View your designs on a television or a broadcast monitor to be sure if you use red extensively in your designs .
9 : This is where people may disagree with me :
Be wary of very chunky ( Impact springs to mind ) fonts at smaller sizes , they can appear to fill in a little , much like print on newspaper , especially when you soften the type a little to cut back on flickering .
10 : When animating type , experiment with frame blending and motion blur , which can give a smoother result .
Be careful though , as it can hinder readability while in motion , especially below 36pt .
11 : Where possible , recomposite animated type for the system you are using .
For example , if you design for NTSC and need to reversion it for PAL ( this happens a lot ) , the standards conversion process has to interpolate frames from about 30 fps to 25 , or indeed vice versa - this can cause a ghosting / after image effect from frame to frame .
On typography , as it its inevitably high contrast , this can be very noticable .
Secondly , because the resolutions used are different , a converted design will need to interpolate missing pixels - a small loss in quality .
Its more work , for sure , but the results will be smoother and higher quality if you create two versions at the right frame rates and resolutions to begin with .
12 : View your work !
How it looks on your computer screen in your design or composition application will not match how it looks on television .
Check it , ideally from a distance .

Just a week ago , we brought you news that Electronic Arts ' survival horror title Dead Space had its released pushed forward .
Today we have more even better news : the release date has been pushed up again , this time from October 24 to October 14 on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 .
The PC version will ship on October 20 .
We 've also been told by Dead Space community manager Andrew Green that the title has been completely banned from the following countries : Germany , Japan , and China .
That 's right , there 's just too much survival and way too much horror in Dead Space for these countries to handle .
No word on whether EA has any plans to alter the game for a future release in those territories .
I have n't had a chance to go hands - on with Dead Space ( woe is me ! ) , but everyone I 've spoken with who has only had good things to say about it .
Who else is looking forward to donning the trash can - like helmet and killing some monsters ?
Preparations are being made for Lehman Brothers , the fourth - largest investment bank in the US , to file for bankruptcy .
The two strongest potential buyers appear to have pulled out of talks to rescue Lehman - the latest victim of the American credit crisis .
If no new financing comes before Wall Street opens , it will have to seek " Chapter 11 " bankruptcy protection .
This could result in a severe shock to the global financial system , as banks unwind their complex deals with Lehman .
Late on Sunday the US central bank , the Federal Reserve , announced new moves to ease access to emergency credit for struggling financial companies .
The Fed said the step - which broadens the types of securities financial institutions can use to obtain emergency loans - was designed to mitigate the potential risks and disruptions to markets .
In a related move , a consortium of 10 investment banks announced a $ 70 bn ( £ 39 bn ) loan program that troubled financial companies can use to help ease the credit shortage .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The banks - Bank of America , Barclays , Citibank , Credit Suisse , Deutsche Bank , Goldman Sachs , JP Morgan , Merrill Lynch , Morgan Stanley and UBS - each agreed to provide $ 7bn ( £ 4bn ) to the pool .
On Monday , Asian stock markets fell amid concerns over the fate of Lehman Brothers .
Singapore stocks dropped 2.26 % in morning trading and shares in Taiwan fell 1.83 % .
Markets in Tokyo , Hong Kong , Shanghai and Seoul were closed for public holidays .
Lehman employs about 25,000 worldwide , including 5,000 in the UK .
Accountancy firm PWC has already been lined up to run the British operations of Lehman should the firm go into administration .
BBC business editor Robert Peston says UK bank Barclays ' decision to walk away from a Lehman deal was a huge setback for the effort to rescue the Lehman .
Barclays terminated the negotiations because it was unable to obtain guarantees in relation to financial commitments faced by Lehman when markets open on Monday .
Bad bank , good bank
The rescue effort for Lehman was being co-ordinated by the US Treasury and the New York Federal Reserve .
No other large firm should buy Lehman whole - its toxic real estate and securities are too difficult to value
Peter Morici
University of Maryland
Robert Peston 's BBC blog
The US government had hoped to arrange a bailout under which other US investment banks would finance a " bad bank " that would hold the most " toxic " investments of Lehman in the property and mortgage market .
The " good bank " or rest of the firm , including its investment and wealth management arms , would then be sold to another financial institution , for example Bank of America or the UK's Barclays .
Although such a deal would have cost the other investment banks millions , it might have restored confidence in the sector and avoided a sharp drop in the share price of all banks .
However , it appears that this plan is falling apart .
" The only thing that can prevent Lehman collapsing would be a huge injection of taxpayers ' money , " a banker close to the talks told the BBC , but added that US Treasury Secretary " Hank Paulson has made it clear he does n't want to do that " .
Hard choices Bank of America , meanwhile , is said to be unconvinced that buying Lehman would be in the interest of its shareholders .
Instead , according to a report in the New York Times , Bank of America is in " advanced talks " to buy investment bank Merrill Lynch for more than $ 38bn .
HAVE YOUR SAY
It 's amazing that companies which charge high interest to cover risk still need to be bailed out by the taxpayer .
Jack , Canada
Like other US investment banks Merrill has suffered losses of tens of billions of dollars in the subprime crisis , and has seen its share price plummet during recent months .
" No other large firm should buy Lehman whole - its toxic real estate and securities are too difficult to value , " said Peter Morici of the business school of the University of Maryland .
Lehman is up for sale after it reported a $ 3.9 bn ( £ 2.2 bn ) quarterly loss last week amid concerns over its long term financial viability .
The firm 's share price has plummeted as fears over its future have mounted .
Former Federal Reserve boss Alan Greenspan said the US government faced " very difficult decisions " over Lehman if it could not secure a rescue deal that did not involve public funds .
Yet Mr Greenspan said it would be " unsustainable " for the government to bail out every US bank that got itself into difficulty .
Predicting that Lehman would not be the last to require rescuing , Mr Greenspan added that this would not necessarily pose a problem .
" The ordinary course of financial change has winners and losers , " he said .

I do n’t know about the rest of you , but every time I hear the term , “ clean coal power ” and the millions of taxpayer dollars Republicans are intending to throw at it , I get a little nauseous .
Clean coal ?
Are we living in a dark fairy tale ?
How can we listen to Republican leaders spewing these words and not raise a rebuke ?
Why do I feel like I ’m in the silent minority when thinking Republicans , all dressed up with folksy narrative , are so naked underneath ?
The same confident , “ I almost failed out of school ” , let ’s go “ field - dress a moose ” language gushing from the pen’s of McCain and Palin ’s speechwriters mirror that of Bush ’s in 2000 .
They did n’t even bother to change the sentence structure from eight years ago .
The only media member who seems to think this is alarming and disturbing enough to report is Jon Stewart .
Watch this clip .
No , really , please watch this :

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DshaTkR3ZY[/youtube]
The same speechwriting team bringing some of our citizens to their feet in warm regard and support of the least approved president in American history ( twice ! ) are at it again .
The simple idea of coal being somehow “ clean ” compared to renewable energy is laughable .
It is coal .
Packaging it and selling it as “ clean ” is like wrapping up dog poop and .. you know ?
I ’m not even going to bother with an analogy here .
Short story is , coal is a filthy mess .
Ever picked up some charcoal ?
Hands afterward ?
Right .
Black as night .
We burn this stuff to get energy .
Disgusting .
Yet , legislative leaders in states like West Virginia , Alabama , and Kentucky insist millions of dollars in subsidies and R&D dollars are warranted to create “ clean ” coal .
Nobody in the media seems to ask questions about why this is acceptable or even a plausible idea .
Hmm .
I wonder why that is ?
Maybe it has something to do with the fact that 5 corporations replete with shareholders expecting solid quarterly returns filter your national news to suit advertisers .
It makes sense that Republican leaders would want to re-brand coal .
After all , it has been the bread and butter paycheck of their constituents for a very long time .
Phasing coal out of those energy portfolios might be equivalent to Uncle Cletus alerting the family that he ’s gay .

From a very well constructed Alternet post on the attempt to pull the wool over our eyes :
Scientists and environmentalists contend “ clean coal ” does not exist ; it is a misnomer and an oxymoron .
The National Resources Defense Council says that using the term “ clean coal ” makes about as much sense as saying “ safe cigarettes . ”
The extraction and cleaning of coal inevitably decimates ecosystems and communities .
So , right - wing policymakers and shrewd coal industry lobbyists have called for a cleaner , softer , and kinder coal .
You know , the type of coal that makes you all warm and fuzzy inside and lulls you to sleep while it lazily plucks away on a harp ?
Never heard of that coal before ?
Well , you could take a bath with it if you want :
Oh , and trees and mountains love clean coal .
Just like old friends !
The well financed , borderline criminal coal industry spin machine is in full swing :
Playing on stereotypes and employing scare tactics about the unpredictability of the Middle East , the coal industry is developing a Frankenstein - like future for U.S. energy needs …
In Kansas , Gov. Kathleen Sebelius recently blocked plans for two coal - fired electricity plants ; afterward , on Nov. 5 , a full page ad in Kansas newspapers explained that now , because of Sebelius ’ decision , “ Kansas will import more natural gas from countries like Russia , Venezuela and Iran . ”
The ad displayed the grinning faces of the leaders of these countries and continued , “ Without new coal - fueled plants in our state , experts predict that electric bills will skyrocket and Kansans will be more dependent than ever on hostile , foreign energy sources . ”
In fact , Kansas exports natural gas to other states , and the United States does not even import natural gas from Russia , Venezuela or Iran , according to the U.S. Department of Energy .
Guess whose hip pockets the industry is in ?
Excerpted from Palin ’s acceptance speech last week :
“ Starting in January , in a McCain - Palin administration , we ’re going to lay more pipelines … build more nuclear plants … create jobs with clean coal … and move forward on solar , wind , geothermal and other alternative sources . ”
Did you see that ?
They ’re gonna create jobs with clean coal !
As for those other “ alternative energies ” ?
Yeah , let ’s move forward with them by not really creating jobs .
Excellent .
Instead , lets open our pockets to big oil and drill some more .
Then wait !
We do n’t have enough cash and we ’re counting on the votes of all those great folks in Appalachia who need not be bothered with sex education or literacy .
They ’re such proud Americans !
Let ’s make their coal mining jobs respectable in this green new world .
Clean - Coal !
U - S - A! Clean - Coal !
U - S-A !
How about Mr. McCain ’s acceptance speech ?
My fellow Americans , when I ’m president …we will produce more energy at home .
We will drill new wells offshore , and we ’ll drill them now .
We will build more nuclear power plants .
We will develop clean coal technology .
We will increase the use of wind , tide , solar and natural gas .
We will encourage the development and use of flex - fuel , hybrid and electric automobiles .
There you have it , both members of the Republican 2008 ticket .
Drilling for oil .
Cleaning up coal .
Just as a side , did you see how McCain emphasized his words above ?
You may be thinking : “ Emphasized what ?
At least he said they were going to include cleaner cars and wind , tide , solar .
What ’s your problem ?? ” .
Look closely :
“ We will develop clean coal technology ” .
That , friends , is a commitment .
Whereas this ?:
“ We will encourage the development and use of [ all those renewables ] . ”
“ Encouraging development ” is not a commitment .
That statement , clear as day is a , “ We ’ll get out of the way if necessary , it ’d be nice if those technologies got going on their own . ”
All I can think of right now are three words , uttered a multitude of times by the only politician I really felt spoke from his heart at either convention .
You can see it in his conviction .
While nobody was really there to see his speech , plenty took note .
Please , as Dennis Kucinich implores of us , Wake Up America !!
Wake .

A FORMER CIA man died at Manchester Royal Infirmary after the alarm on his heart monitor was mysteriously turned down .
American Alan Bel - who had lived in Salford for 30 years after finishing working for the secretive agency - may well have been saved if staff had been alerted that he was having a heart attack .
Consultant cardiologist Dr Bernard Clarke told a Manchester inquest that `on the balance of probabilities ' , Mr Bel , a retired businessman and pastor , would have survived .
A hospital investigation was n't able to establish who turned the alarm 's volume control down , or when .
Bosses have now employed four extra nurses to monitor patients - at a cost of £ 120,000 a year .
Manchester coroner Nigel Meadows has used new powers to write to the hospital and Hertforshire - based Spacelabs Medical , who make the machine , calling for a more thorough investigation , a review of all monitoring machines at the MRI ; and for machine maintenance to be properly recorded .
Mr Bel , originally from Texas , where he worked for the CIA , had a history of heart problems .
He had a pacemaker fitted in 2000 , but it had to be removed last year and he was hooked up to the monitor .
Mr Bel died of a heart attack last November , half an hour after he was seen alive by nurses .
Investigations revealed the volume on the alarm , which would have alerted staff , had been turned down - and they had not realised this .
Mr Bel 's daughter nurse Carolyn Birtwistle , from Swinton , has employed Manchester - based Pannone LLP to bring a legal case against the hospital to try to make sure this does n't happen to anyone else .
Coroner Mr Meadows recorded a narrative verdict at an inquest on October 13
Mr Bel worked in the CIA until he married , before moving to Salford and setting up his own security business .
He and his wife Diane had five children and nine grandchildren .
Emma Holt , head of clinical negligence at Pannone , said : " This is a tragic case where a life has been lost through carelessness .
I can confirm we are pursuing action against the trust concerned . "
Signing of the United Nations Charter in San Francisco on Jun 26 , 1945
On October 24 , 1945 , the United Nations officially came into existence when its Charter was ratified by the five permanent members of the Security Council ( France , Republic of China , Soviet Union , United Kingdom and United States ) and a majority of other 46 member countries .
To celebrate the UN's birthday ( actually , celebrated as the " United Nations Day " in many countries ) , here are a quick 10 fun facts about it :
1. Failure of the League Of Nations
The first world organization of countries was the League of Nations , founded after the World War I ( back then it was called the Great War or the War to End All Wars - yes , ironic ) .
The aim of the League of Nations was to prevent the repeat of the war .
Benito Mussolini , the prime minister of Italy back then , famously said " The League is very well when sparrows shout , but no good at all when eagles fall out . "
And indeed , just three decades after the founding of the League of Nations , the world plunged into another war , World War II .
2. Churchill in a Bathtub : The Origin of the Name
The name " United Nations " was proposed by US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt to Winston Churchill back in 1942 .
Churchill was in Washington , D.C. then - in fact , he was sitting in a bathtub when FDR was wheeled into the bathroom and proposed that the Allies of World War II be called the United Nations .
( Source )
FDR and Churchill thought that " United Nations " sounded better than the " Alliance , " a name they were thinking of first .
Churchill noted that the poet Lord Byron had used the name to describe the Allies at the Battle of Waterloo in his book Childe Harold 's Pilgrimage :
Here , where the sword United Nations drew ,
Our countrymen were warring on that day !
And this much — and all — which will not pass away .
Ironically , the Allies of the 1815 Battle of Waterloo , which included the Prussian Army ( which later became part of Germany in 1919 ) , fought the French Empire .
France , of course , was later part of the Allies of World War II , who fought Nazi Germany .
3. Rockefeller 's Gift : Land for the UN Headquarters
The land of the United Nations Headquarters in New York City was purchased from real estate mogul William Zeckendorf with money donated by John D. Rockefeller , Jr. Zeckendorf was going to use it to build X City , a futuristic real estate development that failed to get off the ground ( Source ) .
The UN Headquarters building was designed by Le Corbusier and Oscar Niemeyer , and built with an interest - free loan from the United States .
The land and the building of the United Nations Headquarter are considered international territory .
It does n't even meet all of New York City 's fire safety and building codes .
4. United Nations Stamp
The United Nations has its own post office and its own postage stamp !
Though mostly collectibles , you can actually mail stuff using the UN stamps from UN premises in New York , Geneva , and Vienna .
5 . The UN Logo Was First Designed for a Lapel Pin
The logo of the United Nations was designed by Donal McLaughlin , who worked for the Office of Strategic Services ( OSS ) , the precursor of the CIA .
Donal described the UN logo as an " azimuthally equidistant projection showing all the countries in one circle , flanked by crossed olive branches . "
The logo was first designed as a lapel pin .

6. UN Flags and One That Just Gotta Be Different
Agencies and organizations of the United Nations all have their own flags :
The UN official colors are light blue and white .
For some reason , World Food Programme just has to be different : its flag colors are reversed !
7. UN Secretary - General Fun Facts
The head of the United Nations is the Secretary - General .
They are appointed based on geographical rotation , but never from the five permanent Security Council member states .
The current Secretary - General is Ban Ki-moon from South Korea .
He has been described by many as " bland " ( indeed , his nickname is Ban- chusa , or " the bureaucrat " in Korean ) .
When he was elected Secretary - General , however , Ban surprised everyone by singing a version of " Santa Claus is Coming to Town " with the lyrics " Ban Ki-moon is coming to town " instead ) .
Another interesting facts about past UN Secretary - Generals :
- Kofi Annan is a twin , a particularly respected thing in Ghanaian culture .
The Akan people of Ghana often name their children after the day of the week they were born .
His name , Kofi , is given to boys born on a Friday .
- Let 's face it : Boutros Boutros - Ghali has a funny name .
Indeed , an Icelandic soccer team has been named after him !
" Boutros Boutros " once said " The best way to deal with bureaucrats is with stealth and sudden violence . "
We can't agree more !
- Kurt Waldheim got embroiled in the " Waldheim Affair " when it was discovered that he was an intelligence officer for Nazi Germany during World War II .
- Forget " Boutros Boutros , " the UN Secretary with the best name has got to be U Thant .
Actually " U " is an honorific in Burmese , roughly meaning " mister " - his actually name is only " Thant . "
- Dag Hammarskjöld was killed in a mysterious plane crash ( it was rumored that the British MI5 , the CIA , and the South African intelligence services were responsible ) .
He is the only UN Secretary - General to die in office and the only person ever to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize posthumously .
8. Does it Pay to be an Employee of the UN ?
The UN Secretariat employed some 15,000 people worldwide ( in comparison , the Pentagon employed 23,000 people in Washington D.C. alone ! ) .
Salaries for professional staff of the United Nations are determined by the " Noblemarie Principle , " named after the chairman of a committee of the League of Nations who first formulated it in 1920 .
The Noblemarie Principle holds that the UN must pay its staff equally for work of equal value , despite differences in levels of pay in various countries from where they are drawn .
This translates to a base salary of $ 113,000 for the Under Secretary - General , to the bottom salary of $ 32,000 ( Source )
Being a diplomat to the United Nations , on the other hand , has its benefits : because of their diplomatic immunity , many of them refuse to pay parking tickets .
Indeed , 6 countries have an average of over 100 parking tickets per diplomat !

9. Newest Member : Welcome Montenegro !
The newest member of the United Nations is Montenegro , who became the 192nd member in 2006 .
Besides member states , there is one non-member observer state , the Holy See in Vatican City .
10 . Who Pays for the United Nations ?
The UN budget comes from the member states , determined by their ability to pay ( for example , France and the UK were assessed 6 % of the budget , whereas Liberia was assessed 0.001 % , the minimum rate ) .
The United States shoulder the lion 's share : it pays 22 % ( and 27 % of the peacekeeping budget , which is assessed separately ) .
In 2006 , this turns out to be $ 423 million or $ 1.42 per American citizen .
Despite being assessed the most , the United States is constantly late in payment .
By 2005 , the US owed more than $ 960 million in arrears .
Thankfully , it 's not alone : only 40 out the 192 members paid on time - in fact , late payment is considered standard practice by many nations !

I dread to think how many people — who for some mysterious reason are allowed out of the hospital , let alone a vote — think that the next president of The United States is a terrorist Muslim .
And more to the point , what the hell kind of “ news ” papers and TV stations have they been “ reading ” for the last two years to still think that way , just weeks before polls open ?
EDIT : Spotted by Lucy :
It ’s not a suspension of your campaign when you continue to do everything you already had planned for that day .
Yesterday , McCain continued to meet with Her Royal Highness Lady de Rothschild and Sir Bono the Good , then this morning , rather than returning to DC to work on the crisis , McCain continued his campaign schedule in NYC sucking up to Clinton voters at Bill Clinton ’s global initiative .
Mind you , while McCain keeps to his schedule in NYC sucking up to Clinton voters , the actual meeting with Republicans about the economic bailout plan is taking place in Washington – McCain wo n’t be there , just like he was n’t there for pretty much any important vote this year ( it ’s true , he ca n’t multi-task ) .
Then at 11 am , McCain ’s senior economics advisor is busy doing a campaign event with the uber - conservative Washington Times ( she ’s not there as a private citizen ) .
It is n’t a suspension of your campaign when you continue to do everything you were going to do anyway .
By the way , is n’t that Her Royal Highness Lady Lynn Forester de Rothschild to the right ?
On a superficial level , Novell ‘s third quarter , which ended July 31 , 2008 , did n’t look that good .
A closer look reveals though that Novell did quite well in general and extremely well with its Linux business .
According to the company press release , “ For the quarter , Novell reported net revenue of $ 245 million . ”
This was up from Novell ’s net revenue of $ 237 million for the third fiscal quarter 2007 .
“ Income from operations for the third fiscal quarter 2008 was $ 1 million , compared to a loss from operations of $ 10 million for the third fiscal quarter 2007 .
Loss from continuing operations in the third fiscal quarter 2008 was $ 15 million , or $ 0.04 loss per share , due to a $ 15 million impairment charge related to our auction - rate securities . ”
Auction - rate securities , to those of you who know more the Linux kernel than exotic financial issues , are long - term bonds .
What makes them odd is that their interest rates are set by weekly or monthly auctions .
Companies have been using them in the last few years as a way to raise money .
Unfortunately , investors have tended to give up on buying these securities because they do n’t think that they can move them .
In other words , they no longer have any faith in the securities ’ liquidity .
What that means for Novell , and many other companies , is that their debt has gotten much more expensive than they had expected it to be .
For companies in financial trouble , this spells trouble .
Novell is anything but a company in financial hot - water .
Even after Novell purchased PlateSpin , data center workload lifecycle management company , repaying part of its debt and buying back some of its stock , Novell has $ 1.4 billion in cash , cash equivalents and short - term investments .
The real news for Linux users , though was that of Novell ’s $ 33 million of Open Platform Solutions product revenue $ 31 million of it was from Linux Platform Products .
In other words , Novell ’s Linux business was up 30 % year - over - year .
Novell ’s other business areas also grew at a healthy pace .
“ We had another quarter of strong product revenue growth and expanding operating margins , ” said Ron Hovsepian , Novell ’s CEO in a statement .
“ Our transformation of the company positions us well to focus on sustained growth in 2009 . ”
Curiously , one of the major drivers behind Novell ’s Linux business it its controversial partnership with Microsoft .
While many open - supporters hate this deal , Novell has reason to love it .
Indeed , Novell recently expanded its Microsoft deal .
Some people see this move as betraying open source , but as Novell PR director Ian Bruce wrote in response to my column on this latest advance in the partnership , “ Novell ’s agreement with Microsoft is in no way an acknowledgment that Linux infringes upon any Microsoft intellectual property .
When we entered the agreement with Microsoft , Novell did not agree or admit that Linux or any other Novell offering violates Microsoft patents . ”
What Novell will admit to though is that both Linux , and its partnership with Microsoft , has done extremely well for the company .
How to avoid election manipulation and theft .
1. Always use paper ballots .
It is OK to use an electronic reader to tabulate the ballots provided the paper trail is retained for at least 5 years after the election .
2. Provide four - part ballot forms so the voter can retain two copies with the other two being counted .
The copy ballots should receive a stamp to certify that it is an official copy of the original ballot cast .
Each must have a unique ID number printed on all copies .
Two copies go with the voter .
The other two are placed into separate locked boxes one of which goes to the official elections commissions for tabulation with the second box going to an independent auditor to tabulate for comparison .
The voter 's copies allow them to retain one copy and have one available to mail in the event of a recount or to verify that their vote was properly recorded using the ID number on the ballot .
3 . Provide the option for voters to identify themselves on their ballot if they choose to do so .
By offering the option to declare your votes openly , this lessens the chance that your vote is not counted because it becomes traceable .
A secret ballot is a ballot no one can confirm or deny as being valid or of having the correct candidates marked as intended .
4. Elections must not , by law , be run by any partisan part of government .
Members of elections boards should be chosen by random drawing from a pool of qualified persons and should be seated only for the duration of the particular election .
None may be employees of any government body or agency or affiliated with any candidate .
5 . An independent auditing company shall be hired
By open bid process , a licensed auditing firm shall be hired to receive and tabulate the second copies of the ballots to be compared with those tabulated by the elections board .
No person associated with the auditor may sit on the elections board .
6 . Press to witness counts .
Any bona fide member of the press shall be permitted to witness any ballot count as shall any member of an organized " poll watch " group .
7 . All handling and counting of ballots shall be video taped .
8. Require recount in close race .

Continuing on your theme this morning , I just want to point out that women of any intelligence recognize Palin as a female archetype we 've had to deal with for years .
In modern vernacular , she 's a " mean girl , " who is ambitious and has no trouble stabbing people in the back to get what she wants .
This type of woman is terribly divisive , splitting women between adoring acolytes who want to be " just like them " and women who see clearly what 's going on and can't believe that no one else ( especially males ) can see through it .
If Rich Lowry has a girlfriend with a brain , I bet she 'd like to strangle him .
Right now , Palin is cocky , self - satisfied and believes she has fooled the world .
This is good news .
It 's frequently the state of things just before a mean girl gets toppled from her throne .
The waiting can be hard , though .
This female archetype knows no generational boundaries .
My mom , who is a serious fundy and believes the Bible is a scientific review of creation , had not seen much of Palin prior to the debate .
KETCHIKAN , Alaska ( CNN ) --
The " Bridge to Nowhere " may have been shelved .
But the " Road to Nowhere " is alive and well .
Gov. Sarah Palin let the " Road to Nowhere " go ahead because the contract had been signed .
The proposed $ 400 million span that would have connected the coastal city of Ketchikan to its airport on Gravina Island died after it became a symbol of congressional excess .
But the three - mile access road that was built on the island is ready for residents to take a drive to nowhere .
It was paid for by some of the $ 223 million in federal funding that sparked ridicule among opponents of congressional " pork - barrel " spending .
In stump speeches , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin has touted her eventual decision to abandon the Gravina Island bridge , which she initially supported .
But Palin , now the Republican vice presidential candidate , let the access road go ahead because the contract to build it had been signed , a campaign aide said .
iReport.com :
Are you in a battleground state ?

Ketchikan Mayor Bob Weinstein calls the road , which was paid for by federal tax dollars , a waste of money that could have been used to fix his city 's roads and sidewalks .
" Gov. Palin could have stopped construction of this road , " said Weinstein , who wore his " Nowhere , Alaska " T - shirt to an interview with CNN .
Watch where road ends »
The island is connected to the city by a ferry that runs to the airport , well past the point where the bridge was to have been built .
But some locals said they 'll find some way to use the road , such as running or bicycle riding .
" It 'd be nice to see them put something over here now they have a road : park , picnic benches , something to get people out here , " said P.J. Murphy , who works on the island .
" I mean , it 's pretty here . "
Read Abbie Boudreau's " backstory " blog on " Road to nowhere "
Campaign spokeswoman Meg Stapleton said Palin would not have allowed the road project to go forward under normal circumstances .
But the deal had been signed just before she took office in December 2006 , Stapleton said .
" The governor was left no viable alternative , " Stapleton said .
For the first two weeks of her campaign , Palin routinely told audiences in her stump speech that she told Congress " thanks , but no thanks " for the bridge , which was backed by the leaders of Alaska 's congressional delegation .
But Weinstein , a Democrat , said Palin instead spent $ 26 million to build a road " that will not go to a bridge . "
Palin has been heavily criticized for repeating the stock line about killing the " Bridge to Nowhere " without noting that she supported the project as a candidate for governor .
She has dropped the line from her stump speech in the past week , but a McCain - Palin aide said that her prepared remarks are being tweaked as needed to reflect current events , and it could come back again .
All About Sarah Palin • Alaska • U.S. Presidential Election
Bush is currently trying to ram his $ 700 Billion give - away to Wall Street down the throat of Congress , the same way he rammed the Iraq war and the Patriot act .
But as Electoral Vote puts it :
Even legislators who were easily cowed during the run-up to the Iraq war are beginning to show something that might , given enough time , possibly , eventually develop into something resembling a proto - spine .
I ’d love to say that it is the Democrats who are finally growing some , but even Republican Congress members are resisting the bailout .
However ( and this is a big however ) , one has to suspect that the reason Bush is trying to fast track this legislation is not because they want it to pass , but because they want Congress to not pass it .
Most people ( including economists ) expect the financial situation to get worse , and assuming it does , then the Republicans will be able to say that they tried to fix the economy with the mother of all bailouts , but Congress ( now controlled by Dems ) did n’t do anything .
In other words , even in the middle of an economic crisis , it ’s politics as usual .
Rachael Maddow has an interesting metaphor for the bailout : “ your kids ate all the candy , and now we are out of candy so we need to give them more candy ” :
Today , the latest edition of the Wikipedia school edition has been released by SOS Children ’s Villages , a charity organization that aims to help orphans and vulnerable children worldwide .
The 08/09 edition can be downloaded for free , via BitTorrent only , and comprises over 5500 hand - picked educational articles aimed at helping schools to enhance their curriculum .
This year ’s Wikipedia edition for schools is the largest since the project started back in 2006 .
With 34,000 images and 20 million words , it is comparable to a twenty volume encyclopedia captured on a single DVD .
Without a doubt , it is the most successful “ checked content ” project based on the English Wikipedia , used by hundreds of schools in first and third world countries .
The project was originally aimed at schools in developing countries , but because of the high quality articles – all based around the UK curriculum with an absence of adult content – it is often used on intranets in first world schools too .
To save on resources , Wikipedia for schools is only available online via BitTorrent , which practically reduces the charity ’s distribution costs to zero .
SOS Children CEO Andrew Cates , who is a Wikipedia administrator himself , said that they have no other choice than to use BitTorrent , since the 2.9 GB download would crush their server .
“ BitTorrent was a bit disappointing in that it got us the only substantial criticisms we received online , ” Cates said in an interview with Wikinews .
“ A lot of people find it too much effort to use .
However for the period we offered a straight http : download we had huge problems with spiders eating vast bandwidth . ”
“ As per last year therefore our main two channels will be free download by BitTorrent and mailing the DVDs free all over the world .
At a pinch we will ( as before ) put straight copies up for individuals who cannot get it any other way , and we have some copies on memory sticks for on distributors , ” Cates added .
The .torrent file is available for download on the SOS Children ’s Villages website .
For those who do n’t want to install a BitTorrent client , the DVD can also be downloaded from any web browser with BitLet .
A final word of advice from SOS Children ’s Villages : “ It helps our charity if you keep µ Torrent running after your download is finished . ”
Welcome to the murky world of modern racism , where most of the open animus has been replaced by a shadowy bias that is difficult to measure .
As Obama gently put it in his race speech , today ’s racial “ resentments are n’t always expressed in polite company . ”
However , they can be  and possibly will be  expressed in the privacy of the voting booth .
If the percentage of white voters who cannot bring themselves to vote for a black candidate were only 15 percent , that would be more than all black voters combined .
( Coincidentally , it also would be more than all voters under 24 years old . )
That amounts to a racial advantage for John McCain .
And this sentiment stretched across ideological lines .
Just as many white independents as Republicans said that most of the people they knew would not vote for a black candidate , and white Democrats were not far behind .
Also , remember that during the Democratic primaries , up to 20 percent of white voters in some states said that the race of the candidate was important to them .
Few of those people voted for the black guy .
Some might say that turnabout is fair play , citing the fact that 89 percent of blacks say they plan to vote for Obama .
That level of support represents a racial advantage for him , too , right ?
Not necessarily .
Blacks overwhelmingly vote Democratic in the general election anyway .
According to CNN exit polls John Kerry got 88 percent of the black vote in 2004 .
The Los Angeles Times is reporting that prosecutors decided to add a hate crime enhancement to the premeditated murder charge against 14 - year - old Brandon McInerney , who allegedly gunned down gay junior high school classmate Lawrence “ Larry ” King , 15 , after investigators discovered a “ trove ” of neo -Nazi literature and drawings in McInerney ’s bedroom .
According to a court document filed by Senior District Attorney Maeve Fox earlier this week , the materials seized from McInerney ’s room included white supremacist literature and drawings concerning “ a racist skinhead philosophy of the variety espoused by Tom Metzger , David Lane and others . ”
McInerney is awaiting trial as an adult for the Feb. 12 murder of King , who was shot in the head in a classroom full of students at E.O. Green Junior High School .
McInerney fled the scene after the shooting and was apprehended a few blocks away .
Witnesses said that King , who had recently revealed that he was gay and started to wear make - up and jewelry , had a verbal confrontation with McInerney regarding King ’s sexual orientation the day before the killing .
McInerney ’s public defender explained that his client had the items only because he was researching a term paper on Adolf Hitler .
The accused killer turned 14 , the legal cutoff for charging a juvenile as an adult in California , less than a month before the murder .
He could face 50 years to life if convicted , plus one to three years for the hate crime enhancement .
ALBANY  Gov. David A. Paterson was acting within his powers when he issued an executive order requiring government agencies to recognize same - sex marriages performed outside the state , a court ruled on Tuesday .
The decision , issued by Justice Lucy A. Billings of State Supreme Court in the Bronx , a trial - level court , is the latest in a string of rulings by state courts that have upheld the right of same - sex couples who were married in other jurisdictions to have their marital status recognized in New York , even though gay couples may not marry within the state .
A bill to allow gay unions passed the State Assembly last year but has not come up for a vote in the Senate .
The suit was filed in June by lawmakers who opposed the governor ’s order and by other opponents of same - sex marriage , who argued that Mr. Paterson had effectively usurped the Legislature ’s role by issuing the order .
The governor said the order , issued in May , was made to protect the state from litigation by gay couples legally married in places like Canada or Massachusetts .
But in her decision to dismiss the suit , Justice Billings rejected the plaintiffs ’ reasoning , finding that Mr. Paterson ’s order was consistent with state laws that generally require officials to recognize marriages from other jurisdictions and are silent on whether gay marriages should be excluded from that recognition .
In a country in the grips of evil , in a police state where every move is being watched , in a world where justice and honor have been subverted , a group of men hidden inside the highest reaches of power decide to take action .
Tom Cruise stars in the suspense film , Valkyrie , based on the true story of Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg ( Cruise ) and the daring and ingenious plot to eliminate one of the most evil tyrants the world has ever known .
Director Bryan Singer re-teams with Academy Award® - winning Usual Suspects screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie to bring to life the story of the men who led the operation to assassinate Hitler .
The film also stars an acclaimed cast including Kenneth Branagh , Bill Nighy , Tom Wilkinson , Carice van Houten , Thomas Kretschmann , Eddie Izzard , Christian Berkel and Terence Stamp .
A proud military man , Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg is a loyal officer who serves his country all the while hoping that someone will find a way to stop Hitler before Europe and Germany are destroyed .
Realizing that time is running out , he decides that he must take action himself and joins the German resistance .
Armed with a cunning strategy to use Hitler ’s own emergency plan – known as Operation Valkyrie – these men plot to assassinate the dictator and overthrow his Nazi government from the inside .
With everything in place , with the future of the world , the fate of millions and the lives of his wife and children hanging in the balance , von Stauffenberg is thrust from being one of many who oppose Hitler to the one who must kill Hitler himself .

Treasure Island : A polluted military base is being transformed intoa dense green neighborhood .
View images from the plans for this city
Today it is an almost completely paved naval air base built atop earthen material dredged from the San Francisco Bay in the 1930s .
By 2020 it is scheduled to become one of the most sustainable communities in the U.S. According to a master plan from the engineering firm Arup , the 400 - acre island would be home to 6,000 new apartments and condominiums surrounded by large buildings along the San Francisco coastline .
The homes — and the adjacent businesses they supported — would get 50 percent of their power from renewable resources , including solar electricity and solar water heaters .
In fact , the compact street grid has been oriented 35 degrees north of due south to maximize the exposure of the rooftop photovoltaics to sunlight — as well as to enable the structures to shield residents from brisk bay winds .
All the buildings would be within a 15 - minute walk of a ferry terminal to San Francisco .
And residents could obtain much of their fresh produce from a local organic farm that would use as fertilizer the waste from the water treatment plant already on the island .
Even so , the development would not be entirely environmentally friendly , at least in terms of greenhouse gas emissions .
“ It does n’t seem feasible given the available technology and the need for the owner to make a profit to go for net zero carbon , ” explains Gary Lawrence , a principal at Arup .
“ We ’re going to make it as carbon - neutral as possible . ”
Lawrence adds that building costs will be reasonable .
“ If you do green development through an up - front ­integrated design strategy , like here , there should n’t be any price premium for green ­design . ”
Dongtan :
One of the earliest eco-cities announced may take longer than anticipated to complete .
View images from the plans for this city
In August 2005 the Shanghai Industrial Investment Corporation hired the engineering firm Arup to design an “ eco-demonstrator ” satellite city for the booming coastal municipality .
It would be anchored on Chongming Island , China , one of the largest alluvial islands in the world , which has been steadily expanding because of heavy silt runoff at the mouth of the Yangtze River .
The planned community would start small but reach full size — at least 500,000 residents — by 2050 , all while maintaining much of the natural wetlands that provide one of the few remaining refuges for birds in the rapidly developing country .
Among the first eco-cities ever announced , Dongtan was planned to be zero waste , energy - efficient , powered largely by sea breezes and free of vehicles running on fossil fuels .
But construction has been delayed until at least 2009 , largely because of the torrid pace of development in other areas of Shanghai , according to Roger Wood , a director at Arup .
The bridge and tunnel link to the mainland , now being built and due for completion in phases beginning in 2009 , “ will be one of the catalysts for development starting , ” Wood says .
He remains enthusiastic about the project because Chinese leaders , both locally and in the central government ( among them President Hu Jintao ) , have urged a new focus on construction that is more ecological .
In addition to Dongtan , Arup is involved in planning at least four more eco-­cities in China , including the revitalization of the old steel town Wanzhuang in Hebei Province between Beijing and the port city of Tianjin .

A sheikhdom whose wealth rests on black gold is building a city that will not rely on any of it .
Subterranean electric cars — dubbed Personalized Rapid Transit — will ferry passengers from point to point because the city of Masdar , whose name translates as “ the source , ” will be off - limits to automobiles .
Solar power plants in the surrounding sand , already in early construction , will provide electricity for lighting and air - conditioning and for desalinating ocean water .
Wind farms will contribute , along with efforts to tap geothermal energy buried deep underneath the earth .
The municipality , which will ultimately aim to be zero carbon and zero waste , will boast a plant to produce hydrogen as well as fuel from the residents ’ sewage , according to planners Foster +
Partners .
Perhaps most important for the desert city , all water will be recycled ; even residents ’ wastewater will be used to grow crops in enclosed , self - sustaining farms that will further recycle their own water .
“ We must fundamentally rethink how cities can conserve energy and other resources , ” said Sultan Al Jaber , Masdar Initiative CEO , this past June in an address to a U.S. congressional committee .
“ We must heavily employ new technologies and even create new urban models . ”

Members of the American Psychological Association have voted to prohibit consultation in the interrogations of detainees held at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba , or so - called black sites operated by the Central Intelligence Agency overseas , the association said on Wednesday .
The vote , 8,792 to 6,157 in a mail - in balloting concluded Monday , may help to settle a long debate within the profession over the ethics of such work .
Psychologists have helped military and C.I.A. interrogators evaluate detainees , plan questioning strategy and judge its psychological costs .
The association ’s ethics code , while condemning a list of coercive techniques adopted in the Bush administration ’s antiterrorism campaign , has allowed some consultation “ for national security - related purposes . ”
The referendum , first posted on the Internet as a petition in May , prohibits psychologists from working in settings where “ persons are held outside of , or in violation of , either International Law ( e.g. , the U.N. Convention Against Torture and the Geneva Conventions ) or the U.S. Constitution , where appropriate , ” unless they represent a detainee or an independent third party .
The association ’s bylaws require that it institute the policy at the next annual meeting , in August 2009 .
“ The good part of this is that the membership has spoken , the process worked , and we ’re going to follow it , ” said Alan E. Kazdin , the association ’s president and a psychologist at Yale University .
“ Will everyone be happy ?
Well , it ’s a typical human enterprise , and there are nuanced positions on both sides .
So , we ’ll see . ”
When the leave was over , he did n’t want to go back to his 60 - hour weeks , but he did n’t want to become a stay - at - home parent either .
“ The work is very important , ” he says .
With a baby at home , he learned that sometimes he could n’t “ wait to get back to work because there ’s sanity .
It can be an oasis . ”
The couple hired a nanny , and Bill switched jobs a few times  to a clerkship for a judge , to a solo practice , to a smaller firm  looking for the right fit .
Alexandra rose through the ranks at her company , and after their second son was born in 2000 , she continued working four days a week .
Her schedule  every Friday off , spent with the children  appealed to Bill , who took a job in the compliance department of his wife ’s employer , though it would be a while before he would get up the nerve to ask for a four - day week too .
In 2004 , when Jo and Tim ’s son was born , Alexandra was pregnant for the third time ( she would have another boy ) , and Bill came across a ThirdPath conference about “ Creating Work - Life Balance in the Law . ”
That was the first he knew that what he was trying to fashion had a name .
Like Jo and Tim , he was reassured and inspired by DeGroot ’s orderly charts , and while he did not go as far as making his own , he did adopt her worldview .
Jo and Tim did draft a chart .
After her three - month maternity leave , their schedule worked like this , as Tim explains : “ I would get up extra early and head to work , and Jo would be home until later in the morning and then take him to day care .
She would leave work again at lunch for an hour to nurse him .
I would take half a lunch and leave work by 2:30 or 3 , pick Seth up and take him home .
Jo would stay at work until 6 . ”
They agreed to share chores at home too , but their varying definitions of “ done ” soon made things unequal .
“ He would do the laundry , ” Jo says , “ but he was so slow about it that I took it back .
His level of alertness to mess is quite different than mine .
I see dirt two or three days before he does . ”
So she took back a lot of the cleaning too .
Their work - home time was evenly divided for about a year , and then in the summer of 2005 , their daughter , Kate , was born .
Jo tried to envision a schedule that would account for the demands of two children under the age of 2 .
“ I realized what it would take to get all of us out of the house by a certain time in order for us to keep the life we had . . . , ” she says , trailing off .
She calculated that her take - home salary , which was substantially lower than her husband ’s , would barely pay for child care .
She took a hard look at the satisfaction she got from her office job , which was nil compared with the joy she had found while planting crops in Chad .
“ If I could get a job that would pay me $ 50,000 a year , that would rival or compete with Tim’s . . . , ” she says , letting that thought trail off as well .
Jo would not disagree with Deutch ’s point that she had a role in creating that inequity  choosing to major in international rural development , with little practical career application , while her husband obtained two master ’s degrees , one in counseling and the other in college student personnel , with better job potential .
Even marrying a man who was ahead of her on the career ladder , and therefore likely to remain ahead of her , was a choice .
But there comes a point where the origin of the cards you hold becomes irrelevant , and you have to play the hand you are dealt .

Man , do I love Australia .
First , my oldest daughter was conceived there on our honeymoon … and while we ’re on the subject , have I ever shared with you that we almost named her “ Sydney ” as a nod to her point of origin ?
In the end , I chickened out , though — I thought that might be a little corny , and truth be told , I think she was actually conceived in Brisbane .
But I ’ll stop there .
This is a family - friendly website .
Anyway , I just love Australia .
I just tried this side dish last night — it was sent to me by Trish , an Aussie friend / reader , a few weeks ago — and I wound up absolutely loving it .
Created by Australian food writer Jill Dupleix , it ’s called “ Crash Hot Potatoes ” and has soared to the top of my Favorite Side Dishes to Serve With Big Ol ’ Hunks of Beef .
They ’re so simple , it ’s terrifying .
Well , not terrifying … but almost .
They ’re a lovely twist on the tired old baked potato , and they perfectly embody a quality I always strive to achieve in my cooking : Flavorful , Crispy Surface Area .
I ’ll go into that principle more in a separate post , but just know I ’ll be pontificating about Flavorful , Crispy Surface Area soon .
And I ’ll make you a believer .
For now , though , let ’s take a chill pill and make Crash Hot Potatoes !
Thanks ,
Trish from Australia , for sharing it .
The Cast of Characters : New Potatoes ( or other small , round potato ) , Olive Oil , Kosher Salt , Black Pepper , and whatever herb you like .
I ’m using Rosemary .
Begin by bringing a pot of salted water to a boil .
Add in as many potatoes as you wish to make , and cook them until they ’re fork - tender .
And yes , I realize my pot is a little full , but listen : my boys filled my large dutch oven with a combination of dog food , potting soil , and gravel yesterday , and then they placed it on top of our garage .
I have to learn to make do around here .
Oh !
And I ’d like to officially announce that as a result of my boys ’ repeated attempts to dig to China , I no longer have any spoons in my kitchen .
You heard me .
Send spoons ASAP , please .
We have cereal to eat .
Next , generously drizzle olive oil on a sheet pan .
This will mean the difference between the potatoes sticking and not sticking , so do n’t be shy here .
When the potatoes are tender , place them on the cookie sheet …
… Giving them plenty of room to spread out .
Next , grab your potato masher and gently press down on the potato until it slightly mashes …
Then rotate the masher 90 degrees and finish flattening it .
Of course , you do n’t want to absolutely smash it into the pan — you want it almost to resemble a cookie .
Repeat until all are flattened .
And really , I do n’t know why you could n’t use the bottom of a glass for this step if you do n’t have a potato masher .
The surface might not be as textured and interesting , but I think it still might work .
Next , brush the tops rather generously with olive oil .
And if you could please use a pastry brush that looks as bad as , or worse than , this , that would be great .
I ’ll sleep better tonight .
Look , I USE the stuff in my kitchen .
I ca n’t be bothered with making sure it ’s polished and perfect .
* Here endeth the rationalization .
Next , grab some Kosher salt .
You can use regular salt , but I ’d really recommend using kosher .
It adheres to the potatoes more easily and really flavors them nicely without getting too salty .
Or something .
Remember : potatoes need salt .
Do n’t skimp !
Be ye ever as generous with fresh ground black pepper .
Now , you can grab some chives …or thyme…or whatever herbs you have available .
I had this in my garden — the same garden that ’s been pummeled by hail , wind , and rain for the past month .
Let ’s observe a moment of silence for all gardens in Middle America .
Whatever herb you use , just chop it pretty finely and sprinkle over the top .
That ’s it !
Now throw them onto the top rack of a very hot ( 450 - degree ) oven , and cook them for 20 - 25 minutes …
… Or until they ’re golden and crispy and sizzling .
Mmmm .
Just look at these babies .
They almost look like latkes , do n’t they ?
But only almost …
I was making steak for dinner last night , so I thought these would be just the ticket .
That there thing on the left there is an iceberg wedge .
In a moment it will be drizzled with homemade ranch dressing .
Marlboro Man has very simple wants .
Okay , by now I ’ve already eaten two potatoes — I just picked ’em up and ate ’em with my fingers .
And they are …DELICIOUS .
The perfect combination of crispy , flavorful , and simple .
Oh , and Australia ?
I love you .
Thanks for allowing my oldest daughter to be conceived in your fine country .
I really like that kid .
And I really like these potatoes .

Advertisement Stock markets were volatile on Tuesday after the key US investment bank Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy .
The Dow Jones industrial average shed 100 points after the US Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged at 2 % but later closed 141 points higher .
Traders saw the central bank 's move as a sign that the economy was in better shape than they feared .
But leading indexes elsewhere ended lower .
The UK's FTSE 100 shed 3.4 % , the Cac - 40 fell 1.9 % and the Dax shed 1.6 % .
Banking shares were badly hit with HBOS losing about 35 % at one point .
Lehman Brothers , which may be about to sell its core assets to Barclays , became the latest victim of the global credit crunch on Monday .
Lehman 's collapse has continued to reverberate : Central banks around the globe have pumped funds into the money markets , including $ 50 bn ( £ 28 bn ) from the US Federal Reserve , £ 20bn from the Bank of England and 70bn euros ( $ 100bn ; £ 56 bn ) from the European Central Bank .
US insurer AIG saw its shares slump by more than 70 % at one point amid continued uncertainty over its future , though these later closed closer to 20 % down .
Stock markets in Europe and Asia fell heavily .
Banks hit The US benchmark Dow Jones index had dropped some 500 points on Monday - its worst session since 11 September 2001 .
The FTSE 100 index of leading UK shares fell 178.6 points to 5025 at close of trade - having earlier dipped below 5,000 points for the first time since June 2005 .
Big banks can no longer be under any illusion that they can make big , stupid financial bets and expect taxpayers to pick up the bill
Robert Peston , BBC business editor Read Robert 's blog Barclays eyes Lehman assets US policy challenge Q&A : Lehman collapse Lehman pension scheme in deficit Credit crunch jargon explained
Japan 's Nikkei 225 index dropped 5 % to a three - year low , shares in South Korea and Hong Kong shed almost 6 % and Shanghai 's index fell by about 3 % .
Markets in Taipei and Singapore were also sharply down , and the pattern was repeated in Australia and New Zealand , although the falls were smaller .
Central banks around the world carried out emergency measures on Tuesday to keep markets liquid .
The extra funding came as the interest rates at which banks lend to each other rocketed - as they did at the start of the credit crunch .
This is seen as a sign of falling confidence between the banks .
Overnight , sterling Libor increased from 5.5 % to 6.8 % , and the dollar Libor rate increased from 3.1 % to 6.4 % .
The extra £ 20 bn ( 25 bn euros ; $ 36 bn ) put into short - term money markets by the Bank of Enlgand was " in response to conditions in the short - term money markets " , it said .
The injection was four times the sum seen on Monday after Lehman 's collapse
The Bank of Japan has carried out two injections of a combined 2.5 trillion yen ( $ 24.1bn ; £ 13bn ) HAVE YOUR SAY More regulation ?
Maybe , but more important in my judgment is using the regulation more effectively Michael , Dallas , Texas Australia and India also pumped cash into their money markets .
Bank stocks were hard hit again across Europe ; in London HBOS was down by about 22 % , having fallen 35 % at one point , and Royal Bank of Scotland was down 10 % .
Barclays Bank - which said it was in talks to take on some of Lehman 's US operations - fell 2.5 % .
German finance firms were also hit with Commerzbank losing close to 12.2 % and Deutsche Postbank falling 8.1 % .
Meanwhile , Japanese - registered Lehman Brothers Japan and Lehman Brothers Holdings have applied to the Tokyo District Court for bankruptcy protection .
' Crisis '
On the currency markets , the dollar slid to a four - month low against the yen before reversing earlier losses .
The collapse of Lehman , which had incurred billions of dollars of losses from the failing US mortgage market , has raised fears that other financial institutions could be hit .
" We 're in the middle of a crisis , " said YK Chan at Phillip Asset Management in Hong Kong .
Meanwhile , there were fears that AIG , one of the world 's largest insurers , could also face collapse .
The State of New York announced a " multi- billion dollar financing plan " on Monday to stabilise the insurer 's finances .
' Rough spots ' ahead On Monday , US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said the US was " working through a difficult period in our financial markets right now as we work off some of the past excesses " .

He said Americans could remain confident in the " soundness and resilience " of the US financial system .
But he warned that uncertainty remained and it was likely that there would be further " rough spots " ahead until the correction of the US housing market was completed .
Mr Paulson said he was committed to working with regulators in the US and abroad , as well as policymakers in Congress to take the necessary steps " to maintain the stability and orderliness of our financial markets " .
But he gave no details of what such steps might mean .

What are these ?
Robert Murat was in London to reach the damages settlement Madeleine McCann suspect Robert Murat has accepted a £ 600,000 settlement from 11 British newspapers in a libel claim .
Mr Murat told the BBC in an exclusive interview that the court award represented a " vindication " .
He said the more than 100 articles and sensational headlines about him had caused the " total and utter destruction " of his life .
Mr Murat said : " I would have preferred to have not gone through it , than had to get to this stage . "
He said an apology from the papers allowed him to " rebuild his life " .
" I have to live my life knowing that I was linked to this situation but with a strong family I do have a future , I do feel I have a future - now which direction that takes me in I do n't know .
At this moment I have no idea . "
I do think the case should continue - I do think they should carry on to find that child
Robert Murat
Robert Murat :
In his own words Mr Murat is still an official suspect - or arguido - in the three - year - old 's disappearance in Portugal in May 2007 .
He said : " I do n't want to be an arguido ... I want to carry on with my life .
But it does n't necessarily mean I want the case to be shelved in Portugal .
I do think the case should continue - I do think they should carry on to find that child . "
The 34 - year - old had travelled from his home in the Algarve to accept the settlement at London 's High Court .
His then girlfriend Michaela Walczuch and IT consultant Sergey Malinka also brought proceedings against Associated Newspapers , Express Newspapers , MGN Limited and News Group Newspapers and were awarded " substantial six figure settlements " .
Mr Murat 's solicitor , Louis Charalambous , said they had taken the action over " baseless inaccurate media coverage " .
He said the newspapers had accepted that they had not been involved in Madeleine 's disappearance .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" They accept that Mr Murat 's actions after the abduction were entirely proper and were motivated by a desire to help find Madeleine McCann , " Mr Charalambous said .
" Until now Robert Murat has had to watch silently as the worst elements of the British media have gone about destroying his good name and reputation . "
In an interview with the BBC's Richard Bilton Mr Murat said the media 's behaviour had been " disgusting " .
" The media does need to have a look at itself and I think that if it can't look at itself I think there has to be some kind of protection for people that do n't have the resources to be able to confront them . "
The 11 papers involved are the Daily Mail , Evening Standard , Metro , Daily Express , Daily Star , Sunday Express , Daily Mirror , Sunday Mirror , Daily Record ( Scotland ) , Sun and News of the World .
All the papers have agreed to publish reports of the statement to recognise the distress and damage which they have caused .
£ 600,000 between several very rich papers is pocket change
Andrew Neil
Former newspaper editor " The defendants apologise to each of the claimants for publishing false allegations about them " , Keith Mathieson the papers ' solicitor said .
" They very much regret the distress these publications caused " .
Outside the court Mr Murat said : " I am pleased that the publications concerned have today admitted the falsity of all their allegations and I can now start to rebuild my life . "
In March , Madeleine 's parents Kate and Gerry McCann reached a libel settlement and got an apology from Express Newspapers for suggesting they were responsible for her death .
Former Sunday Times editor Andrew Neil said the pay - out to Mr Murat would not stop a similar barrage of stories happening again because the damages were too low .
" The papers have not been hurt enough , " he said .
" £ 600,000 between several very rich papers is pocket change . "

What are these ?
There 's a good chance the most powerful chip inside your PC , in raw computational terms , is on your graphics card .
So , how did graphics get so powerful , what are graphics cards good for right now and how on earth do you choose from the baffling array of 3D chipsets on offer ?
A little history
The origin of today 's 3D monsters can be traced back to ancient 2D cards designed to improve the resolution and colour fidelity of the PC .
The very earliest cards had specifications that seem impossibly modest by today 's standards .
The first truly modern graphics processing units ( GPUs ) arrived in 2001 .
Nvidia 's GeForce 3 and the Radeon 8500 from ATI were the world 's first GPUs to support so - called programmable shaders designed to enable more realistic lighting within graphical 3D simulations .
Since then , no other company has been able to keep up with the relentless pace of those two brands ( though ATI was bought by AMD in 2006 ) .
Early programmable chips could typically apply their shading effects to just four pixels per operating cycle .
Since then , GPUs have become ever more powerful , programmable and , most of all , parallel .
AMD 's Radeon HD 4800 , for instance , packs a ludicrous 800 shader units ( also known as stream processors in a nod to their increasingly programmable nature ) .
Current cards also sport huge memory buffers as big as 1GB , enabling them to drive extremely high - resolution displays , and are backed up by massive bus bandwidth thanks to the PCI Express interface in its latest 2.0 format .
Finally , the very latest development in graphics technology is support for multiple cards sharing the rendering load .
But today 's GPU 's do n't just pack painfully powerful 3D pixel pumping engines .
They also support 2D video decode acceleration for modern HD video codecs like H.264 and VC - 1 , as used on Blu-ray movie disks .
That 's how graphics cards got to where they are today .
But what makes the latest chips tick ?
3D rendering
This is the biggy , 3D rendering is the graphics card 's raison d'etre .
With the launch of Windows Vista , Microsoft introduced the 10th iteration of its DirectX graphics API .
The DX10 API is now well established and fully compliant cards are extremely affordable .
There 's no need to compromise on DirectX support .
Whether it 's pixel , vertex and geometry shaders , or support for high quality anti-aliasing and high - dynamic - range lighting , they 're present in all DX10 GPUs .
What you do need to worry about , however , is raw rendering horse power and below is everything you need to know to judge a chip 's performance .
Pixel throughput
Broadly speaking , it 's the texture and render output units ( ROPs ) that define the number of pixels a graphics chip can spit out every cycle .
And remember , a 1,920 x 1,200 pixel grid on a typical 24 - inch monitor works out at over two million pixels .
For smooth gaming you 'll need to refresh that at least 30 times a second .
In other words , well over 60 million pixels per second .
Nvidia 's top chip , the £ 300 +
GeForce GTX 280 has a huge 32 - strong array of ROPs and no less than 80 texture sampling and address units .
AMD 's best , the Radeon HD 4800 series , has 16 ROPs and 40 texture units , facts reflected in pricing that kicks off around the £ 180 mark .
Mid-range cards like Nvidia 's GeForce 9600 series and the Radeon HD 4600 from AMD , typically have significantly reduced ROP and texture unit counts .
Shader processing
This is where the real computation grunt is housed and where those shimmering , shiny visual effects that dominate the latest games are processed .
Intriguingly , AMD 's relatively affordable Radeon HD 4800 packs 800 shaders to the Nvidia GTX 280's 240 units .
However , not all shaders are equal and it's worth noting that Nvidia 's GPUs usually boast much higher shader operating frequencies than competing AMD chips .
Again , mid-range chips typically suffer from cut - down shader counts in an effort to reduce chip size and cost .
If you knew that your husband was twice as likely to be unfaithful in your marriage than another man , would you still marry him ?
Scientists have discovered a gene that may be able to tell just that .
The question is : would you want to know if he had the gene ?
We know strong emotional relationships are essential to mental health .
We do not know , however , how the brain functions in establishing and maintaining such complex interactions .
Scientists have examined the formation and regulation of complex social behaviors in non-human mammals for decades , finding that the hormones oxytocin and vasopressin are among the key modulators in such connections .
One such study compared prairie voles and montane voles .
Prairie voles mate for life and raise litters of offspring together .
In contrast , montane voles do not form lasting pair - bonds and the males are not involved in raising offspring .
In the prairie vole males , bonding triggers vasopressin action in the reward centers of the brain , prompting the animals to seek monogamous relationships .
Montane voles have less vasopressin activity , which predicts the lack of life - long bonding .
Another study of rats concluded that vasopressin acts not just in pair - bonding behaviors , but facilitates anxiety and aggression in males .
Oxytocin was found to be the key mediator for female social behaviors and maternal attachments .
Similarly , in humans , vasopressin is more active in males and is associated with social behaviors including aggression , pair - bond formation , and anxiety .
Oxytocin is more abundant in woman , involved in reducing behavioral responses to stress and inhibiting defensive behavior .
However , both hormones act in both males and females to regulate complex social behaviors , including human attachment and social recognition .
A recent study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reported an association of human gene variants controlling vasopressin activity in males and pair - bonding behavior .
The variant allele is present in 2 of every 5 men and predicts partner bonding , marital problems , marital status , and marital quality .
Men with 2 copies of the variant allele are twice as likely to experience marital problems , including divorce , separation , and infidelity , compared to men with one or no copies of the allele .
The scientists at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm studied vasopressin activity and gene variation in 1000 heterosexual couples .
Approximately 40 % of the men had 1 or 2 copies of the genetic variation .
While men with 2 copies of the gene were at the highest risk for marital discord , men with 1 copy were at higher risk than those with no copies of the variant .
Only 15 % of the men with no variant alleles reported marital problems , while 34 % of men with 2 copies of the variant reported marital problems .
Additionally , 17 % of the men without the allele lived with women without being married , while 32 % of men with 2 variant alleles lived with women without being married .
Further , women married to men with 2 variant alleles reported lower marital satisfaction than women married to men with one or no copies .
Marital satisfaction was based on affection , cohesion , and consensus in the relationship described by the wives and partners of the men .
While more work is needed to replicate and confirm these findings , scientists do agree that vasopressin can change how men behave in social relationships .
Building on this study , many researchers believe that vasopressin may act in other dysfunctions of social behavior including autism , obsessive - compulsive disorder , and borderline personality disorder .
New research may provide potential therapeutic targets for these psychiatric disorders .
A gene alone cannot accurately predict whether a man will make a happy and faithful husband — and many people overcome genetic predispositions for behaviors and conditions — but this discovery is evidence that genes work with our environment , culture , and experience to shape who we are and who we might become .

In the Spring of 2003 , I was attending Carnegie Mellon and enrolled in an introductory C class .
One of our homework assignments was to implement a linked list .
Such an implementation had to include a function that took as an argument a pointer to the head node , freed all the memory associated with the linked list , and returned nothing .
Anyway , when we had done this assignment and turned it in , our TA sent us a message that included a code snippet :
void FreeThisSchnizzle ( void* head )
{
free ( ( void* ) head ) ;
FreeThisSchnizzle ( head -> next ) ;
}
Evidently one of the students in the class had turned this in , and the TA responded accordingly .
( I have to paraphrase here , as I do n't have the original message )
" Guys , please test your code before you submit it to us .
The function to free your linked list is worth 20 % of your grade on this assignment , so do n't mess it up ! "
At any rate , the kid never resubmitted the code to the TA , so he was docked 20 of 100 points in the following manner :

The homeland security mania has invited some startling abuses of police power , but we have yet to hear of any more knuckle - headed than one in Maryland .
There , the State Police are sheepishly tracking down 53 innocent people to let them know they were entered as suspected terrorists on state and federal databases  for the Orwellian offense of engaging in peaceful protest .
The citizens had merely joined gatherings opposed to the Iraq war and capital punishment .
Yet they were listed as terrorists three years ago on criminal intelligence rolls .
“ On the contrary , the groups were determined not to violate the law , ” Stephen Sachs , the former Maryland attorney general , took pains to point out in a blistering report concluding that the runaway program violated constitutional rights and federal regulations .
Legislative hearings this week added insult to injury .
Thomas Hutchins , a former State Police superintendent , insisted that the program was a legitimate surveillance of “ fringe people ” he somehow divined as “ those who wish to disrupt the government . ”
This is a chilling free - speech distinction not found in the Constitution .
It should make any American wonder what else is out there in the way of misbegotten police programs .
The 300 hours of surveillance devoted to data - smearing outspoken citizens was aptly described in the report as “ an instructive example of the abuses that can result when the mere invocation of ‘ terrorism ’ is understood to override constitutional protections . ”
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Consumers are starting to notice a few less snaps , crackles and pops in their Cocoa Krispies lately .
That 's because cereal boxes - and the amount of cereal inside - are shrinking along with most food packages in the grocery store .
As manufacturers cope with the rising cost of raw ingredients and fuel , downsizing their package sizes is one increasingly popular way to pass along a price increase without drawing too much attention .
" They 're raising the prices a little , and shrinking the boxes a little , " said Marcia Mogelonsky , consumer analyst with Mintel International , a consumer research firm in Chicago .
" If you 're running through the supermarket , you do n't necessarily notice that your cereal box is an ounce or two smaller .
That 's how they 're controlling the prices . "
In June , cereal giant Kellogg ( K , Fortune 500 ) slimmed down its cereal boxes ( see photo gallery ) .
Froot Loops , Cocoa Krispies , Corn Pops , Apple Jacks and Honey Smacks all decreased by about 2.4 ounces on average , according to Kellogg spokeswoman Susanne Norwitz .
But Kellogg is n't the only company downsizing , or charging the same price for a package that contains less food .
Consumers are discovering more air in their bag of chips , fewer sheets of paper towels on the roll , thinner garbage bags and even smaller squares of toilet paper .
Unilever ( UN ) recently shrank bottles of Hellmann 's Real Mayonnaise , Breyers Ice Cream and Skippy , among other consumer products .
" Like other companies , Unilever is working to mitigate the impact of these rising commodity costs through hedging , product reformulation and cost savings programs .
We have chosen to reduce package sizes as one of our responses to these dramatic input cost increases , " said Anita Larsen , a spokeswoman for the company .
But when a half gallon container of Breyer 's no longer contained 64 ounces of ice cream , that 's when some shoppers , like Beth Bastian , caught on .
" I noticed ice cream was n't sold in the half gallon , although it looked like it was , and then I started to pay attention , " said Bastian , mother of three .
Now , Bastian said , she 's aware that this is happening " across the board . "
But that does n't make it any easier for her to stomach the trend toward smaller packaging .
" It almost feels insulting , like ' consumers are never going to notice , ' " she said .
But consumers are noticing : 75 % of those surveyed by Consumer Reports in July said they noticed packages are shrinking and 71 % believed the main reason for downsizing was to hide price hikes from consumers .
Yet half of those surveyed said they 'd prefer that manufacturers keep the old package and raise the price .
That 's not how manufacturers are seeing it .
Many food companies say their customers accept , and appreciate , the choices they must make to maintain a quality product in the current economic environment .
In August , Hershey Co. ( HSY , Fortune 500 ) announced an 11 % price increase on its multi-pack and packaged candy lines because of the rising cost of cocoa , corn sweeteners , sugar and peanuts .
That company did n't say , however , that some price hikes had already been implemented in May by way of smaller packaging .
For example , an 8 - ounce bar of Hershey 's Special Dark shrank to 6.8 ounces , a reduction of 15 % .
When asked about the consumer response to the downsized bar , Kirk Saville , a spokesman for The Hershey Company said in an email : " they understand the reasons behind the change . "
Orange juice drinkers are also getting squeezed .
According to Tropicana , a division of PepsiCo ( PEP , Fortune 500 ) , consumers welcomed the new 89 - ounce bottle of Tropicana orange juice , which will replace the 96 - ounce jug by the end of this year .
" Our consumer research indicates that , despite the smaller size , there was no change in the perceived value of the product because of the benefits of the added features , " said Karen May , a spokeswoman from Tropicana , referring to the new bottle 's snap cap .
Like it or not , there 's not much consumers can do to stop the downsizing in food packaging .
But awareness goes a long way , according to Edgar Dworsky , editor of mouseprint.org , a consumer education Web site that aims to expose truth in advertising .
Dworsky suggests checking and comparing the unit prices in the grocery store and opting for the brand that offers the most value .
For a less subtle approach , " complain to the company , " he said .
You may not save money on food , but at least you can express your distaste .
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.'s program to lower loan payments for struggling borrowers with mortgages from IndyMac Bank has been lauded by consumer advocates and government leaders as a model of foreclosure prevention .
But when the FDIC , which is running IndyMac , mailed out 35,000 letters offering homeowners a chance to rework the terms of their mortgages , more than half the borrowers were apparently so discouraged , scared or stressed out that they did n’t bother to respond .
“ Anecdotally , what you hear is that a lot of people kind of hunker down when they ’re getting into trouble with their mortgages , and maybe just stop opening the mail , ” said Mike Krimminger , a special policy advisor to FDIC Chairwoman Sheila C. Bair .
“ Some people have contacted us previously but then just decide they can’t handle it anymore and go silent , ” Krimminger said .
“ And some have maybe just walked away from the home .
So it ’s a combination of things . ”

The FDIC ’s experience has implications beyond IndyMac because the loan - modification program there is being looked at as one of the templates for an emerging government plan to help stem foreclosures .
That plan would offer loan guarantees to encourage loan companies to alter as much as $ 500 billion in mortgages to make them more affordable to struggling homeowners .
But you ca n’t help borrowers if you ca n’t reach them .
Despite the difficulties it has encountered , the FDIC appears at IndyMac to have been more successful at reaching them than most mortgage companies have been .
Horror stories about elusive homeowners abound in the mortgage industry .
Bank of America ’s Countrywide unit tried to contact one delinquent borrower 150 times before the homeowner called -- in response not to the deluge of letters and phone calls but to news accounts of a new Bank of America plan to modify loans , said Steve Bailey , a mortgage executive at the bank .
The FDIC , which was appointed IndyMac ’s receiver when soured mortgages toppled the Pasadena savings and loan in July , announced a plan in August to aggressively reduce payments for borrowers who had fallen behind on their first mortgages .

The intent was n’t charity , the FDIC ’s Bair said ; instead , she reasoned , it would be easier to find a buyer for the thrift if more borrowers were current on their loans .
The goal is to reduce the monthly payment on a loan , including taxes and insurance , to no more than 38 % of the borrower ’s pretax income .
To reach the target , the FDIC is prepared to take as many of the following steps as necessary :
Reduce the interest rate to as low as 3 % .
Extend the loan ’s term to 40 years .

Waive interest on a portion of the mortgage balance .
The borrower would still owe that amount but would n’t have to pay it back until the loan was refinanced or the house was sold .
But of the 35,000 seriously delinquent IndyMac customers who were sent letters about the possibility of such modifications , more than half have yet to be heard from , officials said this week .
The response rate is higher -- 73 % -- for borrowers who had already talked with IndyMac and provided their current income .
The letters to such people were sent by registered mail and proposed new mortgage terms .
If the borrower signs the agreement and returns it in an enclosed , prepaid Federal Express envelope -- along with proof of income and a first new monthly payment -- the mortgage can be modified with no further action by the borrower .
So far , IndyMac has completed the modification process for about 3,500 of these borrowers , with “ thousands more in the pipeline , ” Krimminger said .
The average reduction in principal and income payments has been 23 % , saving the typical borrower $ 380 a month .

But IndyMac has no current income information for about 20,000 seriously delinquent customers who were sent letters .
Many of them had n’t needed to document their income when they took out their loans .
People in that group were sent invitations to discuss loan modifications by regular mail , and only 15 % to 20 % have replied , the FDIC said .
Still , that response rate “ is remarkably off the charts to what other servicers are getting -- we ’re hearing about response rates of 4 % to 5 % , ” Krimminger said .
“ So I ’m pleased but also frustrated because I ’d like it to be a lot higher .
These are people we need to get in touch with .
It ’s kind of a last effort before we have to go into foreclosure . ”
IndyMac has even resorted to paying a bounty of sorts to mortgage counseling groups to contact borrowers who have n’t responded , Krimminger said .
The reward is $ 150 after the borrower ’s income is documented , with an additional $ 350 paid if the loan is successfully modified .
The agency also is experimenting with letters that tell borrowers how much they would save if their income is within a certain range .
Krimminger and consumer advocates said just seeing a hypothetical number could prompt a borrower to sit down and talk .

To be sure , not everyone can be helped .
Of the 652,000 residential first mortgages serviced by IndyMac , 65,100 were more than 60 days past due in mid-October , IndyMac spokesman Evan Wagner said .
IndyMac determined that 18,500 of those loans were ineligible for modifications because the investors who bought the loans had not agreed to the FDIC program , the mortgages already were deep in foreclosure proceedings or other complications existed , Wagner said .
IndyMac considered sending modification offers to several thousand additional borrowers on whom it had current income information , but determined that they did n’t qualify because they could n’t afford even a reduced monthly payment , he said .
At the other end of the spectrum , IndyMac is rebuffing borrowers who want their debt restructured even though they can afford the payments .
The bank has a screening program to identity borrowers who have missed payments intentionally just to appear unable to pay .

Some eligible homeowners have demanded more concessions after IndyMac analyzed their finances and offered to save them hundreds of dollars a month , Wagner said .
“ Our offer is our offer , ” Wagner said .
“ Take it or leave it . ”
Paul Leonard , California director for the Center for Responsible Lending , a consumer advocacy group , said he thought the FDIC could reach more borrowers by taking out paid advertisements and sending all its offers by registered mail .
But he praised the program as a potential model for the industry .
“ No one says it ’s easy or perfect , ” Leonard said .
“ I think what you ’re seeing , however , is . . . substantial innovations that we hope are going to be successful . ”

PC Computer case mods are simply so fun to look at !
Individuals worldwide take time out of their personal life to build new and innovative creations for their computer cases .
The designs are amazing , the effort is praised , and the creativity is completely apparent in any of the modification .
The following is a selection of Top PC Computer Case Mods which help us appreciate geeks , technicians and any others who have build these wonderful artistic modifications .
1. Pink Floyd the Wall
Whether you are a Pink Floyd fan or not , this PC is a masterpiece just like the Wall album was and still considered today .
It sports some amazing imagery as presented in the animated scenes in the movie , including the hammer from the hammer march added as a PC carrying handle .
The strong color used , the artwork , and lyrics all combined to provide a tribute for one of the greatest musical albums ever created and also a great looking Pink Floyd Computer .
2. Car Tires PC
Would this tire PC computer mod TechEBlog found be considered recycling ?
I have repeatedly heard how car tires are made of so many chemicals that when thrown out , they are extremely awful for the environment .
I guess using them to make a computer case mod would result in a practical solution instead of throwing them out .
In addition , it is a very creative way to house your computer and save money on gas at the same time .
3. Lego Computer
In my younger years , someone told me that Legos are like a million toys in one .
In a certain sense , this is true : you can innovate , design and build your own creations just by using Lego bricks .
Now if you decide to combine it with some technology , you can solve the Rubik ’s cube with the Lego Mindstorms or even build a home for your computer like Slashgear showed .
Although many would consider this just as a square box and not much innovation , the video proves otherwise .
The innovator has created separate areas for the various parts of the computer and definitely deserves a prize .
4. Iron Man Case Mod
Iron Man has always been a superhero but with the extreme success of the recent movie starring Robert Downey Jr. , it received many different tributes .
A few examples are the diy record player and another is an Ode with the Iron Man Computer with video .
This PC mod is of superhero status : it lights up , crafted to involve the Ironman ’s looks and power , and is an additional way to have a different identity as you surf the net .
5. Barbecue Gaming PC
Some friends of mine love to Barbecue a few weekends a month , but they seem to always want a bigger and more innovative grill for their steaks and vegetables .
The fire and coals are the same beneath the food , but the grill just doesnâ€™t do it for them anymore .
Meanwhile , the old grill is somewhere in the yard , gathering dust and cobwebs and is simply taking up space being completely useless .
This PC computer case mod Technabob presented uses an old grill that no one wants to touch , and transformed it into a gaming pc with a screen right in the hood .
Some may ask why someone would create it , and I would recommend the reply of â€ œ
Why not ?â€ .
6. Raise some
Hell with the Hellraiser PC case mod
The Hellraiser movies freaked me out as a kid , but the Hellraiser cube was a little short of one of the most amazing things I have ever seen ; as it is rearranged , it raises evil .
I could not really blame the person playing with the cube , because its design and form are simply intriguing .
If such a cube came into my hands and allowed me to mess with it , changing its shape and form , I think I would raise evil just as well .
Maybe in order to avoid the terror of the real cube , this cube replica shown at Nerdcore was made in the form of a PC mod case .
It gathers the mystery of the cube , edgy shape , and cold color into a wonderful computer mod .
I know I love it because I am a fan , but can you really tell me you would mind having this evil cube computer on your desk ?
7. Antique Stained Glass
My Mom has always professed her love for stained glass art and would prefer an art exhibition to technology any day because the latter â€ œconfusesâ€ her .
With the Internet allowing for easy browsing and a world of information , she has caught on a bit and has been using the computer on a daily basis .
By combining her love for stained glass and technology , this computer case would be a definite winner at her home .
On second thought , it may cause her to stop surfing and just look at the mod with awe for the artwork from Boredstop .
8. Hand Curved Wooden PC
I have always been amazed at the time people spend on the creation of art .
It takes a lot of effort and creativity just to come up with a viable idea , let alone actually hand curve an entire Wooden PC case .
This artistic Computer case mod was hand curved by Valery Zhuk and is simply a beautiful masterpiece .
The thing is , when looking at it , you wonder how such an outstanding piece of art actually has electronics within it and would still connect you to the Internet .
9. Toilet PC
Is this PC from Envador full of crap ?
Should we even ask ?
Someone has to .
Why would someone create a PC in a toilet ?
why have it stained in a filthy way ?
and why oh why would you use it ?
I know , you caught meâ€¦â€ Why Not?â€ .
If you have an extra toilet in your backyard ( or front yard ) and are trying to help the environment by less consumption , I guess modding a toilet to be a PC is not a bad idea .
But would you bring it in your home or keep this toilet PC outside ?
10 . Mic Check PC
â€ ˜Check one , check twoâ€™ .
This Mic PC has both practicality and a retro look that many would not mind having inside their home .
Whether you have dreamed of being a famous singer , a radio disc jockey , or simply would want to build your own computer case mod , this Slipperyskip do it yourself Mic PC is outstanding .
The job looks so clean and worthy of two thumbs up .
11 . Can you Digg this PC ?
Was the Digg PC made by someone who works for Digg , reads the popular daily links , or just a modder who wants to reach the front page ?
This PC computer case mod made by ComputerChoppers in the shape of the Digg logo lights up brightly but cannot guarantee you front page popularity .
The digging is still up to you .
12 . R2D2 Robot PC Case mod
Star Wars fans have always been fans of R2D2 , and who could blame them ?
R2D2 is intelligent , compact , and is not afraid of telling C3PO to F&$ K Off .
So if you want some inspiration , have a loyal friend at your side , or are a Star Wars collecting freak like Ciberia … this PC computer mod is one for you .
It may be different than the R2D2 projector , but it is still a very cool piece of machinery that we would love to have staring at us while we surf .
13 . Microwave Computer case mod
This PC from Directron is cooking !
Another old appliance in your back yard … why are you even throwing all this stuff away ?
As a child , I was told many times to reduce Microwave use because of the radiation it projects , and this computer case mod grants another practical use for the major appliance .
The computer screen is the actual door we always look through checking if the food is hot , but this time it is a look into your desktop or the world wide web .
Just make sure not to spend too much time on the computer , so you donâ€™t cook your brain .
14 . Satan PC is Evil
Evil is in the house !
What demented artist at PCModhouse decided to create such an evil , satanic and bloody PC case mod beats me , but they went through a lot of trouble to create a shock value for anyone trying to check their email .
Is the skull what catches your attention , the skeleton hands , or the tons and tons of blood ?
Imagine walking into your roommateâ€™s room and seeing this Satanic computer case mod sitting on his or her desk … what would be the first words to come out of your mouth ?
15 . Nintendo PC
The NES was an amazing video game console back in the days .
Some would keep it for nostalgic reasons , some would still enjoy playing it , and some would mod it into a Nintendo PC case .
Instructables provide all the instructions of making your very own Nintendo Entertainment System pc and include images , comments and more .
This is a perfect way of combining the gaming world of Nintendo with the world of PCs .
16 . the Vulcanus
The Volcanus found through Modding .cz looks like a mean computer case .
It weighs 110 pounds and made a true blacksmith proud .
It could be that it is too heavy to be on you desk , but do n’t move it alone , it is probably too heavy for you .
17 . Nintendo GameCube PC
Oh the beautiful combination of the beloved Nintendo and the PC strikes again , and the PicoCube from WiiDS is an actual working PC .
Completely compact by size and shape , it brings the Nintendo GameCube together with a true PC .
Who could ask for anything more ?
On July 30th , 2008 , for the eighth time , legislators failed to extend renewable energy federal investment tax credits .
Senate bill S. 3335 would extend the 30 % business tax credit for installing solar energy systems through 2017 .
The bill also raises the homeowner tax credit cap from $ 2,000 to $ 4,000 .
You ’d really think this would be a slam dunk , right ?
Wrong .
I wanted to know why this did n’t pass , so I did a little more digging .
Above , you can see that a slim majority of senators voted to send the bill to the floor for debate and a vote .
However , in order for the debate to commence , 60 senators need to vote ‘ aye ’ .
Clearly , 51 was not enough .
Why did n’t more senators vote for this ?
What is going on here .
Well , let ’s take a closer look at who voted to bring the issue to debate by party this time :
Wow , huge split down the middle on party lines .
As it turns out , the sole democrat who voted against the bill was Harry Reid .
However , he voted nay when he saw the bill was not going to make it to debate as a procedural gesture so that he could bring it back after revisions on a later date .
Naturally , since my livelihood and the livelihood of the solar industry is linked to the fate of this bill , I wanted to see who those 5 Republicans were , and learn a little more about why they may have felt safe crossing party lines to vote ‘ aye ’ .
Vote Solar has made a call to phone and email your state senators or chiefs of staff to get this bill moving forward .
Though , part of me has felt that many Republicans are too tied to the oil , gas , and coal industries to even bother with them .
As OpenSecrets.org reports , since 1990 , oil companies have given 75 % of their funds to Republicans ( over $ 220,000,000 ) .
Take a close look at the spreadsheet below .
Listed here are all the Republican senators , the amount and percentage of total campaign contributions they received from the non-renewable energy industry in 2008 , and their votes to debate this bill ( source ) :
[ iframe : width = ” 700 ″ height = ” 975 ″ frameborder= ” 1 ″ scrolling =” yes ” src= ” http://sheet.zoho.com/publish/danyull99/senate-republican-voting-on-solar-itc-renewal”]
Now , you can clearly see that the 5 Republican senators ( Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe of Maine , Elizabeth Dole from North Carolina , Norm Coleman from Minnesota , and Gordon Smith from Oregon ) approving the procession of the bill had a relatively small percentage of their campaign contributions coming from the non-renewable energy industry – confirming some of my suspicions .
Since we have 52 votes in tow at this point ( including Harry Reid ) , 8 more Republicans need to cross party lines for anything to happen here .
Instead of wasting our time with the senators that are near the bottom of the list , we should really be focusing on the senators near the top in more progressive areas of the country .
These are the people we need to be hammering away at on the phones and emails .
Senators near the bottom of this list most assuredly will not be voting for anything green unless they can drill for oil next in your back yard .
It looks like the oil and gas companies are siding with the McCain - Palin horse , but look at how they are hedging some of their bets with Obama - Biden too ( Open Secrets ) :
Now , notice below both candidates abstained from this vote , but take a look at these 3 different funding sources for each of the following senators and their votes on this bill :
Look at the effect those Coal dollars had on Democrat Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia for example .
Wow .
He must have had a tough time getting up in the morning to look at himself having to abstain on this vote .
Understandably , West Virginia is a heavy coal state and even though he ’s a Democrat , he has to tread lightly .
Even though clean coal is complete and utter BS , Jay has got some constituents to look after and some lobbyist money to honor .
Hopefully , you find these contributions as enlightening as I did .

It �s bad enough that Congress passed the Supplemental Appropriations
Act of 2008 two weeks ago , spending $ 165 billion more on our country�s illegal war on and occupation of Iraq well into 2009 .
To add insult to injury , after closely reading the bill , we discovered that Congress snuck in a last - minute earmark for $ 170 million in Foreign Military Financing ( FMF ) for Israel !
The culprit : Representative David Obey ( WI - 7 ) , Chair of the House Appropriations Committee , who has received nearly $ 225,000 from " pro-Israel " PAC�s and more than $ 200,000 from the military - industrial complex since 1989 , according to the Center for Responsive Politics .
Yes , the same David Obey who can be seen in this video berating peace activists for wanting to cut off funding for the war in Iraq .
Yesterday , the US Campaign sent Rep .
Obey a sharply - worded letter protesting his decision to slip this earmark for Israel into an unrelated bill at the last minute , thereby preventing any public scrutiny or debate .
To view a copy of the letter , please click here .
So why was this appropriation for military aid for Israel slipped into an unrelated bill at the last minute ?
Because Congress apparently has decided to delay passing the FY2009 budget until 2009 , even though the fiscal year begins on October 1 .
This means that Congress will have to operate under what is known as a Continuing Resolution ( CR ) to keep the government open until it passes the budget .
How does this relate to military aid to Israel ?
Under a CR , funding is frozen at current levels for all government programs , meaning that Israel would automatically get $ 2.38 billion in military aid .
But President Bush requested $ 2.55 billion in aid for Israel in FY2009 , the first proposed increase under a ten - year Memorandum of Understanding signed by the United States and Israel in 2007 to increase military aid to $ 30 billion over the next decade .
The additional $ 170 million was tacked on at the last moment by Rep .
Obey so that , in his words , " Israel would not be accidentally short - changed " should Congress operate under a CR ( Congressional Record , H5667 , June 19 ) .
Short - changed ?
Hardly .
Israel is already the largest recipient of U.S. military aid , which it uses in violation of U.S. laws to prosecute an illegal military occupation and siege of the Palestinian West Bank , East Jerusalem , and Gaza Strip .
That is why the US Campaign has taken the lead in organizing a campaign to get the United States to cut off military aid to Israel , rather than increase it .

FOXBOROUGH , Mass . --
Rodney Harrison 's career is almost certainly over after the hard - hitting but injury - plagued safety of the New England Patriots tore his right thigh muscle .
" It appears as though the rehab could take 8 to 10 months , " a person familiar with the injury told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the team has not made an official announcement .
" For all intents and purposes , his career is over , " the person , who confirmed the nature of the injury , said in an e-mail Tuesday .
The Patriots officially placed Harrison on the injured reserve list Wednesday , ending his season .
Harrison , a 15 - year veteran , two - time Pro Bowler and two - time Super Bowl champion , tore the quadriceps muscle without being hit while chasing scrambling quarterback Jay Cutler on the last play of the third quarter of the Patriots ' 41 - 7 win over the Denver Broncos on Monday night .
Harrison has had persistent thigh problems as far back as last season 's playoffs .
" He 's had a slight tear all [ this ] season , " Bill McLaughlin , a marketing representative for Harrison , said Tuesday .
" He was getting treatment on it . "
Harrison was listed on the Patriots ' injury report with a thigh problem before their first two playoff games last season .
The injury kept him out of practice two days before New England 's 21 - 12 win over San Diego in the AFC Championship Game .
He was not on the injury report for the Super Bowl , won by the New York Giants 17 - 14 .
Harrison played in all three of those games .
The NFL Network first reported Tuesday that Harrison had a torn quad .
The Boston Globe later reported he had a torn right quad .
During the game , it was announced he had a knee injury .
Harrison played in all six games this season and was not listed on any injury reports but " was injured the whole time , " McLaughlin said .
" He 's played through injuries before . "
Harrison , in the final year of his contract , might have retired anyway after this season following a succession of serious injuries in two of the three previous years .
After being injured Monday , Harrison pointed to his teammates and waved to the crowd as he was driven off the field on a cart .
Coach Bill Belichick gave no update on the injury during his conference call Tuesday , but said after the game that it did n't look good .
" It was difficult for all of us to watch Rodney be carted off like he did , " Belichick said Tuesday .
" We hope that all goes well for him . "
The Patriots ( 4 - 2 ) already are without quarterback Tom Brady , who suffered a season - ending knee injury in the opener , and running back Laurence Maroney , whose season ended when he went on injured reserve Monday with a shoulder injury .
Belichick refused to say if Maroney would need surgery .
Sammy Morris rushed for 138 yards in his place but hurt his knee and did n't play in the second half .
Belichick said his status was day to day .
The injury to the 35 - year - old Harrison is his fourth in four years .
In 2005 , he tore three ligaments in his left knee in the third game and missed the rest of the season and the playoffs .
The next season , he sat out six games with a broken right shoulder blade and returned for two before suffering a strained right knee in the final regular - season game and missing the playoffs .
He was healthy last season but missed the first four games for violating the league 's substance - abuse policy .
He said he used the substance , believed to be human growth hormone , to speed up his healing process .
This season , he started all six games and had one interception .
Harrison made five tackles Monday before the injury .
" Rodney is one of the leaders on the defense from experience and from his playing style and production , " Belichick said .
" He 's a good player .
He 's been a good player [ for the Patriots ] just going on six years now .
" It was hard to watch him go through what happened last night .
That 's tough .
I feel badly for him .
You hate to see that with any player , but that was very unfortunate for him and we all feel badly for him . "
Safety Brandon Meriweather , a first - round draft choice last year , got his third interception of the season Monday and likely would move into a starting role .
Harrison made the Pro Bowl in 1998 and 2001 during his nine - year stint with San Diego .
The Chargers cut him after the 2002 season when he was slowed by an ankle injury .
The Patriots signed him as a free agent in March 2003 and they won Super Bowls in each of their first two seasons with him .
In six seasons with New England , he had nine sacks and eight interceptions .
The aggressive Harrison , the target of complaints by some opponents of dirty hits , has been fined more than $ 200,000 by the NFL .
He was suspended for one game in 2002 for a helmet - to - helmet hit on Oakland 's Jerry Rice that cost him a game check of $ 111,764 .
But Harrison also has been a mentor to players like 24 - year - old James Sanders , the Patriots ' other starting safety .
" He is a future Hall of Famer .
He is one of the best to play this game .
He has taught me a lot , " Sanders said in the locker room after Monday 's victory .
" I am going to go to the training room and see how he is doing and let him know I am here for him . "
Information from The Associated Press was used in this report .
Roy T. Fielding , author of the REST thesis wrote an article recently : REST APIs must be hypertext - driven .
I liked this article , it fit with an intuition I ’ve had .
Then he wrote an article explaining that he would n’t really explain the other articles because , I guess , he wanted a conversation with the specialists , and it seems like a kind of invitation to reinterpret his writing .
So since others are doing it I figured I ’d do it too .
I ’d summarize his argument thus :
Focus on media types , i.e. , resource formats , i.e. , document formats .
The protocol will flow from these if they are well specified .
URL structures are not a media type .
They are some kind of server layout .
You ca n’t hold them , you ca n’t pass them around , there is no notion of CRUD .
Media types have all sorts of advantages that URL structures do not .
An example of a protocol based on a URL structure would be something like :
Do GET / articles / to get a JSON list of all the article ids , with a response like [ 1 , 2 , 3 ]
to get a list of all the article ids , with a response like Do a GET / articles / {id} to get the representation of a specific article .
JSON is a reasonable structure for a media type .
It is not itself a fully explained type , because it ’s just a container for data , just like XML .
In this example you have a document , [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] which is n’t self - describing and just is n’t very useful .
A more appropriate protocol would be :
You start with a container , in our example / articles / .
Do GET / articles / to get a JSON document listing the URLs of all the articles .
These URLs are relative to the container URL .
You ’ll get a response like [ './1 ' , './2 ' , './3 ' ] ( actually [ ' 1 ' , ' 2 ' , ' 3 ' ] would be fine too ) .
.
Do to get a document listing the URLs of all the articles .
These URLs are relative to the container .
You ’ll get a response like ( actually would be fine too ) .
Do GET {article - url} to get the article representation .
It ’s a small difference .
Heck , the communication could look identical in practice , but by putting URLs in the JSON document instead of this abstract “ id ” notion you ’ve created a more flexible and self - describing system .
You could probably give a name to that list of URLs , and then just talk about that name .
An example in Atompub is rel= ” edit ” .
An Atom entry can look like :
< entry >... < link rel= " edit " href= " / post/15 " /> </entry >
Instead of the client just somehow knowing where to go to edit an entry , it ’s made explicit .
Thus you can move the entry around , while still pointing back to the canonical location to edit that entry .
There ’s nothing really that complicated about this , the rule is really quite simple : link to other things , do n’t just expect the client to know or guess where those other things are .
For a more concrete example of where this linking works well , OpenID uses < link rel= " openid.server " href= " ... " > and < link rel= " openid.delegate " href= " ... " > , which allows you to add a little information to any HTML homepage so that the login can happen at a third location .
If OpenID used something like looking at {homepage} / openid for a OpenID server then you could n’t select whatever OpenID service you liked , or change services , or apply OpenID to hosted locations where you could n’t install an OpenID server .
I ’ll add my own little opinion in here : this is why the URL structure of applications does n’t affect their RESTfulness , nor is URL structure all that important of a concern generally .
Pretty URL structures are a nice thing to do , like indenting your code in a pleasant way , but it has nothing to do with your API , and if you ca n’t use a crappy URL structure with that same API then probably something is wrong with that API .

Advertisement Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Ian Blair has announced his resignation , blaming a lack of support from London mayor Boris Johnson .
Sir Ian has faced controversies in the job but said he was not stepping down on 1 December because of any failures .
Mr Johnson said the Met needed " new leadership " , but the home secretary said there was " a process in place that the mayor chose not to respect " .
Gordon Brown said Sir Ian had made a " huge " contribution to the UK 's safety .
The prime minister went on to commend Sir Ian 's leadership at the time of the July 2005 suicide bomb attacks on London 's transport system .

Most computers will open this document automatically , but you may need Adobe Reader Download the reader here Home Secretary Jacqui Smith said : " I pay tribute to Sir Ian for the massive reductions in crime that his leadership of the Met has overseen and his continuing efforts to tackle gun , gang and knife crime .
" His part in leading neighbourhood policing across London has led to Londoners being safer and more confident . "
But she accused Mr Johnson of ignoring protocol regarding the mayor 's relationship with the police , adding : " Frankly you should put a bit of time and effort into that before you jump to judgement . "
Mr Johnson , who took over as chairman of the police authority on Wednesday , has avoided publicly backing Sir Ian since being elected Conservative Party mayor in May .
Speaking after Sir Ian 's resignation , the mayor said : " There comes a time in any organisation when it becomes clear it would benefit from new leadership and clarity of purpose .
I believe that time is now . "
' No secrets ' Sir Ian 's tenure as head of Britain 's biggest police force started confidently with reforms including community support officers , neighbourhood police , and a more diverse workforce .
The new mayor made clear , in a very pleasant and determined way , that he wished there to be a change of leadership
Sir Ian Blair
Resignation statement in full Reaction to decision
But some senior officers disliked his close relationship with Downing Street when Tony Blair was prime minister , and his leadership style .
There were questions about his handling of events surrounding the 2005 death of Jean Charles de Menezes , who was shot dead at Stockwell Underground station in south London after being mistaken for a suicide bomber .
The Met Police was later convicted of a health and safety offence over the incident .
Sir Ian was also criticised after publicly questioning why the murders of two girls , Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman , in Soham , Cambridgeshire in 2002 , had been such a big story in the media .
It later emerged he had recorded a telephone conversation with the attorney general without asking his permission .
In 2006 , in the course of arresting two brothers who were later cleared of any involvement in terrorism , armed Met officers shot and injured one of them .
Recently , Sir Ian has faced criticism over the racism row involving the Met 's most senior Asian officer Tarique Ghaffur .
And Metropolitan Police Authority auditors are in the process of examining Scotland Yard contracts given to consultancy firm Impact Plus , run by a friend .

Sir Ian has said he had been " open and straightforward " in informing both the police service and the police authority about the friendship .
Sir Ian , whose contract was due to run until 2010 , defended his record as he announced his resignation at Scotland Yard .
" I am resigning not because of any failures of my service and not because the pressures of the office and the many stories that surround it are too much .
" I am resigning in the best interests of the people of London and of the Metropolitan Police Service . "
Shadow home secretary Dominic Grieve said Sir Ian had taken the " right decision " in standing down .
HAVE YOUR SAY
It 's a very difficult job , and I do n't believe that he did badly , but he needs to go Nic Brough , London Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne said the resignation was " long overdue " .
But the former London mayor Ken Livingstone said the resignation appeared to make the role of the commissioner more political .
" Whoever is now appointed to replace Sir Ian Blair will know that there 's a precedent that an incoming mayor feels they 've got the right to change the commissioner of police , " he said .
Erionaldo da Silva , speaking for the de Menezes family , said Sir Ian should have resigned three years ago and the decision to do so now should not deflect attention from Jean Charles ' ongoing inquest .
The Home Office and the Metropolitan Police Authority will draw up a shortlist for Sir Ian 's successor .
Met Deputy commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson will take over as acting head should no candidate be appointed by the time Sir Ian leaves .
The Metropolitan Police Federation , which represents rank and file police officers , said it was looking forward to building a " positive and constructive relationship " with the new chief .
Sir Edward Henry was the last commissioner of the Metropolitan Police to quit in 1918 , following a damaging police strike , the last time officers were allowed to walk out .

What are these ?
The Republican vice presidential nominee ’s Alaskan administration has not only supported the aerial hunting of adult wolves , but also the slaughter of their pups .
Sarah Palin ’s record is not very favorable for wildlife .
She ’s put efforts into undoing federal wildlife protections for polar bears and beluga whales in order to protect oil and gas drilling operations , for example .
But her position on wolf hunting is perhaps the most controversial .
One of Palin ’s first acts in office was to put a $ 150 bounty on the heads of her state ’s wolves , allegedly with the goal of increasing the moose and caribou population .
But this was no ordinary hunt – it was meant to incentivize the aerial killing of wolves , in which private hunters take a small plane and chase down wolf packs until they ’re exhausted and can’t move any more , when they either shoot them from the air or land and execute them at point blank range .
A Defenders of Wildlife ad illustrating this process is available at ClimateProgress .
Even worse , now Palin ’s administration is allowing its “ Department of Wildlife Conservation ” to enter into wolf dens and slaughter wolf pups , even though Alaska law specifically prohibits this activity ( Regulation 5AAC 92.110 ( i ) ) .
According to Defenders of Wildlife :
“ Over the past year , the state has produced several publications as part of its $ 400,000 public education campaign designed to inform Alaskans about the facts of its programs .
Our scientific and legal review of this information has found similar omissions of critical information including overstating the impact of predation on moose and caribou populations and failing to recognize the importance of other limiting factors .
The state ’s recent omission of important facts regarding its control efforts in its ‘ public education ’ materials appears to be clearly intentional and designed to influence the vote on the pending ballot measure regarding the aerial hunting of wolves and bears .
One has to wonder if the department tried to keep the killing of these wolf pups under wraps because of the upcoming vote .
It would be an understatement to say the Palin Administration ’s wildlife and environmental record leaves something to be desired .

OK , on to the telomeric part of the session :
Brad Johnson talked about G - quadruplex structures , which often form at telomeres , and suggested that they may be connected to gene expression in cellular senescence .
Robert Marciniak presented evidence that the telomeres act as a “ genotoxic clock . ”
In his model , repair of DNA damage at telomeres results in telomere shortening — so that even in non-dividing cells , the lifetime exposure to DNA damaging agents will be reflected in telomere length .
Liz Blackburn reviewed even more evidence that peripheral blood leukocyte telomere length is associated with psychological stress and the risk of CVD .
This story is evolving into an explanation for immune senescence and the increased susceptibility of the elderly to diseases of various kinds .
The model goes roughly as follows : Signal input → brain → hormones → negative outputs including shorter telomeres → immune dysfunction → disease impact
Ursula Muñoz - Najar examined TIFs ( telomere dysfunction - induced foci ) in aging mice , as well as mice eating high - fat , CR or control diets .
Both aging and high - fat diets are associated with increased TIFs , but — fortunately for the mice — this is reversible when the mice are shifted to a lower - calorie , lower - fat diet .
Resveratrol had similar effects on TIFs : in mice on a high - fat diet , RSV could reduce TIF levels to that of mice on control diets .
To the extent that TIFs are a legitimate biomarker of aging , these findings are consistent with ( now questioned ) reports that resveratrol can extend the healthspan of mice fed an unhealthy diet .

Remembering Ken Iverson
by Roger Hui , November 2004
Acknowledgments
I am indebted to Chris Burke , Eric Iverson , Eugene McDonnell , Donald McIntyre , Roland Pesch , Joey Tuttle , and Arthur Whitney for reading earlier drafts of the paper .
0. Beginnings
I first met Ken Iverson early in 1981 in Toronto , when he invited me to dinner , along with Mrs. Jean Iverson , and Eugene McDonnell , Lib Gibson , David Keith , and Jane Minett of I.P. Sharp Associates .
I believe the dinner happened because Eugene mentioned me to Ken , mainly due to The N Queens Problem paper [ 0 ]
I had submitted to the Recreational APL column that he wrote and edited .
So now not only was I to meet the great Ken Iverson , inventor of APL , but I was also to get a free dinner .
The latter was a consideration : at the time I was a graduate student at the University of Toronto .
At the appointed hour I went up to Ken ’s apartment on the 47th floor of the Manulife Center .
I was so in awe of the great man that I took scant notice of the spectacular view — from the apartment one can see Niagara Falls , a 90 minute drive away — until Ken directed me to do so .
We then went for dinner at a restaurant on King Street .
I do n’t remember much about the dinner , except for the way Ken left the tip .
The change came back from paying the dinner check , in the form of the dingiest looking bills you ever saw .
Ken took out his wallet , extracted some crisp clean bills , and crumbled them up before leaving them on the tray .
In another sense , I had “ met ” Ken Iverson years before , when I learned APL during my undergraduate studies at the University of Alberta , from reading the APL \360 User ’s Manual [ 1 ] and from working at the computer terminal .
Since I did not have direct access to Ken , I read his papers carefully , principally The Design of APL [ 2 ] , The Evolution of APL [ 3 ] , and Notation as a Tool of Thought [ 4 ] .
I also further acquainted myself with APL during the summers of 1975 and 1976 , when Lib Gibson hired me to work as a summer student at I.P. Sharp in Calgary .
1. From APL to J
The late 70’s and early 80 ’s were an exciting time for APL .
APL was a commercial success .
APL was taught in schools and universities .
APL conferences were well - attended .
( I attended my first APL conference in 1979 in Rochester , and my recollected impression is that the parallel sessions at the conference each had audiences of over a hundred . )
Ken had published his seminal paper Operators and Functions [ 5 ] in April 1978 .
He went from IBM to I.P. Sharp in Toronto in 1980 , and there collaborated with Arthur Whitney on Practical Uses of a Model of APL [ 6 ] in 1981 - 82 , leading to Rationalized APL [ 7 ] in January 1983 , multiple editions of A Dictionary of the APL Language between 1984 and 1987 , and A Dictionary of APL [ 8 ] in September 1987 .
Within I.P. Sharp , the phrase “ dictionary APL ” came into use to denote the APL specified by A Dictionary of APL , itself referred to as “ the dictionary ” .
At that time , the main APL vendors were IBM , STSC , and I.P. Sharp , and all were active in developing and extending the language .
IBM had APL2 , based on the work of Trenchard More and Jim Brown [ 9 , 10 , 11 ] .
Work on APL2 proceeded intermittently for 15 years [ 12 ] , with actual coding starting in 1971 and APL2 becoming available as an IUP in 1982 .
STSC had an experimental APL implementation called NARS [ 13 ] .
NARS and APL2 differed in fundamental respects from dictionary APL ( and differed from each other ) .
I.P. Sharp implemented the new APL ideas in stages , complex numbers , enclosed ( boxed ) arrays , match , and composition operators ( on , over , under ) in 1981 [ 14 , 15 ] , determinant in 1982 [ 16 ] , and the rank operator , lev ( left ) , dex ( right ) , and link in 1983 [ 17 ] .
However , the domains of operators were restricted to the primitive functions or subsets thereof .
I.P. Sharp also had SHARP APL / HP [ 18 ] , principally the work of Arthur Whitney with the assistance of Rob Hodgkinson .
An important stepping stone from APL to J was SAX [ 19 ] , SHARP APL / Unix , written in C and based on an implementation by STSC .
An alpha version of SAX became available within I.P. Sharp around December 1986 or early 1987 .
From that time to August 1989 , when the first J source line was written , I had access to SAX , and in the later part of that period used SAX on a daily basis .
SAX implemented dictionary APL in part , and was upward - compatible with mainframe SHARP APL in order to run applications ported from there .
It permitted derived or user - defined functions as arguments to operators , and had the special APL characters , workspaces , and the del - form function definition .
However , it did not permit functions and operators to be named using the assignment arrow , as in the phrase sum ← +/ , precluding what later came to be called tacit definition .
( The dictionary specified such assignment . )
It also did not have hooks and forks [ 20 ] , for those were not yet invented .
For Ken , an important drawback to SAX was that it was not widely and freely available .
From a personal perspective , another important stepping stone from APL to J was the writing of my APL87 paper Some Uses of { and } [ 21 ] .
At the time both Ken and I were working for I.P. Sharp in Toronto , and the ideas in the paper evolved over many conversations with Ken .
Writing the paper refined and sharpened my understanding of dictionary APL .
Arthur Whitney , from collaborating with Ken on Practical Uses of a Model of APL [ 6 ] in 1981 - 82 , inventing the rank operator while on the train ride to the APL82 conference in Heidelberg in 1982 [ 22 , 23 ] , and implementing SHARP APL / HP in 1986 [ 18 ] , went on to Morgan Stanley in 1988 and there invented A [ 24 ] .
He later invented k [ 25 ] in 1993 and q [ 26 ] in 2003 .
( Arthur is a classmate from the University of Alberta ; over the years our paths have crossed many times , and each time I had benefitted .
But that is a story for another time . )
In the wider world , the PC revolution was in full swing .
It was now possible to have a computer ( for example , the AT&T 3B1 UNIX PC or the IBM PC / AT ) at home that was a reasonable platform for developing an APL system .
Not too long ago , such a platform would be under lock and key in a room with a raised floor , inaccessible to mere mortals and not readily available for experimentation .
The conditions were ripe for ...
2. J
[ 27 ]
[ 28 ]
Work began in the summer of 1989 when I first discussed my desires with Arthur Whitney .
He proposed the use of C for implementation , and produced ( on one page and in one afternoon ) a working fragment that provided only one function (+ ) , one operator ( / ) , one - letter names , and arrays limited to ranks 0 and 1 , but did provide for boxed arrays and for the use of the copula for assigning names to any entity .
I showed this fragment to others in the hope of interesting someone competent in both C and APL to take up the work , and soon recruited Roger Hui , who was attracted in part by the unusual style of C programming used by Arthur , a style that made heavy use of preprocessing facilities to permit writing further C in a distinctly APL style .
Roger and I then began collaboration on the design and implementation of a dialect of APL ( later named J by Roger ) , first deciding to roughly follow “ A Dictionary of APL ” and to impose no requirement of compatibility with any existing dialect .
We were assisted by suggestions from many sources , particularly in the design of the spelling scheme ( E.B. Iverson and A.T. Whitney ) and in the treatment of cells , items , and formatting ( A.T. Whitney , based on his work on SHARP APL / HP and on the dialect A reported at the APL89 conference in New York ) .
E.E. McDonnell of Reuters provided C programs for the mathematical functions ( which applied to complex numbers as well as to real ) , D.L. Orth of IBM ported the system to the IBM RISC System / 6000 in time for the APL90 conference , and L.J. Dickey of the University of Waterloo provided assistance in porting the system to a number of other computers .
It ’s funny , but my recollection is that at the time I thought I recruited Ken .
Whoever recruited whom , I won a great prize when Ken decided he and I should work together .
The final impetus that got J started was the one - page interpreter fragment that Arthur wrote , recorded in Appendix A of An Implementation of J [ 29 ] and also reproduced in Appendix A below .
My immediate reaction on seeing the page was recoil and puzzlement : it looked nothing like any C code I had ever seen .
( “ Is it even C ? ” )
However , Ken counselled that I should reserve judgment .
As recounted in An Implementation of J , it then happened that :
I studied this interpreter for about a week for its organization and programming style ; and on Sunday , August 27 , 1989 , at about four o’clock in the afternoon , wrote the first line of code that became the implementation described in this document .
The name “ J ” was chosen a few minutes later , when it became necessary to save the interpreter source file for the first time .
I consciously designed and built the system around “ Table 2 : Parsing Process ” in A Dictionary of APL [ 8 ] , which I had studied carefully and modelled at least two different ways between 1986 and 1989 .
The C data and program structures were designed so that the parse table in C corresponded as directly as possible to the parse table in the dictionary .
I set as an objective of being able to show Ken the C source for the parser , and have him verify that the syntax being implemented was correct .
We never did carry out the exercise ( of Ken reading the C source ) , but I reckon I met my objective , because eventually Ken replaced the table in the dictionary with the parse table from the C source [ 30 , section II E ] .
Other effects of trying to meet the objective were entirely beneficial .
Years after the initial implementation , I happened to re-read Ken ’s APL87 paper APL87 [ 31 ] .
In retrospect , the paper , in five pages , prescribed all the essential steps in writing an APL interpreter , in particular the sections on word formation and parsing .
Ken and I had in mind to implement A Dictionary of APL [ 8 ] together with hooks and forks ( phrasal forms ) [ 20 ] .
For years , Ken had struggled to find a way to write f+g as in calculus , from the “ scalar operators ” in Operators and Functions [ 5 , section 4 ] , through the “ til ” operator in Practical Uses of a Model of APL [ 6 ] and Rationalized APL [ 7 , p. 18 ] , and finally forks .
Forks are defined as follows :
( f g h ) y ↔ ( f y ) g ( h y ) x ( f g h ) y ↔ ( x f y ) g ( x h y )
( f g p q r )
↔
( f g ( p q r ) )
f+g
f+g
The choice to implement forks was fortuitous and fortunate .
We realized only later [ 32 ] that forks made tacit expressions ( operator expressions ) complete in the following sense : any sentence involving one or two arguments that did not use its arguments as an argument to an operator , can be written tacitly with fork and @ : ( compose ) and [ ( left ) and ] ( right ) and constant functions .
If @ : were replaced by the equivalent special fork [ : f g , then a sentence can be written as an unbroken train ( sequence of forks ) .
Because explicit definition ( the analogue of del - form definitions in APL ) was relatively complex , it was not implemented until some months had elapsed .
As well , the restriction in APL that only nouns ( arrays ) can be assigned never made it past the first day , for there was no way other than by assignment to name verbs , adverbs , and conjunctions ( functions and operators ) .
Therefore , for some months all verbs were tacit ; that is , all functions were defined as operator expressions .
These circumstances forced us to explore tacit definition extensively .
Meanwhile , Ken was concerned about the usefulness of forks , and worked hard at finding examples of forks beyond those in Phrasal Forms [ 20 ] .
After a while , it seemed that everything was a fork .
The explanation lies in the proof of completeness for tacit definition [ 32 ] : if the root ( last ) function in a sentence is applied dyadically , then a fork is required to write the sentence tacitly .
Since we wrote tacit definitions exclusively , it was no wonder that we ran into forks constantly .
As well , we had little trouble expressing computations tacitly because of the completeness .
Eric Iverson founded Iverson Software Inc. in February 1990 to provide an improved SHARP APL / PC product .
It quickly became obvious that we had shared interests and goals , and in May 1990 Ken and I joined Iverson Software Inc .
The company soon became J only .
The name was changed to Jsoftware Inc. ( www.jsoftware.com) in April 2000 .
Eric adapted the session manager from SHARP APL / PC for J in time for the first release .
Over the years , he was responsible for everything that was not the interpreter proper — the integrated development environment , the Windows interface , and all other interfaces — and made contributions to the language itself , including locatives , control structures , and memory - mapped files .
Eric also handled product packaging and release details .
Chris Burke joined us in early 1994 and wrote the application libraries , in particular the plot package , the debugger , the project manager , and the performance monitor .
Work proceeded rapidly from August 1989 .
The first public presentation took place on 1990 - 02 - 26 when Ken and I gave a talk complete with a live demo to the Toronto APLSIG at the Toronto Board of Trade .
The first release of the software was at APL90 [ 33 ] in Copenhagen in August 1990 , when J was made available as shareware to the Software Exchange .
( You can still get this version from various archives . )
The first J conference was held on 1996 - 06 - 24 to - 25 at the Koffler Institute of the University of Toronto .
There were 123 attendees and 12 contributed papers in the proceedings [ 34 ] .
In working with Ken , I soon realized that Ken had a flexibility of mind that is breathtaking .
Two examples illustrate this point .
Example 0 : For the first few months , the special APL characters and the ASCII spelling co-existed in the system .
It was Ken who first suggested that I should kill off the special APL characters .
I myself resisted for a few weeks longer , until the situation became too confusing , for reasons described in J for the APL Programmer [ 35 , p. 11 ] .
Example 1 : It came time to implement \ ( “ scan ” ) .
On that day ( in the first half of 1990 ) , during lunch at Josie ’s Cafe on Yonge Street , I asked Ken innocently , “ Have you ever wanted to scan something other than reduction ? ”
The question was not even well - formed , because the APL paradigm is so powerful that it usually pushes aside alternative thoughts .
Nevertheless , the discussion that then proceeded was productive , and quickly led to the realization that [ 35 , p. 16 ] :
Some APL expressions apply reduction implicitly .
For example , APL scan applies its left argument reduction to successive prefixes of the right argument .
The use of reduction ensured that computations such as sum scan can be effected by primitive function arguments to the operator , and that the overall result could be assembled in APL \360 .
With J’s more permissive assembly rules ( and the use of boxed arrays ) , reduction is no longer necessary , and in many cases , inappropriate .
Therefore in J , if a reduction is required , it must be specified .
Thus +/\ in J computes sum scan and +/\. computes suffix sum scan .
The following J example does not use reduction , and is therefore not readily expressed using APL scan : <\ ' abcdef ' +-+--+---+----+-----+------+
|a|ab|abc|abcd|abcde|abcdef| +-+--+---+----+-----+------+
Much recent work involved “ recognizing ” phrases and implementing them with special code .
The expressive power of tacit expressions makes this a fruitful approach .
For example , if f is a primitive proposition , then :
f i. 0 : first place where not x f y f i. 1 : first place where x f y f i : 0 : last place where not x f y f i : 1 : last place where x f y + / @ :f number of places where x f y +./ @:f x f y anywhere ?
*./@:f x f y everywhere ?
I. @:f indices where x f y
are supported by special code .
A primitive proposition is one of the relational atomic verbs ( scalar functions ) = ~ : < <: > > : or the verbs E. or e. ( respectively , “ substring match ” and “ member of ” ; a legend of the J words used in the text is available in Appendix B below . )
For example :
' boustrophedonic ' ( e.i.1 : ) ' aeiou ' NB. index of first vowel 1 ' boustrophedonic ' ( e.i:1 : ) ' aeiou ' NB. index of last vowel 13
If the target is found near the beginning of the search , the result is computed instantaneously ( and in time independent of the lengths of the arguments for atomic verbs f ) .
Even if the target is found only at the end of the search , the improvement in time is by a factor of two or more .
In either case the space used is constant for atomic verbs f .
Another recent development is a port to the Linux and Windows XP 64 - bit operating systems on the AMD64 and Intel EM64T processors [ 36 ] .
J64 has 64 - bit integers and a 64 - bit address space .
Ken had started to write a companion to the Abramowitz and Stegun classic , Handbook of Mathematical Functions [ 37 ] .
Such writing was the motivation behind the extended - precision integer and rational number facilities ; to the same end , extended - precision floating - point numbers will be also added .
The following examples illustrate extended - precision integers and rational numbers :
(+%) /\ 10 $ 1 1 2 1.5 1.66667 1.6 1.625 1.61538 1.61905 1.61765 1.61818 (+% ) /\ 10 $ 1x 1 2 3r2 5r3 8r5 13r8 21r13 34r21 55r34 89r55 0j40 " : (+% ) / 100 $ 1x 1.6180339887498948482045868343656381177203
The hook x (+%) y is x plus the reciprocal of y , and so (+% ) / is the continued fraction .
The first phrase computes convergents to the golden ratio phi in 64 - bit IEEE floating - point numbers ; the second computes rational convergents to phi ; and the third computes phi to 40 decimal places .
3. Remembering Ken
Ken and I worked on J in our homes in Toronto , I in my apartment in the High Park area and Ken in his apartment on Erskine Avenue and subsequently in the Manulife Center ( a different apartment from the one in 1981 , with an even more spectacular view ) .
The arrangement placed me uniquely under Ken ’s influence .
Oftentimes I found myself at Ken ’s house , delivering the latest J version or working on a computer , and many times Ken would invite me to stay for lunch or dinner , explaining that “ thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn ” .
Little did I imagine in 1981 that the dinner I had with Ken and Jean then would be the first of many .
It is said that if you keep playing chess with a grandmaster , your skills can not help but improve .
I had been in almost daily contact with the master since late 1986 , and the following are a few of the things I have learned .
Credit .
When Ken was at Harvard a fellow student habitually stamped his papers “ Copyright ” or “ Confidential ” .
Howard Aiken , head of the Comp Lab and Ken ’s thesis supervisor , advised , “ Do n’t worry about people stealing your ideas .
If it ’s any good , you ’d have to ram it down their throats ! ”
( A less picturesque version of this story is found in [ 38 , p. 240 ] . )
Blame .
Ken and I sometimes kidded each other about whose fault it was when something went wrong .
He complained in jest that I as implementor had the attitude of “ just tell me where to pour the concrete ” .
And I , in turn , complained in jest that he as designer had the attitude that he was never to blame :
If it ’s a mistake in the implementation , then it ’s obviously my fault ; and if it ’s a mistake in the design , well then I should have caught it during the implementation .
In truth , I am profoundly grateful to Ken for not complaining in the times when I failed him , even when I failed him the same way more than once .
I believe that if necessary , he would have forgiven me for seventy times seven times ( although even I would probably catch on before too long ) .
Secret to Success .
In January 1992 , I was in the final struggles of writing my book An Implementation of J [ 29 ] , having difficulty and under time pressure .
Around that time , Ken was polishing off several books and papers , seemingly effortlessly .
I asked him what his secret was .
His reply was , basically , “ First , write 500 papers . ”
( Ken subsequently gave me some more immediately useful advice about writing . )
Reading and Writing Carefully .
In the early days I did not have direct access to Ken , and therefore read his papers carefully .
Another example is Arthur Whitney ’s “ one page thing ” , which was the final thing I studied ( for one week ) before writing the first line of source code for J .
Over the years , I have benefitted enormously from such careful reading .
I later realized that Ken wrote carefully , in the expectation that what he wrote would be read carefully .
An exemplar of such writing is the description of “ cut ” in Rationalized APL [ 7 , p. 19 - 20 ] .
It annoyed Ken to no end when accused of being “ too terse ” , for example as in “ the dictionary is too terse ” , when “ terse ” means “ effectively concise ” .
Words .
As others have recounted , Ken was deeply interested in words , their use and their etymology .
He indeed did read the dictionary , and kept a copy of the American Heritage Dictionary [ 39 ] ( along with other dictionaries ) by his easy chair for ready reference .
He especially encouraged me to consult the section on Indo - European roots in the back of the AHD , which makes deep and uncommon connections between words .
Many of Ken ’s relatives and friends received from him the AHD as a present .
I myself did not because I ’d already owned one years before I met Ken .
In fact , I gave him the third edition of the AHD as a present .
I think nothing I had ever done impressed Ken quite as much as when I found the word “ rhematic ” ( meaning , pertaining to the formation of words ) , a word he had been searching for for some time .
Thus the phrase “ rhematic rules of J ” made its way into the J dictionary [ 30 ] .
Books .
Before long , Ken and I discovered that we shared a love of books .
We often recommended reading material to each other .
A sample of our recommendations :
I to Ken : The Language Instinct by Steven Pinker ; Climbing Mount Improbable by Richard Dawkins ; Lincoln at Gettysburg by Garry Wills .
Ken to me : From Dawn to Decadence by Jacques Barzun ; Calvin and Hobbes ; The New York Review of Books .
And , of course , both of us had read The Book of J [ 40 ] .
Politics .
Unsurprisingly , Ken stood up for what he believed in .
He once spent a few hours in jail after being arrested during a protest against the Vietnam War .
In the same cell was Garry Wills , the historian and author .
Respect for People .
Ken liked to tell the story of the stoic service agent :
At an airport counter an irate traveller was berating the service agent over something or other , which the agent took with stoic forbearance .
After the traveller went on his way , the next person in line told the agent , “ I am amazed at how well you took that abuse . ”
The agent smiled thinly and replied , “ Oh , the gentleman is flying to Chicago , but his luggage is going to Moscow . ”
Ken also suggested , “ Be kind to someone trying to make a living . ”
I try to remember this every time a taxi or truck driver cuts me off on the road .
A Questioning and Flexible Mind .
The flexibility of mind that Ken brought to his work ( noted above ) was also demonstrated in his everyday life .
For example , it astounded me how often and how thoroughly Ken rearranged the furniture in his home .
His explanation was , our needs have changed , and we rearranged our surroundings to meet those needs .

One summer weekend in 1989 , Arthur Whitney visited Ken Iverson at Kiln Farm and produced — on one page and in one afternoon — an interpreter fragment on the AT&T 3B1 computer .
I studied this interpreter for about a week for its organization and programming style ; and on Sunday , August 27 , 1989 , at about four o’clock in the afternoon , wrote the first line of code that became the implementation described in this document .
Arthur ’s one - page interpreter fragment is as follows :

Small islands dwarf large ones in archaeological importance , says a University of Florida researcher , who found that people who settled the Caribbean before Christopher Columbus preferred more minute pieces of land because they relied heavily on the sea .
“ We ’ve written history based on the bigger islands , ” said Bill Keegan , a University of Florida archaeologist whose study is published online in the journal Human Ecology .
“ Yet not only are we now seeing people earlier on smaller islands , but we ’re seeing them move into territories where we did n’t expect them to at the time that they arrived . ”
Early Ceramic
Age settlements have been found in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Montserrat , for example , but are absent from all of the larger islands in the Lesser Antilles , Keegan said .
And all of the small islands along the windward east coast of St. Lucia have substantial ceramic artifacts — evidence of settlement — despite being less than one kilometer , or .62 mile , long , said Keegan , who is curator of Caribbean archaeology at the Florida Museum of Natural History on the UF campus .
It was thought that people preferred larger islands because the land mass of bigger islands could support a more diverse range of habitats and greater numbers of animal species for humans to subsist on , Keegan said .
In addition , the focus of long - term evolutionary patterns has favored large islands , he said .
But small islands had coastlines rich with fish , and the absence of dense woodlands made them more suited to farming and hunting small prey such as iguanas , tortoises and hutias , a cat - sized rodent , he said .
“ In the short term , small islands often are superior to larger islands , and for a variety of reasons , they were actually people ’s first choice , ” Keegan said .
“ They had better wind flow , fewer mosquitoes and more plentiful marine resources .
With sufficient water and a relatively small amount of land to grow certain kinds of crops , they had everything one would need . ”
Because prehistoric people were drawn to these small islands , they may tell scientists more than settlements on larger islands about early patterns of life , Keegan said .
To date , most archaeological excavations have taken place on bigger islands in such countries as Cuba , Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico , he said .

Much of Keegan ’s research focused on Grand Turk , Middle Caicos and very small cays in the Turks and Caicos Islands , along with Carriacou in the Grenadine Islands , he said .
Pottery remains he found that were analyzed at the Florida Museum of Natural History ’s ceramic technology lab shows that humans often left large islands for small ones , probably initially to take advantage of abundant marine resources along the coastline , he said .
Ceramic pottery sherds recovered from the smaller Turks and Caicos islands , for example , were actually found to have come from Haiti , he said .
“ Traveling to the Turks and Caicos gave these people an opportunity to get sources of food that were n’t locally available to them , ” he added .
In another case , pottery remains were found on an extremely tiny island in the Turks and Caicos that had little soil and was accessible only by a sand spit , Keegan said .
“ The island looks just like a rock , ” he said .
“ To think that anyone would have any reason to be out there is just beyond believability .
But the island is named Pelican Cay , so people may have gone there to capture sea birds and their eggs . ”
People were drawn by the large varieties of fish , tortoises , iguanas and sea turtles that were in much greater supply on Grand Turk than the island of Hispaniola at the time , Keegan said .
Remains from loggerhead turtles as big as 1,000 pounds were excavated from Grand Turk , although sea turtle sizes eventually declined to 60 pounds with overexploitation , he said .

“ The high rates of return from capturing these animals far outweighed the costs of getting to Grand Turk , ” he said .
“ Such human migration patterns made good economic sense . ”
It was probably easier to sail to other islands than traverse from one end of an island to the other through the overgrown vegetation of tropical woodlands , he said .
“ Most island archaeologists today , including those in the Caribbean , recognize that the sea was their ancient highway , ” he said .
And the smaller the island , the better .
“ Based on our work , it is clear that marine resources on smaller islands in the Caribbean were abundant , heavily exploited and even sought after by the native peoples , ” Keegan said .
“ You could say that ‘ small is beautiful ’ or ‘ size does n’t matter . ’ ”
Have a Facebook account ?
Laura Buffardi , doctoral student in psychology , and associate professor W. Keith Campbell from the University of Georgia says it may tell them you are a narcissist .
Narcissism is not just attention - seeking or wanting to be liked .
Clearly everyone who signs up for a social media site wants to interact with others .
It is more severe and characterized by an inability to form healthy , long - term relationships .
The tremendous growth of social networking sites ( Facebook now has 100 million users , for example ) has led psychologists to explore how personality traits are expressed online .
Buffardi and Campbell chose Facebook because it 's the most popular networking site among college students and because it has a fixed format that makes it easier for researchers to compare user pages .
Not everyone who uses Facebook is a narcissist .
" We found that people who are narcissistic use Facebook in a self - promoting way that can be identified by others , " said Buffardi .
They gave personality questionnaires to nearly 130 Facebook users , analyzed the content of the pages and had untrained strangers view the pages and rate their impression of the owner 's narcissism .
The researchers found that the number of Facebook friends and wallposts that individuals have on their profile pages correlates with narcissism .
Buffardi said this is consistent with how narcissists behave in the real - world , with numerous yet shallow relationships .
Narcissists are also more likely to choose glamorous , self - promoting pictures for their main profile photos , she said , while others are more likely to use snapshots .
Untrained observers were able to detect the narcissists also .
Observers used three characteristics – quantity of social interaction , attractiveness of the individual and the degree of self promotion in the main photo – to form an impression of the individual 's personality .
" People are n't perfect in their assessments , " Buffardi said , " but our results show they 're somewhat accurate in their judgments . "
Some researchers in the past have found that personal Web pages are more popular among narcissists , but Campbell said there 's no evidence that Facebook users are more narcissistic than others .
" Nearly all of our students use Facebook , and it seems to be a normal part of people 's social interactions , " Campbell said .
" It just turns out that narcissists are using Facebook the same way they use their other relationships – for self promotion with an emphasis on quantity of over quality . "
Still , he points out that because narcissists tend to have more contacts on Facebook , any given Facebook user is likely to have an online friend population with a higher proportion of narcissists than in the real world .
Right now it 's too early to predict if or how the norms of online self - promotion will change , Campbell said , since the study of social networking sites is still in its infancy .
" We 've undergone a social change in the last four or five years and now almost every student manages their relationships through Facebook – something that few older people do , " Campbell said .
" It 's a completely new social world that we 're just beginning to understand . "

Advertisement Downing Street and the mayor of London have condemned the use of a portrait of murderer Myra Hindley in a video shown at a London 2012 event in Beijing .
The painting was shown in promotional footage produced by Visit London , not the Olympic 2012 organisers .
A spokesman for Boris Johnson said the mayor was " deeply disturbed " the image had been shown .
A Downing Street spokesman said it was in " poor taste " .
Visit London said the image appeared fleetingly and had been shown before .
The tourism body 's video was shown at a party attended by Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Mr Johnson at the Chinese capital 's London House to promote London 's culture ahead of the 2012 Games .
The mayor is deeply concerned by the realisation that a shot of Myra Hindley was shown in a short video ... and asked that it not be shown again
Spokesman for Boris Johnson Marcus Harvey 's portrait of Hindley was one of a number of pieces of art seen in the footage filmed in a gallery .
A Downing Street spokesman said : " The use of this image is in extremely poor taste and it should not have been used to promote London . "
A spokesman for Mr Johnson said : " The mayor is deeply concerned by the realisation that a shot of Myra Hindley was shown in a short video at London House and asked that it not be shown again . "
The Liberal Democrats described the decision to include the image in the video as a " regrettable choice " .
The party 's Olympics spokesman , Tom Brake , said : " Of all the many masterpieces that could have been used this was the most regrettable and the least inspired choice . "
Moors murderer Hindley , who died in 2002 , was jailed along with her partner Ian Brady in 1966 for the murders of three children between 1963 and 1964 and confessed to two others later .
Labour peer Lord Pendry , who represented the relatives of the victims , also criticised the use of Hindley 's image .
Tom Pendry , former Labour MP for Stalybridge and Hyde in Greater Manchester , said : " It was in very poor taste and brought about by those who have no regard for people in my constituency who have suffered . "
' Extraordinary decision ' Conservative MP
Ann Widdecombe told the BBC she was shocked by the use of the image .
" I do find it utterly extraordinary that if we 're trying to promote Britain , we should do so with an image of an mass child murder .
" Somebody somewhere has taken an extraordinary decision that I do n't think brings any credit on the country at all . "
There has never been a complaint made about the video up until this point
Visit London
In a statement , Visit London said Harvey 's Hindley artwork appeared only " fleetingly " in the three - minute video of London .
It continued : " The video is not for general public use and has been used many times over the last few years to show to the tourism trade .
" There has never been a complaint made about the video up until this point .
" However , if any offence has been caused , we will withdraw it from use with immediate effect . "
The painting , made from children 's handprints , was vandalised while on display in the Royal Academy in 1997 .
The pair were convicted of the murders of Lesley Ann Downey , aged 10 , in 1964 , and Edward Evans , aged 17 , in 1965 .
Brady was also convicted of the murder of 12 - year - old John Kilbride and Hindley was found guilty of being an accessory .
In 1987 , Brady and Hindley confessed to two further murders - those of Pauline Reade , aged 16 , and 12 - year - old Keith Bennett .

What are these ?
The head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency lied to Congress about his rejection of a request from California intended curb global warming emissions , according to one United States Senator .
Senator Barbara Boxer ( D - CA ) , who has called for EPA chief Stephen Johnson to resign , made the statement at a hearing on regulation of greenhouse gases under the U.S. Clean Air Act .
“ You ’ve shown that what Mr. Johnson told us is not the truth , ” Boxer told Sen .
Sheldon Whitehouse , a Rhode Island Democrat , after lengthy questioning of the EPA ’s Robert Meyers , who helped prepare Johnson for a meeting at the White House over the California decision .
Johnson denied California ’s request for a waiver to impose tough new limits on climate - warming carbon dioxide emissions from cars and light trucks .
That decision last December effectively blocked as many as 18 other states from following suit .
“ It ’s clear that a portion of the ( EPA ) staff believed one way , but the administrator at the end of the day made his decision based on the facts and the law , ” said the EPA ’s Jonathan Shradar .
“ If Senator Boxer wants to actually legislate and change the law , I imagine that ’s what the people of California elected her to do . ”
The EPA has not issued rules so far and the timeline for public comment and rulemaking on this issue make any action during the Bush administration unlikely .

From the time she was a teenager until 2002 , Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin attended a church affiliated with the Assemblies of God , the largest Pentecostal Christian denomination in the U.S.
Pentecostalism emphasizes such practices as speaking in tongues , prophesying , divine healing and other miraculous signs of the Holy Spirit , which it believes are as valid today as they were in the early Christian church .
Prominent Democrats , including CEO of the Democratic National Convention Committee Leah Daughtry and Director of Religious Affairs for Barack Obama ’s presidential campaign Joshua Dubois , also are associated with Pentecostal Christianity .
The Pew Forum ’s U.S. Religious Landscape Survey , conducted in the summer of 2007 , makes it possible to examine the demographic , religious and political characteristics of Pentecostals in the U.S .
As the Landscape Survey explains in detail , Protestantism can be broken down into three traditions : the evangelical , mainline and historically black church traditions .
Pentecostals account for significant numbers within both evangelical and historically black Protestant churches .
Taken together , Pentecostals make up 4.4 % of the adult population . *
But they account for 8.5 % of all Protestants , including 13 % of members of evangelical churches and 14 % of members of historically black churches .
Pentecostals display very high levels of religious commitment on such questions as frequency of church attendance .
For instance , evangelical Pentecostals are more likely than evangelicals overall – and much more likely than U.S. adults overall – to report attending worship services at least once a week or praying on a daily basis .
Pentecostals within both evangelical and historically black churches also are more likely than others in their traditions to report holding a literal view of the Bible , or experiencing or witnessing divine healings .
Pentecostals are more likely than other members of evangelical and historically black churches to express conservative views on abortion and homosexuality .
But evangelical Pentecostals are more likely than other evangelicals to prefer a bigger government providing more services over a smaller government providing fewer services .
And among members of historically black churches , Pentecostals are noticeably less Democratic than others in this tradition .
Demographics
Pentecostal denominations are racially , socially and geographically diverse .
Roughly two - thirds of Pentecostals in the evangelical tradition are white ( 67 % ) , 19 % are Latino and 7 % are black .
Evangelical Pentecostalism includes significantly fewer whites and many more Latinos compared with evangelical denominations as a whole ( 81 % white and 7 % Latino ) .
Pentecostals within historically black churches also are more racially diverse compared with the historically black church tradition overall .
Roughly two - thirds of those who belong to historically black Pentecostal denominations are black ( 68 % ) , compared with 92 % of members of these churches overall .
Together , white ( 14 % ) and Latino ( 13 % ) Pentecostals account for more than one out of every four members of historically black churches .
Economically , evangelical Pentecostals tend to earn lower incomes and have less education compared with the public overall and with other evangelicals .
Nearly half of evangelical Pentecostals ( 45 % ) report annual household incomes of less than $ 30,000 , and 27 % say they have attained less than a high school education .
Among evangelicals overall , the comparable figures are 34 % and 16 % .
Members of black Pentecostal churches also tend to earn lower incomes and to have less education compared with the public overall .
But economic and educational differences between Pentecostals and other members of historically black churches tend to be smaller .
Geographically , Pentecostalism is centered in the Southern United States ; majorities of evangelical Pentecostals ( 52 % ) and members of black Pentecostal churches ( 52 % ) reside in the South , as do 50 % of evangelicals overall and 60 % of members of historically black churches overall .
Religious Beliefs and Practices
On a variety of measures , Pentecostals within evangelical and historically black churches evince very high levels of religious commitment .
Nearly seven - in - ten evangelical Pentecostals report attending religious services at least once a week , significantly higher than evangelicals overall ( 58 % ) and the public overall ( 39 % ) .
Among members of black Pentecostal churches , three - quarters say they attend church at least once a week , higher than the 59 % of all members of historically black churches who attend religious services this regularly .
Overwhelming majorities of Pentecostals within both traditions also say that religion is very important to them ( 86 % among evangelical Pentecostals , 85 % among members of black Pentecostal churches ) .
Large majorities also say they are absolutely certain that God exists ( 90 and 91 % , respectively ) , and report praying on a daily basis ( 83 % and 79 % , respectively ) .
Differences on these measures between Pentecostals and other members of the evangelical and historically black traditions tend to be relatively small .
Pentecostals within both traditions are more distinctive when it comes to views of the Bible and receiving answers to prayer , and especially when it comes to speaking in tongues and experiences with divine healings .
Overall , more than two - thirds of evangelical Pentecostals ( 68 % ) say they believe the Bible to be the literal word of God , making this group more likely than evangelicals overall ( 59 % ) to take this point of view , and more than twice as likely as the public as a whole ( 33 % ) to express this belief .
Three - quarters of members of black Pentecostal churches ( 74 % ) see the Bible as the literal word of God – even higher than the 62 % of members of historically black churches overall who interpret the Bible literally .
Nearly half of evangelicals ( 46 % ) say that they receive a direct answer to a specific prayer request at least once a month , as do 50 % of members of historically black churches , setting these two traditions apart from the public overall ( 31 % ) .
But Pentecostals are even more likely than other evangelicals to report receiving answers to their prayers ( 57 % do so at least monthly ) , while a majority of members of black Pentecostal churches also report having their prayers answered regularly ( 56 % ) .
Large numbers of Pentecostals report having experienced or witnessed a divine healing of an illness or injury ( 74 % among those in the evangelical tradition , 75 % among those in the historically black tradition ) .
Overall , members of evangelical and historically black churches are much less likely to have experienced a miraculous healing ( 50 % and 54 % , respectively ) ; the comparable figure among the public overall is lower still ( 34 % ) .
Speaking in tongues also is a relatively common practice among Pentecostals in both traditions .
Nearly four - in - ten ( 38 % ) evangelical Pentecostals say they speak or pray in tongues at least once a month .
Roughly comparable numbers of members of black Pentecostal churches also speak or pray in tongues monthly ( 35 % ) .
This is a much less common practice among other members of evangelical and historically black churches ; overall , more than three - quarters of evangelicals ( 77 % ) and nearly seven - in - ten members of historically black churches ( 69 % ) say that they never speak or pray in tongues .
Religion and Politics
Pentecostals express socially conservative views on both abortion and homosexuality .
More than seven - in - ten evangelical Pentecostals say that abortion should be illegal in all ( 35 % ) or most ( 38 % ) cases .
They are joined in this view by two - thirds of members of black Pentecostal churches ( 38 % say abortion should be illegal in all cases , 28 % say it should be illegal in most cases ) .
By comparison , evangelicals ( 61 % of whom oppose abortion ) and members of historically black churches ( 46 % oppose ) generally are somewhat less likely to oppose abortion .
Roughly seven - in - ten evangelical Pentecostals ( 71 % ) say that homosexuality is a way of life that should be discouraged by society , as do more than six - in - ten members of black Pentecostal churches ( 61 % ) .
The comparable numbers for all members of evangelical and historically black churches are 64 % and 46 % , respectively .
Pentecostals tend to be more liberal , however , when it comes to their views about government ’s role in the economy .
Half of evangelical Pentecostals ( 50 % ) , for instance , say they would prefer a bigger government that provides more services , while only 37 % express support for a smaller government providing fewer services .
This puts them at odds with evangelicals as a whole , who tend to favor smaller government over larger government ( 48 % vs. 41 % ) .
Two - thirds of members of black Pentecostal churches favor a bigger government providing more services , as do 72 % of members of historically black churches overall .
Six - in - ten evangelical Pentecostals also say government should do more to help the needy , even if it means going deeper into debt , while fewer than three - in - ten ( 29 % ) say that government cannot afford to do more to help the needy .
Among evangelicals as a whole , 57 % say that government should do more for the needy .
Support for increased aid to the poor is even higher within historically black churches ; 76 % of Pentecostals in these churches say that government should do more for the needy , as do 79 % of members of these churches overall .
Just as they are supportive of an active role for government in the economy , Pentecostals are just as supportive as other religious groups of an active role for religion in politics and public life .
A 2006 survey by the Pew Forum found , for instance , that 79 % of Pentecostals believe that religious groups should express their views on day - to - day social and political matters , and 87 % agree that it is important for political leaders to have strong religious beliefs .
The comparable figures for the general public are 61 % and 63 % , respectively .
In the realm of foreign affairs , the same 2006 survey found strong support for Israel among American Pentecostals , with six - in - ten saying they sympathized more with Israel than with the Palestinians in the Middle East conflict , nearly 20 points higher than the public overall .
Despite the similarities in their views on social issues and the role of government , Pentecostal members of evangelical and historically black churches are very different in their partisan preferences .
Evangelical Pentecostals tend to favor the Republican Party ; when surveyed in the summer of 2007 , 45 % described themselves as Republicans or said they lean toward the Republican Party , while 35 % favored the Democratic Party .
Members of black Pentecostal churches , by contrast , overwhelmingly favored the Democratic over the Republican Party ( 60 % vs. 23 % ) .
It is interesting to note , however , that members of black Pentecostal churches are noticeably less Democratic than members of historically black churches overall ( 60 % vs. 77 % ) .
While a plurality of members of black Pentecostal churches ( 41 % ) describe their political views as conservative , this group is less conservative than their Pentecostal counterparts in the evangelical tradition ( 57 % ) .
Relatively few Pentecostals in either tradition describe themselves as political liberals .
About the Survey
Unless otherwise noted , this analysis is based on results from the U.S. Religious Landscape Survey , conducted by telephone between May 8 and Aug. 13 , 2007 , among a representative sample of 35,556 adults in the continental U.S. Full methodological details are available in the full Landscape Survey report .
Full question wording and survey results are available in the survey topline .
Unless otherwise noted , the size of the groups from the Landscape Survey and corresponding margins of error ( at the 95 % confidence level ) are as follows :
* Although this analysis focuses exclusively on members of Pentecostal churches and denominations , the influence of Pentecostal beliefs and practices is actually much larger than these numbers suggest .
Many “ charismatic ” members of non-Pentecostal denominations and traditions , including Catholicism , have adopted certain ideas , beliefs and forms of worship from Pentecostalism .
The Pew Forum ’s “ Spirit and Power : A 10 - Country Survey of Pentecostals ” report includes more information about the global reach of this movement .

Fed up with Java I started to learn Scala .
It ’s a language that seems to solve almost all problems I spotted in Java .
I started with a tutorial ; it ’s definitelly not a very good - written one ( comparing to , say , Java Tutorials or Python Tutorial ) , but it ’s also the best I have found so far .
One of the Java disadvantages that Scala solves is support for functional programming .
While programming in Java I often miss functional features , especially closures and first - class function / method objects , but higher - order functions and currying can be also very useful in solving some problems .
After reading the 4th and 5th chapter of the mentioned tutorial , I learned how to use those functional features in Scala .
I have to say that Scala is not as functional as , for instance , OCaml is .
Let ’s analyze the following , simple example of OCaml code , making use of currying :
let f a b = a + b ; ; let g b = f 3 b ; ; f 3 2 ; ; // 5 g 2 ; ; // 5
The equivalent code in Scala looks as follows :
def f( a:int ) ( b:int ) : int = a + b ; val g = f 3 _ f ( 3 ) (2 ) // 5 g(2 ) // 5
Let ’s take a closer look at differences between the two examples .
In OCaml , each function is curryable by default , without any additional effort .
If a function is called with less parameters given than needed , the result always is a function .
It ’s a simple rule .
Things are different in Scala .
If function should be curryable , it has to be properly declared .
Each “ currying point ” is denoted in parenthesis : in the analyzed example this is only one such point ( after the first parameter ) .
Moreover , each parameter that could be curried has to be given in its own parenthesis .
Well , perhaps it does n’t look so bad , but let ’s suppose we have a function with N parameters ( N>0 ) .
While the OCaml code is simple :
let f a 1 a 2 ... aN = ... ; ; let g a 1 a 2 ... aK = f a 1 a 2 ... aK ; ; // K < N f 1 2 ... N ; ; g K+1 K+2 ... N ; ;
the Scala code becomes more verbose :
def f( a1:int ) ( a2:int ) ( a3:int ) ... ( aN:int ) : int = ... ; val g = f a 1 a 2 ... aK _ f ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ... ( N) g( K+1 ) ( K+2 ) ... ( N )
Of course the same function can be written in a simpler form , but with the price of being not curryable :
def f( a1:int , a2:int , ... , a N:int ) : int = ... ; f( 1,2 , ...,N )
As we can see , there is a clear distinction between curryable and not curryable functions in Scala .
The difference is in function declaration , as well as in function calls .
This difference makes use currying in Scala a slightly less convenient than in functional languages ( like OCaml ) .
One question comes to mind here : is it a serious Scala disadvantage ?
Well , everything has its price .
As far as I know Scala was meant to be a language which solves many problems of Java , and so far I think it is successful in this field .
The example with function taking N paramaters is rather an academical one ; it ’s a case I proposed to show the fact that currying in Scala is not so convenient as currying in OCaml ( and , probably , in other functional languages as well ) .
I doubt I would ever write a fully curryable function of more than 3 - 4 parameters in Scala , so the “ disadvantage ” discussed here is rather a small problem in practice …
However , there ’s alway the other side .
Scala creators seem to focus on functional programming aspects of Scala ; these features are the ones which are exposed and emphasized ( at least I have such an impression ) .
So if we take a closer look at what they have already done : a programming language with support for functional programming , with not - so - convenient currying …
It might seem a little weird .
Anyway , Scala is an interesting language .
I ’m going to keep learning it further .

During the last HackWeek , I had a chance to work on a project that we had been discussing in the Mono team : an interactive C# shell .
The idea was simple : create an interactive C# shell by altering the compiler to generate and execute code dynamically as opposed to merely generating static code .
The result is the csharp command .
The command provides an read - eval - print loop for entering C# statements and expressions :
csharp > 1 ; 1 csharp > " Hello , World " .
IndexOf ( " , " ) ; 5 csharp > Console .
WriteLine ( " Hello " ) ; Hello
Statements are executed ; Expressions are evaluated , and the result displayed .
There is support for rendering arrays , IEnumerables and dictionaries specially , consider the following C# 3 declaration :
csharp > new Hashtable () { { " / bin " , " executable files " } , { " /etc " , " configuration files " } } ;
You will get this back when rendered :
{{ " /tmp " , " Temporary files " } , { " / bin " , " executable files " }}
Statements can span multiple lines ;
In those cases the interactive shell will use a different prompt to indicate that more input is expected , for example :
csharp > 1 + > 2 ; 3 csharp >
One of the main advantages of this shell is that you can try out your LINQ expressions directly on the shell , for example , the following query works on the result from Directory .
GetFiles :
csharp > using System.IO ; csharp > var last_week = DateTime .Now - TimeSpan.FromDays ( 7 ) ; csharp > from f in Directory .
GetFiles ( " /etc " ) > let fi = new FileInfo ( f ) > where fi.LastWriteTime < last_week > select f ; { " /etc/adjtime " , " /etc/asound.state " , " /etc/ld.so.cache " , " /etc/ mtab " , " /etc/ printcap " , " /etc/resolv.conf " }
The LINQ expressions are not limited to working on IEnumerables , you can also use LINQ to XML or LINQ to any database provider supported by Mono by loading the assembly :
csharp > LoadLibrary ( " System.Xml.Linq " ) ; csharp > using System.Xml.Linq ; csharp > var xml = new XElement ( " CompilerSources " , > from f in Directory .
GetFiles ( " /cvs/mcs/mcs " ) > let fi = new FileInfo ( f ) > orderby fi. Length > select new XElement ( " file " , new XAttribute ( " name " , f ) , new XAttribute ( " size " , fi. Length ) ) ) ; csharp > xml ; < CompilerSources > < file name= " /cvs/mcs/mcs/mcs.exe.config " size = " 395 " /> < file name= " /cvs/mcs/mcs/gmcs.exe.config " size = " 464 " /> < file name= " /cvs/mcs/mcs/OPTIMIZE
" size = " 498 " /> < file name= " /cvs/mcs/mcs/lambda.todo " size = " 658 " /> < file name= " /cvs/mcs/mcs/smcs.exe.sources " size = " 726 " /> [... ]
</CompilerSources >
A differences between csharp and the C# language is that I felt that for interactive use , it would be important to change the type of a variable , so the following is allowed :
csharp > var a = 1 ; csharp > a ; 1 csharp > a. GetType ( ) ; System . Int32 csharp > var a = " Foo " ; csharp > a ; " Foo " csharp > a. GetType ( ) ; System .
String csharp >
To load code interactive I added two methods : LoadAssembly and LoadPackage .
LoadAssembly is the equivalent of passing the -r command line argument to csharp or mcs , this example shows System .
Xml .
Linq in use :
csharp > LoadAssembly ( " System.Xml.Linq " ) ; csharp > using System.Xml.Linq ; csharp > XDocument doc = new XDocument ( > new XDeclaration ( " 1.0 " , " utf - 8 " , " yes " ) , > new XComment ( " Sample RSS Feed " ) , > new XElement ( " rss " , > new XAttribute ( " version " , " 2.0 " ) , > new XElement ( " channel " , > new XElement ( " title " , " RSS Channel Title " ) , > new XElement ( " description " , " RSS Channel Description . " ) , > new XElement ( " link " , " https://tirania.org " ) , > new XElement ( " item " , > new XElement ( " title " , " First article title " ) , > new XElement ( " description " , " First Article Description " ) , > new XElement ( " pubDate " , DateTime.Now.ToUniversalTime ( ) ) , > new XElement ( " guid " , Guid. NewGuid ( ) ) ) , > new XElement ( " item " , > new XElement ( " title " , " Second article title " ) , > new XElement ( " description " , " Second Article Description " ) , > new XElement ( " pubDate " , DateTime.Now.ToUniversalTime ( ) ) , > new XElement ( " guid " , Guid. NewGuid ( ) ) ) > ) > ) > ) ;
The variable doc is then rendered :
csharp > doc ; < ?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " utf - 16 " standalone = " yes " ? >
<!-- Sample RSS Feed --> < rss version = " 2.0 " > < channel > < title > RSS
Channel Title </ title > < description > RSS
Channel Description .</ description > < link > https://tirania.org</link> < item > < title >
First article title < / title > < description > First Article Description </ description > < pubDate>9/8/2008 5:13:34 PM</pubDate > < guid>bc6825ab-f1ab-4347-ad6e-3cf076011379</guid > </item > < item > < title > Second article title </ title > < description > Second Article Description </ description > < pubDate>9/8/2008 5:13:34 PM</pubDate > < guid>a474b2bb-deba-4973-9581-762857b24b53</guid > </item > </ channel > < /rss >
LoadPackage is the equivalent of invoking the compiler with the - pkg : flag .
This is a Mono-ism that integrates Mono libraries with Unix 's pkg-config .
Packages allow definitions and multiple assemblies to be loaded in a single call , for example , this loads the Gtk# 2.0 package :
csharp > LoadPackage ( " gtk- sharp - 2.0 " ) ; csharp > using Gtk ; csharp > Application .
Init ( ) ; csharp > var b = new Button ( " Hello Interactive Shell " ) ; csharp > var w = new Window ( " So cute ! " ) ; csharp > b. Clicked += delegate { Application .
Quit ( ) ; } ; csharp > w. Add ( b ) ; csharp > w. ShowAll ( ) ; csharp > Application .
Run ( ) ;
Pleasure
This shell has been incredibly useful to debug things in the last few weeks , as it avoids the tedious typing to try out APIs and to see what some function might return .
Launch csharp and test things away .
To improve the experience of the command line editing , I wrote a managed readline replacement , it provides history , keyboard navigation and searching .
Also the System , System .
Linq , System .
Collections , and System . Collections .
Generic namespaces are imported by default .
Additionally , the csharp command will load any assemblies and C# scripts that you have in the ~/. config / csharp directory .
If you are working constantly say on LINQ , you can put there all of your using and LoadLibrary statements .
Availability
The csharp command will be available in Mono 2.2 , which is still a few months away , or it can be obtained by compiling Mono from SVN today .
Interactive Commands
Currently there are a few static methods and properties that you can invoke from the command line , like the " help " property that will display some help , and the " quit " property that terminates the shell as well as things like LoadLibrary and LoadPackage that I have described before .
A complete list is available on the CsharpRepl page .
I am interested in hearing which other features should be added to the shell .
I think we need some special commands to describe types and objects , like monop .
Additionally , currently values are displayed by using ToString ( ) , but perhaps we need a method Inspect ( object ) that would show the values of all public fields and properties , like a debugger would .
Which other commands should be added ?
While we 're waiting to hear back from Microsoft on the VGChartz forum - sourced Xbox 360 " relaunch " rumor and speculation , one allegedly involved party has given us denial .
G4 reps told us that the 5 - hour special ’ rumored to air on the cable network is " fake . "
" We currently do not have anything planned in conjunction with Microsoft for September 25 , " the rep added .
" I ca n’t speak for Microsoft but can say we do not have anything planned . "
Nothing planned , they say .
Perhaps G4 is blissfully unaware of Microsoft 's plans to hijack its broadcast , as Weird Al Yankovic was notorious for doing to MTV in the mid 1980s .
Damn you , Weird Al !
If you do this one more time even with the aid of Microsoft , there will be hell to pay , free games or not !

Australia 's plan to subject every Internet user in the country to mandatory content filtering just keeps getting stranger .
Although the current government says it simply inherited the program from its predecessor and that the filtering will be voluntary , it seems intent on continuing the rollout plans even as it has become apparent that some level of filtering will be mandatory .
Now , an Australian newspaper has uncovered documents showing that the government minister responsible for the program has ignored performance and accuracy problems with the filters , then tried to suppress criticism of the plan by private citizens .
The filtering plan as it now appears consists of two tiers .
One would apply to all Australian Internet access and would block access to content deemed illegal ( though how that term will be defined has n't yet been disclosed ) .
A second tier would be switched on by default , but users would be allowed to opt - out ; this tier would target content inappropriate for children .
Back in June , however , the government 's own Communications and Media Authority issued a report on tests on some of the equipment that might be used to implement the filters .
Although the report puts a positive spin on the results —
" Hey , the tech has gotten better since we last looked , in 2005 ! " — it 's hard to get around the fact that the filters simply are n't that great .
Five of the six filters degraded network performance by over 20 percent , and two simply hammered the network , dropping throughput by more than 75 percent .
That poor performance came without stellar filtering performance , either .
Half the devices let more than five percent of the blacklist sites through anyway , and all devices had measurable percentages of false positives .
And all of these problems came simply while trying to filter web traffic ; FTP , P2P , and other protocols would all flow through the filters unimpeded .
Senator the Honorable
Stephen Conroy
If you read our earlier coverage on this matter , you 'd see that one of the primary sources of information on the filtering program is a very unhappy ISP employee named Mark Newton , who is speaking on his own behalf , rather than that of his employer , Internode .
Now , Australian newspaper
The Age is reporting that the ministry responsible for the program has contacted a trade group that includes Internode to request that the company keep a tighter leash on Newton .
The Age has also obtained an e-mail that a staffer in the office of Stephen Conroy , the government 's Communications Minister , sent to the Internet Industry Association , of which Internode is also a member .
" In your capacity as a board member of the IIA , I would like to express my serious concern that an IIA member would be sending out this sort of message , " the e-mail said in part .
It was apparently accompanied by a phone call in which it was made clear that this message should be passed on to Internode .
Little of this makes sense , of course , if the program were only something inherited from the prior administration that the current government had no intention of implementing .

It 's lunchtime , and I 'm waiting in the cafe queue to buy a sandwich along with everyone else .
What a lot of sandwiches ...
Imagine if everyone piled their sandwiches one on top of another ...
I wonder how high the mighty tower of sandwiches might be ?
Let 's see ... 60 million people in the UK , say 1 in 8 is having a sandwich right now , each sandwich might be about 3 cm thick including filing , so that 's ... over 200 km high !
You might say I 'm thinking too much about sandwiches , but I 'm actually exercising my number sense .
Which , along with allowing me to make quick guesses about how big things are or how many there might be , also might be helping me get better at calculus and algebra .
Researchers Michèle Mazzocco , Lisa Feigenson and Justin Halberda , from John Hopkins University , have shown that being good at formal mathematics is linked to having a good innate number sense .
See , I 'm not waiting in the sandwich queue , I 'm studying !
Though people often think of mathematics as a pinnacle of intellectual achievement of humankind , research reveals that some intuition about numbers , counting and mathematical ability is basic to almost all animals .
For example , creatures that gather or hunt for food keep track of the approximate number of food items they procure in order to return to the places where they get the most sustenance .
Humans share this very basic " number sense , " allowing them , at a glance , to estimate the number of people in a subway car or bus , Halberda says .
The students were flashed a group of yellow and blue dots ,
and had to estimate which colour group was bigger .
The Johns Hopkins team wondered whether this basic , seemingly innate number sense had any bearing on the formal mathematics that people learn in school .
So the researchers asked 64 14 - year - olds to look at flashing groups of yellow and blue dots on a computer screen and estimate which dots were more numerous .
Though most of the children easily arrived at the correct answer when there were ( for example ) only 10 blue dots and 25 yellow ones , some had difficulty when the number of dots in each set was closer together .
Those results helped the researchers ascertain the accuracy of each child 's individual number sense .
( You can test your own number sense on the New York Times website . )
They then examined the teenagers ' record of performance in school math all the way back through kindergarten , and found that students who exhibited more acute number sense had performed at a higher level in mathematics than those who showed weaker number sense , even controlling for general intelligence and other factors .
" What this seems to mean is that the very basic number sense that we humans share with animals is related to the formal mathematics that we learn in school , " Halberda concludes .
" The number sense we share with the animals and the formal math we learn in school may interact and inform each other throughout our lives . "
Though the team found this strong correlation between number sense and scholastic math achievement , Halberda cautions against concluding that success or failure in mathematics is genetically determined and , therefore , immutable .
" There are many factors that might affect a person 's performance in school mathematics , " Halberda says , " What is exciting in our result is that success in formal mathematics and simple math intuitions appear to be related . "
What might be very exciting indeed is if our mathematical intuition can be trained .
Mathematical guessing questions like the sandwich example above are called Fermi problems after the Italian physicist and mathematician Enrico Fermi .
Fermi problems are already used in maths and science classrooms to practise problem solving skills , to gain an understanding of scale , and also to entertain .
But perhaps these might be more than just fun , they might also train your brain to work better next time you have to do some serious maths .

This could be because one of the following reasons :
The baobab tree represents one of the most ancient species of life on the planet .
In our paper , we investigate ancient and highly divergent proteins , called retro-elements , whose evolutionary histories hold keys to uncovering the origins of life .
Our research demonstrates that phylogenetic profiles generated using the Gestalt Domain Detection Algorithm - Basic Local Alignment Tool provide an independent method for estimating the evolutionary histories of retroelements .
Credit : Randen Patterson and Damian van Rossum , Penn State
( PhysOrg.com ) -- Scientists at Penn State have developed a new computational method that they say will help them to understand how life began on Earth .
The team 's method has the potential to trace the evolutionary histories of proteins all the way back to either cells or viruses , thus settling the debate once and for all over which of these life forms came first .
" We have just begun to tap the potential power of this method , " said Randen Patterson , a Penn State assistant professor of biology and one of the project 's leaders .
" We believe , if it is possible at all , that it is within our grasp to determine whether viruses evolved from cells or vice - versa . "
The new computational method will be described in a paper to be published in a future issue of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The journal also will post the paper on the early on - line section of its
Web site sometime during the week ending 6 September 2008 .
The team is focusing on an ancient group of proteins , called retroelements , which comprise approximately 50 percent of the human genome by weight and are a crucial component in a number of diseases , including AIDS .
" Retroelements are an ancient and highly diverse class of proteins ; therefore , they provide a rigorous benchmark for us to test our approach .
We are happy with the results we derived , even though our method is in an early stage , " said Patterson .
The team plans to make the algorithms that they used in their method available to others as open - source software that is freely available on the Web .
Scientists map out the evolutionary histories of organisms by comparing their genetic and / or protein sequences .
Those organisms that are closely related and share a recent common ancestor have greater degrees of similarity among their sequences .
In their paper , the researchers describe how they used 11 groups of the retroelement proteins -- ranging from bacteria to human HIV -- to trace the evolutionary histories of retroelements .
Their method uses a computer algorithm to generate evolutionary profiles -- also called phylogenetic profiles -- that are compared all - against - all .
For example , given four sequences , the new method compares profile A to profiles B , C , and D ; it compares profile B to profiles C and D ; and so on , for a total of six comparisons .
The method then selects the regions of the profiles that match and creates a tree - like diagram , called a phylogenetic tree , based on the retroelements ' similarities to one another .
The tree provides evolutionary distance estimates and , hence , phylogenetic relationships among retroelements .
Patterson said that the results from this study help to clarify many existing theories on retroelement evolution .
The conventional method for estimating evolutionary relationships , called multiple sequence alignment , also produces evolutionary trees , but can be insensitive to relationships among the most distantly related proteins , in large part because it makes only one simultaneous comparison across all of the genetic / protein sequences .
To obtain more detailed information about possible relationships among the sequences , a human expert who can manually search for such relationships is needed .
But Patterson said that relying on humans to do the work is not ideal .
" Although the human mind is the most powerful tool for pattern recognition , human - based measurements often are hard to reproduce , " he said .
" For example , if you do something and I do something , we 're going to do it differently .
It 's better to have a standardized method for gauging relationships among ancient proteins , and that 's exactly what we 've created . "
According to Damian van Rossum , Penn State research associate / assistant professor of biology and another leader on the project , the new method can be used in conjunction with the conventional method to get a clearer picture of the evolutionary histories of proteins .
" The more independent measures you have , the better view of the world you can get , " he said .
In addition to searching for the origins of life , the team also is using its method to simultaneously gather data on the shapes of proteins , their functions in the body , and their evolutionary histories .
In another paper , which was published in 2008 in the online journal Physics Archives , members of the team previously had demonstrated that their new method can simultaneously measure all three of these characteristics .
" Previously , people have shown that profiling methods can resolve functional and structural differences and similarities between proteins , but to date no one has shown that you can measure evolutionary distances , " said van Rossum .
" Not only can our method measure evolutionary distances , but it also can measure functional and structural characteristics at the same time . "
Patterson said that there are about 30,000 profiles in an online scientific repository that they can use to generate their phylogenetic profiles .
He expects that the team 's method will become even more powerful as additional sequences are added to this protein bank .
In fact , the method already has become more refined in the short time since the team submitted its manuscript to the journal .
" We already are producing evolutionary trees with much more detail than what we show in the paper , " he said .
" In fact , we are surprised at our progress so far in our goal of tracing these histories all the way back to the beginning of life . "

Tiring of its mission to " organize the world 's information , " Google has set itself a new objective : save the planet .
The search giant unveiled a US $ 4.4 trillion plan Wednesday to reduce the U.S. 's dependency on fossil fuels and embrace alternative energy .
The proposal would yield a net saving of $ 1 trillion by 2030 and slash U.S. carbon dioxide emissions by 48 percent , according to Google , which said it had been busy " crunching the numbers . "
The plan involves weaning the U.S. off of coal for producing its electricity and turning to wind , solar and geothermal power instead .
It would also cut oil use in cars by 40 percent and use electricity for personal transportation .
Google said its goal in announcing the plan , called Clean Energy 2030 , was to stimulate debate .
" With a new Administration and Congress -- and multiple energy - related imperatives -- this is an opportune , perhaps unprecedented , moment to move from plan to action , " the company said .
It 's the latest and perhaps most ambitious attempt by Google to shape public policy .
The company has already weighed in on issues like worker immigration , intellectual property law and net neutrality .
Energy is further from its expertise , but Google has been hiring experts to help with the task , including the lead author of the proposal , Jeffery Greenblatt , a former scientist with the Environmental Defense Fund .
CEO Eric Schmidt was to present the proposal in San Francisco on Wednesday evening .
Google also described the plan in a blog posting and in more depth on its Wikipedia - like Knol Web site .
It deals primarily with two areas -- electricity production and personal vehicles .
The basics look like this :
Reduce energy use today : Naturally for Google , it starts with computers .
Data centers and personal computers both can be operated much more efficiently , by unplugging PCs when they are not in use , for example .
Building codes can be more aggressive , and " smart meters " in homes that give real - time pricing should encourage people to use less power .
Pacific Gas & Electric is already installing such meters in northern California .
Electricity : The U.S. today produces half its electricity from coal , 20 percent each from natural gas and nuclear energy , and 1.5 percent from oil .
The plan would replace coal and oil with primarily wind , solar and geothermal energy ( using heat from inside the earth ) .
It calls for keeping electricity demand at today 's level , which would lop 30 percent off the projected demand in 2030 .
Onshore and offshore wind would account for a further 29 percent of demand , solar 12 percent and geothermal 15 percent .
Nuclear , hydro and natural gas would make up the rest .
Google acknowleged that solar energy is expensive today , but said the deserts in the southwest could be used for " concentrating solar power , " which could " bring costs down fast . "
Geothermal energy is " the sleeping giant , " according to Google .
Personal vehicles :
The U.S. consumes 21 million barrels of liquid fuels per day , with 60 percent going into cars and other " light personal vehicles . "
The plan calls for incentives to increase electric and hybrid car sales to 100,000 in 2010 ( annual U.S. car sales today are about 15 million ) , 3.7 million in 2020 and 22 million in 2030 .
It proposes boosting gas mileage for conventional vehicles to 45 miles per gallon , something experts say is plausible .
Economics : Google made several assumptions about costs and savings , including the costs of alternative energy equipment , such as the infrastructure for charging electric cars , and the savings from more efficient power sources .
It assumed that gasoline will double in price to $ 8 per gallon by 2030 , and accepted that fluctuations could add or remove billions in its calculations .
Jobs :
It predicted that millions of jobs in construction , operations and professional services would be created with the alternative energy industries , as well as more jobs in electric vehicle manufacture .
Google is n't the first to devise such a plan .
It acknowleged that Former Vice President Al Gore has come up with a more ambitious proposal .
It remains to be seen now if Google 's effort will stir the U.S. into action .
Today is Blog Action Day and the topic is poverty .
There isnt much talk about poverty and economic crisis in the LGBT community .
There exists many people who suffer with terrible financial problems and many youth who are left homeless .
Discimination and lack of opportunity because of sexual orientation and gender identity is unacceptable .
So in honor of the day and the topic at hand I 'd like to highlight an organization doing great work in this arena .
Queers for Economic Justice .
Find out how you can get involved in promoting economic justice .
Tips for helping out underprivileged queers :
1. Donate to Queers for Economic Justice or a local LGBT homeless shelter .
2. " Clothes are for closets " - donate some old clothes , or sheets , to an LGBT homeless center .
3 . Donate some canned goods and products to a Queer community center that serves underprivileged LGBT people .
Support any and all efforts to make a change for LGBT people who are economically challenged .
Blog Action Day 2008 Poverty from Blog Action Day on Vimeo .
I encourage my fellow bloggers to join in Blog Action 's Day effort to discuss the global poverty crisis .
Of course I could n't help but put a queer spin on it ;)

We were headed to the villages of Dah and Beema ( pronounced Beama ) in Leh district and Garkun and Darchik in Kargil district , and the intention was to spend a week studying the secret lives of a tribe of pure Aryans .
Some of the more inaccessible pockets could be reached only through trekking .
We rose early and started our jeep safari at 7 a.m .
The 130 - km drive passed through the villages of Khalatse ( pronounced Khalsi ) , Dumkhar , Skurbuchan , Achinathang and Hanuthang .
We crossed several high peaks before reaching Beema ( 14,350 ft ) .
Every photograph clicked en route resembled a picture postcard and the seven - hour drive over rugged terrain was made listening to some soothing music .
The first glimpse of the Indus , from miles away , was a near - spiritual experience .
A speck of light blue amidst sand dunes , rock and stone .
A stream nestling in Nature 's palm .
We finally arrived at Beema and took an ice - cold bath in the turbulent waters of this river steeped in history .
The tranquility experienced while meditating on its banks , on a bed of round pebbles , is indescribable .
A group of women checked one 's bags on alighting from the vehicle .
There is a self - imposed prohibition in these Brok - Pa ( Ladakhi word for Aryan or white skin ) villages .
The sarpanch had asked the womenfolk to ensure that no alcohol entered the village .
After a thorough frisking of the luggage , the three women , resembling Greek goddesses , allowed entry into the PWD guesthouse .
The chowkidar , named Sonam Thondup , was an Aryan who knew a smattering of Hindi .
Through a combination of sign and body language , one tried to develop a rapport with the hostile chowkidar , who made it plain that my visit to Dah was not welcome .
On seeing the inner line permit and letter from the collector , Satish Nehru , Thondup reluctantly gave me the guesthouse keys .
There were no other occupants .
The guesthouse is on the banks of the Indus and the view from the room was picturesque .
The gurgling of the river was soothing music to the ears .
The next morning , one had to report at the sarpanch 's house for a purification ritual .
This called for a 10 - km trek over mountain streams , rock and stone .
Thondup sent along two tough looking escorts .
It took us almost two hours to reach Laisthiang the sarpanch 's village .
The landscape began to change and a canopy of green could be seen .
Walnut and apricot trees stretched across the horizon and the fields were full of grain , ready to be harvested .
The staple food is barley , grown in terraced fields and irrigated by the mountain streams that rush to meet the Indus flowing below .
The ascent was rather steep and the altitude nearly 17,000 ft .
One kept replenishing body fluids by drinking the natural mineral water of the mountain streams .
There are about 1,000 descendants of the Aryan tribes and they live scattered around Gilgit , Hunza , Kargil and Leh .
Being nature worshippers , they celebrate the Bononah ( nature ) festival and are strict vegans , which means they are not only strictly vegetarian but also do n't consume milk or milk products .
This minuscule community bars both men and women from marrying non-Aryans , and polygamy and polyandry is common .
Couples who do not conceive are free to choose other partners to give them a better chance of producing an offspring .
Nearly 80 per cent of them marry in their own villages , while 20 per cent marry from neighbouring villages .
Two 500 - year - old Juniper trees ( Cilgi Deuha ) crown the village of Dah , which is the venue of the tri-annual Bononah festival ( held on a full moon night during October ) .
The tribes symbolically draw energy from the ancient Juniper trees by hugging them after a ceremonial dance .
They also worship the swastika symbol ( clockwise ) and the ` Om ' ( symbolising energy ) .
The trek to Dah from Beema took us three hours .
It was a dangerous trek , as we crossed several craggy peaks , holding on to tiny crevices to haul ourselves up .
We could hear gunfire across the Indo - PoK border .
My inner line permit was checked at the army post .
One wrong step on this arduous trek could have proved fatal .
We reached the ancient juniper trees by noon and hugged the trees to soak in their energy .
After spending several hours in this picturesque place , it was time to visit some of the elderly Aryans .
We shared a meal that consisted of jo ( barley ) roti baked in an earthern oven , lettuce leaves , roasted potato , spring onion , boiled cauliflower and wild mint .
Women cooked in an open hearth , burning fallen twig collected from the trees in their courtyard .
There is a strict taboo against tree felling .
The simple meal was fresh and extremely tasty .
The following week the trek continued into the villages of Baldes , Samit , Garkun , Darchik and Hanu .
The few thousand Brok - pa Aryans have over 5,000 years lived in these hostile terrain at 15,000 ft altitude , subsisting on a vegan diet .
Music and dance are a way of life for them .
Both men and women wear colourful costume , decorating their hair with flowers , and are full of joi de vivre .
They live in harmony with nature , and are cheerful and stress - free despite living in small rock shelters .
They trek long distances .
Almond , apricot and walnut form part of the diet along with endless cups of black tea fortified with barley flour .
The weather in September is pleasantly cold , though temperatures in January can plummet to - 20 degrees Celsius .
There are an unusually large number of Aryans above 70 years .
Many are active even at 90 .
Their striking features include blue eyes , aristocratic noses , fair complexion and flawless skin .
They appear ethnically distinct from Ladakhis or Kashmiris .
They do not marry outsiders and restrict their contact with the outside world , seemingly happy in their isolated existence .
Married women braid their hair , which gives them a resemblance to Greeks .
One of the women photographed at Dah could have easily been mistaken for a German tourist .
She was blonde and had high cheekbones , rotund face and unmistakable German features .
The Aryan tribes believe in prophecies and the recording of dreams .
Most of the elderly Aryans meet in the morning at the Juniper grove and discuss their dreams .
One of their folk songs sung at the Bononah festival is translated as follows :
In the beginning there was water all over the earth and some of it froze .
Dust settled on this patch of ice .
Later , a small patch of grass appeared on the frozen patch and , soon , a juniper tree sprouted from the earth .
The whole universe was created by Chag ( fire ) , Ser ( water ) and Yun ( earth ) .

There was a time when many people would have bet on Gateway to become the largest direct retailer of computers in America , instead of Dell .
They even opened up a few boutique retail outlets along the way .
They had a funky vibe going with their black and white cow - spotted boxes , and the future seemed very bright indeed .
That future never materialized , and Gateway was acquired by Acer last year for a comparatively modest $ 710 million .
Now Gateway has completely ended the business model that put them on the map : Direct Sales .
“ We believe that our retail and e-tail partners offer consumers the best , easiest and most effective way to purchase Gateway products , ” said Mark Hill , Acer Group U.S. General Manager .
“ Customers can rest assured that they will continue to get the award - winning products and outstanding technical support they ’ve come to expect from Gateway for the last 23 years .
Moving forward , we are pleased to be able to offer Gateway products through thousands of retail storefronts and major online and telephone - based channel partners both in the United States and abroad .
” Acer does n't do direct sales , and brought their market vision to their new acquisition .
Gateway computers are still available at a large assortment of retail resellers like Best Buy , Circuit City , Wal - Mart , and Costco , and interestingly , you can still buy them from online retailers like Newegg and Tiger Direct .
Just not from Gateway .
It 's a testament to how far Gateway 's direct purchase model had slipped that the Press Release announcing it is dated July 25th , and we can't find one reference to it in a news article .
If a cow falls in the online forest , but there 's no one around to hear , does it still make a sound ?

This might be a shocker out there to many , but we do actually , you know , not leak things from time to time .
What ’s important here , is that we ’ve been rockin’ a BlackBerry Bold for around a month now , and we ’ve got a great handle on the unit .
From hardware to software , this is going to be the most complete BlackBerry Bold review , period .
If you ’re really ready , hit the jump .
You might need a couple cigarettes and a cup of coffee — it ’s long !
RIM ’s BlackBerry Bold 9000 , huh ?
We knew it was coming since October of last year ever since we broke the news , and since then , this has been the BlackBerry communities iPhone .
Sorry for an iPhone reference so early on in the review , but it ’s true .
This is the device every single BlackBerry user has been waiting for .
Finally a BlackBerry that “ has it all . ” 3G , GPS , Wi-Fi , QWERTY keyboard , camera , great screen , clean styling , and more .
Since this has been our day to day BlackBerry exclusively , we ’ve been through a lot of ups and downs with the Bold .
Here ’s a recap on our first day with the Bold , followed by our full review …
Remember all that talk about overheating and battery drain ?
It definitely was n’t crap — we ’ll tell you that !
Even still , the device gets a little warm , but nothing to get too concerned about .
RIM has made strides in regards to updated software builds for the Bold .
Let ’s bring you back to when we first got the device , ok ?
We thanked our very friendly FedEx Sameday delivery man ( or delivery person since there ’s this cute female that sometimes brings us goodies … anyway ) and proceeded immediately to remove the SIM card and microSD card from our BGR edition BlackBerry Curve 8310 .
After that , we took a bat to it , Office Space style .
Once the battery was installed in the Bold , we patiently waited for the unit to turn on .
One minute went by .
Then two .
Then three .
What in the heck ?
Is n’t this supposed to be at least double the speed of the older models ?
When the unit finally powered up , we were greeted by the usual Setup Wizard .
After canceling out of that ( I can remove languages manually , athankyou ) it was time to explore the device .
At first glance , the first thing you ’ll see is obviously the gorgeous screen on the 9000 .
We can safely say that this is the best screen we ’ve ever seen on a mobile device .
Hands down .
So , yeah , after messing around with a couple applications and exploring , it was time to turn on wireless and connect to AT&T ’s mothership .
5 bars of service showed up with the GSM indicator .
Then EDGE .
Oh boy , we ’re so close !
Finally 3G appeared .
We were in business !
But not so fast .
No sooner than the 3G indicator showed up , the device for some reason restarted .
All ‘ Berry lovers will know this all too well .
Red LED , black screen .
After waiting for another three or four minutes for the device to power up again , the same thing happened !
Everything was ok until we tried to turn wireless on .
Oh bother .
What now ?
The Bold did this in an endless loop for a good two hours .
The battery was only at 40 % so we figured we ’d let it keep passing out until it was fully charged .
Bad plan because that did n’t help .
After managing to sneak in right at start - up and turn off wireless mode , the device was stable again .
Great .
What good is a BlackBerry as a PDA ?
Do n’t answer that .
By now we practically had a gun pointed to our heads .
We messed with a Bold before , but we ca n’t even use our first unit ?
After a quick call to one of our BlackBerry ninjas , we were promptly sent an updated software build .
Now it was time to update the OS .
We opened up Desktop Manager 4.5 and proceeded to update the device .
This part totally blew us away !
Gone are the days of a 30 - 45 minute backup and update .
It probably took no more than 6 minutes to backup the device , erase the applications , load the system software and what not .
The only part that took a little bit was waiting for the device to initialize after everything was done .
As soon as we booted up with the new OS , we were good !
The Bold connected to the network just fine and we did our enterprise activation .
First thing we did ?
Check out BlackBerry Messenger !
God knows if there ’s one thing making us keep out BlackBerrys …
The new client is n’t drastically different but has some semi-cool additions .
For instance , the layout is the same but graphics for online , away , and unavailable have changed .
You can set an alert so you are notified when a buddy comes back online , and you can broadcast a message to everyone you have an open conversation with .
Digging a little deeper into Messenger , we found that you can enable an option to change your status when you are on the phone , and even change your status automatically to reflect whatever MP3 you are playing on the device .
Totally iChatish , but not that bad .
After Messenger , it was on to the browser .
At first , nothing looked different at all .
That was until we brought up BGR on it .
The BlackBerry web browser has indeed been redone to act more like a web browser and not a piece of garbage 1990 ’s WAP browser .
Pages render awfully quick over 3G , and even on EDGE .
They are formatted 90 % of the time correctly and images look sharp and crisp .
You ’ve now got new controls with the trackball .
Instead of just a mouse cursor like before , the default setting is a zoom key .
Just scroll over what you ’d like to zoom into , press the trackball and zoom .
This can also be achieved by pressing “ i ” and “ o ” for zoom in and zoom out respectively on the keyboard .
We fired off some emails on the keyboard , made some phone calls , and started to sit back , relax , and have fun with our new BlackBerry Bold .
Battery life improved 10 fold when the new OS was installed , and the overheating we noticed quickly dissipated .
It still gets a little warm when you ’re freakin ’ it , but oh well .
Here ’s the full review on the device and the most recent software build .
We ’re not basing the review on the extremely crappy builds before this .
Design :
Some might say it looks awfully like an iPhone .
But not Mr. Lazaridis .
According to him , every BlackBerry device is “ three years in the making . ”
They could n’t possibly have made the device around the iPhone since they started it three years ago , right ?
In all seriousness , it has a couple similar design features like a chrome border around the unit and black front , but it really stops there .
We do n’t think they said to themselves , “ let ’s copy the iPhone . ”
The chrome you see on the Bold is nothing more than cheap plastic that scratches very easily , though .
Screen :
We said this before , but this really is the screen to beat .
It might be a little too “ contrasty ” at times , if you know what we mean , but overall , it steals the show .
It is the most vibrant , color - rich , sharp screen we ’ve ever seen on a mobile device .
It can be extremely bright if that ’s how you like it , or subtlety lower .
The auto - dim features on BlackBerry devices let the screen adjust to your surrounding so it does n’t disrupt you .
One major problem with the screen , though ?
It , like the chrome border around the device , is made of cheap plastic and scratches incredibly easily .
We kept the Bold in either pants pockets with nothing else in there or a BlackBerry leather holster .
After only a day or so , scratches started to appear out of no where on the gorgeous display .
They better ship this thing with free scratch protectors !
Keyboard :
If you know us , you know we do n’t let keyboards off easy !
And if there is anyone who understands keyboards , it ’s usually RIM .
Think of the 9000 ’s keyboard as a cross between the 8800 and the Pearl .
The keys are pretty large in size , a little squishy , but still firm .
They are not plasticky - feeling like the Curves .
After only around 10 - 15 minutes we found ourselves typing almost as fast as were on our 8310 .
The layout of the keyboard is exactly the same as you ’d find on other BlackBerrys .
Even all symbols and other markings are in the same spot .
This makes it easy to jump right into the device .
The send , BlackBerry , back , and end keys are abnormally large , though .
It ’s not bad .
It ’s just awkward for some reason .
They all work fine , but we ca n’t figure why RIM decided to make them so big .
Possibly a design situation where they had an overall device size ready , could n’t make it any smaller , and ended up filling the dead space with larger keys .
Keyboard back - lighting is great , too .
Just the accents , letters , and symbols light up white .
Not the entire key like the Curve .
Connectivity :
Every BlackBerry users ’ dream lies in the Bold.
3G data , GPS , and Wi-Fi make this a hit .
Unless you ’re really trying not to be found , there ’s a good chance the Bold is going to help you stay connected no matter where you are .
A - GPS in the Bold works wonderfully , always getting a fast and accurate lock on location whenever requested .
The included BlackBerry Maps works well , but since TeleNav hooked us up , we ’re using that for the moment without a hitch .
Er , AT&T Navigator .
If you ’ve ever used a BlackBerry with Wi -Fi , it ’s pretty much the same concept .
Select a Wi -Fi network and off you go .
This is especially useful when you ’re in a low or no coverage area yet have access to a Wi -Fi hotspot .
We found no issues while using the 3G cell network and Wi-Fi at the same time , though it was actually using Wi -Fi for data .
You ca n’t use Wi-Fi if you turn the cell radio off , but you can use Wi -Fi when you have no cell signal .
Food for thought ?
We ’ve noticed that sometimes while using Wi -Fi , the device will lose connection to the BlackBerrt network on the cell network .
Possibly a battery - saving enhancement ?
OS :
We said this from the start … the 4.6 OS is 99 % the same as your current BlackBerry .
Assuming you ’re not using an 8700 or something like that .
Little things have been tweaked to make using the device a little easier and quicker , but for the most part , you ’re basically looking at a skin on the top level .
That ’s not to say there have n’t been some changes beneath the surface , but for the average BlackBerry user , you ’re not going to really notice anything besides the semi-pretty UI enhancements .
It ’s now July 15th , and even running the latest 4.6.0.93 build , we ’re still pulling the battery out a good 10 times a day .
Why ?
Between the constant java errors , and the BlackBerry completely losing service and informing us it ’s “ Searching for Network … ” .
That ’s why .
What ’s sad is that even with this bad - ass 624MHz CPU , we still get slow downs and we still get freezes .
Do n’t get it mixed up , it is 100 % faster than any other BlackBerry .
We just ca n’t understand why this thing is n’t really optimized like it should be .
Ah !
Because the OS is from 1999 .
That ’s it .
Applications :
Again , mostly top level stuff , but there have been a couple added applications .
These include WordToGo , PowerPointToGo , WordMole , and a couple other games that have been around for a while .
There ’s something beneath the surface called BlackBerry Game Service , and what this does is allows true multi-player games over either the cell network or Wi-Fi .
We beat the crap out of our friend in WordMole who was half way across the country .
Sorry , buddy .
One of our favorite applications , if not the favorite , is BlackBerry Messenger like we said before .
In the updated BlackBerry Messenger , you ’ll find added functionality such as being able to broadcast a message to all open conversations , letting your status change automatically when you ’re on the phone , and also changing your status to reflect whatever song is playing on the media player .
HTML email is obviously a go assuming you ’re on a BIS 2.5 carrier or your company has hacked HTML email back into BES 4.1.5 .
Totally awesome feature , though ?
If you ’re downloading an attachment and highlight that email , it will show you a status bar indicated how far along the download is .
Welcome to 2008 , RIM .
Now could you please stop being pansies and show us a progress bar for outgoing messages please ?
You know , some of us actually like to send videos and pictures and what not .
Oh yeah !
Video over BlackBerry Messenger too , while we ’re at it .
Kthnkz .
Browser :
The web browser was actually one of the last things ready on the Bold as we were told .
The earlier versions had a browser nowhere near what we ’ve been using , and we have to say … it ’s pretty darn good !
It ’s no iPhone , but it definitely does the job .
Any BlackBerrry user whether corporate or consumer will definitely appreciate the new browser ’s improved rendering , speed , and controls .
It actually shows web pages how they are supposed to be shown , but the navigation can get a little tiring .
Instead of the regular mouse pointer that we ’ve been used to lately , the pointer is now by default a zoom in pointer .
A couple clicks of the trackball , and you ’ve zoomed into the web page .
Sometimes the page will reformat to the screen , sometimes it wo n’t .
Forget about Flash or anything sexy , but the browser has definitely been upgraded pretty nicely .
Battery life :
Another concern possible Bold buyers have is battery life .
There ’s been so much information floating around , what ’s the real story ?
Up until around 3 - 4 weeks ago , every build of the OS we tried had major battery problems .
Random restarts , device totally dead within a couple hours , etc .
With the latest software version , we can safely say we ’re getting as good or better battery life than we did with our Curve .
Yes .
Is n’t that awesome ?
Thanks to 1500 mAh battery and a crap load of engineering on RIM ’s part , they ’ve finally got it nailed down .
To give y’all a little usage detail : 300-500 emails a day , one hour of web surfing over 3G , Wi-Fi usually turned on , Bluetooth turned off , JiveTalk connected , and around one hour of phone calling ( we do n’t really use the BlackBerry as a phone ) lasted us from 9 AM until 4:30 AM .
Sound quality :
RIM is trying to step it up in the sound department , and it shows .
Instead of a covered speaker like the Curve , there are speaker grills on both sides of the device , and also on the top as well .
Sound quality from playing back music sounds decent .
Not great , not terrible .
It could be a little louder , but even as it stands , music is still distorting on the loudest volume setting .
Also , the speakerphone volume could definitely be louder as we found it lower than our Curve .
Call quality :
We ’ve found call quality to be fantastic .
It ’s definitely the most phone - like BlackBerry to date .
People we spoke to sounded crystal clear and they said we sounded great .
The earpiece volume was also sufficiently loud , so there should be no problems there .
That 3G network is also probably helping a lot with call quality as well , no ?
Build quality :
This one is a tricky one .
We have a production hardware unit , and the trackball can get a little shady .
Then again , do n’t all BlackBerrys ?
There are no creaks with the device , and it seems sturdy as heck .
The screen could possible be an issue as it looks like it ’s a cheap plastic , and the “ chrome ” border around the body is also a lower - grade plastic .
At least it seems that way to us .
Expect for the screen to be scratched to all hell , and for nicks , scrapes , and dents to show up on the device body .
On our unit , the back battery cover is a little loose towards where the release button is and kind of moves in and out when you press it .
We ’re not sure if that will be resolved when the device is released , but it can definitely get kind of annoying .
We would n’t call the Bold fragile but we do n’t think its built as well as the Curve .
So what do you guys think ?
Happy with our review ?
Want a Bold even more now … even less ?
Sound off .
And look for some more posts on the Bold coming shortly .
On September 15 , SurveyUSA released this poll of likely voters in Virginia :
McCain ( R ) 46 %
Obama ( D ) 50 %
Margin of Error : +/-3.7 %
Tables like this appear on TV and in newspapers all the time .
But they ’re never accompanied by any explanation of how to interpret the margin of error .
Commentators usually interpret it in one of two ways :
Obama is ahead by more than the margin of error , hence his lead is statistically significant .
That “+/- ” means either number could be off by that amount .
If you added 3.7 % to McCain ’s 46 % and subtracted 3.7 % from Obama ’s 50 % , McCain would actually be ahead .
So Obama ’s lead is not statistically significant ; it is less than twice the margin of error .
In either case , they are wrong .
So what ’s the right way to interpret the margin of error ?
A lead is significant if it is 1.6 times the margin of error or greater .
That ’s 5.9 % for our poll , so Obama ’s lead is not significant .
This is a strange , non-intuitive rule , which explains why commentators do n’t use it .
The derivation is more revealing than the rule itself .
Obama ’s lead is “ statistically significant ” if there ’s a 95 % probability that Obama is actually ahead .
The “ 95 % ” is completely arbitrary , but the probability
P( Obama ahead )
is quite interesting .
I wish news organizations would report this probability instead of the margin of error .
It ’s easier to interpret the statement “ There ’s an 86.5 % chance that Obama is ahead ” than a statement about margins of error .
These margins of error , incidentally , are just one over the square root of the sample size .
For the poll described above , there were 732 voters surveyed .
The square root of 732 is 27 and one over that is .03696 or 3.7 % .
The reported margin of error is not a standard deviation .
The probability that Obama is ahead can be determined using Bayes ' Rule , which quantifies the effect of evidence on our belief in a hypothesis .
It relates a Hypothesis ( H ) and an Observation ( O ) :
H = Obama is ahead of McCain .
O = In a poll of 732 likely voters , 50 % preferred Obama and 46 % preferred McCain .
Here it is :
Bayes ’ Rule : P( H|O ) = P( O|H ) / P( O ) * P( H )
This rule is important enough that each of these quantities has a name :
P( H ) is the prior probability , our belief that the hypothesis is true before seeing additional evidence .
is the prior probability , our belief that the hypothesis is true before seeing additional evidence .
P( O|H ) is the likelihood function , the probability of seeing the evidence if the hypothesis were true .
is the likelihood function , the probability of seeing the evidence if the hypothesis were true .
P( O ) is the marginal probablity , the probablity of seeing the evidence at all .
It ’s often thought of as a normalizing term .
is the marginal probablity , the probablity of seeing the evidence at all .
It ’s often thought of as a normalizing term .
P( H|O ) is the posterior probability .
It ’s what we ’re really after , the likelihood of the hypothesis in light of new evidence .
Let ’s start with the likelihood function , P( O|H ) .
What are the odds of seeing this survey is a certain portion p of voters prefer Obama ?
It follows from the binomial formula :
pO = portion of voters preferring Obama
pM = portion of voters preferring McCain
a = pO * N ( number of voters who prefer Obama )
b = pM * N ( number of voters who prefer McCain )
N = a + b ( total decided voters )
P( O|H ) = B( a , b ) = N! / ( a! b! ) * pO^a ( 1 - pO ) ^b
This is a binomial distribution over pO .
Notice that we ’re only considering the two - way vote here , the 96 % of the electorate that prefers either McCain or Obama .
To aid in the application of Bayes ’ Rule , statisticians have developed the notion of a conjugate prior .
The conjugate prior for the binomial distribution is the beta distribution .
This means that , if our likelihood function is a binomial distribution , we can choose a beta distribution for our prior probability and get another beta distribution for the posterior probability .
In this case , it ’s simplest to assume a uniform distribution for Obama ’s portion of the vote .
In other words , it ’s equally probable that he ’ll get 1 % of the vote as it is that he ’ll get 50 % or 99 % of it .
Mathematically , if pO is the portion of voters who prefer Obama , then
pO ~ U( 0 , 1 ) = B ( 1 , 1 )
Bayes ’ rule then gives the following distribution for pO after observing the poll :
pO’ ~ B( a + 1 , b + 1 ) = B ( pO * N + 1 , pM * N + 1 )
This is concentrated in a small region ( note the x-axis ) around 50 / ( 50 + 46 ) = 52.1 % , Obama ’s fraction of the two - way vote .
The probability that Obama is ahead is the portion of mass to the right of pO ’ = 50 % :
This fraction is calculated numerically using an integral .
It ’s an important enough quantity to have a name , but not important enough to have a short , catchy name .
It ’s the regularized incomplete beta function ,
P( Obama ahead ) = I 0.5 ( b , a ) = I 0.5 ( 732 * 0.46 , 732 * 0.50 )
It can be calculated using a program like Mathematica or Octave , or by using an online calculator .
Another way of formulating this is to ask , “ what is the fraction Δ by which a candidate must lead in a poll to have a 95 % chance of really being ahead ? ”
For a small sample , Δ will be large .
For a large sample it will be small .
In a survey of N voters , a candidate with a lead of Δ can claim his chance of leading is :
P( leading ) = I 0.5 ( N * ( 0.5 - Δ ) , N * ( 0.5+ Δ ) )
By inverting the regularized incomplete beta function , one can calculate what lead is necessary for 95 % confidence .
But that ’s hard .
Here ’s a table to make things simpler :
N MoE Δ Δ / MoE 100 10.0 % 16.36 % 1.6362 200 7.07 % 11.60 % 1.6402 500 4.47 % 7.35 % 1.6431 1000 3.16 % 5.20 % 1.6438 1500 2.58 % 4.25 % 1.6443 2000 2.24 % 3.68 % 1.6444 2500 2.00 % 3.29 % 1.6445 3000 1.83 % 3.00 % 1.6445
The ratio Δ / MoE ; quickly approaches a constant , somewhere around 1.644 .
Hence the rule I mentioned at the beginning of the post .
If a candidate is ahead by more than about 1.6 times the sampling error , that corresponds to 95 % confidence .
If the lead is equal to the sampling error , this corresponds to about 85 % confidence .
A lead of half the sampling error corresponds to about 70 % confidence .

( Newser ) – With Wall Street unraveling , Roger Cohen writes in the New York Times , we should remember who taught America all about incautious betting : President Bush , “ the first person to reprice risk on the basis it no longer existed . ”
The Iraq war was a gamble with US lives and money , even as he allowed the markets to “ turn capitalism into a pyramid scheme for trading worthless paper . ”
Enough gambling for America , says Cohen .
If John McCain is elected , actuarially speaking , there is a 1 in 6 or 7 chance of Sarah Palin becoming president .
That 's quite a roll of the dice .
" The lesson of the last 8 years is this : when power is a passport to gamble , people can end up seriously broke or seriously dead . "

June 10 , 2005 -- --
Last summer , a 17 - year old Alabama boy died at a poultry plant when he fell onto a conveyor belt that carries live chickens to be processed .
Two months later , another teen died when he was pinned in a front - loader tractor on a construction site .
The two are among the 60 to 70 teens who die every year due to a workplace injury , according to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health .
Every 30 seconds , a young worker gets injured on the job and about 230,000 teens get hurt every year .
So , before you encourage your teenager to learn the finer pleasures of a 9 - to - 5 job , make sure they 're not clocking in for trouble .
The National Consumers League cautions the 4 million young workers headed into summer jobs that not all jobs are safe jobs .
Five Worst Jobs
1. Agriculture : Fieldwork and Processing
Agriculture is the most dangerous industry for young workers , accounting for 42 percent of all work - related fatalities between 1992 and 2000 .
Sure , a lot of the accidents happen to youths who live and work on family farms , but a number of injuries occur to hired farmworkers .
2. Construction and Work in Heights
Roofing , sheet metal work , electrical work and pouring concrete pose great threats , regardless of your age , but according to NIOSH , 15 - to 17 - year - olds working in construction had greater than seven times the risk for fatal injury compared to work in other industries .
3. Outside Helper : Landscaping , Groundskeeping and Lawn Service
Lawn mowing and clipping at least keep you on the ground , but electrocution is common and so are injuries using chain saws and tractors .
4. Driver / Operator : Forklifts , Tractors
Tractor overturns were the primary cause of tractor - related fatalities among youth workers .
Minors may operate tractors at age 14 if they have completed an approved tractor or machinery certification program .
5. Traveling Youth Crews
Door - to - door sales pose a number of risks .
Not only does the job require driving around , supervision can be spotty and teens may be more vulnerable to assaults and abductions by customers and strangers .
Another downside to the job is promises of tips or outings as a replacement to a paycheck .
STATE OF THE SOUL AFTER DEATH ACCORDING TO THE TEACHINGS OF SAINT JOHN DAMASCENE by Hieromonk Dionysios

The Orthodox view of the state of the soul after death is presented in the teachings and writings of Saint John of Damascus .
The Orthodox world has debated the state of the soul after death ( active versus soul slumber ) and the tollhouses ( real or imaginary ) .
It is thus my intent to draw mainly from the writings and hymnology of Saint John of Damascus to show what the Orthodox view actually holds and the reality of the toll houses .
I will also discuss the resurrection of the dead , a resurrection of soul AND body when the resurrected enter the joy of their Lord or suffer eternal torment .
In the Octoechos attributed to Saint John of Damascus , we find a clear reference to the tollhouses .
The eigth canticle from the canon at Matins reads , " O Virgin , in the hour of death rescue me from the hands of the demons , and the judgment , and the accusations , and the frightful testing , and the bitter tollhouses and the fierce prince , and the eternal condemnation , O Theotokos . "
By this hymn , we see clearly Saint John of Damascus ’ belief in a judgment at death .
This judgment involves some type of meeting with demonic spirits ( rescue from the hands of demons , the fierce prince ) and the testing of souls .
It is the testing of souls itself , which occurs at the various tollhouses .
The tollhouses are the places of judgment of the soul after death .
The questions then become : what judgments actually occur , who is the judge , and who does the accusing .
In another hymn attributed to Saint John of Damascus we read , " When my soul shall be released from the bond with the flesh , intercede for me , O Sovereign Lady .. that I may pass unhindered through the princes of darkness in the air . "
Last among these canticles of Damascene is " Grant me to pass through the noetic satraps and the tormenting aerial legions without sorrow at the time of my departure , that I may cry joyfully to Thee , O Theotokos , who heard the cry , ‘ Hail ’ : Rejoice , O unshamed hope of all . "
Bishop Ignatios Brianchaninov states that the teaching of the tollhouses is an accepted teaching throughout the Divine Services of the Orthodox Church .
It certainly is made clear in numerous hymns attributed to Damascus .
Father Seraphim
Rose states the teaching of the tollhouses is given to us that we might learn to struggle against the demons of the air in this life and in our meeting with them at death obtain victory .
The Orthodox teaching taught and held by Saint John of Damascus according to Father Seraphim is that the tollhouses are indeed real , not imaginairy places .
These tollhouses are a series of judgments and the angels are the judges .
They also stand to defend the soul against the false accusations of the demonic spirits .
In reality , however , it is the persons themselves who determine their own fate , for the soul will cling to that which fits it nature , be it the nature of the demons or the heavenly nature of the angels .
The accusers are the demons who stop us at various tollhouses and continue to tempt us and show forth how by our actions we lived as one of them and not as a true servant of God .
The first two days after death , the soul spends on earth , visiting places with which it was familiar .
At the third day , it begins its ascent through these aerial tollhouses , being tested by the various legions of demonic spirits .
This is what Saint John of Damascus refers to when he speaks of the ‘ princes of the air ’ and the ‘ frightful testing ’ .
Until the ninth day , the soul is given a glimpse of the beauty of Paradise prepared for those who loved and served the Lord .
At the ninth day , the Orthodox Church holds a special commemoration for the soul , as it is from this time forth until the fortieth day that the soul sees the torments of Hell , this is the ‘ eternal condemnation ’ to which Saint John of Damascus refers .
At the fortieth day , the judgment is complete , the soul has either a foretaste of Heaven ( its fulfilment in the Second Coming of Christ ) or a foretaste of Hell .
Saint John goes further in his explanation of the mystery of death :
Truly most frightening is the mystery of death , how the soul is violently separated from the body , and by divine decree , the most natural bond of their cohesion is severed .
Wherefore , we implore
Thee , O Giver of Life who loves mankind , to grant rest to the soul to the newly departed one in the dwelling of the righteous .
Vespers of Friday of the Plagal Tone ( Tone 1 ) , not written by Saint John of Damascus but closely related to the theme of his hymnology , states , " O Christ , spare me , thy servant , when my soul is separated from the body at the command given by Thee , Who didst unite dust and spirit by divine beckoning , spare me from the assault and ill treatment of invisible enemies that lie in wait to wrench me away mercilesly . "
From this , the time of our death rests in the will of God .
At the separation of the soul from the body , we see the demonic spirits mentioned again , the invisible enemies who wait to take our souls to their abode .
Can the soul after leaving earth and passing through the judgment experience any change in its state ?
Indeed , according to Saint John of Damscus , until the time of the Second Coming and the general judgment of Christ the state of the soul can be changed for the better .
He states :
Do not reject bringing oil for the sacred lamp at the tomb and lighting candles there when entreating Christ God , for these are acceptable to God and bring great return .
For the oil and wax are sacrifices of a burnt offering , the bloodless sacrifice ( Eucharist ) is an expiation , and benevolence extended to the poor are an addition to every good return .
2 Maccabees 12:44 attests to the offering of prayer for the sake of souls , for its benefit even after death .
" For if he had hoped that they who were slain should have risen again , it had been superfluous and vain to pray for the dead "
The Gospel of Matthew also attests to this : " Jesus answered and said unto them , Ye do err , not knowing the Scripture , nor the power of God … God is not the God of the dead , but the living . "
The implication here is that the dead are truly alive .
I will deal with this further in my discussion of ‘ soul slumber . ’
The soul thus can change its state as it awaits the General Judgment .
At the General Judgment all things are final , all things are sealed , and the state of the soul at this time determines the state of the resurrected person for eternity .
The resurrection , the uniting of the soul and body once again , occurs at the Second Coming of Christ and the General Judgment as Damascus states :
We also believe in the resurrection of the dead .
For in truth it will happen , there will be a resurrection of the dead .
But when we say resurrection , we mean a resurrection of bodies .
For resurrection is a second standing of that which has fallen .
And souls are immortal , hence , how can they rise again ?
For if death is defined as a separation of soul from body , resurrection is surely the rejoining of soul and body and the second standing of the dissolved and fallen creature .
It is , then , the very body that is corrupted and dissolved that will resurrect incorruptible .
For
He who formed it in the beginning from the dust of the earth is not incapable of raising it up again after it has again been dissolved and returned to the earth from which , by decision of the Creator it was taken .
Therefore , there will be , indeed , there will be a resurrection .
For God is just , and He is the rewarder of those who await Him patiently .
Now , if the soul had engaged in the contests for virtue itself , then it would be crowned alone .
And if it indulged in the pleasures , then it alone would be justly punished .
But since the soul pursued neither vice nor virtue without the body , it will be just for them both together to receive that which is their due .
Moreover , the divine Scriptures also witness that there will be a resurrection of bodies .
Therefore we shall rise again , with our souls once more united to our bodies , which will have become incorrupt and put off corruption .
And we shall stand before the fearful judgment seat of Christ .
It is necessary now having examined what occurs to the soul to define the nature of the soul according to Saint John of Damascus .
The soul is not contained ; it is immaterial yet intimately connected to the body .
Every man is a combination of soul and body …
The soul is a living substance , simple and without body , invisible to the bodily eyes by vir of its peculiar nature , immortal , rational , spiritual , without form , using the bodily organ , in which it occassions for growth , sensibility , and productiveness .
The mind is not something apart from the soul , but its purest part , since what the eyes are to the body , such is the mind to the soul .
The soul is independent , with a will and energy of its own , and changeable , capable of altering itself , since it is a created thing .
Thus , the soul is connected to the mind .
Within the body , and as Damascus states , the soul changes form , as a result of its being a created thing , and having free will .
The soul is a reflection of the nature of God , and while immortal , is still a created thing , subject to change , and connected intimately with the body .
Bodily place is the limit of that which contains , by which that which is contained is contained : for example , the air contains but the body is contained .
But it is not the whole of the containing air which is the place of the contained body , but the limit of the containing air , where it comes into contact with the contained body …
But there is also mental place where mind is active , and mental and incorporeal nature exists ; where mind dwells and energizes and is contained not in a bodily but in a mental fashion …
But the ( soul ) is circumscribed alike in time and in place and in apprehension .
There are some Orthodox who have argued that the soul does not pass through the tollhouses , but rather is in a state of slumber .
This term ‘ slumber ’ means that the soul is inactive , and as Father Michael Azkoul , one of the proponents of the soul slumber theory states , " ( the soul ) is in a condition of inactivity , a sort of inactivity in which it does not function , hear , or see . "
Father Seraphim argues against this notion , comparing it to the common misconceptions of the Adventists and Jehovah ’s Witnesses .
He states rather that the souk is quite alive and aware .
To give evidence to this argument he qoutes from Saint Dorotheos , " ( the soul ) remembers everything at its exit from this body and more clearly and distinctly once freed from the earthliness of the body . "
He cites Saint John Cassian , " ( the soul ) becomes yet more alive ( after death ) . "
We must ask if the idea of soul slumber is true , then what is the purpose of prayer for the dead if they are in a state in which their souls are inactive and cannot change state .
The reasoning of Father Michael Azkoul and those ahderents to his position has no solid patristic basis nor is it sensible in light of the Church ’s prayer for the dead .
Also we must realize that even Christ Himself descended to Hades , and that his soul was certainly not inactive after his death that was life - restoring .
In the Divine Liturgy , the priest prays , " In the tomb with the body , in Hades with the soul , on the throne with the Father and the Spirit , was thou , O Christ infinitely filling everything . "
This prayer in itself disproves any notion of soul slumber .
Lastly as recorded in Saint Archbishop John Maximovitch ’s writing on the Life After Death , he argues as well that the soul does remain conscious .
He also quotes from Saint John Cassian who sets forth clearly the active state of the soul : " Souls after the separation from this body are not idle , do not remain without consciousness ; this is proved by the Gospel of the rich man and Lazarus …
The souls of the dead not only do not lose their consciousness , they do not even lose their dispositions . "
A final argument among the Orthodox is whether or not the tollhouses are real or imaginary Father Azkoul rejected the notion of the reality of the toll houses , stating not only that they are not present in the Church ;s tradition ( this has been addressed in the above arguments ) but stating as wel that such an idea must be rejected because it makes the demons as the determiners of one ’s salvation , and through ‘ excess merits ’ of saints , the ‘ toll ’ is paid .
He thus rejects the tollhouses believing it to parallel the Latin idea of Purgatory .
Father Seraphim
Rose refuted this idea of comparing the tollhouse to purgatory as farfetched in that the toll houses are part of the Orthodox ascetic teaching and have to do solely with the testing of man for his sins committed by him .
There is no idea whatsoever he states of there being a satisifaction to God , ‘ excess merits ’ , and the purpose is certainly not ‘ torture ’ as Father Michael Azkoul suggested .
Within the Church ’s tradition in regards to the reality of the toll houses exist not only the previous mentioned hymnology and quotations from the Fathers , but also detailed descriptions of the dying experiences and the passages through the tollhouses by such holy ones as Saint Theodora .
Saint Theodora gives a detailed account of the reality of the toll houses and her passage through them before her soul returned to her body .
Saint Makarios of Egypt gives a clear expression of the reality of these tollhouses :
When the soul of a man departs out of the body , a great mystery is there accomplished .
If it is under the guilt of sins there come bands of devils , and angels of the left hand , and powers of darkness that overtake the soul , and hold it fast on their side .
No one ought to be surprised at this .
If , while alive in this world , the man was subject and compliant to them , and made himself their bondsman , how much more , when he departs out of this world , is he kept down and held fast by them . "
He continues in Homily 43 : " Like tax collectors sitting in the narrow ways , and laying hold upon the paserby , and extorting from them , so do the devils spy upon souls , and lay hold of them : and when they pass out of the body , if they are not perfectly cleansed , they do not suffer them to mount up to the mansions of Heaven and to meet their Lord , and they are driven down by the devils of the air .
We can find numerous references to the reality of the tollhouses within the writings of the Philokalia .
One example is from Saint Hesychios in which he states :
If the soul has Christ with it , it will not be disgraced by its enemies even at death , when it rises to heaven ’s entrance ; but then , as now , it will boldly confront them … the hour of death will come , and we will not escape it .
May the prince of the world and of the air find our misdeeds few and petty when he comes , so he will not have good grounds for convicting us .
This quotation from the Philokalia this shows what occurs at death , and that there is indeed a confrontation ( the toll houses ) with demonic spirits .
Saint John of Karpathos states :
When the soul leaves the body , the enemy advances to attack it , fiercely reviling it and accusing it of its sins in a harsh and terrifying manner .
But if a soul enjoys the love of God and has faith in Him , evne though in the past it has often been wounded by sin , it is not frightened by the enemy ’s attacks and threats .
Strengthened by the Lord , winged by joy , filled with courage by holy angels that guide it , encircled and protected by the light of faith , it answers the malicious devil with great boldness .
When the soul says all this fearlessly , the devil turns his back … "
The tollhouses and the judgment of the soul is and was nothing imaginary to the Fathers such as Saint Hesychios and John of Karpathos who described these things , but rather as a true spiritual reality .
In conclusion , the toll houses are indeed real and a part of the entire teaching of the Orthodox Church in regards to the state of the soul after death .
Saint John of Damascus as well as other Church Fathers and the hymnology of the Church all attest to the judgment after death , the frightful testing , and our warring with the spirits in the air .
The toll houses are not imaginary , and the soul is not in a state of slumber but active , hence the reason for the Church ’s prayers for the dead , as the state of the soul can continually be effected upon until the final judgment .

Palin revises judges , newspaper answers
Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin clarified two of her more memorable gaffes this week involving Supreme Court cases and her reading habits .
In an interview with CBS ’s Katie Couric earlier this week , Palin was unable to list a decision other than Roe v.
Wade that she disagrees with , but in an interview with Fox News on Friday , Palin listed the recent Kennedy v. Louisiana death penalty case as well as the court ’s 2005 controversial eminent domain decision in Kelo v. City of New London .

Asked by Fox ’s Carl Cameron to identify a case running counter to her judicial philosophy , Palin said , “ a recent one , Kennedy v. Louisiana , where the Supreme Court will tell a state that they can't impose the death penalty — even [ in the case of ] a heinous crime of repeat child rapist , that a state , its rights were taken away by the Supreme Court , and we would not be able to decide for ourselves whether the death penalty in a case like that could be implemented or not . ”
On the Kelo case , Palin said , “ private property rights are so precious in this nation , and for the Supreme Court to have sided with government instead of the people , the property owners on that , that was frustrating . ”
The Alaska governor also made mention of a court decision this past summer scaling back the punitive damages owed to victims of the Exxon - Valdez oil spill .
Palin also had an answer ready when Cameron asked what newspapers she reads .
“ I read the same things that other people across the country read , including The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal and The Economist and some of these publications that we 've recently even been interviewed through up there in Alaska , ” Palin said .
When Palin was posed the same question earlier this week by Couric , the Alaska governor fumbled the response , telling Couric , “ Um , all of them , any of them that have been in front of me over all these years , ” adding , ” I have a vast variety of sources where we get our news . ”
Reflecting on the Couric interview , Palin said she was “ annoyed ” by her treatment , adding the CBS anchor did n’t ask questions that reflect “ what a vice presidential candidate stands for . ”
“ The Sarah Palin in those interviews is a little bit annoyed because it 's like , man , no matter what you say you 're going to get clobbered , ” the Alaska governor said .
“ If you choose to answer a question you are going to get clobbered on the answer .
If you choose to try and pivot and go on to another subject that you believe that Americans want to hear about you get clobbered for that too . ”
Palin added that during the CBS interviews , “ I did feel that there were a lot of things that she was missing in terms of an opportunity to ask what a vice presidential candidate stands for — what the values are represented in our ticket . ”
“ I guess I have to apologize about being a little annoyed , but that is also an indication of being outside that Washington elite , outside of the media elite also and just wanted to talk to Americans without the filter and let them know what we stand for . ”
Marilyn Monroe Sex Tape
A long - buried FBI - classified sex tape of , which appears to have been shot in the 1950s , has been sold to a wealthy New York businessman for $ 1.5 million .
The 15 minute footage shows Monroe on her knees performing oral sex on an unidentified man .
When the tape , shot on 16 mm film , came to light in the 1960s , J. Edgar Hoover unsuccessfully tried to prove the man in the video was either John F. Kennedy or Robert F. Kennedy .
The man 's face is just out of camera range , and he never moves into the shot , which may indicate he knew the camera was there .
According to declassified FBI documents , Joe DiMaggio once offered $ 25,000 for the film .
Keya Morgan , a well - known memorabilia collector who discovered the film while doing research for a documentary on Monroe and brokered it 's purchase , says " You see instantly that it 's Marilyn Monroe - she has the famous mole . "
The FBI confiscated the original footage - but not before an informant made a copy of it , which is what was just sold by his son , Morgan said .
" She 's smiling , she 's very charming , she 's very radiant , but she 's known for being radiant , " he said .
" She moves away , and then it stops . "
Monroe never looks directly into the camera , however , it would be extremely difficult for her not to have known she was being filmed .
Filming was a much more complex and noisy operation in the 1950s .
If you were looking forward to seeing a Marilyn Monroe sex tape , do n't hold your breath .
The New York businessman who purchased the film wants to keep this part of Monroe 's past buried .
" He said he 's just going to lock it up , " Morgan said .
" He said , ' I 'm not going to make a Paris Hilton out of her .
I 'm not going to sell it , out of respect . ' "

The ruins of what is thought to be a huge ancient temple have been discovered by archaeologists diving beneath Lake Titicaca in the Andes between Bolivia and Peru .
An international team of scientists announced the finding this week after making more than 200 dives in Titicaca , which , at 3,800 m above sea level , is the world 's highest navigable lake .
" We 've found what appears to have been a 200 - metre - long , 50 - metre - wide holy temple , a terrace for crops , a pre-Incan road and an 800 - metre- long containing wall , " said Lorenzo Epis , the Italian leading the Atahuallpa 2000 expedition .
Ceramic artefacts were also found on the lake 's floor .
Titicaca has long been the subject of legends about a lost underwater city , but there has been little research because of the logistical difficulties of diving at altitude .
While a submerged city has not been found , Mr Epis said the ruins appeared to be 1,000 to 1,500 years old .
It thus predates the Incas and could point to the Tihuanaco people , who lived on Titicaca 's shores before becoming part of the Incan empire .
" This means our civilisations have left more footprints than we had thought , " said Antonio Eguino , Bolivia 's vice - minister of culture .
The ruins were found in an area of the lake between the town of Copacabana and the popular tourist destinations of the Island of the Sun and Island of the Moon .
The divers followed a submerged road until they arrived at the discoveries , at a depth of about 20 metres .
In addition to the practical difficulties , the research project had to contend with a worried public , who had not been informed of the project .
Diving was delayed for four days because of the distrust of the local population on the Island of the Sun , who believe the lake is sacred .
Akakor Geographical Exploring , an Italian cultural association that organised the expedition , first made a trip to Titicaca in 1998 to look at underwater caves and to research diving techniques at high altitude .
Marco Antonio Simi , who was on that expedition , said that the groundwork on pressure levels allowed the group to return this year ; most diving technology is based on ocean - bound dives , where pressure levels are very different .
Mr Simi said this was the first time top - level divers and professional archaeologists had investigated Titicaca together , adding that it was rare for specialists of both disciplines to work side by side .
The team was looking for an underwater temple .
" What they found was the beginning of what they were looking for , " he said .
" We usually pay the first 50 guys in cash , " director Jim Powers told XBIZ .
" So there 's $ 3,750 in individual envelopes of $ 75 .
We had everybody on the set , watching the girl , posing for the box cover , when all of a sudden Johnny [ production manager Johnny Thrust ] comes in , saying , ' I 've been robbed . '
" Apparently a man came in there , pulled the gun .
Johnny thought he was kidding , but the guy put the gun in his face and said ' Give me the money .
In the drawer .
Now . '
He knew exactly where it was . "
Powers thinks one of the bukkake participants was involved in the robbery .
" It was an inside job , because he came at the perfect time , " Powers said .
" One of the guys in the bukkake was texting him , saying ' OK , come now . '
It was n't some guy off the street ripping the place off .
It was well - planned .
They knew exactly when everybody was in the studio .
" It was one of the bukkake guys that was involved .
Not the one who did the robbery , he got one of his criminal friends to do it . "
The bukkake went off as planned , and the participants will get paid by the production company later .
The suspect was described by Thrust as a light skinned male in his late twenties , mixed race , with short brown hair and a mustache , approximately six feet tall , wearing a Los Angeles Dodgers satin jacket over a bulletproof vest .
Powers is offering a $ 1,000 reward for any information leading to the arrest of the suspect .
Information can be emailed to Powers at jp@mrfilth.com .

Problem Not Found in Previous Public ' Logic & Accuracy ' Testing ...
John Gideon Byon
10/14/2008 , 3:22 pm PT
Guest Blogged by John Gideon of VotersUnite.org
From the Charleston Daily Mail ...
On the eve of early voting , problems with the general election ballots are causing Kanawha County [ West Virginia ] officials to conduct an emergency test of its voting machines .
On Monday , the Secretary of State 's office notified the County Clerk 's office of a problem in the programming cards used in the [ ES&S ] M100 machines .
...
" If a person votes a straight party ticket , then deviates from the party in the Supreme Court section , the machine still counts the vote as a full straight ticket , Carper said .
...
The county had a mandatory public test of the machines last week .
This last sentence is important .
The county , and apparently other counties around the state , had already done their Logic and Accuracy testing and they had failed to find this problem .
Thus the L&A testing was not thorough enough to find problems in the ballot programming done by ES&S .
Of course , there is another question and that is who did the L&A testing ?
The county ?
Or ES&S ?
And , as we 've implored recently , do not use the straight - party ticket option when voting !
Machines have failed across the country , in state after state , to count such votes accurately !
This is an exercise in facts and context , which I found quite interesting .
In the debate about rapes by Muslims in Norway , you will often f...
There 's been a lot of sudden online interest in Jill Biden - the wife of U.S. Senator and newly - named Democratic Vice Presidential nominee Joe Biden - in the 24 hours since he was named to the ticket led by Sen. Barack Obama .
Anne Romney can expect the same about this time next week .
Just our opinion .
Now , here 's a little background on Jill Biden ...
Born in 1951 , she 's a lot smarter than we are - she has four different college degrees in education .
Not surprisingly , she 's a college English professor !
Jill Biden is the president of the Biden Breast Health Initiative , a non-profit that provides educational breast health awareness programs in Delaware .
She and Joe married in 1977 and have a daughter , Ashley .
He has two sons from his first marriage , which ended with the tragic death of his first wife .
She already has one big fan .
When Barack Obama told wife Michelle Obama he 'd decided on a vice presidential candidate , she gave him snaps – literally .
" I said , ' That 's the right choice . '
I was like , ' Good ! ' " she told People as she snapped her fingers in approval after her husband 's announcement .
That morning Michelle Obama , 44 , showed the same enthusiasm as she called Jill Biden to welcome her to the campaign trail .
" I see a historic moment , " Jill said .
" I have goosebumps when I think of what these two can do for the country . "

The article by reporter Seymour Hersh , from the magazine ’s July 7 and 14 issue , centers on a highly classified Presidential Finding signed by Bush which by U.S. law must be made known to Democratic and Republican House and Senate leaders and ranking members of the intelligence committees .
“ The Finding was focused on undermining Iran ’s nuclear ambitions and trying to undermine the government through regime change , ” the article cited a person familiar with its contents as saying , and involved “ working with opposition groups and passing money . ”
Hersh has written previously about possible administration plans to go to war to stop Tehran from obtaining nuclear weapons , including an April 2006 article in the New Yorker that suggested regime change in Iran , whether by diplomatic or military means , was Bush ’s ultimate goal .
Funding for the covert escalation , for which Bush requested up to $ 400 million , was approved by congressional leaders , according to the article , citing current and former military , intelligence and congressional sources .
Clandestine operations against Iran are not new .
U.S. Special Operations
Forces have been conducting crossborder operations from southern Iraq since last year , the article said .
These have included seizing members of Al Quds , the commando arm of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard , and taking them to Iraq for interrogation , and the pursuit of “ high - value targets ” in Bush ’s war on terrorism , who may be captured or killed , according to the article .
The U.S. ambassador in Iraq , Ryan Crocker , told CNN ’s “ Late Edition ” he had not read the article , but denied the allegations of cross - border operations .
“ I ’ll tell you flatly that U.S. forces are not operating across the Iraqi border into Iran , in the south or anywhere else , ” he said in an interview from Baghdad on Sunday .
The scale and the scope of the operations in Iran , which include the Central Intelligence Agency , have now been significantly expanded , the New Yorker article said , citing current and former officials .
Many of these activities are not specified in the new finding , and some congressional leaders have had serious questions about their nature , it said .
Among groups inside Iran benefiting from U.S. support is the Jundallah , also known as the Iranian People ’s Resistance Movement , according to former CIA officer Robert Baer .
Council on Foreign Relations analyst Vali Nasr described it to Hersh as a vicious organization suspected of links to al Qaeda .
The article said U.S. support for the dissident groups could prompt a violent crackdown by Iran , which could give the Bush administration a reason to intervene .
None of the Democratic leaders in Congress would comment on the finding , the article said .
The White House , which has repeatedly denied preparing for military action against Iran , and the CIA also declined comment .
The United States is leading international efforts to rein in Iran ’s suspected effort to develop nuclear weapons , although Washington concedes Iran has the right to develop nuclear power for civilian uses .

There 's a common law that most bicyclists know in Los Angeles : sidewalk riding is legal as long as you do not have " a willful or wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property . "
LAMC 56.15 also " disallows the riding of bicycles on Ocean Front Walk in Venice . "
Reading that , you would think that you can ride your bike on all the other sidewalks in Los Angeles .
Wrong .
There are a few spots in the city where another more unknown law is in effect .
LAMC 85.07 , which is unlisted on the city 's " Bicycle and the Law " page , regulates rollerskating , skateboarding and bicycling :
SEC . 85.07 .
REGULATION OF ROLLER -SKATING , SKATEBOARDING AND BICYCLING .
( Added by Ord. No. 166,526 , Eff. 1/27/91 . ) ( a) The Department of Transportation is hereby authorized to install any traffic control devices it determines necessary to regulate roller - skating , skateboarding and bicycling on sidewalks and roadways in order to improve vehicular or pedestrian movement , reduce congestion or diminish accident potential .
Such determinations shall be made only on the basis of traffic engineering principles and traffic investigations .
When such determinations have been made , the Department is authorized to install signs giving notice as to the nature of the regulation as well as signs that provide such safety warnings as it determines will assist those engaged in the regulated activities .
( b)
No person shall roller - skate , skateboard , or operate a bicycle in violation of the limitations set forth on regulatory signs posted pursuant to this section .
It began in San Pedro in 1988 with a motion by Councilwoman Flores .
" While great majority of these skateboard riders & cyclists are courteous & considerate of pedestrians ' rights , a significant number exhibit a callous disregard for safety of those pedestrians , " the motion explained .
And so it was passed and three other areas were able to take advantage of the law .
Last week , Chris Lattner — who manages the Clang , LLVM , and GCC groups at Apple — announced that work was well underway to bring ‘ blocks ’ to the GCC and Clang compilers .
‘ So what ? ’ , I hear you ask , ‘ My kid has been using blocks since he was 9 months old . ’
Fair point , but maybe not these blocks .
A Demonstration of ‘ Blocks ’
Blocks , or closures as they are often called , have existed in other languages for quite some time .
Ruby , for instance , is famous for them .
They also exist in Python , which I ’ll use here to demonstrate the principle .
Take this Python code
def EvalFuncOnGrid( f , forceConst ) : for i in range ( 5 ) : x = i*0.1 print x , f( forceConst , x ) def QuadraticFunc(forceConst , x ) : return 0.5 * forceConst * x * x def Caller ( ) : forceConst = 3.445 EvalFuncOnGrid( QuadraticFunc , forceConst ) Caller ( )
This simple program begins with a call to the Caller function .
The Caller function calls to the EvalFuncOnGrid function to evaluate the function passed , in this case QuadraticFunc , which represents a simple quadratic function .
The result is the value of the quadratic function on a grid of points .
0.0 0.0 0.1 0.017225 0.2 0.0689 0.3 0.155025 0.4 0.2756
Unquestionably exciting stuff , but what I want to draw attention to is the extra data that was passed along with the function itself .
The QuadraticFunc function takes two arguments : the coordinate ( x ) , and a force constant .
This force constant needs to be passed along with function , because the function itself has no way to store it .
This may not seem like a big deal , but suppose now we want to reuse EvalFuncOnGrid to print values of a different type of function , one that does not have a force constant , and instead takes a wave number parameter .
Hopefully you can see that passing ‘ state ’ for the function , in the form of data and parameters , is limiting the flexibility of our code .
One viable solution would be to make QuadraticFunc a class , but that is a bit heavy - handed .
Besides , this solution would work for our own functions , but not for built - in functions , or functions from libraries .
We need some way to pass state to EvalFuncOnGrid , so that it can use that state when evaluating the function .
This is exactly what ‘ blocks ’ allow us to do .
Here is the Python code rewritten to use a block :
def EvalFuncOnGrid(f ) : for i in range ( 5 ) : x = i*0.1 print x , f(x ) def Caller ( ) : const = 3.445 def QuadraticFunc(x ) : return 0.5 * const * x * x EvalFuncOnGrid( QuadraticFunc ) Caller ( )
If you run it , you will find this code produces the same output as before .
So what ’s changed ?
You ’ll note that the force constant has been removed from all argument lists , and no reference is made to it at all in EvalFuncOnGrid .
This was a key objective : to have EvalFuncOnGrid be completely general , and work with any function .
But the force constant must still be there , otherwise how does the quadratic function get evaluated ?
You will have noticed that the QuadraticFunc function has been moved into the Caller function .
The effect of this is that QuadraticFunc gets a copy of the stack of Caller , that is , it ‘ inherits ’ any variables and constants that are set in Caller .
Because const is set , QuadraticFunc copies its value to its own stack , and can access it later in EvalFuncOnGrid .
This is the essence of blocks : it is similar to passing a function argument , with the difference that the block has a copy of the stack from the scope where it was defined .
Blocks in Objective - C
Chris Lattner ’s announcement details how blocks will be used in C and Objective - C , and — in essence — it is similar to the Python example above .
Here is that example rewritten in the new C syntax :
void EvalFuncOnGrid( float ( ^block ) ( float ) ) { int i ; for ( i = 0 ; i < 5 ; ++i ) { float x = i * 0.1 ; printf ( " %f %f " , x , block ( x ) ) ; } } void Caller ( void ) { float forceConst = 3.445 ; EvalFuncOnGrid( ^( float x ) { return 0.5 * forceConst * x * x ; } ) ; } void main ( void ) { Caller ( ) ; }
( I ’m not sure if this is 100 % correct , because I have n’t tried to compile it yet , but it should at least give you the idea . )
The block syntax in C is very similar to the standard syntax for function pointers , but you use a caret ( ^ ) in place of the standard asterisk pointer ( * ) .
The block itself looks like a function definition , but is anonymous , and is embedded directly in the argument list .
( Note that we named our ‘ block ’ in Python , but Python does also support anonymous functions . )
Inside - Out Programming
Another way to think about closures / blocks is that they allow you to rewrite the inside of functions , such as EvalFuncOnGrid in the example .
I like to think of this as ‘ inside - out programming ’ : Traditionally , you call functions from outside , and pass them what they need to get the job done .
With blocks , you get to pass in the guts of a function , effectively rewriting it on the fly .
Why Blocks ?
Why is all of this important , and why now ?
Well , as you are undoubtedly aware , there has been a vicious war raging the last few years , and it is only going to get worse before it gets better .
That ’s right — it ’s the War on Multicore .
Our chips no longer get faster , they just get more abundant , like the broomsticks in Disney ’s Fantasia .
Chipmakers just take existing designs , and chop them in half , and then in half again , and software developers are expected to do something useful with that extra ‘ power ’ .
It turns out that blocks could be a very useful weapon in the War on Multicore , because they allow you to create units of work , which each have their own copy of the stack , and do n’t step on each others toes as a result .
What ’s more , you can pass these units around like they are values , when in actual fact they contain a whole stack of values ( pun intended ) , and executable code to perform some operation .
Attack the tactic ?
Bad strategy , John .
September 29 , 2008 by lestro

I think I just got to the heart of the problem in the George W. Bush Administration , as well as the would - be sequel of the McCampaign .
It is a delicate , but incredible important distinction between strategies and tactics .
Friday in the debate , during a discussion about the 2003 troop surge in Iraq , Barack Obama said :
They have done a brilliant job , and General Petraeus has done a brilliant job .
But understand , that was a tactic designed to contain the damage of the previous four years of mismanagement of this war .
And so John likes — John , you like to pretend like the war started in 2007 .
You talk about the surge .
The war started in 2003 , and at the time when the war started , you said it was going to be quick and easy .
You said we knew where the weapons of mass destruction were .
You were wrong .
You said that we were going to be greeted as liberators .
You were wrong .
You said that there was no history of violence between Shiite and Sunni .
And you were wrong .
John McCain , following this eloquent and succinct dressing down of his judgment , put on his most condescending face , flicked his tongue a few times and did exactly what the Karl Rove playbook says to do .
He belittled his opponent , plugged the message and changed the subject :
MCCAIN : I ’m afraid Senator Obama does n’t understand the difference between a tactic and a strategy .
But the important — I ’d like to tell you , two Fourths of July ago I was in Baghdad .
General Petraeus invited Senator Lindsey Graham and me to attend a ceremony where 688 brave young Americans , whose enlistment had expired , were reenlisting to stay and fight for Iraqi freedom and American freedom .
I was honored to be there .
I was honored to speak to those troops .
And you know , afterwards , we spent a lot of time with them .
And you know what they said to us ?
They said , let us win .
They said , let us win .
We do n’t want our kids coming back here .
And this strategy , and this general , they are winning .
Senator Obama refuses to acknowledge that we are winning in Iraq .
With McCain ’s storied military career , his dressing down his younger opponent on the difference between a strategy and a tactic carries some weight .
Unfortunately , as Joe Biden pointed out in the immediate spin ( which was not countered by the other veep candidate , by the way .
hmmm… ) , McCain was wrong and Obama was right .
A strategy is a big picture goal while a tactic is what you use to help achieve those .
In the case of the surge , the strategy was “ Clear , hold and build ” – the tactic used to try and accomplish it was a temporary increase in troop levels .
In a broader sense , the strategy was to use the military to tamp down violence and create breathing room for the diplomatic operations to take hold and allow us to get out .
The tactic that was used to allow the military to tamp down the violence was “ the surge ” .
Or , in this case , the strategy was to avoid having to answer to that litany of bad judgments that Obama just handed down .
The tactic was to condescend and change the topic .
Again , it ’s fine difference , but an important one .
James Fallows at the Atlantic applied the idea to the whole debate :
Everything John McCain did on stage last night was consistent with trying to score tactical points in those 90 minutes .
He belittled Obama with the repeated “ he does n’t understand ”s ; he was explicitly insulting to him in saying at the end “ I honestly do n’t believe that Senator Obama has the knowledge or experience ” for the job ( a line Joe Biden dare not use so bluntly on Sarah Palin ) ; and implicitly he was shockingly rude and dismissive in refusing ever to look Obama in the eye .
Points scored — in the short term , to the cheers of those already on his side .
But overall , it explains why the whole McCampaign seems to lurch and stilt and jump from place to place and crazy scheme to crazy scheme .
They are mistaking tactics for strategy , sacrificing the long term for the quick ratings boost .
Sarah Palin gave a quick boost in the short term , but will fuck him in the long run .
His big “ suspending the campaign ” hokum seemed like a quick pick - me - up , but will fuck him in the long run .
The Bush Administration has governed in the same way , sacrificing the long term for the short term .
Not only is this economic crisis the result of the exact same selling - out - of - the - future - to - make - a - quick - buck - now philosophy , the Bush Administration ’s response – ohshitohshitohshit - quickthrowmoneyatit - fuckitletpaulsonhavetotalcontrol - justdosomething – is the same basic misunderstanding .
That ’s not an economic strategy , that ’s a tactic that can be used as part of an economic strategy ( all be it a bad one ) , which in this case continues to be “ The Rich Get Richer . ”
Everything they ’ve done since the beginning has been the same sell - out - the - future bullshit .
The change we need is someone who understands the difference .
From ABC ’s Jake Tapper :
The woman seeking to be to a heartbeat away from the presidency without ever holding a press conference remains on the same relatively unaccountable path .
McCain - Palin campaign officials apparently feel the American people should trust her with the button and the world ’s financial markets without ever taking questions from reporters .
Back in the days of Constitutional and limited government , people went about their business making household decisions , economic transactions , and personal plans without any help from Big Government bureaucrats .
Nowadays it 's common to read about “ government plans ” to help us along .
It sounds ominously like those old Soviet “ Five Year Plans ” .
Do we really need this so - called help ?
One example is from the Wall Street Journal this week .
T. Boone Pickens replies to an op -ed by columnist Holman Jenkins regarding an “ energy plan . ” ( Letters , Tuesday , September 2 , 2008 . )
Mr. Pickens cites statistics about alternative energy sources which I trust are all true .
His implication , however , is that Big Government needs to fund His Plan for harnessing “ domestic resources to reduce the impact of foreign oil . . . “
American consumers can decide for themselves which , if any , alternatives are worth funding .
We do this all the time through capitalism .
If an idea seems good or profitable , capitalists appears with the money to make it happen .
We 've done this with the automotive industry , with organic foods , with computers , and much more .
Surely we can decide if Mr. Pickens ' energy ideas are worthy of funding without government intervention .
“ Energy independence ” is another hot - word thrown around a lot .
What 's so great about any product “ independence ” ?
There are lots of commodities that America no longer makes , yet we have no problem obtaining them when government butts out of our business .
We no longer make shoes in this country to any significant extent , yet I do n't read about “ shoe independence ” or see lots of folks walking barefoot involuntarily .
Computer electronics are largely made in other countries , yet we do n't seem to lack gadgets galore .
The free market allows consumers to obtain mostly whatever they need directly and more cheaply than Big Government can .
Is it perfect ?
Of course not .
Big Government is even less perfect .
Oil is just another commodity that would be cheaper and more accessible if Big Government got out of our way .
Think about it : products that are scarce to Americans typically have some kind of Big Government control .
Some might argue that oil is too crucial a commodity ( for defense reasons ) to allow the free market to decide such things .
Nonsense !
Oil is indeed important for our national security , the very reason we should allow the free market to handle its acquisition .
Oil , like health care , is way too important to be left in the hands of Big Government .
Let 's ignore all these Plans from On High .
Recognize them for what they are : attempts at scare - mongering , attempts at increasing the power and control of Big Government .
So far at the Sun StartupCamp , we 've heard from Jonathan Schwartz about the company 's attention to the startup developer community .
Now we hear from a panel on building your brand .
S. Neil Vineberg , President of Vineberg Communications , is moderating the panel entitled Notes From Mission Control : Rules For A Successful Media Launch .
On the panel we have Matt Dickman , Vice - President of Fleishman - Hillard , Jyri Engestrom , Entreprenuer and Google employee , Christina Kerley , a Marketing Specialist from ckEpiphany , Inc. and Adam Metz , a Partner at the MIX Agency .
As most startups will seek out press once they 're ready for spreading the word about their company , this panel is surely helpful for a number of entrepreneurs out there .
Here are some of the points the panel discussed :
~ have a good personality that becomes central to the brand ( Steve Jobs , Richard Branson ) ~ have transparency with different audiences : press , users , consumers , partners , etc. ~ current trends .
how can you use them to tell your story ?
~ strategy behind press and marketing ~ first impressions are key .
you have 5 seconds or less to convey how your different , & institute personality ~ create new tactics .
if you do n't fit into an existing category , create one .
~ make a conversation centralizer , whether it be an aggregator on your RSS , or a network on Ning where others can engage in the discussions ~ jaiku example : get people to rely on your platform for their own success , because they 'll do marketing for you .

The study focuses on MRIs , or magnetic resonance imaging , an ultra-sensitive scan given to more and more newly diagnosed breast cancer patients before surgery , says author Richard Bleicher , a breast cancer surgeon at Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia .
Doctors may perform the scans to get a better look at a patient 's tumor than they could get with a mammogram or biopsy .
HEALTH BLOG : Latest cancer studies FORUM : Living with cancer
Although there 's no evidence that MRIs improve a woman 's odds of survival , Bleicher says the number of patients getting the scans before surgery at Fox Chase doubled from 2004 to 2006 , to 27 % .
Yet the scans may create two potential problems , says Bleicher , who presented his study of 577 women today at a meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in Washington .
First , getting an MRI appears to delay the start of treatment by three weeks , he says .
While waiting three weeks may not affect a woman 's survival , it almost certainly adds to her anxiety , Bleicher says , especially if she spends a lot of that time getting additional tests .
Second , women who have MRIs are more likely to get mastectomies , instead of breast - conserving lumpectomies , mostly because MRIs can pick up suspicious spots outside the original lump .
A study presented earlier this year by Mayo Clinic doctors found the same trend .
Yet Bleicher asks :
Do doctors really need to find that additional cancer ?
STUDY : Women increasingly opt for mastectomy Studies have long shown that women are equally likely to survive , whether they have mastectomies or lumpectomies plus radiation , which can kill lingering cancer cells not removed through surgery , he says .
He says he 's concerned that mastectomy rates — which fell steadily for years as more women chose lumpectomies — are now rising again .
Some of these mastectomies , he says , may be unnecessary .
" We treated women perfectly well " before MRIs came along , Bleicher says .
" Are we doing these women now a disservice ?

Filming of John Travolta movie on Paris housing estate halted after rioting youths threaten crew and torch their cars
Filming of a new John Travolta movie on a deprived Paris housing estate has been cancelled - after rioting youths torched ten of the production ’s cars and threatened crew .
' From Paris With Love ' was meant to have highlighted social problems in the grim suburbs which surround the French capital .
Jobs as extras and support staff were even offered to largely immigrant residents who are plagued by unemployment and discrimination .
Riots : Filming of a movie starring John Travolta and Jonathan Rhys Meyers was cancelled due to violent youths on Les Bosquets estate in Paris
But within days of arrived in Les Bosquets , a high rise estate in Montfermeil , in the notorious Seine - Saint - Denis north of the capital , violence broke out .
‘ All ten of the vehicles set to be used in the film were burnt out and there were threats aimed at support crew , ’ said a production spokesman .
‘ There ’s no now possibility of Mr Travolta or any of the other stars of the film operating in such a dangerous area .
' The scenes we were mean to do here will now be shot elsewhere . ’
‘ From Paris With Love ’ , which will also star British actor Jonathan Rhys Meyers , will be legendary French director Luc Besson ’s last film .
All those involved hoped the £ 30 million movie would draw attention to urban communities alienated from mainstream France .
Troubled area :
The deprived northern Paris suburb of Montfermeil was the scene of riots in 2005
Travolta , the star of numerous films including Grease and Pulp Fiction , in particular wanted to get as close as possible to an underclass which suffers some of the worst social problems in Europe .
He and his wife Kelly Preston arrived in Paris earlier this month , and were due to spend the next three months living close to Montfermeil .
Film makers had been allowed into the area on two conditions - that local people were used as extras , and that meals for the film workers were produced by a local company .
Reacting to the cancellation , Montfermeil ’s mayor Xavier Lemoine said : ‘ I ’m very sad for all residents who were due to take part in this production . ’
Earlier this year , Mr Sarkozy 's government unveiled an £ 800 million plan aimed at tackling social problems in run down estates like Les Bosquets , investing in job creation schemes , education and transport .
However , the former Interior Minister is best known for his reactionary approach to trouble - invariably sending riot police into what he described as ' ghettoes ' , and calling lawless locals ' scum ' who should be ' washed away with a power hose . '
Responding to such emotive language and behaviour , former Socialist prime minister Laurent Fabius said : ' We need to act on prevention , education , housing , jobs ... and not play the cowboy . '
The Most Compelling Political Event of the Year
It was n’t meant to be political .
In fact , Saturday night , while beautiful , was pretty conventional : two of my dear friends from graduate school were getting married .
They are fellow economists who have spent 18 years together ; they have supported each other through their careers , each has followed the other to different cities , and they provide each other with support in their personal lives .
The only difference is that Jed and Eric are both men .
In many respects , their wedding followed the script I ’ve celebrated as my other graduate school buddies have married .
Friends and family were assembled , and the lucky couple were excited and busy hosts , making sure that all the details were in place .
But there were differences .
The timing of their wedding had little to do with the progress of their relationship .
It is pretty unusual for a couple to wait 18 years to marry .
But in this case , their choice reflects the fact that they were legally unable to move ahead until the California Supreme Court ruled that the state ’s Constitution recognizes their right to marriage .
And they were forced to rush their wedding ahead of next week ’s election , as a ballot initiative ( Prop 8 ) seeks to take away this right by amending the constitution .
And so circumstances dictated that their love and their wedding , while being intensely personal , was also somehow public and political .
In a symbolically loaded part of their ceremony , an African - American friend invited them to “ jump the broom . ”
During slavery , society refused to recognize the rights of many African - Americans to marry .
Despite this , marriage — formalized by a couple jumping over a broom — continued to thrive .
Today , we recognize those earlier marriage bans as a gross historical injustice .
The thing that struck me about their ceremony was how viscerally it changed my own feelings about gay marriage .
I had always supported gay marriage , but it was an abstract , intellectual support ; now it ’s personal .
And so a friend ’s wedding became , for me , the most compelling political event of the year .
Here ’s an interesting thought :
How has the recent wave of same - sex weddings changed the political landscape ?
There have now been thousands of same - sex weddings , each enjoining scores of invited friends and family to re-examine their thoughts and feelings .
There ’s a pretty good chance that one of these folks might be the pivotal voter on Tuesday .
And I suspect that this is a much more motivating political force than the tens of millions being spent on political advertising .
If I had photoshop skills , I ’d be putting out a picture of Ron Paul smiling up * at Ben Bernanke throwing money out of helicopters …
Unfortunately , I ’m not an artist .
So this will have to do …
Perhaps my predictions in early 2007 are starting to come true ?
We ’re in an election year , and our next president ( whoever it is ) is about to walk into a shitstorm of 1930s proportions .
The next President will be forced to “ do something ” , and to expect that President to do something positive instead of politically - palatable - but - destructive is naive at best .
More to come when I get a chance , because my initial predictions did n’t quite account for how difficult it would be for our economy to deleverage …
A lot of people do n’t understand what ’s actually happening , so I ’m going to do my best to explain it in simple terms– and try not to get it wrong , as it ’s complex enough to make my brain hurt …
* No , Ron Paul would n’t be smiling up at Bernanke out of respect , it would be more out of a fatalistic delirium that all of us might be facing in the near future .
Ron Paul was just prescient enough to see it coming and try to warn us .
Tech knowledge is like the Force :
It can be used for good or for evil .
And the greatest hackers in history are the ones who used their powers for good , to take technology to exciting places it was never intended to go .
You can hack your , your , your , or ( of course ) your PC to make it do things its creators never intended .
But we tried to go even further in our list of history 's top ten hacks .
We 've looked back to computing 's earliest days to find the most inspiring examples of hacker brilliance in our entirely subjective opinion , of course .
And none of these hacks are crimesor at least , they should n't be .
Spacewar ! ( 1961 )
The PDP - 1 mainframe was not designed to play computer games .
Computer games were pretty much unknown in 1961 .
Then Steve Russell designed the first action - packed , graphics - based , shoot - 'em - up game , controlled by the mainframe 's front - panel switches .
It was a hack , using the PDP - 1 for a purpose it most certainly had n't been intended for and entertainment has n't been the same since .
Play it live today to re-create the glory .
Saving Apollo 13 ( 1970 )
NASA has made many brilliant hacks , but most of them have been about squeezing extra performance out of automated systems , such as the Mars exploration rovers , the Hubble telescope , and Pioneer 10 .
We 'll give the prize to the hack that saved lives .
After a fuel tank explosion severely damaged Apollo 13's command module , ground control and astronauts turned the ship 's moon - landing module into a lifeboat , slingshotted around the Moon using the lunar module 's tiny engine , hacked a system for removing carbon dioxide from the lunar module , and made it back to earth safely .
The Internet Coke Machine ( 1991 )
Back in the early '90s there was a fad for connecting soda machines ( and one coffee maker ) to the Internet .
The idea was that from the comfort of your dorm room , you could use the Unix " finger " program to find out how many Cokes the local machine had , and whether they were cold , computer science students could avoid wasting energy by leaving their desks unnecessarily .
The machine at the Rochester Institute of Technology had the best interface :
It used graphics and actually let you buy drinks online .
But as far as we can tell , the Carnegie Mellon machine , brought online in 1991 , was the first of its kind .
MIT 's VU Meter ( 1993 )
Hacking is basically part of the standard curriculum at MIT , so picking our favorite MIT hack was tough .
Many of the student hacks just involve making fun of other schools or disrupting events , which seemed kind of boring to us , because we 're stodgy old grown - ups .
But we loved the 1993 hack which turned the top of a classroom building into a giant VU meter ( volume units , which indicate signal strength , or loudness ) that was synced to a Boston Pops concert .
As with the Internet soda machine , a lot of people have turned office buildings into light displays since then , most notably Blinkenlights .
But MIT 's was among the first , and still one of the best .
The Greasecar ( 1998 )
With alternative fuels on everyone 's mind , let 's tip our hats to the Greasecar 's creators , who run their cars on leftover fry oil .
This is n't biodiesel ; it 's a car that smells like French fries .
Engineer Carl Bielenberg first hacked a Volkswagen Rabbit to run on straight vegetable oil ; the design was later modified by Justin Carven to run a $ 300 used 1983 Volkswagen Quantum on waste vegetable oil .
Carven 's company , Greasecar , now sells waste - oil conversion kits to anyone who wants to drive around smelling like a McDonald 's ad . 
DeCSS ( 1999 )
The battle between the forces of good and the forces of DRM is epic .
The forces of good say that you 've bought a DVD and should be able to play it on any device you own .
The forces of DRM say no ; they want you to buy the same content over and over again .
Programmer Jon Lech Johansen , who helped write DeCSS in 1999 , is the poster boy for the anti-DRM fight .
DeCSS decrypts DVDs so that you can play them anywhere you like .
Johansen has gone on to write all sorts of other un -DRMing code , including several applications to knock the protection off purchased Apple iTunes Music Store files .
Ben Heckendorn's Opus ( 2000 - present )
Ben Heckendorn is a genius at fitting square pegs into round holes .
Specifically , he takes large , clunky pieces of classic computing gear and turns them into heartbreakingly beautiful handcrafted handhelds and laptops .
His most famous project was the handheld Atari 2600 game system , but he's also turned an and my favorite classic PC , the Atari 800 , into elegant laptops .
His work takes attention to detail , a steady hand , comprehensive engineering knowledge , and a lot of time .
TCP Packets by Pigeon ( 2001 )
What 's the slowest Internet connection you can think of ?
How about a 106 - minute ping roundtrip ?
At 56 bytes per packet , that 's 0.95 bps .
That 's a wireless connection , of course by carrier pigeon .
In 2001 , a Linux user group in Norway decided to try to implement a joke protocol written in 1990 specifying how to transfer Internet data by pigeon .
They pulled it off , but we 're not too sure about the practicality .
OSx86 ( 2005 )
For years , crossing over between the Mac and PC worlds required either physically clunky coprocessors or logically clunky emulators .
Then Apple switched over to Intel processors , which could have let OS X run on any homebrew PC system .
Apple being Apple , its engineers wrote code into the OS so that only Apple machines could boot OS X .
Enter the hackers .
Within months , a team of pseudonymous hackers churned out software patches that create versions of OS X that will run on standard , homebrew machines constructed from parts you can buy at any PC retailer .
They 've tracked Apple 's updates ever since .
Although running a " Hackintosh " can involve a lot of code twiddling and software hacking , it 's an exhilarating project .
The Port - O - Rotary ( 2007 )
I 'm the cell phone guy , so I had to put a phone hack in here .
Lots of people have tried to bring the classic midcentury rotary dial aesthetic into the cell - phone age , most notably Hulger , which sells a line of rotary - phone - style handsets for standard mobile phones .
But Sparkfun 's Port - O - Rotary ( $ 199.95 direct ) puts a full GSM mobile phone inside an authentic old rotary phone , with the dial , ringer , and even the dial tone still functional .
We strongly suggest walking down the street while talking on one of these .
It will draw stares .

" Sauerland " - Terrorists "
The CIA Contact From Ludwigsburg
According to information from sources within the German authorities , a German contact person for the CIA was involved in the planning of what would have been the largest Islamic terror attacks on German soil .
He supposedly helped transport 20 detonators .
It was a hot day in August last year , when the 15 - year old Alaeddine T. from Braunschweig met a tall , sporty man , who called himself Obeida , in a mosque in Istanbul .
The boy later told officials of the Federal Criminal Investigation Office , that Obeida gave him a bag with jeans and a few shoes and told him to take the bag to Germany .
On August 26 Alaeddine gave the bag to T. at a mosque in Braunschweig .
A week later the young man , who received the bag was presented to the world by the international media : Fritz Gelowicz , 29 years old , a muslim convert from Ulm .
Together with its fellow believers Adem Yilmaz , 29 , and Daniel Schneider , 22 , he had supposedly planned attacks on American and Uzbek installations in Germany .
Hidden in the shoes from Turkey were 20 detonators .
The person who had originally handed over the bag in Istanbul was apparently a CIA contact and came from the Pfalz region , as the STERN has learned from security circles .
Mevlüt K. , a 29 year old Turk from Ludwigshafen , is known to German investigators since 1997 as " Obeida , the turk " .
He was a member of the radical Islamic group " Imam Einheit " and was allegedly providing false passports to the terror organisation " Al Tawhid " and collecting donations for the armed Jihad .
He was also suspected to have provided explosives for an attack in Saudi Arabia .
In August 2002 Mevlüt K. was arrested at the airport of Ankara and was in detention ( in Turkey ) until November 2003 .
He was probably enlisted during this time by the CIA and was planted inside the so called " Sauerland Trio " around Fritz Gelowicz .
Last week the Federal Prosecutor 's Office submitted its 259 - page indictment against Gelowicz , Yilmaz and the others .
The investigators found out , that the " Sauerland Gruppe " , wanted to blow up army barracks , pubs or discotheques in large German cities .
In addition the young Muslims had purchased twelve barrels of hydrogen peroxide , which inside a mixture with flour , would have had an explosive yield of 410 kilograms TNT , according to computations of consultants from the Federal Bureau of Criminal Investigations .
The planned targets : army barracks or pubs .
Together the group had got hold of 26 detonators .
Six originated from Bulgaria and Serbia .
The 20 detonators , which were handed over in Istanbul , were of Czech origin .
How they got to the contact man of the CIA , does not seem to be clarified yet .
There are leads that the detonators came from Syria .
There are also traces leading to Lebanon , possibly to a former Palestinian transition camp , which was bombed later .
Technicians of the Federal Criminal Investigation Office who examined some the detonators more closely wrote in their report , which is known to STERN : " Only two of the altogether 17 tested detonators were functional . "
The others would not have ignited , since they had been too damp .
BERLIN ( Reuters ) -
Two decades after the Berlin Wall fell , communism ’s founding father Karl Marx is back in vogue in eastern Germany -- thanks to the global financial crisis .
His 1867 critical analysis of capitalism , “ Das Kapital , ” has risen from the publishing graveyard to become an improbable best - seller for academic publisher Karl - Dietz - Verlag .
“ Everyone thought there would never ever again be any demand for ‘ Das Kapital ’ , ” managing director Joern Schuetrumpf told Reuters after selling 1,500 copies so far this year , triple the number sold in all of 2007 and a 100 - fold increase since 1990 .
“ Even bankers and managers are now reading ‘ Das Kapital ’ to try to understand what they ’ve been doing to us .
Marx is definitely ‘ in ’ right now , ” Schuetrumpf said .
The revival of Marx ’s treatise reflects a broader rejection of capitalism by many in eastern Germany , a communist country until 1989 and now racked by high unemployment and poverty .
A month of intense financial turmoil has toppled banks in the United States and forced a series of government bailouts in Germany and elsewhere , reinforcing anti-capitalist sentiment .
Chancellor Angela Merkel -- herself an easterner -- unveiled a 500 billion euro financial rescue package this week , a move decried as a reward for irresponsible bankers .
A recent survey found 52 percent of eastern Germans believe the free market economy is “ unsuitable ” and 43 percent said they wanted socialism rather than capitalism , findings confirmed in interviews with dozens of ordinary easterners .
“ We read about the ‘ horrors of capitalism ’ in school .
They really got that right .
Karl Marx was spot on , ” said Thomas Pivitt , a 46 - year - old IT worker from east Berlin .

“ I had a pretty good life before the Wall fell , ” he added .
“ No one worried about money because money did n’t really matter .
You had a job even if you did n’t want one .
The communist idea was n’t all that bad . ”
CAPITALISM EVEN WORSE
Unemployment in the former communist east is 14 percent , double western levels , and wages are significantly lower .
Millions of jobs were lost after reunification .
Many eastern factories were bought by western competitors and shut down .
“ I thought communism was s ---- but capitalism is even worse , ” said Hermann Haibel , a 76 - year old retired blacksmith , who was strolling near Alexanderplatz in the heart of old East Berlin .
“ The free market is brutal .
The capitalist wants to squeeze out more , more , more , ” he said .
Free market hopes were high in the east when Chancellor Helmut Kohl promised “ flourishing landscapes . ”
But while some areas on the outskirts of Berlin , in Leipzig and along the Baltic shore are thriving , much of the rest suffers from depopulation and high unemployment .
The opposition Left party , which traces its roots to Erich Honecker ’s SED party , has capitalized on the frustration and become the east ’s most popular party with support of 30 percent .
“ I do n’t think capitalism is the right system for us , ” said Monika Weber , a 46 - year - old city clerk .
“ The distribution of wealth is unfair .
We ’re seeing that now .
The little people like me are going to have to pay for this financial mess with higher taxes because of greedy bankers . ”
Like many other east Germans , Ralf Wulff said he was delighted about the fall of the Berlin Wall and to see capitalism replace communism .
But the euphoria was ephemeral .
“ It took just a few weeks to realize what the free market economy was all about , ” said Wulff .
“ It ’s rampant materialism and exploitation .
Human beings get lost .
We did n’t have the material comforts but communism still had a lot going for it . ”
But not everyone condemned capitalism .
Astrid Gerber was a master tailor in East Berlin before her company was shut down .
“ It was my dream job , ” said Gerber , 42 .
She was unemployed for seven years , then opened up a newsstand but gave it up after her family disintegrated due to her 90 - hour work week .
“ Capitalism has its advantages but so does communism , ” she said .
“ I ca n’t say one is better than the other . ”

Monday , August 11 , 2008 TEL AVIV — Israel has acknowledged the sale of unmanned aerial vehicles and other Israeli security support to Georgia which has prompted complaints and threats from Moscow .
Officials said the Defense Ministry approved the sale of several tactical UAV systems to Georgia in 2007 , Middle East Newsline reported .
They said Georgia has used the unidentified UAVs for border reconnaissance missions .
" Israel should be proud of its military , which trained Georgian soldiers , " Georgian Reintegration Minister Temur Yakobshvili told Israel Army radio on Aug 10 .
" We killed 60 Russian soldiers just yesterday .
The Russians have lost more than 50 tanks , and we have shot down 11 of their planes .
They have sustained enormous damage in terms of manpower . "
Also In This Edition Amazon.com Widgets Russia has complained of the Israeli UAV sale to Georgia .
In May 2008 , the Russian Army shot down an Israeli UAV along the Georgian border .
The UAV was not identified .

In May 2008 , the Russian Army shot down an Israeli UAV along the Georgian border .
The UAV was not identified .
The Russian demand for Israel to stop military sales came amid the intensification of fighting with Georgia and carried with it the implicit threat of increased aid for Israel 's enemies .
Israel has countered with complaints about Russia 's military exports to Iran and Syria .
Moscow , like Israel , has responded by insisting it sells only defensive systems .
Meanwhile , Israel has been divided over whether to continue weapons sales to Georgia , Middle East Newsline reported .
Officials said the debate pits the Defense Ministry against the Foreign Ministry .
They said the Foreign Ministry has advocated a suspension of all weapons sales and support services to Georgia while the Defense Ministry sought to continue exports .
" The question is whether there should be a temporary suspension of arms exports to Georgia during the war with Russia , " an official said .
In addition to UAVs and other defensive systems , industry sources said Israeli firms have also sold rockets as well as night - vision systems to Tbilisi .
On Aug. 10 , the Israeli Defense Ministry , which has overseen an estimated $ 200 million in military exports to Georgia , convened senior staffers to review the Foreign Ministry recommendation .
Officials said the ministry decided to continue to approve exports for non-lethal systems for military and security applications in Georgia .
" The Defense Ministry has been conducting a very wise policy , " Amos Gilad , director of the Defense Ministry 's political - military bureau , said .
" It has taken all factors into account .
Defensive systems have been sent , and they have not upset the strategic balance . "
Moscow has also asserted that Israeli trainers were advising the Georgian military on how to shoot down Russian combat aircraft and disable main battle tanks .
In December 2007 , Israel decided to end the sale of offensive military systems to Georgia , but did not cancel any contracts .
Officials said Israel came under pressure from Russia , who warned that such sales would be deemed a hostile act .
France and the United States have been leading arms exporters to Georgia .
Still , Russia has pressed Israel for a complete military embargo on Georgia .
Officials said the Israeli Foreign Ministry was concerned that Moscow could retaliate by selling advanced weapons to Iran and Syria .
" The Foreign Ministry , and this includes the minister , does not want to give Russia a pretext for selling advanced systems to Iran and Syria , " the official said .
For its part , Israel has warned Russia not to export the S - 300PMU - 2 air and missile defense system to Teheran .
Western intelligence sources said S - 300 components have already arrived in Iran and were expected to be assembled into operating systems in early 2009 .

When a cell 's chromosomes lose their ends , the cell usually kills itself to stem the genetic damage .
But University of Utah biologists discovered how those cells can evade suicide and start down the path to cancer .
Details of how the process works someday may provide new ways to treat cancer .
The new study of fruit flies is the first to show in animals that losing just one telomere – the end of a chromosome – can lead to many abnormalities in a cell 's chromosomes , which are strands of DNA that carry genes .
" The essential point is that loss of a single telomere may be a primary event that puts a cell on the road to cancer , " says Kent Golic , a professor of biology at the University of Utah and senior author of the study , which will be published online this week in the December issue of the journal Genetics .
Fruit flies have four pairs of chromosomes .
Humans have 23 pairs .
Each chromosome has two ends , called telomeres , which often are compared with the plastic tips of shoe laces .
When those tips are lost or break , the shoelace frays .
Previous research has shown that aging and cancer often are associated with loss or shortening of telomeres .
Damaged Cells Usually Kill Themselves to Avoid Becoming Cancerous
To protect an organism against cancer , most cells with broken or missing telomeres undergo " apoptosis , " also known as cell suicide .
But Golic and Simon Titen , a postdoctoral fellow in biology , found how fruit fly cells with a missing telomere sometimes avoid suicide and instead continue to divide and develop early characteristics of cancer .
advertisement
Normally when a chromosome is damaged , the cell carrying the chromosome turns on a gene named p53 , which helps kill the cell .
When mutated , p53 fails to carry out this vital function .
That is why mutant p53 is a cancer - causing gene and is found in most human tumors .
Golic and Titen found that normal p53 and so - called " checkpoint " proteins named Chk1 and Chk2 are required for the suicide of fruit fly cells with a missing telomere .
They also found that a non-mutant cell lacking a telomere occasionally escapes suicide and divides .
Then , its progeny accumulate defects , including the wrong number of chromosomes or chromosomes that have exchanged pieces with each other .
Those defects are hallmarks of cancer cells .
One possible reason a cell avoids suicide even after telomere loss and other damage is that chromosomes in the cell 's offspring regain telomeres .
" All cancer cells have figured out how to add new telomeres , which allows them to survive and divide indefinitely , " says Titen .
" By interfering with this process , it might be possible to provide a route therapeutically to treat cancer . "
A telomere is made of short sequences of DNA repeated hundreds of times .
Proteins bind to the DNA , forming a cap or telomere that protects the end of the chromosome .
advertisement
In humans , cells in certain tissues , such as the skin , continue to divide over a lifetime .
Each time a cell divides , the telomeres become shorter until , in rare cases , the rest of the chromosome is no longer protected .
It has been proposed that this can trigger cancer , but previous studies have been done only in yeast or cultured animal cells that are grown in a dish .
The new Utah study shows in flies that telomere loss can cause cancer - like changes in a cell .
When Cell Suicide is Blocked , Cells Start on the Road to Cancer
Fruit flies often are used for chromosomal studies because they share 60 percent of their genes with humans , and it is unethical to cause genetic abnormalities in humans .
Also , the process by which fly cells grow and divide are comparable with human cells .
To trigger telomere loss , the researchers inserted into the flies a gene from common baker 's yeast .
The gene makes an enzyme that breaks and rejoins DNA .
When they turned on the enzyme , it led to the loss of a single telomere in each affected fruit fly cell .
The researchers then looked at what happened to the cells that lost a telomere .
" When we looked to see what happens to cells [ those lacking a telomere ] , we found that most died – which is good – because those that did n't die accumulated abnormal chromosomes , which is characteristic of cancer cells , " Golic explains .
Next , they repeated the experiment using flies in which p53 , Chk1 or Chk2 were mutated – thus crippling cells ' ability to commit suicide .
The net effect of crippling the cell suicide genes and then damaging the chromosomes was to allow more damaged chromosomes to survive instead of committing suicide .
In a normal fly , when a telomere is lost , only 10 percent to 20 percent of cells with such damage survive , with the rest killing themselves .
But in flies whose suicide genes were crippled , up to 75 percent of cells survived despite lacking a telomere .
" Cells containing chromosomes with broken ends turn on a signal and Chk2 gets activated , and then that activates p53 which eventually leads to cell death , " Golic says .
" Chk1 also becomes activated and eventually activates p53 . "
Titen adds : " Chk1 and Chk2 were not previously known to be involved in cell death due to loss of a telomere . "
The researchers found that if a damaged cell avoids suicide due to p53 , Chk1 or Chk2 , there is another way it can kill itself and avoid starting down the road to cancer .
This occurs when the damaged cell divides , and its progeny have the wrong number of chromosomes .
The resulting genetic imbalance can cause cell suicide .
Thus , telomere loss also is linked to this alternative form of cell suicide .
The study shows for the first time that this type of cell death – which does n't use p53 – is caused by gaining or losing copies of other important genes , Golic says .
Cells that bypass all of the protective suicide measures divide multiple times , accumulating more and more chromosomal abnormalities .
In humans , such cells are likely to develop into cancer cells .
The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health .

Electric Space Weather Baffles Scientists
Atmospheric researchers are puzzled by a " newly discovered form of space weather " observed over the African continent .
" ... We 've seen the smoke , but where 's the smoke stack ? "
This " strange " and " new " phenomenon is the " ion plume " -- a form of electrified " gas " ( plasma ) in Earth 's atmosphere that is so high above ground it makes contact with space itself .
( See NASA -- Strange Space Weather Over Africa )
Scientists are taking the discovery quite seriously .
In Addis Ababa , Ethiopia , over 100 scientists and students have converged this week to discuss the ion plume and its profound ramifications for many scientific disciplines .
The electric plumes were first discovered a few years ago over North America , when one appeared during a geomagnetic storm and noticeably affected GPS signals .
According to NASA , this was a " plume of excess electron density . "
The plumes form in Earth 's ionosphere , reaching upward into space , for reasons that have mystified atmospheric scientists .
For answers , investigators are turning toward Earth 's magnetic equator , which passes along the sub -Sahara .
The Earth 's ionosphere is an outer region of the atmosphere that contains a high concentration of free electrons .
Since scientists have observed electrical properties of the ionosphere for more than 100 years , why should they find the plumes ' discovery " strange ? "
Answer :
The plumes behavior indicates something that scientists have resisted for many decades -- that the Earth itself is a charged body moving in a plasma medium , and interacting electrically with its plasma environment .
In the electric view of the Solar System , the Sun becomes a central player in the electrodynamics of planetary behavior .
And exchanges between the Sun and Earth can be seen as the answer to numerous mysteries that have accumulated over decades .
This common disregard for electricity has a long history .
More than 100 years ago , one of the electrical pioneers , Kristian Birkeland , proposed that the auroras were part of an electrical exchange between Earth and the Sun .
But by the middle of the 20th century , traditional dogma in astronomy had virtually precluded that possibility .
Then , a few decades later , our satellites detected UNDENIABLE streams of charged particles from the Sun entering Earth 's upper atmosphere to provoke the auroras .
Until that point , it had been blindly asserted that Earth 's magnetosphere must be an impenetrable envelope , " squeezed " by the solar wind , to induce auroral activity .
Now it is known that electrical events occur when clouds of charged particles -- Coronal Mass Ejections ( CME ) -- erupt from the Sun .
If the eruption is intense and Earth is in the path of these charged particles , the result will be a proton storm , with potential serious disruptions of communications on Earth .
And this arrival of protons provokes a response from the ionosphere in the form of electron concentrations ( plumes ) rising into space .
In other words , it is an electrical TRANSACTION -- a CURRENT -- connecting the " negative " earth and the positively charged Sun at the center of the Solar System .
( For background on the electric Sun , click here )
Investigators compare the ion plumes to " smoke billowing out of a factory smokestack , " but this analogy is quite misleading .
Electrified plasma is not akin to smoke at all .
The plumes do not float up and then dissipate like smoke from a chimney .
In gravitational terms , the escape velocity from Earth is 25,000 MPH -- not a plausible achievement by a charge - neutral gas like smoke .
But charged particles barely notice gravity , if at all .
The vastly more powerful electric force rules them .
The researchers do recognize the electrified nature of the " gas " ( plasma ) , but are very careful in their choice of words .
In fact , the investigators do not offer any explanation for what they are seeing .
In an electrically neutral Solar System , no explanation exists , because within this framework , electrical transactions across cosmic distances are inconceivable !
What occurred when they first observed the ion plume is this : " â€¦an explosion on the sun had hurled a cloud of magnetized gas -- a CME -- toward Earth .
The plume formed when the CME hit , triggering a strong geomagnetic storm .
The plume consists of ionized air at high altitude moving from Florida to Canada at a speed of 1 km /s ( 2200 mph ) . "
It must be emphasized that the mechanical principles of atmospheric circulation will never account for this anomalous transport at such velocities .
But in electrical terms , charged particles are not restricted by standard gas kinetics .
And in fact , in plasma discharge phenomena we frequently see charged particles accelerated to near light speed .
Another science story on the " mysterious plumes " indicates that they may seriously disturb air travel , obviously increasing the stakes for investigators who do n't understand how or why the plumes form .
The New Scientist news service reports : " Mysterious plumes of plasma at theÂ edge of the Earth 's atmosphere are threatening airline navigation by throwing off GPS positioning information by up to the length of a football field .
But a poor understanding of how the plumes form means that accurate forecasts of the phenomena -- which would allow GPS users to plan around them -- are years away .
" ... at least some of the disruptions are due to giant plumes of charged particles , or plasma , that form in response to the solar outbursts in the Earth 's ionosphere , a region filled with ions at the boundary between Earth 's atmosphere and outer space .
The concentrated plasma in the plumes diverts and delays satellite communications , such as GPS signals . "
We see here a profound illustration of the potential human cost of ignorance .
And this ignorance amounts to little more than the momentum of historic dogma , which has excluded electricity from space .
To put these new findings in perspective , it is only necessary to see Earth as proponents of the Electric Universe see it .
The electrical theorists recognize the Earth as a self - repairing , " leaky " capacitor ( a capacitor is a device for accumulating and storing electric charge . )
A capacitor is made of two conductors separated by an insulating medium .
When charge is placed on one conductor , it attracts charge of the opposite polarity on the other conductor .
As a result , an electric field is set up between the conductors , a reservoir of electrical energy .
Applied to Earth , this means that the atmosphere serves as the insulating layer between two conductive regions â€ “ the solid Earth is the negatively charged region , and the external environment of Earth is the more positively charged region .
And the electrical activity of the Sun affects the balance between the two regions .
Of course , Earth 's atmosphere is not a perfect insulator , and leakage will occur , particularly in response to disturbances from the arrival of " proton storms . "
Sadly , scientists investigating the " mysterious " plumes seem unaware that across many disciplines , similarly " surprising " discoveries in our Solar System reveal the same underlying pattern .
From the energetic outbursts of comets , to the electric plumes of the Jovian moon
Io , to towering , electrified " dust devils " on Mars , to explosive jets from Saturn 's icy moon Enceladus , we see planets , moons , and comets interacting electrically with their plasma environments .
No interpretation of these " anomalies " will work that does not include the recognition of a few basic facts :
1 ) The earth , like all of the planets , is a charged body .
2 ) The Sun has an electric field , and it interacts electrically with the planets .
3 ) The Sun is not powered by some mysterious , internal " nuclear furnace " , but rather externally by electric currents flowing along the arms of the Milky Way .
4 ) 99.9 % of the universe consists of PLASMA , a nearly perfect conducting medium that has been found to exhibit strong electrical properties , almost always ignored by astronomers .
All of space is teeming with charged particles .
We live in an electrically dynamic universe , a reality confirmed almost daily by " surprising " and " mysterious " discoveries such as the electric " ion plumes " over Earth .

Home prices remain stable in the face of a global pandemic , record high unemployment , and millions of Americans actively not paying on their mortgages through forbearance .
Not exactly a rosy picture .
On the surface , the stable prices would seem to indicate all is well .
But the reality is more problematic in that millions of homes are off the market right now as people are not paying their mortgage via forbearance .
For those wanting to buy a home , they are competing with very little inventory .
Selling a home right now just does not seem like the best time given the pandemic we are in .
In California , housing prices remain stable while millions are out of work and half the state is made up of renter households .
The math does n’t seem to add up but this is n’t a “ market ” in what many would think as a free market .

What do you think ?
Pre-Covid our cohort of Millennials in California were already living at home in dramatically large numbers .
The total was 2.3 million Millennial adults were living at home with mom and dad because they were unable to afford high rents , let alone purchase an overpriced crap shack built during World War II with popcorn ceilings and horrid looking carpet .
Flippers think that a little bit of lipstick on the pig is enough to charge $ 1 million for a piece of junk .
It should come as no surprise that Millennials are struggling even more during the pandemic .
The bulk of job losses have come from industries where young people dominate .
So it is no surprise that the median age of a home buyer went from 31 in 1981 to a whopping 47 today .
All of a sudden many of the new buyers are looking like the Taco Tuesday baby boomers that rail against Millennials for not affording a home when they went to college during a time when college was affordable enough to pay with a paper route .
Of course many of these older Americans could n’t program their way out of a paper bag yet rant on social media platforms built by Millennials .

What do you think ?
A startling number of American households are currently not paying their mortgages .
This number is at 4.1 million and this data was before we entered what now appears to be a second shutdown as cases of the Coronavirus spread across the country .
Yet somehow , people think the housing market is going to be perfectly fine .
The reality is , there are massive systemic shocks that are hitting the system and housing is always a lagging indicator .
In California , the unemployment rate is at 16.3 percent which is the highest since the Great Depression .
The forbearance issues run deep since missed payments are now compounding on top of each other meaning many households now owe multiple payments to keep up .
Many missed a payment because they are unable to make one payment so now that people need to make 3 , 4 , or more payments all at once , there will be challenges .
Yet more importantly , think of places in Los Angeles with good schools .
Many are moving to online delivery of coursework this year so that premium on good schools is not worth it if you are essentially paying for a virtual learning model where your student is taking classes from their laptop .

Here is part one , which advances a late Hayekian view of social order .
Particularly impressive is part two , which takes a sound position on the bailout , even as it takes a rather superficial view on the cause .
In general , it is a good link to shoot to someone who is confused .

Date:10/8/2008
EAST LANSING , Mich .
Moderate physical activity during pregnancy does not contribute to low birth weight , premature birth or miscarriage and may actually reduce the risk of complications , according to a Michigan State University professor who contributed to the U.S. government 's first - ever guidelines on physical activity .
Kinesiology professor James Pivarnik and doctoral students Lanay Mudd and Erin Kuffel wrote the section on pregnancy and postpartum activity as part of the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines unveiled Oct. 7 in Washington , D.C. , by the Department of Health and Human Services .
Pivarnik , president - elect of the American College of Sports Medicine , attended the event and spoke on behalf of the organization and MSU .
" There has been quite a dramatic change in regards to pregnancy and exercise , " said Pivarnik , who has studied the topic for more than 20 years .
" While it used to be thought that avoiding exercise meant avoiding harm to the fetus , research now shows physical activity can not only improve health of the mother but also provide potential long - term benefits for the child . "
Specifically , the guidelines call for women to get at least 150 minutes of moderate - intensity aerobic activity per week during pregnancy and the postpartum period , preferably spread throughout the week .
In addition to health benefits , moderate physical activity also may reduce the length of labor , evidence suggests .
The guidelines call for women to avoid doing activities that involve lying on their back after the first trimester and activities with high risk of falling or abdominal trauma .
During the postpartum period , regular physical activity continues to benefit a woman 's overall health , according to Pivarnik 's research , by increasing her cardiorespiratory fitness and improving her mood .
Physical activity after pregnancy also helps women achieve and maintain a healthy weight , and when combined with appropriate caloric restriction , promotes weight loss .
" In the time I have been performing research on exercise during pregnancy , we have shifted from cautious conservatism to the current guidelines , which encourage women to be active throughout gestation , " Pivarnik said .
Also as part of the new guidelines , the government recommends 150 minutes of activity for adults per week .
The move toward measuring recommended exercise by overall minutes as opposed to specific time and frequency requirements mirrors research recently published by Mudd , Pivarnik , Mathew Reeves from MSU 's Department of Epidemiology , and Ann Rafferty from the Michigan Department of Community Health .
That study , published this month in the journal Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise , used a broader approach toward calculating compliance with exercise requirements and found when measured by the amount of energy expended , the number of respondents who met guidelines was significantly higher .
" We found that by following the letter of the law many people who may be getting enough physical activity were not being counted , " Mudd said .
" But we still have a majority of people who are inactive or are not active enough .
" The new guidelines can help shape people 's behaviors and get them on the right track to being healthy , " she added .
" They allow individuals more flexibility in how and when to perform their activities . "

Here 's the good news : Stephen Colbert is running for president in the Marvel Universe .
And , according to Marvel Editor - in - Chief Joe Quesada , the unhinged television superstar is gaining serious momentum .
Here 's the bad news :
He 's not doing the same in the real world .
Mark Waid , The Amazing Spider - Man writer who assimilated the faux newscaster / White House wannabe into issue No. 573 of the comic book , thinks we could use a Colbert presidency more than we could use a Palin vice presidency .
" Despite what a frightening number of red-staters seem to think , " Waid said , " as impressive as it is , being able to field - dress a moose is not a superpower . "
Truthiness , on the other hand , might be .
Wired.com caught up with the two comics rascals , long before they had their morning coffee , to talk Colbert , Spidey , the 2008 election and why Quesada wo n't work blue .
The Colbert issue of Amazing Spider - Man
hits streets Oct. 15 .
Wired.com :
What is it about Colbert that makes him worthy of safeguarding Captain America 's shield or becoming president of the Marvel Universe ?
Mark Waid : Colbert 's worthy because he loves and respects our heroes .
And in a world with J. Jonah Jameson in it , that 's an important qualification .
Joe Quesada : Colbert is a true American hero .
He 's said so on TV , which means it must be true !
Wired.com :
Do you wish he'd run for president in our more boring universe ?
__Waid : __Dear God , yes , if only because it would rock to have Jon Stewart as the veep .
Quesada :
Stephen tried to run for president in our boring universe , but unfortunately his campaign was stymied by the powers that be .
Not so in the Marvel Universe , where his campaign is in full swing and gaining momentum , once again proving that we would all rather be living in the Marvel Universe than the real one .
Wired.com : Why Spidey ?
Is it because he 's got the best sense of humor in the Marvel Universe ?
Quesada : Spidey has his Spider - Sense .
Colbert has truthiness .
It just seemed like a natural fit .
Waid : Clearly , you have not yet read our mega-epic , " Three Men and a Thanos . "
Spidey makes sense because he's had a long tradition of teaming up with everyone inside and outside the Marvel Universe .
Not a bad side gig for a guy who thinks he 's a loner .
Wired.com :
Are there any plans to have Spidey show up on The Colbert Report ?
Better yet , any plans for Colbert to show up in the forthcoming Spidey movies ?
That would be insane in the membrane .
Waid : I yield the floor to my good friend , Joe Quesada .
__Quesada : __While it 's hard to predict where Spidey may show up from time to time , you just never know .
__Wired.com : __Can Colbert save us from ourselves ?
Quesada : Forget about saving us from ourselves , I have Skrulls nipping at my ass !
__Waid : __Joe , I think you just wrote this year 's Christmas song .
Quesada : I do n't work blue .
Wired.com :
Any thoughts on the real election that you would like to share ?
Waid : Just that , despite what a frightening number of red-staters seem to think , as impressive as it is , being able to field - dress a moose is not a superpower .
Wired.com : Colbert has become a pop-culture phenomenon like few others .
Why do you think he resonates so strongly with the public ?
Waid : I just woke up and have no funny answer , damn it .
Quesada : I think it 's simply because he speaks the truth that he feels in his gut .
It 's got nothing to do with ridiculous things like " facts " or " reason . "
And that feels right to me .
Wired.com :
Any thoughts on giving him an alter ego , along the lines of Venom ?
Kind of like Formidable Opponent , with a comics twist ?
Waid :
You mean " archenemy , " right ?
Trust me , readers of the story will see that – thanks to a suggestion by assistant editor Tom Brennan – we 've added to Stephen Colbert 's Rogues '
Gallery in the most unexpected and yet obvious way possible .
Longtime Spidey fans will recognize who Colbert is up against !
( Editor 's note : The New York Times reports that Colbert will square off against The Grizzly in the comic . )
Quesada :
As for alter ego , yes , we worked very hard to design one for him .
When he's not being Stephen Colbert , he 's a mild - mannered comedic actor , husband and father of three living in New Jersey named Stephen Colbert .

Senator John McCain ’s presidential campaign on Friday stepped up its efforts to tie Senator Barack Obama to a community organizing group that has been accused of involvement in problematic voter registrations in several hotly contested states , including Colorado , Indiana , Nevada and North Carolina .
The group , the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now , or Acorn , has long been a favorite target of conservatives .
It made news this year when it was revealed that a brother of Acorn ’s founder had embezzled almost $ 1 million from the organization but that Acorn had failed to disclose the theft for eight years .
“ Barack Obama has made very inconsistent remarks about what his relationship with this organization is , ” Rick Davis , Mr. McCain ’s campaign manager , said in a conference call .
Mr. Davis said Mr. Obama had worked as Acorn ’s lawyer and conducted training events for its leaders .
He also noted a payment the Obama campaign made in February to an Acorn affiliate , Citizens Services Inc .

Even Governor Palin 's personal image is causing her problems .
Earlier this morning , Republican eyebrows were raised when a photograph emerged of Governor Palin wearing disco attire featuring a micro-mini - skirt and a breathtakingly low - cut décolleté as she steadied herself on a bar while teetering on shiny , black patent leather platforms fitted with vertiginous stiletto heels that could have been purchased at Victoria 's Secret .
Governor Palin 's colorful image plus her interesting background and rising political profile will certainly remain subjects of intense public interest for a long time to come .

Exactly .
We cannot afford a " Shoot from the hip " President .
Major decisions need to be made in the coolness of soberthought , AFTER listening to advice from a number of points of view .
For the last seeven plus years e have had a " Decider " on the throne , who listens only to people who agree with his preconceived ideas .
We caannot afford one minute more of this type of decision - making , but we have four and a half months more of it to endure , and the stupidity - directed thinking may involve us in three simultaneous wars .
I WISH the Congress had developed some cojones and impesched the decider and his Svengali long ago .

There is an Alaskan blog by Andrew Halcro , who is clearly a Palin detractor ( he ran against her for governor ) .
He is suggesting inappropriate involvement of relatives in Palin 's administration .
The comments section is an oppo researcher 's delight - names , situations , and possible areas for research that have not yet hit the media .
Coming into question is the extent of Todd Palin 's involvement in Sarah 's governing , and the appropriateness of it .
For example , he has been invited to sit in on meetings .
He is copied on emails that have been withheld from FOIAs as " executive privilege " , yet he is not a staff member of the governor .
There are additional firings that appear to be personally motivated , and the allegation that Todd is operating as an unregistered lobbyist ( all the more reason he should not be copied on executive privilege emails ) .
This is not a vetting process that one could finish in hours or days , given the amount of stuff that came up .
When mayor of Wasilla , she supposedly used her staff for campaigning purposes as she ran for governor .
A city newspaper picked up on it and Todd Palin threw a fit at the city employees who responded to the public information request by the paper , saying they should not have released the information .
I strongly suggest reading this blog and wading through the comments section --- it provides many leads for more interesting " understanding " of this too - quickly selected candidate .

It leally shows that he has lack of judgement , mrs .
Pelin is a women and I believe that he should have vet her better , a someone that is running for a High office should set a moral standar , and also him self .
We need someone with strong values to show a good example to the new generation of our country .

" did n't even have to stretch the truth to do it either . "
We must have watched different speeches .
all I saw was one bald faced lie after another topped with absolutely ZERO substance .
What I expected from someone that has no experience and who 's only plan is lie continuously for the next 4 years while raping the country blind .
The MSM is making her out to be the best thing since sliced bacon and refuses to tell the facts about her .
We are getting exactly what we deserve in Nov.
Another stolen election , another 4 years of WORSE THAN BUSH and I can not believe this country will survive it .
My wife & I have decided if these lunatics steal this election then we are moving out of the country , probably Cayman Islands or New Zealand .

No .
Sorry .
I forgot to come and update this .
I missed a salient section of her speech the first time through .
When I watched it over again without the interruptions , yes , she did stretch the truth pretty good there in one section particularly .
I agree .
Worse than Bush .
Palin really scored for McCain last night .
Luckily not nearly as many people saw it as saw Obama .

The hall had a lot of empty seats .
The cheers were all choreographed and amplified .
They always do that .
Makes them sound united , and like bigger threats than they are .
All that .
Just between Giuliani and Palin they got back a whole lot of lost votes .
They hit Obama really hard on his weakest parts .
He 's been leaning way out over the yawning chasm for those Republicans and Independents and he had them last week .
Palin just yanked most of them right back .
McCain could n't have done that .

The amazing bendy TV screen that folds up to fit in your pocket
In operation : A snapshot of the running all - organic 2D - display
By Cher Thornhill for MailOnline
Traditional flat - screen televisions could soon become a thing of the past , as scientists have revealed an ultra - thin , flexible screen that could fold up and fit in your pocket .
The bendy screens - less than a millimetre thick - could be used for televisions , computers and phones , and may pave the way for easy - to - carry digital newspaper displays , which readers could upload their news on to daily .
Some speculate that the technology could even lead to wearable TV jackets , flexible laptop screens , and TV blankets .
Sony worked with researchers at the Max Planck Institute in Germany to create the design .
They say it is flexible and transparent , and has an extremely low energy requirement , allowing laptop and phone batteries to last longer .
The screens are made up of organic molecules that emit light in all directions to produce an image , which gives an almost infinite viewing angle .
Stacking up the transparent screens may produce 3D effects , the scientists say .
Other possibilities include moving images on posters , like those seen in films such as Minority Report , and talking pictures on cereal boxes .
The researchers told the Journal of Physics : ' The displays have excellent brightness and are transparent , bendable and flexible .
' There are practically no display size limitations and they could be produced relatively easily and cheaply compared to today 's screens . '
An earlier version of the work was demonstrated by Sony in 2006 , but technical and design issues stopped it from being mass produced .
ARB has released the much anticipated OpenGL 3.0 spec and if you were the one following developments of OpenGL for sometime , you would know that hopes were riding high on the fact that OpenGL 3.0 would be a revolutionary redesign of an ailing and a rather old API .
Apparently it ’s none of that and even worse it ’s actually nothing at all .
OpenGL was drugging along for the past 15 years , adding on layer upon layer of muckish extensions to the point that many had expected ARB to really go ahead and make radical changes in the 3.0 specification .
None of that has happened .
Most of the radical changes promised have not been delivered .
All that seems to have happened is the standardization of already existing extensions by making them a part of the the standard .
Sad , really sad .
As a game developer and more as someone who has been using OpenGL for the past 8 years I am pretty disappointed .
I was hoping to see a refreshing change to OpenGL .
I am at a loss of words here ; no really I am .
There is really nothing more to say .
The changes have been so shallow , that I wonder why it called for a major version number change in the first place .
2.1 to 3.0 , phooey , it should have been 2.1.1 instead .
Let me put it in another way ; my current OpenGL renderer which is based on OpenGL 2.x could be promoted to 3.0 probably with 4 or 5 minuscule changes or maybe none at all !
Where is the Direct3D 10 + level functionality what was hyped about ?
Where is the “ radically forward looking ” API ?
What does this say for the future of OpenGL ?
Sadly not very much at least in the gaming arena .
It was already loosing ground and there was a lot of anticipation that ARB would deliver a newer OpenGL to “ take on ” Direct3D .
I must say that a powerful Direct3D ( thanks to DirectX 11 ) looks all set to become the unequivocal champion when it comes to gaming graphics .
OpenGL will clearly take a back seat to DirectX here .
While some may argue that OpenGL will continue to flourish in the CAD arena , I am not so sure that Direct3D wont find favor over there as well .
OpenGL drivers from most vendors already fall short of their Direct3D counterparts .
That ’s to be expected .
It ’s not their fault either .
What else can they do when you have a 15 year old API to support whose legacy functionality is out of touch with modern day reality .
EDIT : The major thing missing as far as OpenGL 3.0 was a clean API rewrite .
When you compare OpenGL 3.0 with Direct3D 11 it ’s how things look from here on forward is what bothers me .
Direct3D is more streamlined to address developments in hardware and while vendors could also expose similar functionality via OpenGL using vendor specific extensions , the whole situation does n’t look too good .
Making a driver that is fully OpenGL compatible will cost more in terms of manpower .
That is because the specification is so large .
Yes there is opportunity to deprecate things but I am not too sure how things will pan out there as well .
Supporting older features on newer hardware means compromises and sacrifices in quality and performance .
Driver writers cannot optimize for everything and that is why in the end performance suffers ; or in worst case , ships out broken .
NEW YORK ( AP )  New York City investigators are wondering why neighbors waited more than a half hour to call police after hearing the screams for help from a woman who was stabbed to death at a Queens apartment .
Police found Ebony Garcia , 21 , lying in a pool of blood at about 2:10 a.m Saturday .
She was stabbed about a dozen times and died two hours later at a local hospital .
Witnesses say neighbors ignored the woman 's screams for more than 30 minutes before someone called the police .
One neighbor said she ignored the cries because she thought the victim had been drinking .
Police want to question Garcia 's boyfriend , against whom she had obtained a restraining order .

Desmond Tutu , the South African Nobel laureate , said yesterday there was a " possibility " Israel had committed a war crime when 18 Palestinians from a single family were killed by Israeli artillery shells in Gaza two years ago .
Tutu said the Israeli attack , which hit the Athamna family house , showed " a disproportionate and reckless disregard for Palestinian civilian life " .
The archbishop presented his comments in a final report to the UN Human Rights Council , which had sent him to Gaza to investigate the killings in Beit Hanoun in November 2006 .
For 18 months Israel did not grant the archbishop or his team a visa .
They entered Gaza in May this year on a rare crossing from Egypt .
On the three - day visit , Tutu and his team visited the house , interviewed the survivors and met others in Gaza , including the senior Hamas figure and former prime minister , Ismail Haniyeh .
At the time , Tutu said he wanted to travel to Israel to hear the Israeli account of events , but he was not permitted .
" In the absence of a well - founded explanation from the Israeli military - which is in sole possession of the relevant facts - the mission must conclude that there is a possibility that the shelling of Beit Hanoun constituted a war crime , " Tutu said in his report to the 47 - member council .
Tutu also said that rockets fired by Palestinian militants into southern Israel should stop and should be investigated .
" Those firing rockets on Israeli civilians are no less accountable than the Israeli military for their actions , " he said .
For the past three months a ceasefire between Israel and the militant groups in Gaza has been in place .
It has significantly reduced the number of incidents and the death toll from the conflict there .
Israel maintains a tough economic blockade on the territory , restricting imports and banning nearly all exports .
" It is not too late for an independent , impartial and transparent investigation of the shelling to be held , " Tutu said .
He said those responsible for firing the shells should be held accountable , whether the cause of the incident was a mistake or wilful .
After the incident , Israel 's military said the shelling into Beit Hanoun that day was a mistake and was the result of a " rare and severe failure in the artillery fire - control system " which created " incorrect range - findings " .
It said the shells had been aimed 450 metres away from the edge of town .
No legal action was taken against any officer .
However , it is unclear why the artillery was fired so close to a residential area that morning and why shells continued to be fired after the first one hit the Athamna house .
Tutu also said he recommended that Israel pay adequate compensation to the victims " without delay " .
His report said " reparation " should also be made to the town of Beit Hanoun itself , and suggested a memorial to the victims would also help the survivors .
He suggested a physiotheraphy clinic as one possibility .
The survivors in the family remain bitter and most of the large extended family no longer live in the building .
Since the shelling they have received no financial help , apart from a monthly stipend from the Palestinian Authority of £ 50 for each of the 18 dead .
Aharon Leshno - Yaar , Israel 's ambassador to the UN in Geneva , where the Human Rights Council was meeting , rejected Tutu 's report as " another regrettable product of the Human Rights Council " .
" It is regrettable that this mission took place at all , " he added .
Leshno - Yaar said the report gave de facto legitimacy to Hamas , the Islamist movement that won elections in 2006 and then seized full control of Gaza last year .
" This does not serve the interests of Israel or the Palestinians or the cause of peace , " he said .
Treasury Department unveils changes to Lincoln penny WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
Next year , the penny will be getting not just one new look but four of them , the first changes to the 1 - cent coin in 50 years .
The U.S. Mint unveiled the new designs during a ceremony Monday at the Lincoln Memorial .
The coin changes are part of the government 's commemoration next year of the 200th anniversary of Lincoln 's birth .
Lincoln 's profile will reman on one side of the coin but the Lincoln Memorial will be replaced on the other side by the new images , with a different one being introduced every three months .
The first new design will depict a log cabin , representing the place in Kentucky where Lincoln was born in 1809 .
The second design will feature a young Lincoln taking a break from working as a rail splitter in Indiana by reading a book .
Lincoln as a young lawyer standing in front of the old state capitol building in Springfield , Ill. , will be the design on the third coin .
The final coin in the series will show the half - completed Capitol dome , evoking Lincoln 's famous order that construction of the Capitol should continue during the Civil War as a symbol that the Union would continue .
The first new penny is scheduled to go into circulation starting on Feb.
12 , Lincoln 's birthday , and then every three months after that .
The changing designs mark another effort by the Mint to duplicate the success of the 50 - state quarter program , the most popular coin collecting program in U.S. history .
The nickel also had changing designs to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the Lewis and Clark expedition and the Mint has embarked on an effort to revive interest in a $ 1 coin by introducing four new designs each year honoring a different president .
Under the law that authorized the design changes for the Lincoln penny , after 2009 the " tails " side of the coin will be changed to feature " an image emblematic of President Lincoln 's preservation of the United States as a single and united country . "
That image has not been chosen yet .
Lincoln 's image was added to the penny in 1909 when the nation was celebrating the 100th anniversary of his birth and the Lincoln Memorial was added to the other side of the coin in 1959 to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the 16th president 's birth .

I 've heard concerns from various traders and hedge fund managers over the past few weeks that the Lehamn Brothers ( LEH ) derivatives unwind has been what 's roiling markets .
Early October , Citi ( C ) credit analyst Michael Hampden - Turner estimated there is $ 400bn of Lehman credit derivatives that will be settled on Friday
Hence , some recent fear can now be attributed in part to jumbo losses caused by Lehman 's derivative unwind . . . with JPMorgan ( JPM ) being the biggest potential collateral damage .
JPM has the biggest derivative exposure on the Street ( I have no opinion on how this impacts them or on their derivative exposure ) .
Here is the FT :
" At the moment , participants can't just extinguish credit derivatives contracts with Lehman , they can only offset them .
That , in turn , puts pressure on some participants to buy more credit insurance and the cost of such contracts is rising .
Moreover , many counterparties to Lehman who believe it owes them money have joined the ranks of unsecured creditors .
This increases the number of claimants and reduces the money available to bondholders and other creditors .
The exact amount of any claim is determined by the difference between the value of the collateral and the cost of replacing the contract .
The cost has risen in line with fears about the health of financial institutions and the creditworthiness of counterparties . "
While Fannie and Freddie CDS settled at between 91.5 and 99.9 cents on the dollar . , expectations are for Lehman to settle at 10 cent on the dollar -- causing a few $ 100 billion in losses .
The unwind comes Friday .

Lehman exposes faults in credit default swaps

Banks prepare for CDS pay - outs :
Banks are hoarding cash in expectation of pay - outs on up to $ 400bn of defaulted credit derivatives linked to Lehman Brothers and other institutions , according to analysts and - dealers .
This added pressure on the frozen financial system comes as authorities prepare to meet participants in the so - far unregulated $ 54,000bn credit derivatives market to speed up plans for the creation of a central clearing house .
The Federal Reserve will meet dealers , investors and exchange executives in New York today .
Although big dealers had committed to setting up a central counterparty by the end of the year , urgency has increased in light of the collapse of banks around the world and as company bankruptcies loom .
" The New York Fed will hold a meeting [ today ] with a small number of banks and buyside firms to discuss the progress being made toward the creation of a central counterparty for credit default swaps , " said a Fed official , adding that this would " help reduce systemic risk associated with counterparty credit exposure and improve how the failure of a major participant would be addressed " .
Reuters explains how the process will work :
Twenty - two dealers will participate in the auctions , which will determine how much protection sellers will recover after paying out the insurance .
The timeline for the auctions follows , according to JPMorgan .
9:45 a.m.-10 a.m.
Auction participants will submit bids and offers for the debt backing the credit default swaps , which will be used to determine the initial recovery rate of the swaps .
10:30 a.m. Auction administrators Creditex and Markit will publish the initial recovery price and the open interest for the contracts will be published .
The open interest reflects the amount of bids and offers that have been made , and will show if there are more buyers than sellers , or vice versa .
12:45 p.m. - 1 p.m.
Participating dealers will submit limit orders for the debt on behalf of themselves and their clients to fill the open interest 2 p.m .
The final price of the auction will be published .

As he is often wont to do , Ambrose Evans - Pritchard worries , in dire terms , about the poor prospects for growth and stability ,
It would be easy to dismiss him as histrionic were it not for the fact that some commentators who have been right so far about the progress of the credit crunch , are also hyperventilating .
Witness Nouriel Roubini's latest offering , " The Coming Systemic Bust of the U.S. Banking System : ' Dead Stocks Rallying ' " .
By comparison , Evans - Pritchard is almost cheery .
In truth , this piece is n't Evans - Pritchard 's best work ( he and others have covered parts of this ground before ) , but some observations were nevertheless interesting and likely to elicit reader reactions .
so I 'm providing extracts .
From the Telegraph :
The world 's two biggest financial institutions have had a heart attack .
The global currency system is breaking down .
The policy doctrines that got us into this mess are bankrupt .
No world leader seems able to discern the problem , let alone forge a solution .
The International Monetary Fund has abdicated into schizophrenia .
It has upgraded its 2008 world forecast from 3.7 pc to 4.1 pc growth , whilst warning of a " chance of a global recession " .
Plainly , the IMF cannot or will not offer any useful insights .
Its " mean - reversion " model misses the entire point of this crisis , which is that central banks have pushed debt to fatal levels by holding interest too low for a generation , and now the chickens have come home to roost .
True " mean - reversion " would imply debt deflation on such a scale that would , if abrupt , threaten democracy .
The risk is that these same central banks will commit a fresh error , this time overreacting to the oil spike .
The European Central Bank has raised rates , warning of a 1970s wage - price spiral .
Fixated on the rear - view mirror , it is not looking through the windscreen .
The eurozone is falling into recession before the US itself .
Its level of credit stress is worse , if measured by Euribor or the iTraxx bond indexes .
Core inflation has fallen over the last year from 1.9 pc to 1.8 pc
The US may soon tip into a second leg of this crisis as the fiscal package runs out and Americans lose jobs in earnest .
US bank credit has contracted for three months .
Real US wages fell at almost 10 pc ( annualised ) over May and June .
This is a ferocious squeeze for an economy already in the grip of the property and debt crunch .....
The awful reality is that Washington has its back to the wall .
Fed chief Ben Bernanke thought the US could always get out of trouble by monetary stimulus " à l'outrance " , and letting the dollar slide .
He has learned that the world is a more complicated place .
Oil has queered the pitch .
So has America 's fatal reliance on foreign debt .
The Fannie / Freddie rescue , incidentally , has just lifted the US national debt from German ' AAA ' levels to Italian ' AA -' levels .
China , Russia , petro-powers and other foreign states own $ 985bn of US agency debt , besides holdings of US Treasuries .
Purchases of Fannie / Freddie debt covered a third of the US current account deficit of $ 700 bn over the last year .
Alex Patelis from Merrill Lynch says America faces the risk of a " financing crisis " within months .
Foreigners have a veto over US policy ...
My view is that a dollar crash will be averted as it becomes clearer that contagion has spread worldwide .
But we are now at the point of maximum danger .
Britain , Japan , and the Antipodes are stalling .
Denmark is in recession .
Germany contracted in the second quarter .
May industrial output fell 6 pc in Holland and 5.5 pc in Sweden .
The coalitions in Belgium and Austria have just collapsed .
Germany 's left - right team is fraying ...
This is the healthy part of Europe .
Further south , we are not far away from civic protest .
BNP Paribas has just issued a hurricane alert for Spain ....
China , India , East Europe and emerging Asia have all stolen growth from the future by condoning credit excess .
To varying degrees , they are now being forced to pay back their own " inter - temporal overdrafts " .
If we are lucky , America will start to stabilise before Asia goes down .
Should our leaders mismanage affairs , almost every part of the global system will go down together .
Then we are in trouble .
Someone is pissed they stole his alien movie pitch .
The original V series creator Kenneth Johnson is not very happy with ABC for forcing his alien invasion back onto the telly without his blessing .
The weird part is what he wrote on his website .
On Johnson 's site he writes :
When projects that bore Kenny ’s original creative stamp and control have been taken on by other people , audiences have seen the results : earlier attempts at reviving V , as well as The Incredible Hulk movies and the recently reimagined Bionic Woman all proved to be serious misfires which unfortunately failed with the critics and with the public .
Though ABC is again considering the possibility of developing a TV pilot project , it is a script development deal only and does not in any way affect Kenny ’s ongoing efforts to remake his original classic as a major motion picture .

Sounds like sour grapes , but why the strange use of the third person to talk about himself ?
What I read from this is he 's pissed because his script , V : The Second Generation did n't fit the bill for Hollywood or they decided to go " another direction " entirely .
I understand his pain because he probably spent some amount of time writing it .
But let 's call a spade a spade — V was a ridiculous melodrama ( which I loved ) .
We 're not rewriting Shakespeare here , people .
I say do them all :
The more face - ripping lizard aliens having sex and enslaving our race the better .

; Chapter 5 , entitled “ Returning Functions ” , is where we really start to see the power of functional programming .
It is the types of problems outlined in the chapter where Clojure really shines .
In fact , many of the functions created by Paul Graham in On Lisp are built into Clojure , as I will show below .
; As always , I will post when the code is “ complete ” , but my progress can be followed on Github .
Also , this post is executable , just copy and paste into a Clojure REPL .
; pg. 62
; Clojure does not have a typecase function , but one could be made by writing a macro that expands into something like ( I stress ‘ like ’ as this is not exactly correct ) :
;
( defn joiner [ obj ] ( let [ name ( . (. (. obj getClass ) getGenericSuperclass ) getName ) ] ( cond ( = name " clojure.lang . ASeq " ) cons ( = name " java.lang. Number " ) + ) ) ) ;
; Clojure of courser has a multi-method facility that would provide something similar :
;
( defmulti joiner class ) ( defmethod joiner : default [ obj ] cons ) ( defmethod joiner java.lang .
Number [ obj ] +) ( joiner 2 ) ( joiner ' ( 2 3 4 ) ) ( joiner 3.14159 ) ( joiner [ 1 2 3 ] ) ( joiner " test " ) ;
; Of course it would be nice if we could use type hints for dispatch and simplify the API .
I will not hold my breath for this ( especially since it breaks Clojure ’s current intent for type hints … and my comment on it was ignored : p ) .
;
( defn foo ( [ #^java.lang . Number x ] + ) ( [ x ] cons ) ) ;
; pg. 63
; One of PG ’s famous “ inventions ” is the make - adder function .
He originally presented it as a test for programming language X which is used to determine how such a simple function cannot be easily defined in many ( at the time ) popular languages .
Of course , since Clojure has closures like Lisp , it ’s a no-brainer .
;
( defn make - adder [ n ] ( fn [ x ] (+ x n ) ) ) ( def add3 ( make - adder 3 ) ) ( add3 10 ) ;
; Remember that ( remove - if ) function from chapter 2 ?
We can use Clojure ’s ( complement ) function to build an inverse function from an existing predicate .
;
( defn remove - if [f lst ] ( if ( seq lst ) ; idiomatic ( if ( f ( first lst ) ) ( recur f ( rest lst ) ) ( lazy - cons ( first lst ) ( remove - if f ( rest lst ) ) ) ) nil ) ) ( remove - if ( complement odd ? ) '( 1 2 3 4 5 6 ) ) ;
; pg. 65
; Memoization has gotten a lot of airtime recently as it was a fun game to show how it could be done in language x — that meme seems to have died away .
In short , memoization is the act of defining a function that caches past results of calls to it and returns the cached version if it exists .
This is useful when it does a computationally intense operation and it expects to be called often with similar values .
I was planning on writing a memoization function , but found that the Clojure Contribs library already has one .
;
( defn memoize [ function ] ( let [ cache ( ref {} ) ] ( fn [ & args ] ( or ( @cache args ) ( let [ result ( apply function args ) ] ( dosync ( commute cache assoc args result ) ) result ) ) ) ) ) ( def slowly ( memoize ( fn [ x ] (. Thread sleep 100 ) x ) ) ) ( time ( slowly 1 ) ) ( time ( slowly 1 ) ) ( def mri ( memoize ( remove - if f lst ) ) ) ( time ( mri odd ? ( range 1000 ) ) ) ( time ( mri odd ? ( range 1000 ) ) ) ;;
This may show an more dramatic speed - up ( time ( doall ( mri odd ? ( range 11000 ) ) ) ) ( time ( doall ( mri odd ? ( range 11000 ) ) ) ) ;
; pg. 66
; PG talks next about function composition , that is , defining a function that takes functions f and g ( any number but 2 for illustration ) functions and returns a function that is f ( g ( &args ) ) .
Of course , Clojure provides this in the form of the ( comp ) function :
;
( ( comp first list ) ' a 'b ' c ) ( ( comp first rest list ) ' a ' b ' c ) ;
; I skip over the tree functions ( pgs. 70 - 75 ) built by PG because for the most part they are either included or trivial using Clojure ’s Zipper API .
Maybe I will come back one day and do this should I need them in later chapters .
But for now , good day .

As a result of several complaints against Trooper Wooten , he was suspended from the state police force for five days .
However , Mr. Branchflower ’s report found numerous instances in which Ms. Palin , her husband and her subordinates tried to press for harsher punishment , even though Mr. Monegan and others told them they had gone as far as the law and civil service rules would allow .
Ms. Palin has denied that anyone told Mr. Monegan to dismiss Trooper Wooten , or that the commissioner ’s ouster had anything to do with the trooper , who remains on the force .
Mr. Monegan has said that he believes he lost his job because he would not bend to pressure to dismiss Trooper Wooten .
On July 28 , the Legislative Council , a bipartisan body of House and Senate members that can convene to make decisions when the Legislature is not in session , approved an independent investigation into whether the governor abused the powers of her office to pursue a personal vendetta .
Mr. Monegan said in an interview Friday night that he felt relieved .
“ I feel that my beliefs and opinions that Wooten was a significant factor , if not the factor , in my termination have been validated , ” Mr. Monegan said , adding , “ I was resisting the governor from the very beginning on the Wooten matter to protect her from exactly what just happened to her here , being found to have acted inappropriately . ”
The report was released after Alaska lawmakers emerged from a private session in Anchorage where they spent more than of six hours discussing the ethics report and what portions should be made public .
The legislative council ended up voting unanimously to make part of the overall report public .
At a news conference Friday evening , a local McCain - Palin campaign spokeswoman , Meghan Stapleton , said that Mr. Branchflower ’s abuse of power finding was the result of an “ overreach ” by the investigator who went beyond “ the intent of the original ” inquiry .
The biggest money give - away to the richest people in the world is a done deal .

But House Republicans are balking on several issues , Frank said , though he added that he was n't sure what their objections were .
Spintronics Effect May Lead to Energy - Efficient Magnetic Batteries
October 10th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Japanese researchers have discovered that electrons will rearrange themselves according to their spins if one side of a magnetized nickel - iron rod is heated up .
This “ spin-Seebeck ” effect could give way to magnetic batteries that will be useful in the development of spintronics devices .
Such devices use magnetic currents to reduce overheating in computer chips .
The “ spin-Seebeck ” effect is named after the original Seebeck effect , which was discovered in the 1800s .
According to the Seebeck effect , heating one side of a conducting rod causes electrons to move towards the cooler end of the rod , ultimately leading to a voltage .
The new effect is similar , but affects electron spin .
And the “ spin-Seebeck ” effect is n’t just an interesting discovery — it could lead to more efficient computers .
Magnetic information storage is much more energy efficient than electronic information storage since magnetic currents do n’t generate waste heat ( unlike electric currents ) .
That means magnets may one day allow computer chips to become even smaller , faster , and less energy - intensive .

I 've been working a lot with Google App Engine in the past few months .
I still maintain , as I reiterated recently in my Boagworld interview with Paul , that it 's a great idea and has great potential .
And the Google App Engine team has been wonderful in working with me and helping me out .
Unfortunately , there are a couple of fundamental issues that must be addressed , and addressed properly , before Google App Engine can be taken seriously as a web application platform .
( And no , Java support is most definitely not one of them . )
Rather than writing a lengthy diatribe , I am going to succinctly list the main showstoppers that Google needs to fix to make Google App Engine work :
1MB limit on data structures
Although this is hinted at in various bits of the documentation , it is not stated plainly anywhere so let me state it for the record :
Google App Engine does not support any data structure that is larger than 1MB in size .
This includes files .
So you can't host that 1.2MB PDF you want to offer for download as part of your site .
The limit affects blobs , text , and any other fields in the datastore , as well as variables in Python ( so you cannot get around the limitation by breaking things up into smaller pieces in the datastore and stitching them together later in code ) .
The only way to get around this limit is to stitch the data structure together on the client by making several Ajax calls .
The number of use cases where this is useful , of course , is severely limited .
Among other things , the 1MB limit on data structures makes it nigh on impossible to run reports and makes having an administrative shell on the deployment environment pretty much useless as serialized results of queries with hundreds of items will quickly hit the limit .
1,000 item limit on query offsets
The datastore has always had a 1,000 item limit on query results .
I do n't have a problem with this .
However , they recently also introduced a 1,000 item limit on offsets .
This means that you can at most get the 2,000th entity for a given kind .
Again this is n't documented anywhere .
Unless you have been keeping a sortable field ( like a numeric index that you were manually saving ) in your datastore , this new limitation effectively locks you out of your data beyond the 2,000th item for each kind .
The fact that such a radical change was introduced without any forewarning or even an announcement is , in and of itself , troubling .
Currently , the only way to get around this limitation is to make sure that you have a sortable field that you can limit your queries on .
I would highly recommend saving a numeric key for every entity .
This does mean , however , that you will be doing two datastore writes for every entity ( once to save the record and get its numeric id , and another to write the numeric id into a separate field that you can sort on ) .
This is both more cumbersome and will no doubt raise the risk of your running into another Google App Engine limit :
The short - term high CPU quota .
( From what I 've heard , the Google team is working on adding sortable keys in a future update . )
The short - term high CPU quota
Not only are your calls limited to returning in 10 seconds but if you actually try to do anything too stressful within those calls , you will quickly hit the short - term high CPU quota limit .
Thankfully , Google has raised this limit ( and the other limits ) for my app but plain vanilla apps are not as lucky .
In my tests , I 've found that the high CPU limit can be randomly triggered even in calls that return within a second .
To tell you the truth , I do n't actually know what causes these .
I memcache nearly everything and try my hardest not to stress the system out and yet I routinely see the high CPU warnings in my logs for even the most mundane calls .
( I 've also seen strange high CPU errors in my logs informing me that I am 1.0 x above the high CPU limit which makes no sense at all . )
The short - term high CPU quotas must be removed .
Not only that but Google must review how it handles quotas in general .
Quotas in general
When was the last time you saw an " over quota " error on one of your favorite web applications ?
Google 's handing of quotas is a major step backwards to the days of Geocities and " this user has used too much bandwidth " errors .
Probably acceptable if you 're hosting pictures of Little Timmy and Sally Jo's Summer Camp Adventure on Geocities , not so acceptable if you 're hosting your next big web app on what you thought was Google 's infinitely - scalable Cloud solution .
Simply put , they could n't have come up with a worse PR campaign for Google App Engine if they had hired Steve Ballmer to handle the job .
Think about it :
You build an awesome new app on Google App Engine .
You tell your friends .
They tell 1,000 of their friends on Twitter who tell 1,000 of their friends and then , suddenly , you have all these developers hitting Google App Engine for the first time to see your app .
Paradoxically , by doing that , they trigger the " intelligent throttling " " feature " in Google App Engine which freaks out and shuts down your app with an " Over Quota " error -- effectively making the " Over Quota " message the first impression most of your audience has of Google App Engine .
Not good .
Especially not good when your unique selling point is that your system can scale .
We do n't care that it can scale .
We care that it does scale .
And that it scales when you need it the most .
But that 's not the worst bit .
Admin ?
What 's that ?
Currently Google App
Engine does only one half of what a web application needs ( and does that only half well ) .
As it stands today , Google App Engine is a highly scalable request / response system that is tuned to handle lots of tiny calls .
A typical web application , however , needs more than that .
While concentrating on making applications scalable , Google App Engine entirely ignores a crucial use case of any web application : administration .
The administrative features of your web application may not be consumer - facing but they are just as important .
They may include features for running reports or mailing all of your users .
Key , essential tasks for any modern web application .
With Google App Engine today , if you have more than a couple of thousand members / records in your datastore , you can forget about running any sort of admin task .
A total lack of long running processes , coupled with the 1MB limit on data structures and the 1,000 limit on query offsets means that you cannot run reports or backups .
( Not that there is a data backup system currently available for Google App Engine -- I have one that I wrote myself which used to work but is currently crippled due to the 1,000 item limit on offsets . )
Similarly , unless you knew to plan ahead and create a sortable key to query on , you will find yourself locked out reaching certain records in your datastore ( for example , not being able to email all of your members ) .
These are core showstoppers for anyone considering building a real - world application on Google App Engine and I can only hope that they are at the top of the engineering team 's list of new features .
25 % ready for prime - time
As things stand , Google App Engine is about 25 % ready for prime time .
Once quotas are handled properly and the 1MB limit removed , it will be about 50 % ready .
The other 50 % has nothing to do with scalability and everything to do with everything else that a typical web application needs .
Specifically , long running processes and the ability to run reports , aggregate data , and perform operations on large data sets .
In effect , Google App Engine is entirely missing a separate mode of operation and this glaring omission must be addressed before Google App Engine can be deemed a serious web application platform .
Priorities and showstoppers
I really hope that Google is not working on adding support for other languages to Google App Engine , as they mentioned that they were at the Google Developer Day in London , when there are such fundamentally crippling issues with the platform that must be addressed first .
Adding support for other languages to Google App Engine today is like sewing a new set of drapes for a house that does n't have any walls yet .
In summary , before Google App Engine can be used for real web applications , the following issues have to be addressed :
1MB limit on data structures must be removed .
Quotas must be handled optimistically , without crippling applications at the very moment that they should be benefitting from The Cloud .
The " intelligent throttling " " feature " and short - term CPU quotas must be removed .
The 1,000 item limit for offsets in queries must be removed .
Support for long - running processes must be added .
It may just be that Google has to implement two modes of operation for each application on Google App Engine : one that is request / response - only and scales ( i.e. , basically what we have today , with better quota handling ) and a separate admin mode that has long - running processes and is n't crippled by data structure size limits and short - term high CPU quotas .
As things stand today , running a real - world application on Google App Engine is a complete nightmare because the system completely ignores the essential administration - related use cases for web applications that we take for granted on other platforms .
Update : Several people have brought it to my attention that I forgot to mention another major showstopper for most applications , which is the lack of SSL .
I ran into this early on , did my research , and found that PayPal was the only viable e-commerce solution at the time if your application needs to receive notification callbacks on purchases ( ironically , Google Checkout requires SSL for its notifications API ) .
Database of 18 million immigrants to UK since 1878 goes online ... including ancestors of Lewis Hamilton and Theo Walcott
The arrival in Britain of millions of people , including the relatives of several famous names , is recorded in a database which goes live today .
Family histories in Ancestry .co.uk include those of Arsenal and England footballer Theo Walcott , F1 racing driver Lewis Hamilton and Labour MP Diane Abbott .
The UK Incoming Passenger Lists 1878 - 1960 details the arrival of more than 18 million people , many from countries that were once part of the British Empire .
They included the ' Windrush Generation ' of immigrants from the West Indies .
The family histories of British Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton ( left ) and Arsenal and England footballer Theo Walcott can be viewed on Ancestry.co.uk
Digitised in partnership with The National Archives , the list contains records of travellers who arrived in Britain in the age before commercial flights became commonplace .
The records show that : Davidson Hamilton , grandfather of Lewis Hamilton , migrated from Grenada , arriving in Southampton in 1960 on the Ascania .
Wendell Walcott , grandfather to Theo , born in Jamaica , arrived in 1949 at Avonmouth on his way to Weston - Super - Mare as part of his RAF service .
Julia McIymont , mother to Diane Abbott , the first black woman MP , sailed into Bristol from Jamaica in 1950 on the SS Ariguani .
Arthur Wharton , the first black professional football player in the world , who played for Rotherham Town , arrived from Jamaica in 1882 .
The listings include Labour MP Diane Abbott 's mother Julia McIymont , who arrived in Bristol from Jamaica in 1950 and Winston Churchill returning from the US
The listings also contain the arrival of Winston Churchill , then prime minister , returning to Southampton from the US in 1953 and other stars including Gloria Swanson , Noel Coward , Dorothy Parker and Norman Mailer .
But Ancestry.co.uk says the database will be of most use helping ordinary Britons fill in the gaps in their own family stories .
Just a day after the Federal Reserve dropped its key short - term interest rate to 1 % -- matching the generational low reached in 2003 - 04 -- the betting is intensifying on another cut .
Trading in futures contracts on the federal funds rate , the Fed ’s benchmark , implies a 51.4 % probability that the central bank will slash the rate to 0.50 % on or before its next meeting on Dec. 16 , according to Bloomberg News data .
On Wednesday , the probability of a cut to 0.50 % was 32 % .
At a minimum , the futures market expects the Fed to take its rate down to 0.75 % on Dec. 16 .
Rate expectations may be cueing off the government ’s report today that the economy shrank at an annualized rate of 0.3 % in the third quarter .
Although analysts figured the economy had contracted in the period , the details were ugly -- particularly the 3.1 % decline in real consumer spending , the biggest drop since the vicious recession that began in 1980 .
There are psychological reasons why the Fed would prefer not to cut its rate below 1 % .
The closer the Fed gets to zero , the more likely that investors will worry the U.S. economy is facing a long period of misery on par with what Japan faced after its real estate markets crashed in the early 1990s .
The Bank of Japan had to maintain its benchmark interest rate at or near zero for most of the 1999 - 2006 period , before policymakers finally felt comfortable that the economy was in a sustainable recovery .
The wording of the Fed ’s statement on Wednesday suggested that " they may [ cut ] again if necessary , but are probably hoping that they will not have to take the zero-option on rates , " said Christopher Rupkey , economist at Bank of Tokyo - Mitsubishi in New York .
Others see more cuts as inevitable .
" I think the Fed is going lower , " said Tom Higgins , chief economist at investment firm Payden & Rygel in L.A .
" Zero is the floor . "
Given the severity of the credit crunch and what that has wrought in the economy , he said , the Fed ’s attitude can only be , " Why not throw everything at it ? "

So Ubuntu is taking a little heat for not being the world 's largest contributor to the Linux kernel.org community .
BUT they are about to finally join a major effort to improve Linux kernel quality for all .
Ubuntu is on the verge of fully participating in the Kernel Oops project run by Intel 's Arjan van de Ven ( i've interviewed him before , great guy and an awesome project ) .
Kernel Oops is an incredibly valuable effort that tracks ' oopses ' on Linux and provides information so kernel developers can fix bugs .
So far Kernel oops has been part of the default installation on Red Hat 's Fedora and is available to Novell OpenSUSE users as well .. it soon may beavailable by default to Ubuntu users too .
Ubuntu / Canonical CTO
Matt Zimmerman noted in a blog post that he has done some work on integrating kerneloops .
" The result is that kernel oopses can be captured as Apport problem reports with full detail , and semi-automatically filed as bugs , in addition to being counted on kerneloops.org 's statistics , " Zimmerman wrote . " I 've put an initial version into Ubuntu and sent the patch to Arjan for merging upstream , and we 're exploring the addition of kerneloops to our default installation to provide testing feedback to kernel developers from our users . "
' What will be very interesting to see in say 6 months time , is how many reports Ubuntu users submit to Kernel Oops vs other distros .
I wonder if the reports will be any different ( are Ubuntu users using different configs ? ) and the value that those reports provide .
Without a doubt , more information is better and we should all commend Zimmerman for his efforts in trying to get Kernel Oops into Ubuntu as it will inevitably lead to a better Linux experience for all .
Think for a moment , if you wanted to make the maximum impact in greening one product area , what would it be ?
Cars may come to mind first , but that requires a significant commitment and investment by the buyer .
While it can and will make a positive impact , there ’s an area that ’s much more ubiquitous and may not even register on the radar for some – office supplies .
Think about how much you use .
Think about how much a company of 50 uses .
500 .
To use supplies that are less impactful , or perhaps even eliminating the damage they typically do , has enormous potential .
It ’s this thinking that led Gil Yaron , once a lawyer focused on shareholder activism and socially responsible investing to create Vancouver based FrogFile in 2006 .
In his work leading up to this , he saw that many companies were interested in greening their office operations , but they did n’t quite know how or where to do that .
Then once they did know what they wanted to do , there was n’t a place to get what they needed .
FrogFile seeks to be a remedy for this quandary .
And yet , you might say , green office supplies seem to be everywhere these days , both online and in office supply stores large and small .
What does FrogFile contribute , and how do they stand out from this growing chorus ?
First , their aim is to serve the broader public , beyond the already there green people .
Their mission is no less than creating a fundamental change in the marketplace .
In order to do this , you need to meet all of people ’s product needs , and do it at a price that wo n’t make them flinch .
How do they do this ?
As Yaron said to me , “ Green is n’t a niche for us , it ’s our business . ”
With that in mind , they order large quantities or all their catalog offerings , getting competitive prices , and do n’t choose to charge a premium on them , as other stores may presume the market will bear .
It ’s that kind of thinking by most that , in my opinion , has held back quicker , broader adoption by businesses .
They may have a lot to offer , but being smaller sized then the big boxers of the world , they are able to carry leading edge products like this well thought out recycled soda bottle fabric based vertical messenger bag from Act2GreenSmart .
Also , every single product on their site is vetted for being truly green .
Non petro based but shipped from far away ?
Probably wo n’t show up in their catalog .
Yes there ’s lots of greenish products at stores , but without taking the time to dig deeper , you may not know it ’s missing the mark .
At Frogfile , they ’ve done the heavy green lifting for you , and will not compromise .
Yaron sees FrogFile as an experiment , more about a conversation about creating change then about selling product .
And this experiment seems to be paying off , as sales have increased 400 % from July 2007 to July 2008 , and increasingly large companies are inquiring about FrogFile ’s offerings .
Currently a Canadian focused business , they will be making their way into the US , starting in the northwest .
Stay tuned …

McCain adultery story rocks political world — oh wait , no it does n’t
The Los Angeles Times did some solid investigative reporting and published a very damaging item yesterday on John McCain ’s personal background , which is of course a key part of his campaign .
We learned that McCain turned his back on his wife after she was seriously injured in a car accident , committed adultery , and left the mother of his children when he found a younger , wealthier woman .
Worse , we also learned that McCain did n’t tell the truth about this in his own memoir .
McCain insisted that he was separated from his first wife before he began dating his second wife .
That ’s not true .
McCain also insisted he ’d been divorced for months before remarrying .
That was n’t true , either .
( In fact , the LAT reported , “ McCain obtained an Arizona marriage license on March 6 , 1980 , while still legally married to his first wife . ” )
Clearly , this is the kind of salacious story reporters just love .
A presidential candidate , running on his personal background , is found to have a messy past .
The story has sex , drama , and fairly obvious lies — everything a news outlet needs for wall - to - wall coverage .
What does this tell us about McCain ’s character ?
Will voters care about a conservative Republican ’s adultery ?
What will the “ family - values ” crowd say ?
How do we reconcile McCain ’s untruths with his alleged proclivity for “ straight talk ” ?
Will the revelations hurt McCain in the polls ?
It ’s the kind of story the media can obsess over for months .
So , let ’s take a moment to step back , and analyze the media frenzy we ’ve seen over the last 24 hours , as the political world comes to grips with McCain ’s controversial personal life and his willingness to be less than truthful about it :
( picture tumble weeds rolling by )
Nada .
Mark Halperin quickly featured the LAT story yesterday morning , but removed it soon after .
Campaign reporters did n’t ask McCain about it at all yesterday ( ironically , McCain was emphasizing his concern for women yesterday , so it might have been apropos ) .
A couple of mid-size papers republished the LAT article , with an emphasis on McCain ’s relationship with the Reagans .
The networks did n’t touch the story .
The major dailies ignored it altogether ( the NYT ’s Nicholas Kristof mentioned it on his blog , but there was nothing in the actual newspaper ) .
This may be an awkward subject for reporters — McCain did , after all , give them barbecue — but it is a legitimate news story .
First , as far as the media was concerned when Bill Clinton was running for president , adultery counted as a character issue .
Maybe reporters got burned out on the subject , but it creates a glaring double standard — a Democrat guilty of infidelity is a major news story ; a Republican guilty of infidelity deserves a pass .
Second , even if news outlets decided McCain ’s character issues are too old to deserve attention , there ’s the issue of McCain ’s memoir , which clearly includes stories about his marriages that are n’t true .
Obama ’s books were scrutinized in great detail , and news outlets highlighted minor inconsistencies .
McCain , meanwhile , lied about cheating on his wife .
What constitutes major news lately ?
Wesley Clark , who has a tangential connection to Obama and supported his primary opponent , accurately questioned McCain ’s presidential qualifications .
Jesse Jackson , who hardly has any connection to Obama at all , whispers to a friend , off the record , about his dissatisfaction with Obama ’s message to the African - American community .
These were huge stories that generated excessive coverage .
McCain lies about the circumstances of his marriages ?
Nothing .
No interest whatsoever .
I ’d ask reporters to consider one simple question .
If investigative reporters at the LA Times had discovered that Barack Obama had been divorced , cheated on his first wife , left her after she was injured in a car accident , pursued a younger woman while still married , and then lied about the circumstances of his marriages in his memoir , does anyone seriously believe that news outlets would blow off the story completely ?
Or is it more likely we would never hear the end of this ?
The next time someone suggests the media is covering the candidates even - handedly , keep this story in mind .
It turns out that John McCain was the keynote speaker at a March 2006 conference sponsored by ACORN on Immigration Reform .
Consider yourself zinged :
Bertha Lewis , Acorn ’s chief organizer , said in a statement that came with the photo , “ It has deeply saddened us to see Senator McCain abandon his historic support for ACORN and our efforts to support the goals of low - income Americans . ”
” We are sure that the extremists he is trying to get into a froth will be even more excited to learn that John McCain stood shoulder to shoulder with ACORN , at an ACORN co-sponsored event , to promote immigration reform , ” she said .
America 's 1st Reaction -- Friday 's McCain - Obama Debate Should Still Be Held On Friday , But Perhaps with New Focus : Immediately after John McCain 's announcement at 3 pm ET today , Wednesday 09/24/08 , that he was suspending his campaign and seeking to postpone Friday 's scheduled presidential debate , SurveyUSA interviewed 1,000 adults nationwide .
Key findings : A majority of Americans say the debate should be held on Friday .
Just 10 % say the debate should be postponed .
A sizable percentage of Americans , 36 % , think the focus of the debate should be modified to focus more on the economy .
3 of 4 Americans say the presidential campaigns should continue .
Just 14 % say the presidential campaigns should be suspended .
If Friday 's debate does not take place , 46 % of Americans say that would be bad for America .
" White skin notwithstanding , this is our first black president .
Blacker than any actual black person who could ever be elected in our children 's lifetime .
After all , he displays almost every trope of blackness : single - parent household , born poor , working - class , saxophone - playing , McDonald 's - and - junk - food - loving boy from Arkansas . "
With these words in the New Yorker in 1998 , Toni Morrison granted our 42nd president , William Jefferson Clinton , a kind of cadet membership in the grand cultural narrative of black America .
While her intent was never to make him out as a role model , her essay nevertheless reflected how implausible , how impossibly distant the idea of an African American occupant in the Oval Office seemed at the time .
Morrison could n't have known that , exactly a decade later , her assertion would be given the lie :
We now face the very real prospect in Barack Obama of an " actual black person " being elected president — though one whose own cultural narrative is so unique and complicated that some would argue it has as many contrasts as commonalities with that of the average black American .
In fact , reading Obama 's absorbing 1995 memoir " Dreams from My Father , " it strikes me that the tropes that surround and define Obama can just as easily be read as those of another community entirely .
Which raises the question : Could it be that our true first black president might also be our first Asian American president ?
Fitting the curve
He was born and raised in Hawaii , the only majority - Asian state in the union ; he spent four formative years in Jakarta , the home of his Indonesian stepfather Lolo Soetoro , where he attended local schools and learned passable Bahasa Indonesia .
The family with whom he 's closest — half - sister Maya Soetoro - Ng and her Chinese Canadian husband , Konrad Ng — are Asian American .
So , too , are the most senior members of his congressional team — his Senate chief of staff Pete Rouse , whose mother is Japanese American , and his legislative director Chris Lu , whose parents hail from China .
Evidence for Obama 's affinity with the Asian American experience runs true even as one delves deeper into his history .
" A lot of aspects of the senator 's story will be recognizable to many Asian Americans , " says Lu , a Harvard Law School classmate of the senator 's who joined the team in 2005 .
" He talks about feeling like somewhat of an outsider ; about coming to terms with his self - identity ; about figuring out how to reconcile the values from his unique heritage with those of larger U.S. society .
These are tensions and conflicts that play out in the lives of all children of immigrants . "
And how he talks about those tensions could be rote recital from the Asian American literary canon .
With minor search - and - replace , much of the first half of " Dreams " could have been excerpted from an Asian American coming - of - age work , like Gus Lee 's " China Boy , " Gene Yang 's " American Born Chinese , " or Michael Kang 's " The Motel . "
For instance , Obama recalls how , on his first day at school in Hawaii , his well - intentioned teacher made a point of complimenting him on his beautiful , alien name , waxing on about the fantastical magnificence of Kenya , and asking " what tribe " his father was from — thereby condemning young Barack ( classmate : " I thought your name was Barry ! " ) to the status of outsider , foreigner , weirdo .
" I heard titters break across the room , " writes Obama .
" I spent the rest of the day in a daze ...
The novelty of having me in the class quickly wore off for the other kids , although my sense that I did n't belong continued to grow ...
Most of my classmates had been together since kindergarten ; they lived in the same neighborhoods , in split - level homes with swimming pools ; their fathers coached the same Little League teams ; their mothers sponsored the bake sales .
Nobody played soccer or badminton or chess , and I had no idea how to throw a football in a spiral or balance on a skateboard . "
And he talks about how , as he grew older , he began to realize that his pervasive sense of difference extended beyond the mere purgatory of elementary school .
" TV , movies , the radio ...
Pop culture was color - coded , after all , " he writes .
" I began to notice that Cosby never got the girl on ' I Spy , ' that the black man on ' Mission : Impossible ' spent all his time underground .
I noticed that there was nobody like me in the Sears , Roebuck Christmas catalog ... and that Santa was a white man . "
By the time Obama talks about his remote father 's outsized academic expectations for him ( " Have I told you that your brothers and sister have also excelled in their schooling ?
It 's in the blood , I think " ; " Barry , you do not work as hard as you should ...
If the boy has done his work for tomorrow , he can begin on his next day 's assignments .
Or the assignments he will have when he returns from the holidays " ) and about his overprotective mother 's use of guilt as leverage ( " A healthy dose of guilt never hurt anybody , " she tells him , " It 's what civilization was built on , guilt .
A highly underrated emotion " ) the Asian American reader 's feelings of deja vu will have slipped from amusing to uncanny .
Translating identity
But even if Obama 's personal narrative reads like it was written to an Asian American template , why should that matter ?
The fact is , understanding this dimension of his makeup offers critical insights to how his outlook and political sensibilities were forged , even providing explanation for some of his more controversial positions , such as his charge to black America about the crises of disengaged parenting and broken families .
" The senator often talks about the importance of education , the value of hard work , and the need for a sense of personal responsibility , " says Chris Lu .
" That resonates with a lot of Asian Americans , who feel they 've pulled themselves up by their bootstraps , and understand the notion that what we accomplish in life is in large part a measure of who we are as people , and how hard we strive . "
To some African American leaders , notably the Rev. Jesse Jackson , Obama 's continued reminders of the duty of parents to their children and citizens to their society sound elitist and patronizing .
To Asian Americans , they sound ... well , they sound familiar .
They 're at the core of the ethical foundation many of us have inherited , that fusion of post - Confucian philosophy and immigrant ethos the media often calls " Asian values . "
Aspiration tempered with pragmatism .
Strenuous effort and rigorous accountability as the bedrock of success .
Moderation in all things , humility in times of triumph , patience in periods of tribulation .
This is a point often missed by those who have assessed Obama at face value , seeing in him a fiery street preacher or a bright - eyed idealist , an iconoclast or an ideologue , and expressed disillusionment with what they see as " triangulation " or " pandering " in some of his recent positions .
The people who know him best say that the senator is nothing if not consistent — that throughout his career and campaign he has stayed true , if you will , to his Asian American roots .
The coat of many colors
Calling Obama the first Asian American president does n't obscure or invalidate his other identities — black , white , multiracial , transnational , pancultural .
If anything , it simply highlights the fact that his diverse heritage uniquely invites those around him to project on him a full spectrum of hopes and dreams .
" He 's basically a human Rorschach test , " says Lu. " African Americans think , and rightfully so , that this is a guy who understands their experience .
But it 's similar if you talk to Latinos and Asian Americans , or to our 22 - year - old field organizers .
People see in him the qualities they want to see . "
The important thing to note is that this is n't a case of " either / or , " but " and . "
Perhaps the way to read Obama was best pointed out by another black man of mixed heritage , another pioneer whose arrival on a heretofore lily - white landscape shook the firmament .
If we are all Tiger Woods , there 's no reason we can't all be Barack Obama .
We are the world 's foremost Cablinasian nation , and in an increasingly flat and unbounded global landscape , this is not a weakness , but our greatest competitive strength .
" It 's amusing watching people come up with these caricatures suggesting he 's not American , " notes Lu . " He 's not only American , his story is the quintessential American story .
It 's the story that our nation is all about . "
The prompt for writing this piece , which I 've been musing on for a while , was my recent attendance at the UNITY Journalists of Color convention in Chicago .
Given the event and location , it was n't entirely unexpected that Barack Obama was scheduled to speak at the conference ; similarly , it was n't entirely unexpected that a similar invitation extended to John McCain was rejected .
Obama was speaking on home turf , to an audience of familiar faces .
McCain would have been out of his element and almost certain to face tough questions about immigration , affirmative action , gay adoption , even his past use of the term " gook . "
So , Obama appeared on his own , in a brief , CNN - simulcast interview by CNN correspondent Suzanne Malveaux and Time magazine world editor Romesh Ratnesar .
The organizers of the convention went to great pains to ask attendees to demonstrate " professional decorum " by resisting the urge to treat Obama with anything but polite respect ; unsurprisingly , coverage of his talk focused more on the audience and its reaction than on the substance of his remarks .
In fact , Obama did get a brief standing ovation — though far less sustained and extreme than the White House Correspondents Association regularly grants the President and other key subjects of their coverage each year .
Which brings up the question of double standards .
Did journalistic standards demand that attendees sit stoicly in their seats ?
Was a slap on the wrist warranted for those moved to clap on their feet ?
The question rests on the notion that being moved by a person 's remarks — or grateful for his presence — at a single event is a sign of a conspiracy to compromise basic fairness in reporting .
That seems bogus — even offensive .
If the abundantly collegial nature of " mainstream " events like the WHCA gala is given a free pass , focusing on UNITY 's reaction to Obama is a blanket assertion that minority journalists are less mature , less conscientious , less dedicated to their craft than their white counterparts .
It 's particularly ridiculous when one considers that journalists of color make up a tiny fraction of the political press corps — people who would actually be covering the campaign .
And the ones who are covering it know they 're under a microscope , and thus they 're likely to be even more self - aware and restrained in their work than their colleagues .
Finally , as far as balance is concerned , no one seems to have written a line about the fact that McCain refused to attend , despite being a few states away in Ohio at the time ( while Obama , meanwhile , flew overnight from Europe to make it to the event ) .
McCain has made his willingness to face tough issues and buck expectations a core part of his political persona .
Even if he saw UNITY as hostile territory , well , it would have been a mark of courage — and possibly a way of redirecting attention away from Obama 's barnstorming world tour — had he attended ; it would also have emphasized his desire to truly be a president for all Americans .
But , like the WHCA , he faced nary a question .
Does the burden of proof in these cases rest solely on the shoulders of people of color ?

US action along the Pakistan border has raised tensions The United States military says US and Afghan forces have exchanged gunfire with Pakistani troops across the border with Afghanistan .
A senior US military official says a five - minute skirmish broke out after Pakistani soldiers fired warning shots near two US helicopters .
No one was hurt in the incidents and the US maintains its troops did not cross the border from Afghanistan .
Cross - border action by US - led forces has angered Pakistan in recent weeks .
The latest incident took place along the Pakistani border with the eastern Afghan region of Khost , an area which is a hotbed of militant groups .
Forces from the US - led coalition and the Nato - led International Security Assistance Force ( Isaf ) patrol the frontier , but Pakistan has been angered by reported US operations across the border in pursuit of insurgents .
A BBC correspondent says the border between the two countries is very unclear and in effect is marked by a 3 km - 4 km ( 2 - 2.5 mile ) stretch of no - man 's land .
Escorting troops Nato said the helicopters - which belong to its Isaf mission - came under fire from a Pakistani checkpoint .
A US Central Command spokesman , Rear Admiral Greg Smith , said Pakistani soldiers at the checkpoint were observed firing on two US OH - 58 Kiowa helicopters that had been covering a patrol of Afghan and US troops about a mile ( 1.6 km ) inside Afghanistan .
" The ground forces then fired into the hillside nearby that checkpoint , gained their attention , which worked , " he said .
" Unfortunately , though , the [ Pakistani ] unit decided to shoot down a hillside at our ground forces .
Our ground forces returned fire . "
However , the Pakistani military gave a different account .
In a statement , commanders said troops fired warning shots at the helicopters when they strayed over the Pakistan border .
" When the helicopters passed over our border post and were well within Pakistani territory , our own security forces fired anticipatory warning shots , " a statement said .
" On this , the helicopters returned fire and flew back . "
In New York , Pakistan 's new president gave another version of events when he said that Pakistan forces had fired " flares " to warn the helicopters they were near the border .
Later , in an address to the UN General Assembly , President Asif Ali Zardari referred to the cross - border tension when he said that his country could not allow its territory to " be violated by our friends " .
An Isaf spokesman said he believed the incident was a misunderstanding , but he was certain the helicopters had been operating on the Afghan side of the border .
The BBC's Syed Shoaib Hasan , in Islamabad , says that the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan is very unclear .
BORDER TENSIONS 3 Sept : First reported ground assault by US troops in Pakistan - Islamabad responds furiously 15 Sept : Pakistani troops reportedly fire in air to stop US troops crossing in S Waziristan 17 Sept : Top US military chief Adm Mike Mullen visits Pakistan to calm tensions 16 Sept : Pakistan says it was not told of fresh US missile strike 22 Sept : Pakistani troops in fresh firing to deter US incursion into N Waziristan , officials say 25 Sept : Pakistani troops fire warning shots at Nato helicopters on border with Khost
The Afghan - Pakistan militant nexus US attacks raise stakes in Pakistan
There is an imaginary border called the Durand line which each side marks differently .
Pakistan says that the area of no -man 's land along the border is its territory and Afghanistan makes similar claims .
Tension between Washington and Islamabad has risen since 3 September , when the US conducted a ground assault in Pakistani territory , its first , targeting what it said was a militant target in the tribal region of South Waziristan .
Pakistan reacted angrily to the action , saying 20 innocent villagers had been killed by US troops .
Local officials have said that on two occasions since then Pakistani troops or tribesmen have opened fire to stop US forces crossing the border .
The claims were not officially confirmed .
On Wednesday , a drone believed to be operated by the CIA crashed inside Pakistan .
The US and Nato have called on Pakistan to do more to curb militants operating in the border area .

What are these ?
Well Neil was the son of a president who owned an S & L that cost us close to a billion $ to bail out in the S & L scandal .... part of what ' Ace " McCain got in trouble for with the Keating 5 .
But ... Now McCain 's son Andrew was on the board of Silver State bank that recently was taken over by the FDIC to the tune $ 500 million .
Get this Andrew was in charge of the Audit committee .
You know .. the guy responsible to ensuring the bank complied with the regulations !!!
So looks like the acorn does not fall far from the tree !!!
The motto of Silver State Bank :
" When the casinos treat you poorly , let Silver State treat you like a valued customer , "
If you can't tell from the picture , these are knock - off Star Wars jimmy jackets , cleverly named Star Condoms .
Apparently they were purchased somewhere in Asia and , HELLO , I 'm wearing one .
" A long time ago in a galaxy for , for away ... "
Awesome .
Just a heads up though : do n't buy condoms with misspellings on the box , it indicates poor quality control .
Seriously , the one I 'm wearing does n't even have a tip .
Hmm , I hope I do n't catch anything from this keyboard .

American foreign policy is corrupted by a powerful influence so arrogantly reckless it endangers the human race .
This influence is n’t Big Oil or Zionism , which are merely tools of the real power .
The real power that controls US foreign policy is Big Money — the central banking institution known as the Federal Reserve System .
The ultimate in corporate welfare , the Fed is a government - supported banking cartel which creates trillions of dollars from mere bookkeeping entries .
The $ 123 billion in Big Oil profits last year is trivial in comparison .
In political clout , Big Money is the driver and Big Oil is only along for the ride .
Likewise , Israel is also but a passenger .
True , US foreign policy is dominated by neoconservative ideologues , but the neocons are politically powerful because of their lobbies , and their lobbies get their money from financiers who get their money from investment bankers who get their money from the central bankers of the Federal Reserve .
The neocons may sincerely believe in their own agenda but they have power only because the central bankers need them to feign a patriotic / nationalistic smokescreen so that citizens will sacrifice and soldiers will die for a foreign policy whose real purpose is to enrich the central bankers .
No wonder the neocon narrative has plot holes .
For example , if the neocons favor democracy , why support Saudi Arabia , the most repressive regime in the Middle East ?
Why attack Iraq , which had no connection with terrorists and no weapons of mass destruction , and why support Pakistan , which has both ?
Why so eager to immediately attack Iran , which is years from developing nuclear weapons ?
And most bizarrely of all , why did the neocons push Georgia into a hopeless war against Russia ?
None of this protects the US or Israel from " Islamo - Fascism . "
Instead , the neocons defer to the key foreign policy objective of the central bankers , which is : Keep the Dollar Strong .
A strong dollar will dominate as the world ’s reserve currency and serve as the international medium of exchange , and as the global economy grows , demand for reserve currency increases and the central bankers reap enormous wealth by trading their otherwise worthless little green pieces of paper for the world ’s resources .
Unfortunately , the central bankers are too greedy .
Over - inflating the money supply , they undermine the dollar ’s value .
In desperation , to keep the dollar as world reserve currency , the Fed pressures its oil - producing vassal states — especially the US puppet regime in Saudi Arabia — to accept only dollars in exchange for oil .
As oil is the world ’s most essential commodity , the world must trade in dollars to survive .
Thus the neocons show fealty to the Fed .
They ignore Saudi repression , because Saudi oil keeps the dollar strong .
The neocons attacked Iraq because it was a major oil producer that dared sell in currencies other than the dollar .
The neocons want to attack Iran now for the same reason .
The neocons would also love to attack Russia , the world ’s second largest oil producer , for it too refuses to bow before the Almighty Petrodollar .
However , Russia really has weapons of mass destruction , and so the neocons pursued indirect confrontation by encouraging their puppet regime in Georgia to attack South Ossetia , a Russian ally .
The Russians predictably retaliated , and frightened Europeans are pulling investments from Russia and questioning their reliance on Russian oil .
End result : the dollar rules on .
The neocons knew Georgia could n’t beat Russia .
Localized military defeat for global financial victory was the game plan .
As neoconservative Jeane Kirkpatrick revealed during the Cold War : “ Russia is playing chess , while we are playing Monopoly . ”
And so Russia loudly stakes out a square while the Fed quietly buys up the board .
Very clever — but in provoking a deadly confrontation with a nuclear power , did the central bankers let greed go too far ?
To dilute our currency at a cost of thousands of dollars a year per citizen is criminal , but to risk the annihilation of civilization is depraved .
Dismissing feeble altruistic rationalizations , we see the Federal Reserve ’s power to create unlimited amounts of money at whim has caused our monetary overlords to lose touch with humanity and wage war against the human race .
Such unbounded egomania is a natural consequence of being insulated from economic , political , and moral accountability during the Fed ’s century - long reign of corruption .
For our freedom , prosperity , and survival , the Federal Reserve scam of the central bankers must be abolished — before more wealth is dissipated by their parasitical monetary system , or another life is lost to their vampirical foreign policy .

The Best of Joe Schembrie
When George W. Bush was sworn in as President in January 2001 , the price of oil was approximately $ 28 per barrel .
By coincidence , 2001 also saw the US import more oil than it produced domestically for the first time in its history .
In hindsight , perhaps this was an omen .
During the tenure of his administration , oil prices have skyrocketed to $ 130 per barrel , and some analysts have predicted that the price could ultimately settle at $ 250 or $ 500 , depending on the time frame .
Conspiracy theorists and cynics would correctly point out that the Bush family and administration insiders have profited from this rise .
Even Bush supporters would have to concede that the administration has contributed to , if not actively encouraged , the record run-up .
From fiscal policy to energy policy to foreign policy , the Bush Administration has committed one gaffe after another , and the futures markets have been quick to react , with devastating economic consequences .
At the same time , there were isolated instances in which the Administration appeared to be working to relieve prices , and these efforts should be acknowledged as well .
In doing so , the net effect of his presidency can be distilled from the sundry other factors that weigh on oil .
Weak Dollar : While President Bush and his coterie have echoed the " Strong Dollar " policy of the Clinton administration , the Dollar ’s performance has been anything but strong under Mr. Bush ; it has depreciated 37 % against it chief rival , the Euro , over the last eight years .
While the factors which weigh on currencies are as numerous as those which affect the price of oil , the policies of President Bush have been disastrous for the Dollar .
Record - low interest rates , a surging trade deficit , and ballooning national debt have shaken investor confidence in the Dollar , causing the currency to rapidly lose value .
While the relationship between the Dollar and the price of oil is tough to pin down , the commodity and the currency are 95 % correlated .
One explanation is that investors have moved into commodities because they provide a hedge against inflation and the falling Dollar .
On the other hand , it could just as well be that oil is driving the Dollar , and not the other way around .
According to Goldman Sachs , an investment bank , " commodities [ oil ] are moving for their own reasons and the dollar is caught in the slipstream . "
The truth is probably that there is two - way causality .
This is basically a fancy way of saying that one would expect that a weak Dollar would encourage foreigners to charge more for a given quantity of oil , but more expensive oil would then weaken the US trade imbalance in the short - term , causing the Dollar to depreciate further .
In this way , strong oil and a weak Dollar reinforce each other .
Regardless of the nature of this relationship , the weak Dollar ( for which the Bush Administration bears some responsibility ) ensures that America pays more for oil than other countries .
As most oil contracts are still denominated in Dollars , the price of oil is relatively higher in terms of Dollars , compared to other currencies .
Foreign Policy : The Bush Administration ’s aggressive foreign policy has also contributed to the surge in oil prices .
When the USA invaded Iraq in 2003 , the justification was that Saddam Hussein was harboring weapons of mass destruction , and secondly , that he was oppressing the citizens of Iraq .
Conspiracy theorists snickered , believing instead that the war was related to oil .
In hindsight , it looks like they were right , especially since the the first priority of US armed forces upon entering Iraq was to assume control over Iraqi oil production .
While those directly involved in the planning of the Iraq war have yet to come clean about their true motives , Alan Greenspan and Henry Kissinger have separately implied that the war was blatantly aimed at Iraq ’s vast deposits of oil .
Regardless of whether this is true , the US presence in Iraq should have ultimately stabilized Iraqi oil production , right ?
Not exactly .
In fact , a full five years have passed since the initial invasion , and oil production is still hovering around 2/3 of pre-war output .
This is especially unfortunate because Iraq is one of the only major oil producers that ( would have been ) is in position to increase output .
As if this were not enough , the ongoing US military effort requires 3 million gallons of imported gasoline per day to sustain its operations .
Disregarding the cost to taxpayers - estimated at $ 1 Billion per week due to the army ’s unique fuel specifications - this means that the net effect of the US military effort has been an increase in demand for oil and a decrease in supply .
One expert has speculated that if not for the Iraq War , the current price of oil would probably be closer to $ 40 .
Overseas Supply : Let ’s now focus the spotlight on the supply side of the equation , specifically overseas supply .
The top suppliers of oil to the US , in order of decreasing importance , are : Canada , Saudi Arabia , Mexico , Nigeria , Venezuela , and Iraq .
Conspicuously absent from this list is Iran , with which the US has refused to trade for a couple decades .
Given President
Bush ’s thinly veiled ambitions to go to war with Iran , it does n’t look like he will lift these sanctions before he leaves the White House .
Returning to the list , oil production in Mexico and Canada is subject to capacity constraints , and production in Nigeria is highly variable due to political instability .
The situation in Iraq was covered already , which leaves Saudi Arabia and Venezuela as the two most viable candidates to increase oil exports to the US .
Hugo Chavez , the flamboyant President of Venezuela , has suggested that despite certain ideological disagreements with President Bush , he would be willing to dialog with Bush anyway .
According to Chavez , however , his requests have been repeatedly rebuffed .
With regard to Saudi Arabia , with whom the President has a longstanding personal and business relationship , the situation is more nuanced .
Mr. Bush has repeatedly lobbied Saudi Arabia to raise output , but thus far has secured only token increases .
The US Congress has become especially disenchanted by the President ’s lackluster efforts , and is debating whether or not to sue OPEC to achieve what he single - handedly could not .
Analysts echo their frustrations by pointing to the myriad of trade deals that President Clinton signed with OPEC members while he was in office .
Domestic Supply : Maybe we should cut the Bush Administration some slack , since there is only so much they can be done to persuade foreign oil producers to ramp up production .
Let ’s turn our attention to the domestic front .
According to the Wall Street Journal , " Exxon Mobil Corp .
Chief Executive Rex Tillerson chided President Bush for asking Saudi Arabia to boost its production , while not doing more to increase production at home in the U.S. , particularly off the coasts of Florida and California . "
Perhaps in response to such criticism , Mr. Bush has " proposed to the Congress that they open up ANWR [ Alaska National Wildlife Refuge ] , open up the Continental Shelf … "
However , the economic benefit of oil exploration in such areas is dubious , even without taking into account the environmental consequences .
Two professors at the Center for Energy and Environmental Studies reckon both that the amount of recoverable oil in the ANWR is lower than current estimates suggest and that the oil would be quite expensive to extract .
Even if the rosiest forecasts obtain , they predict that oil production in Alaska probably would n’t exceed 1 % of global supply .
No New Refineries : Refineries represent the sine qua non in the chain that links oil producers to consumers , by transforming crude oil into usable products such as gasoline and heating oil .
The profitability of oil refining is represented by the " crack spread , " which according to one estimate , " has tripled in the last 12 months . "
One of the factors behind this increase is a shortage of refining capacity .
Unfortunately , not a single new refinery has been built in the US in the last 30 years , a time period that obviously includes the eight years under the leadership of President Bush .
Fuel Economy : Moving to the demand side of the supply / demand paradigm , the Bush Administration has done little to mitigate demand for oil products .
Since 2/3 of the oil consumed in the US is used for transportation purposes , it would follow that an increase in motor vehicle fuel economy would go a long way in reducing demand .
However , it was n’t until 2006 that that Bush Administration made any effort to legislate an increase in fuel economy , and even this effort was uninspired .
This mandate " only increases fuel economy by 1.8 mpg over 4 years … abandons fleet - wide averages in favor of a sized - based system that will encourage automakers to build larger vehicles with weaker fuel economy standards … and larger pick - up trucks will remain exempt from the standard . "
Individual states responded to this legislation by circumventing the federal government and enacting their own standards .
Instead of embracing these efforts , the Bush Administration called them " ‘ an obstacle to the accomplishment ’ of the new federal standards " and insisted that its own ( lower ) standards superseded those of the states .
Fortunately , the US federal court system has sided with the states .
Alternative Energy : Alternative energy is being heralded both as the solution to America ’s addiction to oil and a strategy to deal with climate change .
The only person who has not firmly jumped on the bandwagon is President Bush .
While the President likes to boast of his support for the alternative energy sector , the numbers indicate that funding has hardly budged over the duration of his presidency .
Now , the Democrat - controlled Congress is moving to punish oil companies that do n’t invest in alternative energy by imposing a " windfall profits tax . "
President Bush is spearheading the effort to block this bill .
Republicans have already scuttled a similar bill which would have required utility companies to generate a modest 15 % of US electricity in 2020 using renewable energy methods .
Instead , President Bush has thrown his support behind ethanol , which , if 2007 was any indication , probably ca n’t be counted on to lower fuel prices .
Not to mention the fact that its purported efficiency and environmental benefits are dubious and that it is contributing to rising food prices .
Speculation : The Bush Administration is known for its coziness with big business .
Its economic policy team is dominated by former executives in the financial sector , such as Henry Paulson who serves as Secretary of the Treasury .
Despite evidence to the contrary , Mr. Paulson is adamant that expensive oil , albeit unpleasant , is a natural result of changes in the balance between supply and demand .
He has firmly ruled out the possibility that excessive speculation has played a significant role .
The " Commodity Futures Trading Commission , the government agency responsible for overseeing the trading of energy contracts , " evidently disagrees , and " has taken the unusual step of revealing a six - month investigation into possible price manipulation . "
Led by Democratic Senator Joseph Lieberman , the Congress is also conducting an investigation .
Lieberman has indicated that he would like to see Congress ban all institutional investors from speculating in commodity markets , because they are altering the landscape from one based around hedging to one based on investing .
He is supported by George Soros , respected investor , who argued that , " Oil is increasing … but the recent rise I think has a larger fundamental speculation and really misconception in the way the institutions have piled in on one side of the market buying these commodity indexes . "
One could be excused for cynically suspecting the Bush Administration from actively fomenting the rise in oil prices .
After all , this is a president who shockingly opposed legislation which would temporarily suspend filling the American strategic petroleum reserve until oil prices return to earth .
Leaked documents , reveal an Administration that is in hoc with oil companies , which are invited to take part in drafting the nation ’s respective energy and environmental policies .
This is also an Administration whose Vice President famously dismissed conservation as " a sign of personal virtue , but it is not a sufficient basis for a sound , comprehensive energy policy . "
Hence , it should come as no surprise that as oil prices have climbed ( and continue to climb ) to record levels , the Bush Administration has stood idly and failed to take meaningful action .
Near the start of his book , “ The Conscience of a Conservative , ” Barry Goldwater wrote : “ Every man , for his individual good and for the good of his society , is responsible for his own development .
The choices that govern his life are choices that he must make ; they can not be made by any other human being . ”
The political implications of this are clear , Goldwater continued : “ Conservatism ’s first concern will always be : Are we maximizing freedom ? ”
Goldwater ’s vision was highly individualistic and celebrated a certain sort of person  the stout pioneer crossing the West , the risk - taking entrepreneur with a vision , the stalwart hero fighting the collectivist foe .
The problem is , this individualist description of human nature seems to be wrong .
Over the past 30 years , there has been a tide of research in many fields , all underlining one old truth  that we are intensely social creatures , deeply interconnected with one another and the idea of the lone individual rationally and willfully steering his own life course is often an illusion .
Cognitive scientists have shown that our decision - making is powerfully influenced by social context  by the frames , biases and filters that are shared subconsciously by those around .
Neuroscientists have shown that we have permeable minds .
When we watch somebody do something , we recreate their mental processes in our own brains as if we were performing the action ourselves , and it is through this process of deep imitation that we learn , empathize and share culture .

Hundreds of Thousands of Laptops Lost at U.S. Airports Annually
This is a weird statistic :
Some of the largest and medium - sized U.S. airports report close to 637,000 laptops lost each year , according to the Ponemon Institute survey released Monday .
Laptops are most commonly lost at security checkpoints , according to the survey .
Close to 10,278 laptops are reported lost every week at 36 of the largest U.S. airports , and 65 percent of those laptops are not reclaimed , the survey said .
Around 2,000 laptops are recorded lost at the medium - sized airports , and 69 percent are not reclaimed .
Travelers seem to lack confidence that they will recover lost laptops .
About 77 percent of people surveyed said they had no hope of recovering a lost laptop at the airport , with 16 percent saying they would n’t do anything if they lost their laptop during business travel .
About 53 percent said that laptops contain confidential company information , with 65 percent taking no steps to protect the information .
I do n’t know how to generalize that to a total number of lost laptops in the U.S. ; let ’s call it 750,000 .
At $ 1,000 per laptop — a very conservative estimate — that ’s $ 750 million in lost laptops annually .
Most are lost at security checkpoints , and I ’m sure the numbers went up considerably since those checkpoints got more annoying after 9/11 .
There are n’t a lot of real numbers about the costs of increased airport security .
We pay in time , in anxiety , in inconvenience .
But we also pay in goods .
TSA employees steal out of suitcases .
And opportunists steal hundreds of millions of dollars of laptops annually .

Parents feel increasingly unable to help their children with homework because they find it too difficult to understand .
A study by the General Teaching Council for England has found that parents ' across the social spectrum ' are calling on teachers to run sessions that will help them to understand the curriculum and modern teaching methods .
They also want schools to provide them with ' homework accompanied by worked examples ' so that they can better support their children .
The research highlighted mathematics and science as particularly difficult for parents because the way in which they are taught has changed so dramatically from when today 's adults were children .
Many also feel teachers are increasingly remote figures with less and less time for parents , especially in secondary schools .
The report looked at how parents were coping with the growing expectation for them to engage in their children 's learning .
It found that the tradition of sitting at the kitchen table with a child and their homework is almost impossible for parents who work .
For those who try to find time after they come home from work , there can be rows , as tired parents and equally tired children fight over the task .
This is despite the fact that the government is recommending that schools set homework that children cannot manage alone , as a way of involving parents .
The Department for Children , Schools and Families website states : ' Homework is a fantastic way for you to get more involved in your children 's education and find out what they 're doing all day . '
But with a recent survey by the Office of National Statistics finding that a typical working parent was spending a total of just 35 minutes a day ' looking after ' children , getting more involved can be a daunting prospect .
Lorraine Thomas , who runs the Parent Coaching Academy , said the amount of homework had caused a big rise in parents ' anxieties .
' Homework has become much more of an issue in the last 18 months , and with younger and younger children , ' she said .
' Working mums especially are feeling the stress that they can't help .
Frayed patience and tempers at the end of the day does n't help anyone , and this is becoming a real sign of the times .
I call it the arsenic hour when parents get home thinking there 's going to be an idyllic evening when everyone discusses their day and bonds like a perfect family .
But of course there is no such thing when everyone is tired . '
' Getting homework [ handed in ] from pupils is a huge struggle , ' said Hayley Bennett , a secondary school teacher in Torquay , Devon .
' I find it very difficult on a daily basis to get homework from every pupil .
If parents have genuine anxieties over helping and understanding homework , then they need to remember that we are specialists .
No one would expect an art teacher to understand someone 's physics project , so it 's about supporting and encouraging their children . '
Anna Barnes , a teacher at Brill Primary School in Buckinghamshire , said : ' If time is really tight , then parents can be imaginative , five minutes reciting their tables in the car or in the bath , spelling words at the breakfast table . '
Keith Bartley , chief executive of the general teaching council , said parents should not panic .
' We understand the challenges for parents feeling the pressure of having to sit down and help with homework .
It 's an ingrained expectation , but it is unrealistic in many cases . '
He said it was clear teachers and parents were feeling there was decreasing time for engagement .
Parents in the study all commented on how it was ' increasingly difficult to talk to their child 's teachers - both primary and secondary , and particularly so for secondary schools with administrators acting as gatekeepers .
Primary school teachers were increasingly only available at the end of the day , which is not convenient for parents with young children . '
Many described secondary teachers as ' unapproachable ' .
' We commissioned this research because teachers had told us they welcomed parents ' engagement and we wanted to understand the challenges for parents .
And it is clear schools do need to foster more open - door policies ; teachers are busy people , but there needs to be scope for the quick conversation , ' said Bartley .
' Teaching has been revolutionised since most of today 's parents were at school , so its not surprising they feel left behind by it . '
Who Serves in the Military Today ?
Three of the four candidates in the upcoming election have a son who has either served in Iraq or soon will : Jimmy McCain , Beau Biden , and Track Palin .
( And the children of the fourth candidate , Barack Obama , are a bit too young for military duty . )
Is this sheer happenstance ?
I am guessing that when Obama was preparing to pick his running mate , it was important to counter John McCain ‘s military bona fides — and Joe Biden fit the bill at least in some small part because his son Beau is a captain in the Delaware Army National Guard , soon to be deployed to Iraq .
When McCain chose his vice - presidential candidate , Sarah Palin ‘s chances certainly were n’t hurt by having a son who ’s an Army Pfc. about to be sent to Iraq .
If you randomly take any four American families , it would certainly be anomalous if three of them had a son in Iraq .
( The U.S. military currently has about two million people in uniform . )
But is n’t it even more anomalous that three of four families like these — i.e. , families of considerable means — have sons in Iraq ?
Is n’t the modern military full of men and women from low - income backgrounds , with a far higher minority representation than in the general population , who join up only because they have no other viable career possibilities ?
That is certainly a piece of conventional wisdom that I have heard voiced ; which is why a new report titled “ Who Serves in the U.S. Military ?
The Demographics of Enlisted Troops and Officers ” is so surprising .
It was compiled by Shanea J. Watkins and James Sherk at the Heritage Foundation ’s Center for Data Analysis .
I suspect that the Heritage Foundation ’s imprimatur will raise skepticism among some readers , and I have several qualms myself with what is said and not said in the report , but the facts are very compelling .
The report measures the demographics of military personnel against the general U.S. population in four areas : household income , education level , racial and ethnic background , and regional origin .
Here is the most surprising picture in the report :
So 50 percent of the enlisted recruits ( i.e. , not including the officers ’ corps ) come from families in the top 40 percent of the income distribution , while only 10 percent come from the bottom 20 percent .
It is worth noting that the income information here is not perfect : the data do not include actual family income for each recruit , but rather use the median household income of the recruit ’s home census tract .
But still , one look at that graph tells you that the conventional image of a military full of poor kids does n’t reflect the reality .
“ These trends are even more pronounced in the Army Reserve Officers ’ Training Corps ( R.O.T.C. ) program , ” reads the report , “ in which 40 percent of enrollees come from the wealthiest neighborhoods — a number that has increased substantially over the past four years ” ( i.e. , since the September 11 attacks ) .
Here are some of the report ’s other claims :
1. “ American soldiers are more educated than their peers .
A little more than 1 percent of enlisted personnel lack a high - school degree , compared to 21 percent of men 18 to 24 years old [ in the general population ] . ”
2 . “ Contrary to conventional wisdom , minorities are not overrepresented in the military service . ”
3 . “ The facts do not support the belief that many American soldiers volunteer because society offers them few opportunities .
The average enlisted person or officer could have had lucrative career opportunities in the private sector . ”
Point No. 1 , while technically true , is also misleading .
As the report states elsewhere , “ The military requires at least 90 percent of enlisted recruits to have high - school diplomas ” ( not counting GED ’s ) and , furthermore , the Army itself requires a high - school diploma or equivalent , with a 2.5 G.P.A .
So high - school dropouts are , for the most part , not getting into the military .
In fact , if you consider “ low education ” a proxy for “ low income , ” that would seem to explain most of the high - income effect we see in the graph above .
This does n’t make the graph any less true ; it just makes the report ’s language needlessly boastful .
Point No. 2 is particularly interesting , especially as you dig further into the report ’s data .
Whites and blacks make up almost exactly the same percent of the enlisted personnel as they do in the general population .
The recruit - to - population ratio for whites is 1.06 , and for blacks it is 1.08 .
Hispanics , meanwhile , are significantly underrepresented among enlisted personnel , with a recruit - to - population ratio of just 0.65 .
( It should also be said that this entire report groups together personnel from all four service branches , which means that the aggregate numbers do not necessarily represent any one of the branches separately . )
It ’s also interesting to note that blacks are overrepresented in R.O.T.C. commissions , with a 1.21 officer - to - population ratio , compared to 1.02 for whites .
United States Military Academy graduates , however , are a different story entirely .
Just over 80 percent of West Point graduates are white ( a 1.12 officer - to - population ratio ) , while only 5.5 percent are black ( a 0.5 ratio ) .
Also , nearly 18 percent of West Point cadets come from a family with a household income of more than $ 100,000 .
Granted , West Point is an elite institution and is bound to attract elites .
There ’s a further important point that ca n’t be found in this report but can be found in another one , which compiles race - specific U.S. military fatalities in Iraq and Afghanistan .
As of March 1 , 2008 , there were 2,964 white fatalities in Iraq , representing 74.8 percent of the total ; in the general population , meanwhile , whites in that age cohort make up about 62 percent of the population , so whites are overrepresented among Iraqi fatalities .
Blacks and Hispanics , meanwhile , are both underrepresented ; the same is true in Afghanistan .
Point No. 3 is almost an ideological argument rather than a factual one .
But still , this much is clear : when discussing the U.S. military in the aggregate , the common notion that the military is a stop of last resort , increasingly staffed by low - income desperadoes with slim future prospects , cannot be right .
If the report has one significant ideological point to make , it ’s that military participation has a huge patriotic / service component that is commonly overlooked , especially in portions of the country where military representation is far below average .
( In the Northeast , for instance , the recruit - to - population ratio is just 0.73 , compared to 1.19 in the South . )
We obviously have n’t heard the last word on patriotism or service in the current campaign .
And many of the words to come will certainly be loaded .
If nothing else , here ’s hoping that people — no matter which side they ’re arguing — will take a look at some of the numbers in this report before leaping to conclusions .
[ Note : I recently discussed this topic on The Takeaway . ]
As the Jallikattu issue has finally come to an end , I think It is time to reassess and look at some ...
This past weekend , Haruki Murakami appeared at U.C. Berkeley ’s Zellerbach Auditorium for a reading of his short stories and a wide - ranging conversation about his work and life .
Despite my disappointment with his recent work , Murakami ranks as one of my favorite writers , and it was a pleasure to finally see the notoriously shy writer in person .
Zellerbach is a big venue , at least 800 seats , and in an age when lit pundits constantly bemoan the future of literature , I was surprised when I attempted to buy tickets several weeks ago only to find they were sold out .
Thanks to the timely intervention of a friend , however , I managed to get a decent seat in the mezzanine , and spent two and a half enjoyable hours laughing along with the capacity crowd at Murakami ’s understated humor .
During the first part of the program , Murakami read “ The Rise and Fall of Sharpie Cakes ” ( from Blind Willow , Sleeping Woman )
The story , written in the early stages of his career , is a parable about the Japanese literary world and its reception of his first novel .
In classic Murakami style , the story follows a Japanese everyman whose seemingly normal life descends into the bizarre .
In this case , after responding to a newspaper ad , he finds himself baking cakes for a competition that is judged by cannibalistic crows .
The story , in turns hilarious and gruesome , received a warm reception from the audience , with several people , strangely , even laughing at the grim denouement .
“ Sharpie Cakes ” was followed by a fascinating discussion on writing between Murakami and Roland Kelts , a writer and lecturer at the University of Tokyo , and questions from the audience .
The conversation ranged from Murakami ’s obsession with jogging to Carl Jung , hitting most of the stops in between , including hints about his newest novel .
Some of the highlights ( in no particular order and paraphrased in places ) :
On Reader ’s Questions : Apparently Murakami actually answers all of his fan mail personally .
“ I like stupid questions .
A guy sent me an email about squid .
He asked ‘ are their tentacles hands or feet ? ’
I told him he should give a squid ten pairs of gloves and ten pairs of socks and see what happens . ”
On Inspiration : “ I ’m observing things , not making them up …
I ’m not nationalist , I do n’t write for my country , but for my people …
I do n’t think with my brain .
I like my keyboard .
I think with my fingers .
When I write , it ’s just a simple joy …
I can write about torture , about skinning someone alive .
But it ’s still heartwarming … ”
On his obsessions : “ Elephants , sofas , refrigerators , wells , cats , ears .
These things help me to write . ”
On video games : “ Writing a story for me is just like playing a video game .
I start with a word or idea , then I stick out my hand to catch what ’s coming next .
I ’m a player , and at the same time , I ’m a programmer .
It ’s kind of like playing chess by yourself .
When you ’re the white player , you do n’t think about the black player .
It ’s possible , but it ’s hard .
It ’s kind of schizophrenic . ”
On dreams : “ I do n’t dream .
I use my dreams when I write .
I dream when I ’m awake .
That ’s the job of a novelist .
You can dream a dream intentionally .
When you ’re sleeping and you have a nice dream , you ’re eating or with a woman , you might wake up at the best part .
I get to keep dreaming .
It ’s great . ”
On his next novel :
He finished it last week .
Apparently , it ’s going to be a doorstop .
“ I hope you ’re not a commuter …
The new novel is in the third person , from beginning to end .
I need that room , because the story is getting more complicated .
I need many perspectives . ”
On translations of his own work : “ I ’m a translator myself .
I believe in my translations .
If the story is strong enough , it will be translated rightly .
I ’m a novelist , not a linguist .
If the story ’s good , it will move you .
That ’s the important thing .
It ’s embarrassing for me to read my own work in Japanese .
I enjoy the translations of my novels in English , because it ’s not what I wrote .
I forget what I wrote , and I turn the pages , excited to find out what will happen next . ”
On Catcher in the Rye ( which he translated several years ago ) : “ It ’s a dark story , very disturbing .
I enjoyed it when I was seventeen , so I decided to translate it .
I remembered it as being funny , but it ’s dark and strong .
I must have been disturbed , when I was young .
J.D. Salinger has a big obsession , three times bigger than mine .
That ’s why I ’m here tonight , and he is n’t . ”
On Revision : “ The first draft is most important .
I have to go through and adjust small things , contradictions .
When I stared writing The Wind - up Bird Chronicle , I wrote for an hour , and immediately I felt something was wrong .
There was too much going on , so I pulled out that part of the story and wrote another book , South of the Border , West of the Sun . ”
On his favorite music : “ I listen to classical music in the morning , jazz in the evening .
I listen to rock when I ’m driving .
I like Radiohead ( big round of applause ) .
I like REM , Beck , the Red Hot Chili Peppers .
Thome Yorke is a reader of mine .
He ’s in Tokyo now , and he wanted to meet me , but I had to be here .
It ’s a huge sacrifice for me …
I sing “ Yellow Submarine ” while I swim .
It ’s sounds like bubbling .
It ’s great .
I recommend you try it …
I loved the Beach Boys when I was younger .
I met Brian Wilson when he came to Tokyo .
He ’s strange . ”
On Berkeley : “ Something ’s wrong with this town . ”

This is what fighting “ terrorism ” in this country has become .
Timothy McVeigh is responsible for the Oklahoma City Bombing , the deadliest act of terrorism in this country prior to 9/11 , killing 168 people , but a Homeland Security official says he ’s not a terrorist .
Neither is Eric Rudolph , who killed two people and injured hundreds others in a bombing campaign against abortion and a “ homosexual agenda . ”
Pennsylvania ’s Homeland Security Director James Powers said :
“ Tim McVey [ sic ] is not a terrorist , just very angry with the U.S. government , ” Powers said .
“ Whether a person is a terrorist or a criminal is irrelevant to me . ”
You know whom he and the state police do consider terrorists ?
The Earth Liberation Front , Animal Liberation Front , and Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty , even though actions by those groups have been “ relatively minor , ” by their admission .
Those groups have never injured anyone , let alone killed hundreds , but the Pennsylvania state police is offering free , yes free , “ risk and vulnerability assessments ” for corporations to help protect their profits from pesky activists .
[ Sounds kind of like that leaked State Department presentation , does n’t it ? ]
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Unfortunately , this is not an isolated , “ news of the weird ” kind of incident .
It ’s systemic .
The Maryland State Police have admitted classifying 53 nonviolent activists as terrorists , including opponents of the war and the death penalty , and tracking them in state and federal “ terrorism ” databases .
Cops infiltrated organizing meetings and rallies , and spied on political email lists , similar to the government infiltration of the RNC .
The groups targeted , including the Maryland Campaign to End the Death Penalty and the Baltimore Pledge of Resistance , are n’t suspected of harming anyone , are n’t suspected of bombing anyone , are n’t even suspected of vandalizing property .
Their crime ?
They ’re “ fringe people , ” says Thomas E. Hutchins , the former state police superintendent who authorized the operation .
“ I do n’t believe the First Amendment is any guarantee to those who wish to disrupt the government , ” he said .
Get this , one activist was described in police databases as having a “ primary crime ” of “ terrorism - anti - government ” and a “ secondary crime ” of “ terrorism - anti- war protesters . ”
This was n’t an isolated abuse of power , this is a coordinated campaign of harassment and intimidation .
The gloves are really starting to come off , folks .
Years ago , government officials were using these same tactics , but under the pretext of going after illegal , underground groups like the Earth Liberation Front .
Now , they are openly , brazenly , harassing and infiltrating nonviolent activist groups with no connection –not even an ideological connection –to saboteurs .
Why ?
This “ War on Terrorism , ” above all else , is an ideological war .
In some ways , though , I think folks should take some pride in that .
Considering what is mainstream government policy now , I ’d much rather be in the camp of “ fringe people . ”

GENEVA ( Reuters ) - The United Nations appealed on Friday for $ 20 million to help one million people in Syria cope with the worst drought in four decades .
Many of those in need are herders and subsistence farmers who have lost their livestock and crops after poor and erratic rainfall , according to the U.N. ’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( OCHA ) .
More than 100,000 herders have lost at least half their livestock .
“ It is the worst drought in Syria in 40 years , ” OCHA spokeswoman Elisabeth Byrs told a news briefing .
The U.N. appeal to donors said “ around 1 million people in north - eastern Syria are food insecure : their income from crops and livestock sales have been depleted and currently many resort to damaging coping mechanisms , such as decreased food intake , sale of agriculture and household assets , or migration . ”
It also noted a “ marked increased in the prevalence of anemia , malnutrition and diarrhea especially among children less than five years of age as well as pregnant women by more than twofold compared to the same period in 2007 . ”
The U.N. appeal would fund food and agricultural assistance for six months .
The Syrian government has already distributed emergency aid to 29,000 families , the OCHA said .
“ The situation is not expected to improve until the spring of 2009 , ” Byrs said .
This would depend if crops sown now mature then , providing rains do not fail for a second year in a row .
Syria , usually a major wheat exporter , resorted to the international wheat market in July for the first time in 15 years to compensate for one of its smallest harvests on record .
The country ’s national wheat production was at 47 percent of the previous season and 49 percent of the past 10 - year average , while barley production was at 67 percent and 67 percent , respectively , according to the U.N. .

In February 2007 , William Winkenwerder Jr. announced he was stepping down from his post as assistant secretary of defense for health affairs following a press conference in which he downplayed the Walter Reed scandal as a mere “ quality - of - life experience . ”
In the months that followed , it seemed clear that Winkenwerder ’s negligence may have been partly to blame for the deplorable conditions at the military hospital .
Now , more than a year and half after his departure , Winkenwerder ’s legacy lives on in a multibillion - dollar Defense Department medical - records management system that many military doctors believe is fatally flawed .
One military physician , speaking anonymously , calls it “ another Walter Reed - type scandal . ”
The story of the Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application , or AHLTA , begins in 1997 , when the Pentagon began to develop an updated version of the Composite Health Care System , a bare - bones electronic medical records ( EMR ) management program it had been working on for a decade to help military hospitals keep track of their patients .
In 2000 , the DOD signed a $ 60.6 million contract with an IT firm called Integic for the initial design and installation of an improved “ CHCS II ” system .
The Defense Department approved CHCS II in 2002 .
It introduced the system into military facilities in January 2004 , under Winkenwerder ’s oversight .
By spring of that year , clinicians were already complaining that CHCS II processed data too slowly to be useful .
Dissatisfaction grew vocal enough to raise rumors that the Pentagon was going to suspend use of the new system until it could be brought up to par .
The military stuck with the system until November 2005 , when Winkenwerder , who oversaw all DOD health care , held a press conference rechristening the system “ AHLTA . ”
“ We have put a new name on what we are doing because it is not a ‘ version two ’ of anything , but an entirely new system , ” he said .
But AHLTA was CHCS II , warts and all — and a new name could n’t hide the program ’s problems .
Over the course of AHLTA ’s implementation period , which has continued through this year , military doctors have grown increasingly disgruntled with the system .
They complain that AHLTA is difficult to use , error prone , and slow , and that it has too many nonsensical tics such as an inability to capture patient data unless the patient stays in a hospital overnight .
According to AHLTA ’s critics , one of its biggest failings is its inability to share patient data with VistA , the records - management system that Veterans Affairs has used for the past 25 years .
When patient databases can’t communicate with each other , soldiers suffer :
At least part of the reason why patients languished at Walter Reed was a lack of coordination between Army personnel and medical records .
Unlike AHLTA , VistA has been a huge success .
Research from the University of Washington and the VA shows that it has enhanced VA productivity , reduced costs , and improved prescription accuracy to a remarkable 99.997 percent .
Given its stellar performance , VistA is considered a model from which the military could expand its use of EMRs to include active soldiers as well as veterans .
But Winkenwerder championed the private - sector solution .
Like many Bush administration appointees , Winkenwerder was plucked from industry .
An MD / MBA , he never served in the military and was a vice president of Blue Cross Blue Shield , New England ’s largest private health insurer , before arriving at the DOD .
Winkenwerder was proud of his corporate pedigree : During his nomination process , he told the Senate that “ coming from the private sector , I am …confident in the ability of private health care contractors to [ provide ] … high quality services . ”
( Winkenwerder did not respond to an interview request . )
Despite a growing consensus among military doctors that Integic ’s product was a bust , Winkenwerder and the Pentagon kept pushing forward on AHLTA .
Winkenwerder even took the unusual step of hiring the PR firm Edelman to drum up media attention for the system and brushed off complaints from clinicians .
In 2006 , even Stars and Stripes — a military newspaper subsidized by the Defense Department — noted that Winkenwerder had “ ignored a rising chorus of critics ” and “ volunteered only praise ” for AHLTA .
This stubbornness has shaken military medical staff , many of whom view AHLTA as an impediment to providing quality care .
According to the military physician , internal polls cite AHLTA as “ the biggest issue of concern for military clinicians , ” and “ while Walter Reed is a more visible scandal , this failure actually impacts [ soldiers ’ ] health more , ” since doctors across the military are using an unreliable system to manage patient records .
The AHLTA debacle has n’t come cheap .
So far the Pentagon has invested an estimated $ 5 billion of taxpayer money in the project .
This figure includes the original Integic contract and other corporate handouts such as a $ 67.7 million follow - up contract for “ monitoring ” and “ management ” with Northrop Grumman — which bought out Integic shortly before AHLTA was announced — and another $ 12.3 million to Northrop and Booz Allen Hamilton for aid in assessing how AHLTA and VistA can share data .
Meanwhile , it would have probably been easy — and vastly cheaper — if the Pentagon had simply used VistA in the first place .
In April , Phillip Longman , a senior fellow at the New America Foundation and author of Best Care Anywhere : Why VA Health Care Is Better Than Yours , told the tech website ZDNet that the government “ could wire Walter Reed or Bethesda ( the two biggest military hospitals ) for VistA in an afternoon .
Technically , there ’s no big problem . ”
In fact , VistA ’s code is so flexible that it ’s even been adapted for use in other countries .
“ Yet , ” said Longman , “ there are DOD people who have built their careers on AHLTA and want people to switch to their system . ”
Winkenwerder was one of those people , going so far as to reject criticism from members of Congress who expressed frustration at the Defense Department ’s tunnel vision .
In 2006 , then - chairman of the Senate Veterans ’ Affairs committee Sen. Larry Craig ( R - Idaho ) noted “ that [ since the ] VA has an award - winning , highly - touted [ EMR system ] … I have to wonder whether DOD is just trying to justify the agency building its own system . ”
In response to pressure from legislators , Winkenwerder had one of his deputies send a letter to Congress insisting that adoption of VistA would be too expensive and time - consuming .
The Pentagon has often relied on this excuse when defending AHLTA .
Last year , Government Executive magazine reported that , in order to promote use of AHLTA , the Defense Department was blocking military doctors from accessing a new patient - tracking system that operated through the Internet .
Like VistA , this system was embraced by the VA and has been touted by doctors as being more efficient than AHLTA .
It cost just $ 320,000 to develop and an additional $ 2 million a year to maintain , and because it ’s accessible through standard Web browsers instead of complex software , it ’s more useful on the battlefield .
When Lt. Colonel Mike Fravell , who developed the alternate system while serving as the chief information officer of the military ’s Landstuhl Medical Center in Germany , spoke out against the Pentagon ’s obstructionism , he was first transferred to South Korea and then to a post just outside of Washington , DC — or , as one congressional source put it to Government Executive , “ bureaucratic Siberia . ”
When Congress confronted the Defense Department about its attempt to quash use of Fravell ’s system , the military claimed that AHLTA could n’t integrate with the tracking system without more time and money — in this case , $ 30 million more .
Battlefield medics were livid : “ It is time to say , ‘ the emperor has no clothes ' ” when it comes to AHLTA , one combat surgeon told Government Executive last year .
In June , military doctors got their chance to do just that when Winkenwerder ’s successor , S. Ward Casscells , held an online town hall for clinicians to weigh in on AHLTA .
The forum received almost 200 comments , the vast majority of them negative .
One colonel declared , “ I remain completely disappointed .
AHLTA … [ is ] slow , inefficient , unreliable , and in every respect an inferior product . ”
Another colonel blasted the DOD for being too concerned with “ rice bowls ” — military slang for pet projects — and a captain urged the Defense Department to “ save money and incorporate the VA system . ”
Another military clinician agreed , saying that it ’s “ time to cut our losses and switch to the VA EMR . ”
In July Casscells called the town - hall outpouring “ shocking ” and “ galvanizing , ” and announced that it was time “ to find an alternative … to AHLTA . ”
Even so , that alternative wo n’t be the VA ’s program , but rather a so - called “ converged evolution ” of AHLTA and VistA .
In other words , the two systems will be gradually tweaked so that they can work together .
Still , Casscells admits that VistA is “ much more popular with the doctors , ” which suggests that AHLTA will become more like the VA ’s system , rather than vice versa .
But making these systems interoperable will come at enormous taxpayer expense : Casscells says the price tag for convergence will be another $ 15 billion over the next several years , putting the total cost of AHLTA somewhere in the realm of $ 20 billion — four times what the government had originally budgeted for the entire AHLTA process .
“ There ’s been plenty of blame to go around , ” Casscells said at a forum on military health care last month .
“ Nobody ’s gonna like it . ”
Nobody except perhaps the Pentagon contractors , including Northrop Grumman , who stand to make additional billions off the project .
For his part , Winkenwerder , who boasted that the system “ works ” and “ is improving care ” in an October 2007 interview , is still touting the success of AHLTA .
His profile at Deloitte Consulting , where he serves as a senior adviser , proudly claims that he oversaw “ the world ’s … most sophisticated electronic health record system . ”

You know , it would really be much easier to not go all Godwin on the Republicans if they would n't just open themselves up for such blatant charges of being Nazis .
The thing that never ceases to astonish me is how little they attempt to hide it .
ABC News :
That heartbreaking scenario ( of people displaced after natural disasters like Hurricane Gustav ) inspired Louisiana Republican State Rep .
John LaBruzzo to start thinking about ways to stem generational welfare , in which many welfare recipients have children who also end up dependent on government assistance , according to the representative .
His idea -- giving $ 1,000 to poor women to undergo reproductive sterilization by Fallopian tube ligation -- is stirring up controversy among some medical professionals , who say that the proposal is offensive and smacks of long - discredited eugenics programs .
LaBruzzo has also suggested other controversial ideas : paying poor men to get vasectomies and giving tax incentives for college - educated wealthy couples to have more children .
LaBruzzo does n't know why it would be considered eugenics if it 's voluntary or racist if most welfare recipients are white .

Two terrestrial planets orbiting a mature sun-like star some 300 light - years from Earth recently suffered a violent collision , astronomers at UCLA , Tennessee State University and the California Institute of Technology will report in a December issue of the Astrophysical Journal .
" It 's as if Earth and Venus collided with each other , " said Benjamin Zuckerman , UCLA professor of physics and astronomy and a co-author on the paper .
" Astronomers have never seen anything like this before .
Apparently , major catastrophic collisions can take place in a fully mature planetary system . "
" If any life was present on either planet , the massive collision would have wiped out everything in a matter of minutes — the ultimate extinction event , " said co-author Gregory Henry , an astronomer at Tennessee State University ( TSU ) .
" A massive disk of infrared - emitting dust circling the star provides silent testimony to this sad fate . "
Zuckerman , Henry and Michael Muno , an astronomer at Caltech at the time of the research , were studying a star known as BD +20 307 , which is surrounded by a shocking 1 million times more dust than is orbiting our sun .
The star is located in the constellation Aries .
The astronomers gathered X - ray data using the orbiting Chandra X-ray Observatory and brightness data from one of TSU 's automated telescopes in southern Arizona , hoping to measure the age of the star .
" We expected to find that BD +20 307 was relatively young , a few hundred million years old at most , with the massive dust ring signaling the final stages in the formation of the star 's planetary system , " Muno said .
Those expectations were shown to be premature , however , when Carnegie Institution of Washington astronomer Alycia Weinberger announced in the May 20 , 2008 , issue of the Astrophysical Journal that BD +20 307 is actually a close binary star — two stars orbiting around their common center of mass .
advertisement
" That discovery radically revised the interpretation of the data and transformed the star into a unique and intriguing system , " said TSU astronomer Francis Fekel who , along with TSU 's Michael Williamson , was asked to provide additional spectroscopic data from another TSU automated telescope in Arizona to assist in comprehending this exceptional binary system .
The new spectroscopic data confirmed that BD +20 307 is composed of two stars , both very similar in mass , temperature and size to our own sun .
They orbit about their common center of mass every 3.42 days .
" The patterns of element abundances in the stars show that they are much older than a few hundred million years , as originally thought , " Fekel said .
" Instead , the binary system appears to have an age of several billion years , comparable to our solar system . "
" The planetary collision in BD +20 307 was not observed directly but rather was inferred from the extraordinary quantity of dust particles that orbit the binary pair at about the same distance as Earth and Venus are from our sun , " Henry said .
" If this dust does indeed point to the presence of terrestrial planets , then this represents the first known example of planets of any mass in orbit around a close binary star . "
Zuckerman and colleagues first reported in the journal Nature in July 2005 that BD +20 307 , then still thought to be a single star , was surrounded by more warm orbiting dust than any other sun-like star known to astronomers .
The dust is orbiting the binary system very closely , where Earth - like planets are most likely to be and where dust typically cannot survive long .
Small dust particles get pushed away by stellar radiation , while larger pieces get reduced to dust in collisions within the disk and are then whisked away .
Thus , the dust - forming collision near BD +20 307 must have taken place rather recently , probably within the past few hundred thousand years and perhaps much more recently , the astronomers said .
advertisement
" This poses two very interesting questions , " Fekel said .
" How do planetary orbits become destabilized in such an old , mature system , and could such a collision happen in our own solar system ? "
" The stability of planetary orbits in our own solar system has been considered for nearly two decades by astronomer Jacques Laskar in France and , more recently , by Konstantin Batygin and Greg Laughlin in the U.S.A. , " Henry noted .
" Their computer models predict planetary motions into the distant future and they find a small probability for collisions of Mercury with Earth or Venus sometime in the next billion years or more .
The small probability of this happening may be related to the rarity of very dusty planetary systems like BD +20 307 . "
" There is no question , however , " Zuckerman said , " that major collisions have occurred in our solar system 's past .
Many astronomers believe our moon was formed from the grazing collision of two planetary embryos — the young Earth and a body about the size of Mars — a crash that created tremendous debris , some of which condensed to form the moon and some of which went into orbit around the young sun .
By contrast with the massive crash in the BD +20 307 system , the collision of an asteroid with Earth 65 million years ago , the most favored explanation for the final demise of the dinosaurs , was a mere pipsqueak . "
In their 1932 novel " When Worlds Collide , " science fiction writers Philip Wylie and Edwin Balmer envisioned the destruction of Earth by a collision with a planet of a passing star .
The 1951 classic movie based on the novel began a long line of adventure stories of space rocks apocalyptically plowing into Earth .
" But , " Zuckerman noted , " there is no evidence near BD +20 307 of any such passing star . "

In one of his characteristically terse email replies , Apple chief executive Steve Jobs has reportedly told one Mac user that changes in video camera technology have reduced the need for FireWire on his company 's 13 - inch MacBooks .
The one - line response to a fan complaining over the lack of FireWire on the new entry level aluminum MacBooks is blunt but also points out that technology has changed since the company began including FireWire with Macs in 1999 .
" Actually , all of the new HD camcorders of the past few years use USB 2 , " Jobs supposedly wrote in an email , a copy of which was posted to the popular Flickr image sharing website .
Jobs is likely not pleased about theÂ current state of FireWire himself .
Apple invented the standard in the late 80s as a hot pluggable replacement for SCSI , with a special emphasis on supporting media streaming withÂ isochronous , real - time data transfers .
The company then released the specification through a standards body to become IEEE 1394 , where others including DEC , Texas Instruments , and Sony contributed to itsÂ developmentÂ as well . Â
UponÂ returningÂ to theÂ beleaguered Â Apple in 1997 , Jobs hoped to earnÂ
Apple some licensing royalties from the technology , which was quickly becoming an emerging standard not just to replace SCSI but also in video and music applications .
Jobs ' plan resulted in Intel offering to upgrade its USB standard to speeds approaching FireWire at a lower cost .
The ' master to slave ' USB 2.0 protocol was cheaper to implement than the ' smart peers ' design of FireWire because USB required less intelligence in the controllers .
Somewhat ironically , Apple 's 1998 iMac originated the push behind USB that allowed it to gain rapid adoption among consumers .
USB 2.0 built upon that ubiquity to push into the peripheralÂ territory Â that had been wholly owned by FireWire .
In 2001 , Apple 's iPod began to popularize FireWire as an interface that was much faster for syncing the thenÂ relatively Â large MP3 files compared to existing players that used USB 1.0 .
However , by 2003 , Apple started adding USB 2.0 support to target PC buyers , where FireWire ports were rare .
By the end of 2005 , Apple had removed FireWire sync from the iPod line as a cost savings measure .
While USB 2.0 ate into the casual peripheral market for consumer hard drives and web cams , FireWire retracted to support applications where USB 2.0 was n't suitable .
It retains clear advantages over USB 2.0 among higher performance hard drives , but in that market , FireWire is now competing against eSATA , which developed from ATA cabling .
Historically , FireWire has been the way to import video from digital cameras , but as Jobs ' purported email announced that is no longer always the case .
A glance at the product pages for Canon , Hitachi , JVC , Samsung and Sony as well as Amazon 's top camcorder list indicates that virtually all new compact consumer HD cameras now use USB 2.0Â to transferring footage directly to a computer instead of the FireWire .
Some camcorders also offer the option of burning directly to DVD and a fewÂ can transfer video over a USB - to - FireWire bridge cable .
A purported email reply from Apple chief executive Steve Jobs .
That reality is little comfort to those who fall outside of Apple 's market for the new entry - level portables , many of whom are vocal in their opinions in Apple 's support discussions as well as AppleInsider 's own forums .
Support for older cameras , many of which ( particularly DV tape models ) depend on FireWire , is ruled out by Apple 's aluminum MacBook update ; so too are prosumer cameras such as Sony 's HDR - FX1000 , which needs the faster throughput of FireWire ( called i.LINK by Sony ) to deliver raw content if a card reader is n't used .
To serious amateurs or professionals who prefer a smaller system , the loss of FireWire on the new entry level MacBooks is a vexing problem . Â
" I am a video producer and use my MacBook on site to ingest footage taken from FireWire cameras , even occasionally hooking the camera right up to the MacBook , " says one Mac user with the previous generation system .
Â " Well , it looks like there is n't a FireWire port on it anymore ... how the heck am I supposed to do that ?
I am sure I am not the only one with this concern . "
Professional musicians also use FireWire in recording equipment .
Â
Others have noted that the lack of FireWire additionally rules out Target Disk Mode for managing files or cloning systems , as USB 2.0's architecture lacks the capacity to support that feature .
Apple 's Migration Assistant software now alternatively supports importing files from another machine over Ethernet , from USB drives , or Time Machine backups , however .
Even so , many argue that Apple 's move appears built to upsell any serious user to the MacBook Pro , which starts at $ 800 more than the entry level new MacBook , despite the fact that AppleÂ continuesÂ to sell the previous - generation white MacBook , with FireWire intact , for $ 300 less than the new aluminum MacBooks .
There 's no doubt that the removal of FireWire from the MacBook was as difficult of a decision for Apple as it is a mourned loss for many Mac users .
With FireWire increasingly receding into the professional space , Apple had to weigh several variables , including the cost of incorporating another port to its entry level laptop that many of its new users would n't even recognize .
After all , half of the buyers Apple is selling to in its retail stores are new to the Mac .
Being able to offer them a lower price will likely help more than trying to sell them on the concept of Target Disk mode , which is entirely foreign to PC users .
The future of FireWire is still up in the air .
Apple retained the FW800Â versionÂ ( running at 800 Mbps , twice the speed of the original specification ) on the new MacBook Pro , providing substantially faster throughput than USB 2.0 .
On the MacBook , FW400 does n't offer most users enough of an advantage over USB 2.0 to warrant taking up the limited space on the port panel and on the logic board .
" Many of us do n't have great confidence that FireWire is here to stay on MacBook Pro , Mac Pro , or iMac , either , " one forum user wrote .
With the advancement of USB 2.0 on the low end , erosion from eSATA among hard drives , and a migration away from FireWire even in its home field advantage among digital video users , Apple is probably wondering the same thing .
Update : Jobs continues serve at times as Apple 's unofficial public relations department , and AppleInsider can now nod to the authenticity of the aforementioned email with a high degree of certainty .
Since our publication of his original email Thursday , Jobs has since exchanged another pair of emails with David , both of which be seen here :

Hi Steve ,
Thanks for the fast response !
In answer to your statement , though , I decided to look at the selection of camcorders on BestBuy.com since I believe they represent a pretty average staple of what consumer electronics people are buying .
Although you are correct that ( almost ) all of the new HD camcorders use USB 2.0 , there are still many , many standard definition camcorders ( read : Â affordableÂ for average Joes ) that require firewire .
Does this mean to say that Apple no longer supports average Joes from making home movies on their computers ?
In other words , if I have a $ 300 firewire camcorder and a new MacBook , should n't I be able to edit videos of my kid's birthday just as easily as someone who has a MacBook Pro and a $ 1200 HD camcorder ?

A motorbike racer has died in hospital following a crash in the British leg of the World Supersport Championship at Brands Hatch .
Honda rider Craig Jones , 23 , of Peterborough , suffered serious head injuries in the ninth round on Sunday .
He was transferred to the Royal London Hospital by Kent Air Ambulance but died in the early hours of Monday .
His team manager paid tribute to him as one of Britain 's " brightest hopes " in world championship motorcycle racing .
Parkalgar Honda team manager Simon Buckmaster said : " The team 's thoughts are with Craig 's family and friends at this very difficult time .
" Craig 's family passes on its thanks to all well - wishers . "
' Wonderful rider '
The rider , who lived in Peterborough , but was originally from Northwich , Cheshire , was fighting for the lead when he crashed at Clark Curve .
Mr Jones won the 1996 British Junior Mini-Moto Championship , the 1997 British Senior Mini-Moto Championship , 2002 British Junior Superstock Championship and numerous race victories and awards .
In 2005 he finished runner - up in the British Supersport Championship before moving to the World Superbike Championship for 2006 .
In 2007 he finished fifth in the World Supersport Championship .
Jonathan Palmer , chief executive of MotorSport Vision which owns the racetrack , said Mr Jones was a " determined and professional " rider .
" I am so desperately sad that Craig died from the injuries he sustained at Brands Hatch yesterday , " he said .
" Britain has lost a wonderful rider whom I admired enormously and had every chance of being a future world champion .
" It is fitting that the abiding memory so many of us will have of Craig was him riding brilliantly , battling for the lead of an incredible race , in front of his home crowd . "
The Tasmanian Police Commissioner Jack Johnston is to contest allegations he passed on confidential police information to government ministers .
The 58 - year - old was granted bail after being charged this morning with two counts of disclosing official secrets .
Jack Johnston pleaded not guilty to the charges during a brief appearance in the Magistrates Court in Hobart .
As he walked into the dock , the Commissioner smiled and waved to his family and friends sitting in the back of the courtroom .
Among those supporters was former Deputy Premier Max Bingham .
It is alleged that in April , Johnston disclosed official secrets by alerting the then Premier Paul Lennon about a police investigation involving the appointment of a new Solicitor General .
Johnston is also accused of forwarding a secret briefing document about that investigation to the state 's Police Minister .
Johnston 's lawyer David Gunson asked that the matter be adjourned until February when his client will appear in the Criminal Court in Hobart .
OK , let me say it again , I have a problem with the 2008 Nobel Prize winning economist Paul Krugman .
I am glad that while my economist friend Gary has his Krugman issues , he still links to and thinks Krugman gave a good explanation of what triggers the subprime mess in this Dec 2007 Google Talk .
Enjoy this talk by Obi-Wan Krugman .

P.S. Funny ( or not so funny ) joke by Paul @ 1:05:15 , “ We now have fair trade with China .
They send us poison toys .
We send them fraudulent securities . ”
They told us it was a rescue ; not a bailout : what they forgot to specify was that they were rescuing the banks and their corporate co-conspirators , and NOT the taxpaying public whose money they are still so freely using !
This was only part of this Crime of the Century !
The reason that the European Bailout is working , is because for their banks to partake in their government 's infusion of liquidity ; corporate officers of those banks must resign .
The US did not demand the same tough terms over here , which proves the point that this was always about saving the same people that caused this near collapse !
In fact what actually happened here was criminal and pre-planned .
The self - appointed " managers " of this near - meltdown used every minute of those eight days of anguish to drag this country and the world to the edge of oblivion .
In the state of mind thus produced ' the public was willing to accept any " deal " that promised any relief at all from what was fast becoming a total meltdown , for far too many people , that had already begun to see their hard won assets going up in smoke !
These criminals are using some of the oldest tricks in the archives of criminal behavior to get exactly what they set out to achieve .
And the public has swallowed this " lure , " hook , line and sinker !
Look at how much was lost to millions of people because the government did not maintain oversight over any of the financial community 's most notorious thieves and con-artists .
Government failed in its duty to protect the public from worthless investments , bogus mortgage acquisitions , completely fraudulent transfers of junk securities ; and all the while they were telling the public " American markets are sound and reliable , there is nothing to worry about ! "
The size of that lie is what produced the meltdown !
All that was lost was due in large part to mismanagement and to the criminal behavior by government & financial figureheads that was entered into to delude the public while personally reaping illicit billions : yet no one has called for the heads of any of these major criminals to roll ; so we continue with business as usual ?
Where are the lawsuits , where is the outrage that must be converted into compensatory re-actions to this hijacking of the public 's confidence and ultimately the theft of so much of the future that used to belong to so many millions of people !
If more proof is needed that this crime is still unfolding ; then you only need to remember that the North American Union is still on track to take over the entre economy and that the dollar is still scheduled to be replaced by the Amero , sooner rather than later !
Troops were deployed in this country to quell any public uprising just before this crime was announced : and they 're still here , and may soon be augmented .
If the public ever figures out that this " reprieve " is just more smoke & mirrors in a much greater heist ; then it will take a lot more troops to quell the very real rage that will follow upon that news coming home to the victims of this continuing Bailout of the Bandits , while they continue to fleece the terrified herd !
Americans have been quietly dying in their tiny little bubbles ; hoping against hope " that for a change , something might really change ! "
Sorry there will not be any cavalry coming to our rescue : instead we 're only going to get more of the same , until the last drop of profits are finally squeezed from our starving hands !
There is still a very long way to go - yet - the public will cling to this euphoria as if it were Christmas - in - October : instead of demanding their money back for everything that they 've already lost so far !
Listen to the ' candidates ' scurry through the crumbs looking for some in - tact piece of meat to offer to the victims .
The public needs to spit on rebates or tax - credits ; and on anything that is not immediate and spendable money in their hands !
The government enabled the theft of huge amounts of wealth and that needs to be repaid in - kind with interest :
Then the thieves need to spend the rest of their days in penniless - isolation , from all other human beings !
That would constitute a real BAILOUT , because it would get to the core of this problem that so far has yet to even be touched !
This government in the middle of this meltdown has used this fact to cover up their passage of the largest military spending bill in US history .
" WHILE THE NATION REMAINED fixated on the nearly $ 1 trillion Congress gave to criminal bankers and investment firms on Wall Street , the House and Senate quietly passed the largest military spending legislation to date loaded with pork and gifts for the military - industrial complex .
On September 24 , the House passed the $ 612.5 billion fiscal year 2009 defense budget bill with no debate by a vote of 392 to 39 .
The massive measure had already passed the Senate on Sept. 17 by a vote of 88 to eight .
This unprecedented appropriations legislation breezed through Congress despite a bevy of earmarks because of pressure put on conservative Republicans and far - left Democrats to be " patriotic " and to " support the troops . " "
( 1 ) This had NOTHING TO DO WITH THE TROOPS , and everything to do with the Defense Industry and with the secret no -bid contractors that are already rolling in illicit billions !
This , while the government is supposedly fixated on trying to solve the meltdown problem , given that the nation is so broke !
Crime upon crime , criminality upon deceit and a generous portion of public lies that has been poured over all our days , yet seemingly all we chose to do about it - is to beg for even more of the same - no alterations in the composition of the government is apparently required !
Had we used IMPEACHMENT when it mattered , this could not have happened : but then Pelosi FORBADE the public from using our constitutional right to throw out our thoroughly corrupt leaders .
Do you still think that this is over yet ?
There is no " safe or distant way " to confront this nightmare .
You have to get involved if you want to see a change , because no politician will ever do this for you !
It 's your money , or rather it was your money : but is n't there still more that remains for you to lose !
It 's your call America : if you begin to talk among yourselves maybe you can find some ways to take this on and actually WIN for a change !
In any case that would beat just waiting for the other shoes to drop because this wo n't be over till all the accounts have been emptied !

Django ->
Plone :
Things that make me go , Hmmmm .
[ This continues from my previous post about my Django - to - Plone odyssey .
My first post in the series explains why I ’m learning Plone , and the caveats that apply . ]
For your enlightenment or amusement , here are some things I ’m bumping into this week .
Skins vs. browser directories
From the Plone Theme Reference and other sources , I ’ve learned about the dual existence of the skins and browser subdirectories .
Ick .
Both can hold templates , CSS , and images .
The Theme Reference ’s explanation of which one to use was n’t very clear , at least to me .
Penn State ’s WebLion site had more easily understood advice , but when to use which directory is still fuzzy .
The names of the two directories do n’t help at all — they provide zero mnemonic assistance .
In contrast , Django has one folder for all site static media ( the admin interface also has its own folder ) , and you can organize it however you wish .
( Flat , subdirectories , whatever . )
Ditto for templates .
I needed about 30 seconds to understand all of that in Django ; compared to an hour or so of multiple readings for Plone , and I still do n’t think I understand it .
Skin registration complexity
When I create a new skin , I have to make four edits to two XML files just to register it ?
Gaaaaaaaa !
Through The Web ( TTW ) adds lots of complexity
Providing TTW access to a site ’s design appears to add a lot of complexity to multiple Plone and Zope areas .
That , coupled with TTW ’s limitations , and how site development works in the real world , makes me suspect that it ’s not worth it .
Doing significant editing in a simple TTW form would be laborious , and you wo n’t have any of your normal development tools to help you .
So it ’s suitable for only quick fixes and small changes — on the production server , where you should never be hacking anyway .
Python scripts are lobotomized constrained by Zope 2 ’s security policy .
I did n’t think it was possible for Python to be unpythonic , but it is in Zope 2 .
constrained by Zope 2 ’s security policy .
I did n’t think it was possible for Python to be unpythonic , but it is in Zope 2 .
Having only one way to do something is much easier to learn .
And developer resources can be focused on fixing and improving “ the one way to do it . ”
Martijn Faassen wrote in his blog about the problems and opportunities faced by Zope 2 developers , including TTW development .
I ’ll probably attend the session on this topic in the D.C. Plone conference .
( I have n’t read about , and therefore do n’t understand , Zope 3 ’s TTW treatment . )
Site developers always have access to the file system , so I do n’t see how TTW is advantageous for non-trivial site creation .
In every other common web framework I know of , you edit files , test those files , and then propagate them up to production .
And this is what you have to do in Plone 3 / Zope 2 anyway , if you ’re working on a project in a shared code pool .
For my CMS project at work , we ’ll probably use only external methods .
Legal issues with Python
Python scripts are called either “ Script ( Python ) objects ” or “ External Methods . ”
The Zope Book , 2.6 Edition , says :
Note that the torturous form of their name ( as opposed to “ Python Script ” ) is unfortunate : a legal issue prevents Zope Corporation from naming them “ Python Scripts ” , but most folks at Zope Corporation and in the Zope community refer to them in conversation as just that .
There must be a good backstory here .
I hope to learn what it is at the Plone conference .
PRINCETON , NJ -- Barack Obama has regained the edge over John McCain in Gallup Poll Daily tracking from Sept. 23 - 25 , 48 % to 45 % .
Today 's three - day rolling average includes interviewing from Tuesday through Thursday , and thus includes two days following McCain 's announcement on Wednesday afternoon that he was suspending his campaign , putting his participation in the first presidential debate on hold , and staying in Washington until lawmakers reach an agreement on a financial rescue bill .
Last night 's interviewing could also reflect public reaction to the reported breakdown of those rescue talks late Thursday afternoon .
Obama 's current three percentage point advantage , while not significant , is a return to his slight frontrunner positioning of the past week , after slipping back to a tie with McCain at 46 % in Thursday 's Gallup Poll Daily tracking report .
These small shifts in candidate support levels could be just random fluctuations given the survey 's margin of error , or could reflect public reaction to the many momentous news items coming out of Washington and Wall Street .
( To view the complete trend since March 7 , 2008 , click here . )
The propensity for Obama 's candidacy to benefit from public anxiety about the economy became apparent as Obama moved into a six - point lead over McCain in last week 's Gallup Poll Daily tracking following the financial collapses of Lehman Brothers and AIG .
With another major bank failure in the news today , and no consensus in Washington on how to fix the problems , support for Obama could again be on the rise .

Survey Methods
For the Gallup Poll Daily tracking survey , Gallup is interviewing no fewer than 1,000 U.S. adults nationwide each day during 2008 .
The general election results are based on combined data from Sept. 23 - 25 , 2008 .
For results based on this sample of 2,736 registered voters , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on landline telephones ( for respondents with a landline telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

MCCAIN WANTS A COMMISSION ….
There was a great episode of “ The Simpsons ” a few years ago , in which the city of Springfield was looking to local officials to address a crisis .
Mayor Joe Quimby , anxious to give the appearance of action without actually doing anything , announced the creation of a “ blue - ribbon commission . ”
Lenny responds earnestly , “ Did he say a blue - ribbon commission ? ” — prompting Carl to say , “ Well , you ca n’t do any better than that ! ”
Maybe the McCain campaign watches “ The Simpsons , ” too .
Republican presidential candidate John McCain on Tuesday called for a high - level commission to study the current economic crisis and claimed that a corrupt and excessive Wall Street had betrayed American workers . [ … ]
Appearing Tuesday on the three network morning shows , McCain said there was indeed a financial crisis and that to understand what had caused it , the nation would need a review on the order of the one led by the Sept. 11 commission . [ … ]
“ I warned two years ago that this situation was deteriorating and unacceptable , ” McCain said on “ Good Morning America ” on ABC .
“ And the old - boy network and the corruption in Washington is directly involved and one of the causes of this financial crisis that we ’re in today .
And I know how to fix it and I know how to get things done . ”
Is it me , or is this message a little disjointed ?
McCain knows precisely why this crisis unfolded , and he wants a commission to help him determine precisely why this crisis unfolded .
McCain saw this coming two years ago ( for which we ’re supposed to give him credit ) , but as a policy maker and presidential hopeful , he did n’t lift a finger to try to prevent or address it before it became a crisis ( for which we ’re not supposed give him credit ) .
McCain knows how to fix the crisis , but he has n’t said what this solution might be , or why he has n’t tried to implement this solution before .
He ’s going to have to do better than this .
Being a brief code fragment that makes me happy .
Thereâ€™s this little 10 - byte file called 4 c like so :
~/dev/rx / 627 > hexdump 4c 0000000 26 d0 96 e4 b8 ad f0 90 8d 86
These bytes are the UTF - 8 encoding of a particular four - character string as described in Characters vs. Bytes .
Iâ€™m running Ruby 1.9 as checked out from svn earlier today :
~/dev/rx / 628 > ruby - v ruby 1.9.0 ( 2008-09 - 19 revision 19423 ) [ i386-darwin9.4.0 ]
Thereâ€™s a new method , String#each_codepoint :
~/dev/rx / 629 > ri String#each_codepoint
--------------------------------------------------
String#each_codepoint str.each_codepoint { |integer| block } => str
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Passes the + Integer + ordinal of each character in _str_ , also known as a _codepoint_ when applied to Unicode strings to the given block .
" hello\u0639".each_codepoint { |c| print c , ' ' } _produces : _ 104 101 108 108 111 1593
And it works !
( Disclaimer : I probably am not using the best and simplest idiom . )
~/dev/rx / 630 > irb irb( main ) :001:0 > u = File.read( '4c').force_encoding ( ' UTF - 8' ) => " & Ğ–ä¸­ğ��† " irb( main ) : 002:0 > u.each_codepoint { |c| printf ( " U+%04X

This is a quick screencast to show you the data export solution I 've created for Google App Engine that lets you backup your application 's datastore and restore it either locally on your development machine or on the same Google App Engine application on the deployment environment or on a different Google App Engine application ( which you can use as a staging environment ) .
That 's right , this solves one of the big criticisms I 've seen levelled at Google App Engine , which is that there is no way to export your data from your applications .
With this solution , not only can you export your data but you can also easily restore it .
I am going to be sharing the solution with you in the coming days as a separate open source project in the form of a Django application that you can plug into your own applications as part of the Singularity Web Conference Open Initiatives program ( stay tuned for updates on that front ) .
In the meanwhile , watch the screencast to see how the backup and restore solution works .

The first and only vice presidential debate was filled with talk of policy by Joe Biden , and talking points from Sarah Palin .
If there was any doubt left that this woman does n’t belong on a national ticket in any capacity , that doubt was answered tonight .
Palin may have scored style points , but Biden is the person Americans should trust in the White House .
We were promised Sarah Barracuda , but instead we got an overmatched hockey mom who sounded more like the vice president of the PTA , than a potential vice president of the United States .
Palin demonstrated no grasp of policy , and no policy specifics .
The McCain campaign sent Sarah out there to charm America , but charm does not get a nation out of an economic crisis .
Joe Biden delivered exactly what was expected of him a solid performance of a man who is ready to serve as vice president .
For example , let ’s compare the two candidates ’ answers on deregulation .
Joe Biden brought up John McCain ’s plan to deregulate the healthcare industry , “ So what you had is you had overwhelming “ deregulation . ”
You had actually the belief that Wall Street could self - regulate itself .
And while Barack Obama was talking about reinstating those regulations , John on 20 different occasions in the previous year and a half called for more deregulation .
As a matter of fact , John recently wrote an article in a major magazine saying that he wants to do for the health care industry deregulate it and let the free market move like he did for the banking industry .
Advertisements
Palin chose to talk about taxes , “ I would like to respond about the tax increases .
We can speak in agreement here that darn right we need tax relief for Americans so that jobs can be created here .
Now , Barack Obama and Sen. Biden also voted for the largest tax increases in U.S. history .
Barack had 94 opportunities to side on the people ’s side and reduce taxes and 94 times he voted to increase taxes or not support a tax reduction , 94 times .
Now , that ’s not what we need to create jobs and really bolster and heat up our economy .
We do need the private sector to be able to keep more of what we earn and produce .
Government is going to have to learn to be more efficient and live with less if that ’s what it takes to reign in the government growth that we ’ve seen today .
But we do need tax relief and Barack Obama even supported increasing taxes as late as last year for those families making only $ 42,000 a year .
That ’s a lot of middle income average American families to increase taxes on them .
I think that is the way to kill jobs and to continue to harm our economy . ”
Joe Biden was solid on policy , but won this debate and showed his soul when he talked about his weakest trait and discussed the auto accident that claimed the life of his first wife and daughter , and having to raise to children alone , and said that he understands that people are hurting .
He understands that people need help .
Biden appeared emotional , while Palin replied with a robotic answer about mavericks .
Joe Biden revealed something about the man , while Sarah Palin stuck to the script .
The McCain campaign needed a momentum changer .
Sarah Palin needed to rehabilitate her image .
Unfortunately , Palin ’s performance reinforced the perceptions of her caused by her media interviews .
The McCain campaign is trying to win this election with character and charm , without talking about issues .
There was no big gaffe by either candidate , and not much interaction between the two .
Palin did n’t offer anything different or new .
She was big on style , but short on substance .
She ducked and dodged questions , and did not look like a person who is ready to be vice president .
Partial Debate Transcript

While campaigning in Dayton , Ohio today , Barack Obama continued his attack on John McCain ’s mortgage plan , by not only picking it apart but also called out McCain for shifting his position on the issue .
The Democrat went after McCain ’s flip flop , “ Now , this is just the latest in a series of shifting positions that Senator McCain has taken on this issue .
His first response to this crisis in March was that homeowners should n’t get any help at all .
Then , a few weeks ago , he put out a plan that basically ignored homeowners .
And now , in the course of 12 hours , he ’s ended up with a plan that punishes taxpayers , rewards banks , and wo n’t solve our housing crisis . ”
He also pointed out that the McCain plan would reward lenders for bad behavior and
give them no incentive to help homeowners , “ But it ’s not just that the McCain bailout rewards irresponsible lenders , it ’s that his bailout would make it more likely that those lenders keep up their bad behavior .
Just yesterday , Countrywide , one of the nation ’s largest lenders , reached an agreement to help homeowners refinance their mortgages .
Under Senator McCain ’s plan , lenders like Countrywide would n’t have any incentive to come forward and help homeowners – because they could just wait for the government to bail them out . ”

Obama also went back to the theme that McCain is an erratic and uncertain leader , “ Well , I do n’t think we can afford that kind of erratic and uncertain leadership in these uncertain times .
We need steady leadership in the White House .
We need a President we can trust in times of crisis .
And that ’s the kind of President I intend to be . ”
The most dramatic change in this race is the role reversal caused by the economic crisis .
When the campaign revolved around foreign policy , McCain was viewed as the steady hand , but as campaign shifted to the economy , McCain fell apart , and Obama became the candidate that voters see as the safer choice .
McCain has flip flopped on a number of issues in this campaign from offshore drilling to immigration he has moved to the right .
The problem for him is that these shifts due undermine his theme of leadership , and make him look indecisive , impulsive , and erratic .
Obama is on the money to call this proposal by McCain what it is .
It is a flip flop to get him in line with public opinion , and a gift to lenders who got themselves into trouble with poor business practices .
I do n’t understand how McCain can rail against the greed of Wall St. one day , then on the next propose that the government pay to bail out lenders who resisted helping homeowners for months while this crisis built .
The reality is that McCain has no ideas or plans for the economy , and this could both end up being his downfall , and the issue that elects Barack Obama president .

For the last 10 years , I have been asking people more knowledgeable than I , " How big should my swap be ? " and the answer has always been " Just set it to twice your RAM and forget about it . "
In the old days , it was n't much to think about — 128 megs of RAM means 256 megs of swap .
Now that I have 4 gigs of RAM in my laptop , I find myself wondering , " Is 8 gigs of swap really necessary ? "
How much swap does the average desktop user really need ?
Does the whole " twice your RAM " rule still apply ?
If so , for how much longer will it likely apply ?
Or will it always apply ?
Or have I been consistently misinformed over the last 10 years ?
Everyone who has owned a cellphone over the last 10 years should at some point pour one out in thanks to Cliff Kushler , one of the inventors of the T9 text entry system that knows you mean " DONKEY " when you type 366539 in an SMS .
Now Cliff is smartly shifting his focus on touchscreens with Swype - a way to type blindingly fast on a touchscreen by tracing your finger or stylus over the letters you want without lifting up , connect - the - dots style .
It looks frankly amazing in a demo - so amazing that we remembered we 've seen it somewhere before .
Thankfully , it could be heading to the iPhone and Android really , really soon .
Click to view
This is the demo Kushler gave to CNET , where he claims he can get a blazing 50 words per minute with the system .
And we believe him - it 's quite a sight .
And then we remembered Writing Pad - a demo of an Android text editor that uses the exact same interface :
Turns out , as the folks at jkOnTheRun also point out , that the idea of this kind of input system has been around since 2004 ( when touchscreens were still kind of from the future ) , when it was developed by IBM and called SHARK .
Now , SHARK is called ShapeWriter , who are the developers of the WritingPad Android app and a similar app for the iPhone .
How about that ?
Swype is currently near prime time for Windows Mobile , with an SDK to bring it to other platforms in the works .
ShapeWriter 's Android version of WritingPad is forthcoming , and their iPhone version , which was released briefly before being pulled from the App Store for reasons unknown , should be back soon .
No matter who brings it , I 'm liking this .

Kevin Grandia confesses to being somewhat surprised by the magnitude of interest in his new Web site , VoteForEnvironment.ca .
In a phone interview with the Georgia Straight , Grandia said that he and Alice Klein , cofounder of NOW Magazine in Toronto , spent six months designing the site , which gives citizens guidance on a riding - by - riding basis if they want to vote strategically to stop the Conservatives from being reelected .
Since the site was launched late last month , Grandia said , it has generated almost half a million page views .
" I ca n’t keep up with the e-mail we ’re getting — the fan mail , " Grandia said .
" We ’ve been saying it from the beginning : environment is a big issue in this election . "
Grandia is operations manager of DeSmogBlog ( www.desmogblog.com ) , a Web site that exposes how industry has financially supported those who deny the reality of climate change .
He said that last December he started thinking about how to stop the Conservatives out of concern over Prime Minister Stephen Harper ’s climate - change policies .
Last month , UVic climate scientist Andrew Weaver told the Straight he recommends voting strategically to stop the Conservatives .
Weaver , lead author on three reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , was quoted in last week ’s Straight condemning the Harper government for muzzling Environment Canada climate scientists .
Grandia noted how it dawned on him earlier this year that Republican presidential candidate John McCain ’s climate - change plan is far more progressive than Harper ’s , which focuses on reducing the intensity of greenhouse - gas emissions .
" The only friend Canada had left with the stance Harper was taking was George Bush , " Grandia said .
" When George Bush is gone , we will literally be the international pariah on this issue . "
In November 2009 , countries will meet in Copenhagen to negotiate international greenhouse - gas - emissions targets for the period after the Kyoto Protocol expires in 2012 .
If Harper remains prime minister , Grandia contended , there ’s no reason to believe that Canada will play a constructive role .
Grandia said he might bring his polar - bear costume to this conference , to highlight the importance of curbing greenhouse - gas emissions .
" The polar bears are going on a slow boat to Copenhagen , " he joked .
As for Metro Vancouver , the site offers guidance in eight hotly contested local ridings .
In Burnaby - Douglas — where there ’s a hard - fought race between New Democrat Bill Siksay , Liberal Bill Cunningham , Conservative Ronald Leung , and Doug Perry of the Greens — the site was recommending Siksay as the Straight went to press on October 1 .
In Vancouver Quadra , the site recommended Liberal Joyce Murray over NDP candidate David Caplan , Conservative Deborah Meredith , and Green candidate Dan Grice .
" If the NDP goes up and the Conservatives drop down , you might see our picks automatically change to NDP instead of Liberal or Green or Bloc Québécois or whatever in specific ridings , " Grandia said .
" It ’s fully automated . "
The Strategic Counsel , an Ontario - based market - research firm that does polling for CTV and the Globe and Mail , has identified nine " battleground ridings " in Metro Vancouver , including Burnaby - Douglas and Vancouver Quadra .
In the two battleground races on the North Shore , VoteForEnvironment .ca endorsed one incumbent , Liberal candidate Don Bell ( North Vancouver ) , and advised " You Choose " in West Vancouver–Sunshine Coast–Sea to Sky Country , where Green candidate Blair Wilson is the incumbent .
The site supported Liberal candidates Brenda Locke and incumbent Sukh Dhaliwal in Fleetwood –Port Kells and Newton–North Delta , respectively .
New Democrat incumbent Dawn Black was favoured in New Westminster–Coquitlam .
In Richmond , the site picked Liberal incumbent Raymond Chan as the best bet .
Grandia used to work for Chan as a constituency assistant and policy adviser , but he noted that Klein is a long - time supporter of the NDP .
He emphasized that the choices are made based on a combination of polls .
" Most of the people out there who are willing to fight for these issues usually have a political background , " Grandia said .
" I ’ve seen the power of being able to insert yourself into a national dialogue .
And if the parties are n’t going to talk about the environment , then I ’m going to .
That was really what it came down to . "
Will Canadians decide to vote strategically ?
> 54 percent of Liberal voters would vote for a candidate they dislike to reduce the chance of a Conservative government ( Toronto Star / Angus Reid poll ) .
> 47 percent of NDP voters would vote for a candidate they dislike to reduce the chance of a Conservative government ( Toronto Star / Angus Reid poll ) .
> 44 percent of Green voters would vote for a candidate they dislike to reduce the chance of a Conservative government ( Toronto Star / Angus Reid poll ) .
> 64 percent of Canadians think a Conservative majority would result in less funding for arts and film programs ( Toronto Star / Angus Reid poll ) .
> 52 percent of Canadians are worried about Stephen Harper forming a majority government ( Globe and Mail / CTV poll by the Strategic Counsel ) .
> 81 percent of Canadians are not likely to switch their vote , even if the Conservatives are going to form a majority ( Globe and Mail / CTV poll by the Strategic Counsel ) .
> 45 percent of B.C. voters in battleground ridings feel it ’s time for a change , and that a new government should be elected ( Globe and Mail / CTV poll by the Strategic Counsel ) .

GOP official : McCain Michigan pullout a ' dumbass stunt '
RAW STORY
Published : Sunday October 5 , 2008
Print This Email This One Michigan official was not satisfied with the explanation the McCain campaign gave for the Thursday decision to pull out of his state , according to an e-mail obtained by Politico on Sunday .
" With 30 days before the election , the campaign must decide where it can best utilize its limited resources with the goal of winning nationally and ensuring John McCain is our next President , " McCain 's Michigan state director Al Ribeiro explained , while urging activists to keep working , adding that McCain " had n't given up on the state . "
" If you are going to end visits to the state by McCain / Palin , do it , " Emmet County GOP Chairman Jack Waldvogel replied , copying a list of Michigan Republicans .
" Just do n't formally announce that you are ' pulling out ' of Michigan , and then come back two days later asking the base core of support to ' keep working . '
What a slap in the face to all the thousands of people who have been energized by the addition of Sarah Palin to the ticket .
I 've been involved in County Party politics and organization for 40 years , and this is the biggest dumbass stunt I have ever seen . "
" He has given up on our State ?
What a total and complete crock of crap , " Waldvogel added .
" Again , I think McCain owes the Republicans and the People of Michigan a HUGE APOLOGY .
SOON !... How on earth are we to get people to work for McCain here , when he has already , publicly , in the media , given up on Michigan ?
We feel abandoned , we are disappointed , and we are heartsick to know that we are n't important enough for him to fight for . "
The nature versus nurture argument over aptitude for science and math seems to resurface every few years , but recent studies are providing strong support for the argument that any gender gap is cultural rather than biological .
A new report looks beyond standardized tests of mathematical skills to see what happens in the world of exceptional mathematical ability , and it finds that the same thing applies there .
The report 's authors , reasoning that we could use any talent that 's out there , make some suggestions as to how to eliminate the people who get lost due to this cultural math gap .
The study ( PDF ) is published in the Notices of the American Mathematical Society , which is an open access publication , meaning anyone can read the paper .
The authors start by reinforcing the general conclusion that advanced math skills do not exhibit a biological gender gap .
Administering the SAT math test to 13 - year - olds 25 years ago resulted in top scores skewed thirteenfold in favor of boys .
By 2005 , males outperformed females by less than threefold , and the rate was still dropping .
But the bulk of the report focuses on exceptional achievement , examining performance in tests like the Putnam Mathematical Competition and the International Mathematical Olympiad .
For these competitions , mathematical problem skills are nowhere near sufficient ; students are tested on the ability to generate elaborate proofs of complex mathematical concepts .
Most students who attempt the Putnam , for example , fail to handle any of its dozen problems within the six hours allotted .
Those who excel here are , in the authors ' view , literally one in a million .
Unfortunately , given their rarity , it 's hard to do a robust statistical analysis of these exceptional talents .
Still , the authors can detect a number of trends when it comes to gender , ethnicity , and social factors , and their connections to mathematical achievement .
Their first point is that people from Asian nations and Central Europe do extraordinarily well , and this often includes the women from these nations .
This is n't uniform , however ; Japan has only put a single woman on its team in recent decades .
However , she happened to be an exception that supported the authors ' contention that gender has nothing to do with it , since she was that team 's top scorer .
Money and a large starting pool of talent also seem to have little impact .
Bulgaria and Romania consistently did well , despite their small populations and economies .
Meanwhile , none of the Western European nations were able to consistently score well over the last few decades .
The US was an informative exception ; it frequently did reasonably well , and the teams it sent often included women .
But those women were often from Asian or Central European countries and , in many cases , had received much of their mathematical training overseas .
The authors conclude that the scarcity of women at the highest levels of math " is due , in significant part , to changeable factors that vary with time , country , and ethnic group . "
They estimate that , globally , the lower bound for female achievement would see them account for somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 percent of the highest honors , even without compensating for the cultural issues they face .
With that in mind , they attempted to identify the cultural issues that were holding women back in the US .
For both males and females , family culture played a big role , as the children of first - generation immigrants from Asia and Central Europe did well ; so did Jewish students .
Since the gender gap first appears on math tests in middle school , the authors examined factors that might protect students form social pressures at this age .
They found that high achievers often came from towns populated by the faculty of nearby academic centers ; several of them were also home schooled , which isolates them from social pressures .
Finally , many of them engaged in extracurricular mathematical education , such as programs hosted at local colleges , and some even engaged private tutors .
The authors argue that we can't afford to have social factors rob us as a society of the people who have the most to contribute to math , either directly or through its application to science and technology .
To foster a better environment , they provide a list of recommendations .
Some of these are fairly standard — improve early math education and foster a better public image for math .
But they also argue that we need to expand access to high schools dedicated to high achievers in math and science and provide greater access to programs that place advanced public school students at local universities .
Due to the small population of high achievers , a lot of the information in the study appears somewhat anecdotal .
Still , its authors present a compelling case that , even at the highest level , mathematical achievement is largely a matter of cultural priorities .

Friends , Enemies , and " Existential " Threats
In the ceaseless and invariably bellicose calls for war ( both open and clandestine ) against Iran , perhaps one argument invoked by pro-war pundits and politicians stands out and takes pride of place above all others : Iran , it is claimed , " poses an existential threat to the state of Israel . "
It ’s certainly been a favorite of Republican presidential nominee , John McCain .
Furthermore , Sarah Palin , McCain ’s running mate , when asked about America ’s response in the event of a unilateral Israeli military strike against Iran , repeated an astounding three times the AIPAC - by - rote reply : " I do n’t think that we should second - guess the measures that Israel has to take to defend themselves and for their security . "
The argument : because Iran has been cited as an " imminent threat " to the security of Israel , a " nuclear Iran " is deemed unacceptable .
As a result , both Israel and the United States are permitted to avail themselves of " all options " to neutralize the " Iranian threat . "
In short , the Bush Doctrine holds , and preventive war with Iran is warranted .
Meanwhile , occupations and insurgencies continue to rage in Afghanistan , Iraq , and more recently , the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan .
In addition , and as anyone familiar with the history of the modern Middle East can tell you , Israel has proven in the past to have very few qualms about bombing its neighbors .
It has meticulously followed a policy of " bomb first , ask questions later " in Lebanon , Iraq , and , most recently , Syria .
A story that has thus far received rather patchy coverage in the Western media , however , Iranian Vice President for Cultural Heritage and Tourism Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei ’s " controversial " comments two months ago regarding Israel and the Israeli people .
Mashaei ’s little - publicized remark ?
“ Today Iran is the friend of the people of the United States and Israel , and no nation in the world is our enemy . ”
Not quite the apocalyptic banter readers of the Western press associate with the Islamic Republic , that bunch of crazed , wild , and irrational zealots the Bush administration contends it ’s impossible to negotiate with .
This surreal charade is maintained despite the fact that the U.S. has been negotiating with Iran over the security situation inside Iraq and Afghanistan to great effect ( Patrick Cockburn in fact credits the convergence of Iranian and U.S. objectives for the " success " of " the surge , " as without Iran ’s cooperation , stability in Iraq ca n’t possibly be achieved ) and has also been on the sidelines of Iran ’s nuclear - program negotiations with the European Union .
Though Mashaei ’s comments predictably sparked the ire of the right - wing establishment ( and have since been partly rebutted by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei at last week ’s Friday prayers , which remains problematic ) , President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad at a news conference in Tehran said , “ Mashaei ’s position represents that of the government . "
Ahmadinejad added , " Our nation does n’t have a problem with nations or people . "
Ahmadinejad emphasized that Mashaei ’s comments were unrelated to the dispossession of the Palestinian people .
Despite stern opposition , Ahmadinejad , whose son is married to Mashaei ’s daughter , has refused to yield to pressure from a number of senior clergymen to sack the minister .
Mashaei ’s comments are important for a number of reasons ; chief among them is that they show the Iranian political establishment is not a monolithic entity .
Even among so - called hardliners there are cleavages on numerous issues about which there seems to be a chronic lack of consensus .
Factionalism among the hardliners was undoubtedly one of the reasons why Mohammad Khatami was able to clinch the presidency in 1997 , and it will offer further opportunities for reformist gains and additional bilateral negotiations with the U.S. in the future .
It must be said , however , that Ahmadinejad has slightly fudged the issue to quell the tide of vitriol emanating from the right - wing establishment of which he is an integral part .
In this respect , the remarks should be greeted positively but with caution .
Mashaei ’s comments are a far cry from the endlessly mistranslated comments by Ahmadinejad in which he allegedly said that “ Israel should be wiped off the map . "
As anyone even slightly familiar with the Persian language can testify ; his words were willfully distorted to grab headlines and demonize the Iranian president for reasons of political expediency . [ 1 ]
Though Ahmadinejad ’s actual words were rightfully seen as offensive , they in no way constitute a direct threat to the nation of Israel .
The same cannot be said for the words of Israeli Infrastructure Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer , who has plainly stated that any attack on the Jewish state would result in the “ destruction of the Iranian nation . "
Iranian politicians know this only too well , and for this reason would never seriously consider launching an unprovoked attack against Israel .
With Israel ’s present nuclear arsenal said to stand at some 200 nuclear warheads , even the more bellicose amongst the Iranian leadership grasp that a nuclear strike against Israel would be tantamount to national suicide .
However , even this statement presumes that Iran has a nuclear weapons program in the first place .
According to the 2007 National Intelligence Estimate , Iran ’s weapons program was frozen back in 2003 , making the premise of a " nuclear Iran " propagated by Washington and Israeli hawks somewhat redundant .
Ben -Eliezer ’s threat of " retaliatory " genocide has gone unchallenged by the same pundits who could n’t help themselves but warn the world of the " genocidal ambitions " harbored by the Islamic Republic .
The chorus of threats and psychological warfare against Iran has even been joined by high - profile Democrats such as Sen.
Hillary Clinton , who infamously said that in the event of an attack on Israel , " we would be able to totally obliterate them [ the Iranians ] . "
Oversimplifying Iranian - Israeli Relations
It ’s often claimed that the shah enjoyed good relations with Israel prior to the revolution .
Though this has some truth to it , the reality was not quite so rosy , since the cordiality and warmth of Iranian - Israeli relations was prone to vacillate according to Iran ’s regional aspirations , rather than out of some kind of natural affinity between the two states .
For example , as Dr. Trita Parsi , president of the National Iranian - American Council , has observed , in his indispensable book , Treacherous Alliance : The Secret Dealings of Israel , Iran , and the United States , upon the signing of the Algiers Accord in 1975 with Saddam Hussein , Iranian - Israeli relations became quite fraught as the shah moved toward a more pro-Arab policy in a bid to secure Arab recognition of Iranian regional hegemony .
[ 2 ]
Much to the dismay of the Israelis , the shah ’s government also voted in November 1975 in favor of UN General Assembly Resolution 3379 , which stated that " Zionism [ the ideology upon which the Jewish state is predicated ] is a form of racism and racial discrimination . " [ 3 ]
That being said , there is little doubt that upon the cusp of revolution , opposition to Israel ’s occupation of East Jerusalem , the West Bank , and Gaza was essential to the ideological disposition of the revolutionaries on both the Left and the religious Right .
Among the Islamists , opposition to Israel stemmed from solidarity with the Palestinian people and anger over the occupation of Jerusalem , the Dome of the Rock , and al - Aqsa mosque , which is considered the third holiest site in Islam .
The shah was partially blamed by a number of clerics and secular intellectuals for his role in facilitating Israel ’s military conquests , since he had consistently satiated Israel ’s demand for oil over the decades .
Israel had also been a key participant in the establishment and training of the shah ’s secret police , the SAVAK [ 4 ] , who were responsible for the torture , arbitrary arrest , and extrajudicial killing of dissidents .
For many of the revolutionaries , this fact helped crystallize their animosity toward Tel Aviv .
Finally , there was , of course , good old guilt by association , which branded Israel an enemy of the Islamic state for its close ties to Washington .
The revolutionaries often disparagingly referred to Israel as " little America . "
Beyond considerations of realpolitik , it ’s well - known that the ideological fervor of the Islamic Revolution set itself up in opposition to the " twin evils " of American imperialism and Zionism .
However , the rhetoric of the heady days of quoting Fanon , calling for the export of the revolution , and demanding that the " wretched of the earth " revolt against their oppressors mellowed long ago [ 5 ] ; what has taken its place has been the pursuit of the Islamic Republic ’s perceived national interests and regional self - aggrandizement .
Tehran ’s calculated use of inflammatory rhetoric has been largely instrumental in shoring up support under the imprimatur of an Islamic vanguard , a role that finds itself intrinsically limited by virtue of Iran being a Shi’ite and non-Arab power .
The shah similarly realized that he could never achieve unchallenged regional hegemony without Arab acquiescence for almost exactly the same reason .
It should be said that this geopolitical dynamic has been dramatically altered with the American - led coalition ’s overthrow of the Ba’athist regime of Saddam Hussein in March 2003 and the effective empowerment of Iraq ’s long - suppressed Shi’ite majority .
Distinguishing Between Judaism and Zionism
During the Islamic Revolution , Ayatollah Khomeini was explicit in distinguishing between the Jewish religion , which he saw as part of the " Abrahamic " tradition , and Zionism , which he deemed a modern ideology with the sole aim of depriving the Palestinian people of their national rights and cultural identity .
Undoubtedly , such an understanding of Zionism is reductive , one - sided , and ignorant of the historical realities that necessitated its emergence , but it is not an understanding exclusive to political Islamists .
Many others of varying ideological hues have taken exception to what they regard as the discriminatory and identity - centric logic of Zionism .
This distinction has been crucial to the post - revolutionary understanding of Israel and its place in the minds of Iran ’s leadership and is maintained by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to this very day .
Iranian Jews elect their own deputy to the 270 - seat parliament and enjoy certain rights of self - administration .
Jewish burial and divorce laws are accepted by Islamic courts , and like all other Iranians , Jews are obliged to undertake military service .
It would be only half - true to point out that Ahmadinejad ’s rhetoric has been willfully mistranslated in toto and that he has said nothing that can be viewed as offensive or anti-Semitic .
He has quite clearly questioned the veracity of the Holocaust , under the sway of Mohammad - Ali Ramin , a close adviser to the Iranian president , according to veteran Iranian journalist Kasra Naji , author of Ahmadinejad : The Secret History of Iran ’s Radical Leader .
Ramin ’s fulminations against Israel and Jews often regrettably slide from criticism of the Zionist project to outright anti-Semitism [ 6 ] , a European phenomenon without historical precedent in Iranian history .
These comments and the circus that was the International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust in December 2006 leave little doubt that Ahmadinejad ’s government has at times blurred the distinction between the Jews as a people and Zionism as a political ideology , which had hitherto been a mainstay of Khomeinist doctrine .
These events were criticized not only by members of the Iranian public and press , but also by Iranian - Jewish member of the Majlis Maurice Motamed ; the mayor of Tehran , Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf ; and even Baztab , the newspaper chiefly associated with the Revolutionary Guard , which lambasted the government for pursuing an unnecessarily provocative course with the West .
Ahmadinejad ’s own proposed solution to the Arab - Israeli conflict has often been ignored or intentionally obscured , however .
Though I personally disagree with his proposal because it diverges from the international consensus enshrined in United Nations Security Council Resolution 242 , it is worthy of quotation .
The Iranian president has argued on numerous occasions that “ We believe that all the people who live there , the Jews , Muslims , and Christians , should take part in a free referendum and choose their government . "
Some might find this hard to believe , but Ahmadinejad contends that only a democratic solution can solve the 60 - year impasse dividing Palestinians from Israelis .
Moreover , it would appear that if both peoples decided on a two - state solution in a fair and transparent electoral process , Ahmadinejad would be compelled to accept the results .
Ignorance and Bigotry Are Not a Casus Belli
Though there is little doubt that Ahmadinejad thought his remarks on the Holocaust would get him headlines , it appears that through a mixture of miscalculated provocation and ignorance  the tragic history of the Holocaust simply does n’t have the same emotional resonance in the Muslim world as it does in Europe , since it rarely features in the curriculum and few know much about it  he greatly underestimated the offense and alienation such remarks would cause .
Such comments ought to be roundly condemned , of course , but as repugnant as they might be , they do n’t legitimize the case for war with Iran .
Questioning the Holocaust does not constitute a casus belli .
Iran has n’t directly threatened Israel ; it has only threatened retaliation in the event of an Israeli strike against its nuclear facilities .
As we know , Israel has already undertaken a " test - run " for such an attack , and the debate continues in Israel over whether to proceed along the military route .
Even hawkish analysts Ronen Bergman , author of The Secret War With Iran : The 30 - Year Clandestine Struggle Against the World ’s Most Dangerous Terrorist Power , has stated on al - Jazeera English ’s Riz Khan Show that Iran would never unilaterally launch a nuclear strike against Israel .
Mashaei ’s comments should be welcomed and rightfully seen as throwing into doubt the propaganda claiming Iran has some kind of implacable enmity toward the Jewish state .
The idea that conflict is inevitable between these two nations simply does n’t stand up to scrutiny .
The two countries in fact had little problem conducting business during the Iran - Iraq war in what was part of the fiasco that has since been dubbed the Iran - Contra Affair .
In other words , where Iran ’s and Israel ’s interests have converged , negotiation has been feasible .
Iran ’s relationship with Israel is more complicated than it has been portrayed in the mainstream media .
It is not one of unremitting hostility , and even Iran ’s hardliners have in the past proven to be tempered by pragmatic considerations and calculated self - interest .
Mashaei ’s distinction between the Israeli government and the Israeli people attests to the factional nuances that are so often overlooked by those beating the drum for military conflict .
Even if Ahmadinejad ’s support of Mashaei is merely an instance of pragmatism , it shows that a combination of sticks and carrots could result in fruitful negotiations and steer us clear of the path to war .
Iran ’s leaders are not beyond rational engagement , as some may have us believe .
Mashaei ’s comments show that the Iranian government is willing to distinguish between the policies of the Israeli government and the people of Israel .
This approach has long had credence among the reformist faction and those aligned to former president Khatami .
It is now even steadily penetrating the more fundamentalist factions who presently control all the major levers of power inside Iran .
For a long time to come , there will be little love lost between Tehran and Tel Aviv .
Iran analyst Karim Sadjadpour is probably correct in his assessment that a marked change in Iran ’s relations with the West or Israel will be untenable until a new occupant with a less dogmatic adherence to Khomeinist ideology replaces Khamenei as supreme leader .
War , however , is not inevitable , and an Israeli military strike cannot be justified on the charge that Iran poses either an " imminent " or an " existential " threat to Israel , given that the Ahmadinejad government has only threatened to retaliate against unprovoked Israeli aggression , and , according to the 2007 NIE , Iran has no active nuclear weapons program .
Though some of Ahmadinejad ’s comments have unfortunately slipped into the rhetoric of anti-Semitism , which should be condemned , bigotry simply does n’t merit war .
Israeli hawks have no legitimate casus belli for going to war against Iran , and any future act of aggression by either side must be staunchly opposed by antiwar activists .
[ 1 ] I ’m not going to rehash the particulars of the " wiped off the map " incident , since it has already been addressed in depth elsewhere .
The correct translation and clarification of Ahmadinejad ’s comments can be found here in a trenchant essay by Arash Norouzi and here on Professor Juan Cole ’s blog .

Woman who visited doctors 1,000 times over 20 years is finally told what 's wrong with her - and it's incurable
A woman had to visit doctors more than 1,000 times over 20 years before they finally diagnosed her illness .
Christine Wicks , 65 , first visited her doctor with persistent sore throats and ear pain in 1988 .
As the pain worsened and spread around her body , dozens of GPs and specialists blamed her problems on everything from tonsillitis and strokes to multiple sclerosis and heavy smoking - even though she has never smoked .
Long - suffering : Christine Wicks , 65 , pictured with husband Fred , has been diagnosed with a rare , debilitating infection ... after 20 years of pain
After two decades of being misdiagnosed experts finally identified the rare bacterial infection actinomycosis .
If the condition had been caught early it could have been cured completely using antibiotics but it has now caused so much scarring that Mrs Wicks will never be fully cured .
The grandmother of five has to undergo three hours of drug treatment every day just to contain the symptoms .
Actinomycosis is caused by certain bacteria entering body tissues , leading to abscesses , fever and muscle pain .
If untreated it can spread to the heart and brain and lead to meningitis .
Long time waiting : Christine and Fred 25 years ago , before she developed the disease , and now she has finally been diagnosed
Mrs Wicks said : ' It was over - whelming never knowing what was wrong .
Eventually , I went into a shell and did n't want to see any more doctors .
' I felt they thought I was making it up and at one stage I thought I needed psychiatric help .
' I had at least 1,000 visits to the doctor , although my consultant said it could have been 3,000 and I still would n't have been diagnosed because everyone was looking in the wrong place .
' The doctors just did n't know what to do with me . '
It was only when Mrs Wicks and her husband Fred , 69 , a retired engineer , moved from Essex to Long Sutton , Lincolnshire , in 2000 that she found sympathetic doctor John Jacklin .
She said : ' I went to Dr Jacklin and he had the patience to listen and find out what was really wrong .
At last there was someone who believed me .'
Dr Jacklin and staff at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King 's Lynn , Norfolk , finally diagnosed actinomycosis after testing a sample Mrs Wicks provided .
She said : ' It is such a relief to finally understand what has been happening to my body for the past 20 years .
I know I 'll never be cured but at least I can fight this .
' I have a wonderful husband and magnificent friends , and most importantly the support of doctors , which is all I ever wanted . '
Her husband Fred has now been trained to administer her drugs three times a day through an intravenous tube in her chest , which must stay in until next February when doctors will judge how effective the treatment has been .
Gruelling treatment : Fred has been specially trained to administer her drugs three times every day through a catheter into her chest
Mrs Wicks now gives talks at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital to raise awareness of her rare condition .
Despite the constant pain , she is not bitter about being let down by the medical profession .
She said : ' I 'm not angry .
There 's no point being angry .
My therapy is talking to people and making them aware of this illness . '
Her consultant Dr Syed Tariq said other doctors may have missed the actinomycosis because the bacteria die if they come into contact with oxygen .
He said Mrs Wicks is only the second case he has treated in 29 years as a doctor .
The NHS estimates one in every 300,000 people suffers from actinomycosis .
The infection often starts in the mouth or throat and will only spread if the bacteria has chance to penetrate the body 's tissues .
It can be caused by gum disease , dental surgery , or , as doctors think in Mrs Wicks 's case , a small particle of food or fish bone getting lodged in the throat .
On June 2 this year , actinomycosis sufferer Owen Reilly , 44 , from Lanarkshire , Scotland , had part of his left lung removed after doctors wrongly diagnosed him with lung cancer .
So awful it sounds like bullshit , right ?
It ’s not .
Sarah Palin likes to brag that part of her “ executive experience ” was being the Mayor of Wasilla , Alaska from 1996 - 2002 .
Well , in 2000 the town of Wasilla began charging women who claimed to be raped for their own forensic testing .
Seemed Sarah & Co. , decided that they wanted to save the tax payers the estimated $ 5000 - $ 14,000 per year that these tests cost the city .
From the Valley Frontiersman :
While the Alaska State Troopers and most municipal police agencies have covered the cost of exams , which cost between $ 300 to $ 1,200 apiece , the Wasilla police department does charge the victims of sexual assault for the tests .
Wasilla Police Chief Charlie Fannon does not agree with the new ( state - wide ) legislation ( outlawing the practice of charging victims for their tests ) , saying the law will require the city and communities to come up with more funds to cover the costs of the forensic exams .
In the past we ’ve charged the cost of exams to the victims insurance company when possible .
I just do n’t want to see any more burden put on the taxpayer , Fannon said .
Over the past few decades , the CIA controlled mainstream media in America has achieved a significant PR objective : they have made it socially unacceptable to believe that there is a conspiracy operating at the highest levels of our government .
This puts those of us who do know about the plot at high levels in an awkward position : either we pretend that we do n’t know what we know , or we risk being ridiculed and marginalized as a pathetic joke .
He who defines the language defines the parameters of the debate , and so far the conspirators are winning .
They have succeeded in imbuing the moniker “ conspiracy theorist ” with such intensely negative connotations that even most conspiracy theorists — such as 9/11 truth activists — tie themselves in knots to avoid earning that label .
Is there anything wrong with having theories ?
Of course not .
Knowledge progresses through scientists proposing a certain hypothesis ( or theory ) and then testing to see if it holds up .
It does n’t mean they are flying blind , untethered by facts .
They use the facts they already know to create theories about things that are still unknown .
Is there anything wrong with having theories about a conspiracy ?
Is it akin to having theories about leprechauns , poltergeists or Bigfoot ?
Do conspiracies exist only in the realm of fantasy or the occult ?
Definitely not .
There are dozens of vast conspiracies that have been validated by historians .
Wikipedia lists 27 “ proven conspiracies , some of which were not the subject of any widespread speculation until they were exposed . ”
That is , they used to .
The list of 27 proven conspiracies is in my article on the back page of the June issue of the Rock Creek Free Press , exactly as copied from Wikipedia in May 2008 .
That list of “ proven historical conspiracies ” was removed from Wikipedia on June 7 , 2008 , just a few days after the June issue of the Creek hit the streets of DC .
But I digress .
High level government conspiracies definitely happen .
So what exactly is wrong with having a theory about a vast plot to deceive us ?
From the point of view of the conspirators , plenty .
They cannot succeed unless their under - handed dealings remain well out of sight .
If the details of Operation Mockingbird became widely known , no one would read or watch any news from the mainstream media anymore , and their effort to control public opinion would fail .
Those in charge of the cover-ups had very good reasons for launching an all out attack on conspiracy theorists , and due to Operation Mockingbird , they are able to insert their memes into TV shows , news articles , books , movies , songs , greeting cards and comic books .
Without quite realizing how it happened , the population adopts the belief desired by the conspirators : that those who suspect conspiracies are deficient human beings in every respect .
Based on my own exposure to the MSM , I could easily conclude that conspiracy theorists are :
lonely , socially inept losers
intellectually bankrupt , oblivious to evidence
immature , still living at home with their parents
unattractive to the opposite sex , unable to find love or sex
do n’t bathe or change clothes regularly
have a tenuous grip on sanity , may be mentally ill
paranoid
No wonder no one wants to be considered a conspiracy theorist !
Many truth activists have reacted to this demonization by avoiding discussing theories , and insisting they are just asking questions .
Fomer Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura gave a lengthy news conference in Arizona on 9/11/08 about the anomalies in the government ’s story about 9/11 , and he used this tactic .
When asked his opinion about what was going on , he insisted he was just asking questions .
This approach is dishonest and ultimately unproductive .
It is disingenuous to pretend you do n’t have any theories just to avoid the dreaded “ CT ” label .
It is also nearly impossible not to have theories about something you have studied extensively ; I do n’t know a single 9/11 truth activist who does n’t .
It is also unproductive because we hold back from saying the things we know to be true .
Why should we only ask questions when we know some of the answers ?
Questions require a lot of our audience .
They require listeners to come up with the answers themselves , something not everyone has the time or inclination to do .
We should state what we know with confidence .
Another defensive measure employed by some in the truth movement ( such as author David Ray Griffin ) is to point out that the government ’s story is also a conspiracy theory .
But that dog wo n’t hunt .
For although it is technically true that any crime involving more than one person is a conspiracy , in general vernacular a “ conspiracy theorist ” is someone who has a theory about a very specific kind of conspiracy : one operating at the highest levels of our government , or above and outside our government .
No one would use the term about someone who suspects their neighbors of planning a bank heist .
For all the symmetry and beauty of Griffin ’s arguments , they are not persuasive to the man on the street .
The more destructive effect of Griffin ’s efforts is that it gives tacit assent to the meme that to be a conspiracy theorist is a bad thing , something we want to paint our enemies as being .
By trying to squirm away from the label , we only create the perception that we agree that it is a shameful thing to be , and can be hurt by that label .
Let ’s look at how two other groups , who were victims of vicious stereotypes , reclaimed the words used to attack them .
Those words are “ nigger ” and “ queer , ” and today those words no longer carry the punch they once did .
African Americans reclaimed “ nigger ” by using it to refer to each other , as did homosexuals , who took back the epithet “ queer . ”
Borrowing from their example , I hereby announce : I AM A CONSPIRACY THEORIST !
I ’m proud to be one of the clear - eyed Americans who have woken up and see how badly we ’ve been lied to .
I ’m part of a group that includes the smartest , most courageous , selfless , free - thinking and hard working people I ’ve ever met .
I reject those CIA engineered stereotypes that say that I and my fellow truthers are not the bold , brave , cutting edge change agents that we are .
Put it on a bumper sticker and shout it from the rooftops .
Say it loud and say it proud .
There is a conspiracy and I have a theory about it !
Congress is n't doing very good either , but Broder 's boy is at 22 %
Overall , the president 's approval rating has dropped five points from last week and is now the lowest of his presidency .
Only 22 percent of Americans approve of the job he 's doing , while 70 percent of Americans disapprove - a new high .
It 's still way too early , but this is encouraging .
Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama leads GOP rival John McCain 49 percent to 40 percent among registered voters in a new CBS News poll .
The nine - point spread marks an increase of four percentage points in Obama 's lead from a CBS News / New York Times survey taken last week .
Obama also leads by nine points among likely voters , 50 percent to 41 percent .
Here 's all the latest polls .
Obama is on an upswing , but still close .
And here 's the latest on the battleground states .
The latest Quinnipiac polls show Obama crossing the 50 percent threshold in all three of those states : Florida : 51 - 43 Ohio : 50 - 42 Pennsylvania : 54 - 39
I 'd expect some wild stuff to come out of McCain 's camp soon .
That 's after the Biden - Palin debate of course .
I 'd say moments after it ends .
The isolated towns of Virginia ’s Appalachian coal region are home to strong labor unions and Democratic political machines that date back generations .
Yet voters here who eagerly pushed Democrats into the Senate and the governor ’s office are resisting Barack Obama .
Some Americans say Obama ’s race and uncommon background make them uncomfortable -- here those people include Democratic precinct chairmen and get - out - the - vote workers .
Many Americans receive e-mails falsely calling Obama a Muslim -- here a local newspaper columnist has joked in print that Obama would have the White House painted black and would put Islamic symbols on the U.S. flag .
And so Obama ’s supporters , as they push to win this dead - even battleground state , are talking directly about race , betting that the best way to raise their neighbors ’ comfort level with the prospect of the first black president is to openly confront their feelings .
When Cecil E. Roberts , president of the coal miners union that shapes politics in much of this mountain region , talks to voters , he tells them that their choice is to have “ a black friend in the White House or a white enemy . ”
When Charlie Cox , an Obama supporter , hears friends fretting about Obama ’s race , he reminds them that they pull for the nearby University of Tennessee football team , “ and they ’re black . ”

Union organizer Jerry Stallard asks fellow coal workers what ’s more important : improving their work conditions or holding onto their skepticism of Obama ’s race , culture or religion .
“ We ’re all black in the mines , ” he tells them .
The presidential campaign , in the almost all - white counties of southwestern Virginia , has produced an outcome that few people expected : a frank discussion of race .
Voters sometimes sound as if they are reasoning with themselves and working through their own complex views as they talk through the choice they face this November .
“ I ’ve never been prejudiced in my life , ” said Sharon Fleming , 69 , the wife of a retired coal miner , who spends hours at the union hall calling voters on behalf of Obama .
“ My niece married a black , and I do n’t have a problem with it .
Now , I would n’t want a mixed marriage for my daughter , but I ’m voting for Obama . ”
Obama beat Hillary Rodham Clinton convincingly in the Virginia Democratic primary , but his supporters have known they face a challenge in this part of the state , just as Obama has faced challenges elsewhere among white voters from rural and working - class households .

He took 64 % of the primary vote statewide but just 9 % here in coal - rich Buchanan County , for instance , and 12 % in neighboring Dickenson County .
Though he is now the Democratic nominee , many voters are cool to him -- even some of the party ’s own leaders and precinct captains .
“ I have n’t found in my precinct one out of five that will vote for Obama , ” said Tommy Street , the party ’s vice chairman in Buchanan ( pronounced buck - AN - in ) County .
Street , 78 , counts himself among the doubters , citing Obama ’s alliance with Sen. Edward M. Kennedy ( D - Mass . ) .
He has always voted Democratic , he said , but this year plans to leave the presidential ballot blank .
Some here blame Obama ’s troubles on his mixed - race background ( his mother was a white Kansan , his father a black Kenyan ) .
Others say his journey from Hawaii and Indonesia to Harvard and big-city Chicago politics makes him an oddity .

The challenge facing Obama was on display at a recent Democratic Party dinner at Twin Valley High School in Buchanan County , deep in the mountains , about a two - hour drive from Bristol , the nearest city .
Looking out at about 70 local Democrats as they ate turkey , ham and mashed potatoes from school cafeteria trays , Phil Puckett , a local state senator who backed Clinton in the primary , said he knew that nearly everyone present had voted for Clinton and that many were not necessarily excited about Obama .
But he pleaded with them not to believe everything they were hearing about the Illinois senator , and to seize the chance to boot the GOP from the White House .
“ Do n’t miss this opportunity because someone says to you , ‘ I ’m not voting for him because he ’s Muslim , ’ ” said Puckett .
“ If there ’s a word of truth in my body , this guy is a Christian who believes in Jesus Christ . ”
Ben and Beth Bailey sat in the back and clapped politely , but they remained unpersuaded .
They said they were likely to break from their tradition of voting Democratic and might well not vote at all .

Obama “ just does n’t seem like he ’s from America , ” said Beth Bailey , 25 .
Ben Bailey , 32 , noted that Obama ’s middle name is Hussein , “ and we know what that means . ”
Beth ’s father , Josh Viers , is the party ’s Whitewood precinct chairman , responsible for working the polls and urging Democrats to vote the party line .
He came around to backing Obama only recently , and reluctantly .
“ Am I racial ?
Am I prejudiced ?
No , I ’m not , ” said Viers .
Still , he is frustrated that his job is to persuade other Democrats to back a black man .
“ Somebody in Buchanan County or in the United States can look at him and say , ‘ He ’s not my color , ’ ” said Viers .
“ Why put yourself in that position ?
We had a shot four years ago , and the people listened to lies , rumors , negative ads and got us beat .
Bush got him a second term , and look what it got us . ”

Viers said he will do his best to help Obama on election day .
But local Democratic leaders said they could not rely on all of their precinct chairs to follow suit .
That is why party officials are relieved that they can rely on another local organization : the United Mine Workers of America .
The union , which initially backed John Edwards in the Democratic primary , has a strong presence here and in other coal - producing areas .
It has field workers going door to door and making phone calls across Appalachia , with special emphasis on Virginia , Pennsylvania and Ohio -- all of them election battlegrounds .
Virginia , which has not chosen a Democrat for president since Lyndon Johnson in 1964 , and Ohio are so close in polls this year that no one can say whether Obama or Republican John McCain is ahead .
Both states are central to each campaign ’s national strategy .
Advertisement
Often , union officials show up at coal mine bathhouses during shift changes , when dozens of workers are getting dressed , to make the case for Obama .
The union portrays him as a friend of the coal industry , and argues that Obama is culturally in step with local workers .
Union literature tells them that the Democratic nominee supports gun rights , and the literature attacks McCain for opposing legislation that would make union organizing easier .
“ Barack Obama Wo n’t Take Away Your Gun , ” says one flier .
“ But John McCain Will Take Away Your Union . ”
A new 18 - minute video that the union is distributing in coal states features Roberts , the union president , talking directly about race as he addresses white workers , many them clad in jeans or denim overalls .
Advertisement
“ I could just ignore the fact that Barack Obama is African American , ” says Roberts , “ but I ’m not . ”
Roberts challenges the notion that a believing Christian could base a voting decision on a candidate ’s ethnicity .
“ We go to church , sing our songs , pray , come out and talk about , ‘ I ca n’t be for an African American , because of the color of his skin , ’ ” Roberts says in the video .
His voice rising , he then scolds the crowd : “ Ca n’t do that if you believe in the Bible . ”
Republicans say that they also are aggressively courting coal miners and other union voters in southwest Virginia , but that race is not part of their conversation .
Advertisement
Instead , said McCain spokeswoman Gail Gitcho , voters in the region are being told that Obama and his running mate , Joe Biden , are not true friends of the coal industry .
That has been the theme of campaign ads that have seized on a recent Biden gaffe in Ohio , when he appeared to oppose the construction of any new coal - fired power plants .
“ We certainly do n’t believe that race has any part in the political discourse , ” Gitcho said .
But here in Buchanan County , it is unavoidable .
A local newspaper columnist , in a spoof of Obama ’s platform , wrote in one recent piece that the Democrat would hire the rapper Ludacris to paint the White House black ( a reference to a pro-Obama song by Ludacris ) , and divert more foreign aid to Africa so “ the Obama family there can skim enough to allow them to free their goats and live the American Dream . ”
He joked that Obama would replace the 50 stars on the U.S. flag “ with a star and crescent logo , ” an Islamic symbol , and that his policy on drugs would be to “ raise taxes to pay for Obama ’s inner-city political base . ”
Advertisement
The columnist , Bobby May , is also treasurer of the Buchanan County Republican Party and was listed in a July news release as the county ’s representative on McCain ’s Virginia leadership team , though he said his column reflected his views alone , and he denied it was racist .
History suggests that a black candidate could win support here .
In 1989 , L. Douglas Wilder carried Buchanan and other nearby counties as he became the country ’s first black elected governor since Reconstruction .
Many here recall that Wilder kicked off his campaign in the region and aggressively courted whites .
Obama is expected to do well in Virginia ’s urban areas and the suburbs of Washington , D.C.
But to win the state , strategists say , he needs to improve his performance in the southwest counties .
For that to happen , volunteers such as Ruby Hale have to strike the right tone with their neighbors .
On some nights , Hale , a retired jewelry store owner , shows up at her Pentecostal church in tiny Rowe with her Toyota truck stacked full of Obama signs and bumper stickers .
Advertisement
“ I ’ll tell them , ‘ You ca n’t judge a man this way , ’ that he could n’t help who his father was , and he did n’t name himself -- that I am convinced he is a Christian . ”
Then she tells the potential voter to think it over for a few days .
And the conversation often begins again .

Maybe ... just maybe ... Chris Wallace had enough of McCain Campaign Manager Rick Davis 's ridiculous spinning on Sarah Palin that he was n't about to let Davis get away with the standard campaign glossing over of her " executive experience . "
Who knows , maybe Wallace is nursing a grudge for not being able to book Palin this Sunday and having to settle for the unctuous Davis .
Whatever the reason , Wallace was uncharacteristically hard on Davis 's attempt to bolster Palin 's reputation for being a reformer .
But honestly , I think that all of this sturm und drang about Palin is EXACTLY what the McCain campaign wants .
Suddenly the campaign has become all about Palin vs. Obama , shunting off McSame into the shadows , where he gets to spend less time trying to refute that his will be a third term of proven failed Bush policies .
Palin 's aggressive stance in getting federal money is the same thing that every governor does ( although as a Californian , who pay more taxes than we get back , the per capita federal funding makes me a little ill -- think of how much better our infrastructure would be here in Cali , if we did n't have states like Alaska sucking us dry ) .
I do n't think that there should be that much focus on it other than to point out that Palin herself was named THREE TIMES by none other than McCain as a Pork Barrel Princess .
So does n't this go more towards the poor and reckless judgment of McCain , who picked someone as a running mate that he personally has castigated in the past for her fiscal irresponsibility ?
So are they trying to tell us that this kind of hypocrisy is acceptable ?
transcripts below the fold
WALLACE : But are n't you vastly exaggerating her record as a reformer ?
Take a look : as Mayor of Wasilla , she hired a Washington lobbyist and got $ 27 million in earmarks .
And in her less than two years as Governor , Alaska has asked for $ 589 million in pork barrel projects .
Her record , as a reformer , particularly on the issues of earmarks , is far from clean .
DAVIS : Well , well , let 's be clear about this .
When she was Mayor of Wasilla , there were already people in place who were getting those grants from the federal government .
And small towns do a lot of that kind of activity , because mayors ...
WALLACE : She hired a Washington lobbyist [ crosstalk - inaudible ] close to invited senator ...
DAVIS : .... She was already involved in that ...
WALLACE : No , she did hire ... she did hire a lobbyist ...
DAVIS : ... And so , let me also point out these pork barrel projects that you talk about .
These were not projects that she tried to get .
These were projects that the Republican establishment in Alaska , who she campaigned against , and beat many times over , were the ones picking those grants up .
Let me remind you , she vetoed more bills .
She cut back on more pork barrel spending in the state legislature than any previous governor .
She converted that legislature into reform , because she passed ethics reforms and corruption reforms .
She railed against the establishment in Alaska and was able to accomplish great things by passing a significant energy bill that allowed them to create a natural gas pipeline .
These are all things that a true reformer is able to accomplish .
So , you know , I do n't disagree with the fact that these ... there were ... there were pork barrel projects coming to Alaska , but not from her .
Within the state legislature she beat back those efforts .
WALLACE : Wait a minute , first of all ...
DAVIS : She 's not a federal ...
WALLACE : As governor , Alaska , during her year and a half , two years as governor , Alaska continued to get more federal money for pork barrel projects per capita than any state in the country ...
DAVIS : Yeah , that 's Ted Stevens ... that 's Ted Stevens ...
WALLACE : and , and ... let me , it just works better if I get to ask the question .
DAVIS : Okay .
WALLACE : And she supported the " Bridge to Nowhere " and it was only after the federal government dropped it out and killed it - the Congress killed it - that she then opposed it and in fact , she still got the money for the approach , the ramp to the bridge to nowhere .
DAVIS : Congress did n't beat back the Bridge to Nowhere .
WALLACE : Yeah , but she accepted the money .
DAVIS : That funding ... that funding was in the grant and she said , " I 'm not spending that money . "
And what they did ?
They took a $ 500 million bridge and she turned it into a $ 2 million ferry .
And that 's what she did on her own , without any help from anybody else .
WALLACE : Well , actually , it was Congress that killed the money for the Bridge to Nowhere , but let me move on to something else .
I remember when the Internet was a promise .
Back in the day , you might have had a homepage if you were really into the whole computer thing , and chances were your homepage had a real purpose that actually made it interesting to other people .
You were probably an expert on something , whether it was quantum entanglement or collecting beer mats , and since the majority of your cyber correspondence was related to that forte you naturally started to upload more and more data related to that subject until your little website became a miniature Solomon 's Mine of information and you were no longer just Daniel , the computer geek who lived next door with his mom but Legendary Dan , the Beer Mat Man .
And you did it without frontloading Google keywords in your home page and cross-posting all over the Web and putting links to your page and Amazon affiliate banners in your sig , but by simply uploading information about beer mats .
Nowadays you would n't have an outside chance of becoming the Beer Mat Man without a major advertising campaign , a feature in Wired and a Lulu - published book with five - star reviews by several of Amazon 's Top Reviewers .
Even then you'd be better off getting sponsored by Anheiser - Busch in exchange for some favourable product placement in your beer mat reviews .
Of course , it does n't matter a bit , because websites that are actually about something are so Web 1.0 anyway .
Nobody generates informative content any more .
Why do all that research when you could just create a MySpace page , join the Beer Mat Collectors group , post quotes from the official Heineken site in your blog and hit every forum you can find with snarky comments about how people who collect bottle caps are complete LOSERS !
( Note : it is vitally important that when you start posting snarky comments , your forum signature is seven times as long as your average post .
Your fans wo n't appreciate the effort of having to converse with you to find out who you are and what an amazing beer mat guru you have become in your years of experience .
That is what your sig is for .
Make sure your sig states clearly the url for your website , your current five favourite beer mats , the number of beer mats in your collection , the time and location of your first carnal encounter with an Apple computer , and why Journey suck so hard , or you will surely be seen as a complete loser .
Also , it never hurts to insert a shibboleth from an obscure webcomic ( not too obscure , mind you - as a professional Web poster , you live for the occasional off - topic " wow , you love Webcomic X too ? " comment ) or something about how much you love Jesus , depending on which camp you fall into . )
YOUR AD HERE !!!!!
Strangely enough , though , the Web does n't seem to have been depopulated .
On the contrary , it 's growing at a phenomenal rate .
This is no wasteland , you may think as you 're cruising the eightteen lanes of Information Superhighway .
This is Wonderland !
Look at all the stuff out there !
Why , I can see a dozen amazing websites from right here !
What is this idiot Dejawhatsis gassing on about ?
I 'll tell you what happened .
We completed the Superhighway metaphor .
We built billboards and service centers all along it .
That 's what you can see .
No trees , no wonders of nature , just mile - high , customer - driven , neon billboards , Exxon stations and McDonald 's franchises .
The Internet used to be a new frontier that crossed borders and held limitless possibilities .
Then the businessmen moved in .
Are you reading a webpage about supernovas ?
Hey , you must really be into the stars .
Why do n't we frame that page with a banner ad for the new Star Trek movie , a couple of box ads for telescopes , DVDs about the Challenger disaster and one for a website where - get this , fellow stargazer - you can play a crappy Flash version of Asteroids with HARDLY ANY HIDDEN COST AND GUARANTEED NOT VERY MUCH SPYWARE !!!
And since it 's pretty easy for to just ignore the frame and read the article you came here for , why do n't we pepper the text itself with pop -up hyperlinks to dozens of other things you can buy , and make every one jump out at you every time your cursor comes anywhere near it ?
Also , that page is way too long .
Who wants to look at so much boring text ?
Do n't your fingers get tired from scrolling ?
Take a break , fanboy .
Tell you what , we 'll put a little stop sign in there to break up that wall of text for you after three paragraphs .
Looks a little empty like that , so how about we insert a nice page - width ad for Dell computers there ?
No harm done , right ?
Hey , if you do n't want a new Dell you just scroll right past it .
And if we find that you do that too often , we 'll make it into one of those neat animated pop -up ads that scroll with you , blocking the text until you click to make it go away .
So everybody wins .
Hey , our sponsors have to eat too .
Hmm , that 's still an awful lot of text .
Hey , I know , why do n't we break it up into three pages , and that way you can see three times as many ads for the same actual information ?
Yeah , I like that .
Thanks for reading our page (s ) about exploding stars .
And on your way out , do n't forget to click on the handy buttons we 've installed for Reddit , Duggit , Hatedit , nas.ty.tast.ing , and Regurgitate.com , so all your friends can know how much you rock .
That way we get noticed , you get indy cred points , your friends find out what 's cool , and the Web evolves , right ?
WEB 2.0 : EVOLVING TO THE LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR
Welcome to the new world .
It 's a major step forward .
It 's actually user - created .
This is a quantum leap , my fellow Netizen .
Finally we 're taking control of the Web .
No more static content written by people who know what they 're writing about .
We 've got access to Mother now , and we 'll get our own answers !
Down with Brittanica , up Wikipedia !
Yeah , sure .
I like Wikipedia , actually .
It 's a perfect example of the things I once thought the Web would achieve .
I do n't write for it because I 'm an opinionated bitch who can barely write a single sentence in Neutral Point of View , but I look things up on it all the time .
And over the years , the hivemind really has turned Wiki from a niche hobby site riddled with errors and dead zones into a really good writers ' resource that you can trust to at least get the basics right on just about every subject .
Wikipedia search is built into browsers now .
It 's done well , it 's beautiful , and it 's the future .
BUT .
Wikipedia is n't the paradigm for Web 2.0 , MySpace is .
For every Wikipedia - style website you can find in the wild , there are three or four taking pages from MySpace or Facebook .
The key element of the new wave of websites is n't user - written , it 's social networking .
Friend requests !
Shared bookmarks !
Make Me Popular widgets !
What kind of loser wants to spend hours writing a dumb encyclopedia article , when you could be checking Monica 's latest camphone self - portraits , finding out who 's going to the Fall Out Boy concert , or voting on the new Mountain Dew flavor ?
And if you 're really caught up in that oh - so - 2007 blogging stuff and still think writing is cool ( what a dweeb ! ) , use Twitter instead of one of those long , boring blogging tools .
Hell , 140 characters is more than enough for anybody - and with Twitter , everybody knows how sucky your work day is the very second you get a bathroom break !
You 're not just writing or hanging out virtually here , dude , you 're sticking it to the Man !
The Web is ours at last !!
You should totally YouTube that shit !!!
THE BATTLE OF THE BOOB TUBES
Remember when Yahoo was a Web directory ?
Well , that functionality could still be there for all I know , but I have n't seen it in years , because they 've buried it under seventeen layers of MyYahooSpaceBook crap as part of Yahoo's transformation into a modern Internet portal .
What " Internet portal " apparently means circa 2008 is , your new interactive TV station , with every kind of junk that you used to get on your old - fashioned TV .
This , the second most popular gateway into the wonderful Web , now proudly presents a front page full of the very latest in celebrity gossip , diet tips , box office news , love horoscopes , and " most popular searches " , half of which involve Jessica Simpson ( who appears to be some kind of singer , as far as I can tell ) .
Sure , there 's information in there , too , just like there are good things on TV .
You can find real news on Yahoo if you want it .
You can use search to find things that do n't involve Jessica Simpson .
You can check your e-mail , get a weather forecast , find critiques of great books , just like you could potentially use your TV to watch Masterpiece Theatre and Jon Stewart .
But that 's not what Yahoo assumes you want , and it certainly does n't go out of its way to show you those things .
By Yahoo standards , Jessica Simpson is more important than Barack Obama .
Call me a geek or a pretentiously serious old fart , but that just seems wrong to me .
The good stuff on the Web is still out there , just like TV still produces the occasional Daily Show , Lost and Deadwood .
I still get my news from the Net , and probably still spend more time reading online than reading books .
But the signal to noise ratio gets worse and worse every year , and it 's becoming unbearable .
We turned off our TV in 2002 to protect ourselves and our daughter from the brain - sucking stupidity that passes for entertainment on TV .
I 'm starting to wonder if we 'll make it to 2012 without turning off our Internet .

Back to English News homepage
( CNN ) -- Despite his felony conviction this week for filing false U.S. Senate financial disclosure forms , Republican Sen .
Ted Stevens of Alaska insisted he was innocent and vowed not to step down .
" I have not been convicted of anything , " he maintained during a Thursday night debate in Anchorage , only days before Tuesday 's election .
The debate , sponsored by Alaska Public Television , pitted Stevens , who is seeking re-election , against his opponent , Democratic Anchorage Mayor Mark Begich , in a tight race .
" I 'm not going to step down .
I have not been convicted .
I have a case pending against me , and probably the worse case of prosecutorial ... misconduct by the prosecutors that is known , " Stevens said .
" I think you will find out , I will succeed and I 'll be found innocent . "
Stevens , who has been in the Senate since 1968 , is seeking a seventh full term .
He is the longest - serving Republican in that body .
" The case is still pending on the basis of motions we filed for a new trial or a dismissal of the case because of prosecutorial misconduct , " he said when asked about calls for his resignation from some key Republicans .
They include GOP presidential nominee John McCain and his running mate , Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska , and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky .
" I would tell them [ McCain and Palin ]
I understand that they make statements during the heat of a campaign , and probably they 've been a little misinformed by their staff .
" But I would n't hold it against them .
I understand what they are doing .
They are trying to get elected , " Stevens , 84 , told the panel of journalists before a live audience .
Asked if he were accusing his Republican critics of just saying what 's convenient to win elections , Stevens said , " I think to a great extent they are . "
When asked if he still can be effective , he replied , " I think I 'll be effective .
Effectiveness is a matter of experience . "
A federal jury in the District of Columbia on Monday found Stevens guilty of seven counts of failing to report about $ 250,000 in gifts and renovations to his home in Girdwood , Alaska , between 1999 and 2006 , mostly paid for by the senator 's friend , Bill Allen , chief executive of the oil - services company Veco Corp .
The company has since been sold .
Senators are required to fill out forms each year stating what gifts they and their families have received -- over a certain amount -- and from whom .
Stevens predicted that his fellow senators would not expel him , which would take a two - thirds majority .
Although the jury found Stevens guilty , it 's still out as to what happened to one of the jurors who disappeared during the trial .
Judge Emmet Sullivan last week expressed sympathy for the juror , who had told a U.S. marshal late on October 22 that a member of her family had died .
The judge reached her by cell phone Thursday morning , and learned she was leaving for California in response to her father 's death .
The trial continued with an alternate juror taking her place , but the judge now wants to know why the original juror has not been in touch with the court .
According to court documents released Friday , the judge has scheduled a hearing for November 3 , ordering the juror " to show cause as to why you have failed to respond to the Court 's numerous and continued attempts to communicate with you . "
The judge 's order indicates the missing juror , a woman in her 40s with training as a paralegal , has remained out of touch with the court through Wednesday .
The editorial today in the Anchorage Daily News is Abidcation by Palin , criticizing her for allowing John McCain and his operatives speak for her on TrooperGate .
The governor who said , " Hold me accountable , " is hiding behind the hired guns of the McCain campaign to avoid accountability .
Is it too much to ask that Alaska 's governor speak for herself , directly to Alaskans , about her actions as Alaska 's governor ?
.... Is the McCain campaign telling Alaskans that Alaska 's governor can't handle her own defense in front of her own Alaska constituents ?
HONG KONG ( MarketWatch ) - U.S. authorities are considering radical new measures to shore up ailing financial markets , including guaranteeing billions in bank debt and insuring all U.S. bank deposits for a temporary period , according to a report Friday in The Wall Street Journal 's online edition .
The moves , if implemented , would mark the government 's most extensive intervention in the financial system , the Journal reported , citing unidentified people familiar with the situation .
See full Journal story .
Backing all U.S. bank deposits , a measure which is currently only at the discussion stage , would be aimed at preventing a further exodus of cash from financial institutions , including small and regional banks , The Journal reported .
The move is being floated as banking customers have pulled money out of healthy community banks under the assumption that only deposits held at larger financial institutions would be backed by government guarantees in the event of a failure .
Removing the ceiling on deposit insurance would require multiple government agencies to agree that a " systemic risk " exists , thereby invoking a rarely used legal power .
Some banking regulators say the move is justified following repeated efforts by the federal government to prop up ailing institutions .
It is not clear that either idea will be carried out , and U.S. officials have downplayed expectations such a move would be announced this weekend , The Journal reported .
The report also noted the Bush administration is under pressure to find a solution to the economic turmoil that goes beyond the $ 700 billion financial rescue package that was recently signed into law .
If the government guaranteed all bank lending , the measure would effectively entail the U.S. becoming the backstop for the nation 's financial system .
Top officials from the Group of Seven leading industrial nations will meet later today in Washington to discuss a proposal from the U.K. government to bolster bank lending .
The U.K. unveiled a plan earlier this week in which it will guarantee up to 350 billion pounds ( $ 432 billion ) in bank debt maturing over the next three years .

Video tape revelations of former Watergate conspirator deserve mainstream attention in run-up to 45th anniversary
The world exclusive E. Howard Hunt JFK confession video tape was released this week to a deafening silence from the mainstream media , while the dumbed - down general public attempted to dismiss the now deceased whistleblower Hunt , a former CIA operative and Nixon White House insider , as a mentally unstable drunk .
E. Howard Hunt testifies before the Senate Watergate Committee on Sept. 25 , 1973 .
In the video , Hunt discusses LBJ , who saw Kennedy as an “ obstacle ” to the presidency , and how Johnson consorted with top CIA officials Cord Meyer and William K. Harvey to carry out the assassination plot .
Hunt had direct knowledge of the plot because he was part of it in his role as a “ bench warmer , ” as he described himself .
You Tube comments in response to the video prevaricated not around the astounding never before seen revelations of Hunt , but centered on mindless charges that Hunt , whose original disclosure was the subject of a widely read April 2007 Rolling Stone special following his son ’s release of an audio tape , was nothing more than “ an old quack ” or a homeless drunk .
The fact that the public would deny the gravity or the relevance of one of the key Watergate conspirators and dismiss his story as “ lacking evidence , ” despite Hunt ’s credibility and his open admission that he was complicit in the plot , proves how deep a state of denial some people are still in about the malfeasance of which their government is capable .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The fact that people would demand physical evidence for the murder plot described by Hunt , in which he played a role , beggars belief .
Do they expect LBJ to have written down his plans to kill Kennedy on paper ?
Do they expect to see a receipt for the payment to the gunman on the Grassy Knoll or a contract signed by Lee Harvey Oswald ?
Hunt ’s confession is the evidence , backed up by the mountains of other blatant indicators that Lee Harvey Oswald did not act alone .
The fact that Hunt sounds a little worse for wear in the clip , which some people have used to attack the credibility of his testimony , might begin to be explained by the fact that he had throat cancer , had all of his teeth removed and was dragged out of his deathbed to do the interview .
That might put a bit of a crimp on someone ’s ability to speak clearly , I would suggest .
E Howard Hunt ’s deathbed confession needs to be treated with the gravity it deserves , it warrants widespread mainstream media attention – especially in the run-up to the 45th anniversary of the JFK assassination this November 22nd .

Howard Hunt ’s revelations in full , along with a wider in - depth study of the JFK assassination and its cover -up .

Cross - platform application Dropbox may be great at syncing regular old files and folders over the internet and to the web , but with a little ingenuity , you can use this free software to ensure important application data stays in sync no matter what computer you 're using .
With the right setup , you can sync your passwords over the internet so you 've always got access to the latest versions of your secure passwords no matter where you are .
Keep reading to find out how .
I 'm going to detail how this works with the open - source password manager , KeePass , and with the Mac - only manager , 1 Password — the top two favorites in our recent Hive Five Best Password Managers .
The setup is basically the same for both applications , so to get started , go download and install Dropbox on every computer you want to sync passwords to .
Done ?
Now let 's set up password syncing with KeePass .

Sync KeePass Passwords Across the Internet with Dropbox
Advertisement
We 've already covered how to get up and running with KeePass once before , so I wo n't go into a lot of detail .
Assuming you 've already created your KeePass database , you need to move it to the Dropbox folder so Dropbox can sync it over the internet .
I just selected File ->
Save As , then pointed KeePass at my Dropbox folder .
( Simple enough , right ? )
Now on any other subsequent computer , just open KeePass ( or KeePassX for OS X or Linux users — which works just as well ) , select File ->
Open Database , and point it to the synced KeePass database file that you added to your Dropbox folder .
Assuming the step above went as planned , this file should already have synced to the Dropbox folder on all of the computers you want to sync passwords to .
That 's really all there is to it .
Any time you edit or create a new password on one computer , it 'll automatically sync to the other ; all you need to know to access any of your passwords is one master password .
There 's a small catch here : KeePass does n't automatically update your passwords when it 's open , so if you make a change on one computer and then make a change on the other without re-opening the new database , you 'll end up with a conflict .
Dropbox handles conflicts well — that is , nothing will break and it alerts you of the conflict — but you may lose changes from one of your computers .

Sync 1 Password Across the Internet with Dropbox

Syncing 1 Password with Dropbox works very similarly to syncing KeePass .
In a nutshell , you need to save your 1 Password database file in your Dropbox directory .
There are a couple of peculiarities that you 'll need to make sure you 've covered before proceeding , but the 1 Password blog has detailed instructions for the whole process , so I wo n't re-tread that ground .
What I will say is that 1 Password works like a charm with Dropbox , since this password manager automatically detects any changes and updates your keychain the moment a change is made to the Agile Keychain file .
That means you 're much less likely to end up with any sort of conflicts or lost information .
What Other Clever Ways Can I Sync Data with Dropbox ?
Password syncing really just scratches the surface of the clever ways you can use Dropbox to sync application data or share files .
For example , XBMC - spinoff
Boxee suggests using Dropbox to quickly share media files with your media center no matter what computer you 're using .
GeekTonic expands on this idea for SageTV users .
What clever ways are you putting Dropbox to use ?
Let 's hear about it in the comments .
The Clone , the Cube , and the Construct : Part 1
Thanks to all of the great comments in the previous threads , I decided that I wanted to do one more final analysis of the entirety of Portal after the previous two articles , mainly so that I could either convince myself one way or the other regarding my theory on why GLaDOS tortures Chell ( and therefore the player ) into wanting to kill her at the end of the game .
What I was looking for was some concrete evidence ; something that could not be hamstrung by differences of opinion .
I thought I had my answer when I realized that GLaDOS could open and close portals at will , as she does in the first couple of levels of the game .
This , it would seem , was the lynch pin of the argument that she could have killed Chell at any time she chose , but then when I went to go grab screenshots of it , I realized that GLaDOS could only create portals where an in - wall portal device was located ( the walls are marked with protrusions on either side of where a portal will appear ) .
So while I am still left with the problem of how GLaDOS removed the dead bodies of previous test candidates ( and presumably the previous inhabitants of the Aperture Science Labs ) , I did stumble across what I think was the intended narrative of the short Portal story .
It quite literally is a tale of The Clone , the Cube , and the Construct .
It ’s a story about a woman , enslaved , and her attempt to break free by proxy .
It ’s a long ride , so curl up with a blanket while I attempt to unravel the big picture in three parts .
Today , it ’s all about :
Chell , the Android Clone
We begin the game with no clues as to who we are .
We emerge from a cocoon - like device only to find out we are in a glass cage of a room with no doors .
As a gamer we identify with this “ blank slate ” by projecting our own thoughts , perceptions , and behaviors onto the protagonist , but we need to attempt to look at what Valve was telling us about the protagonist herself in this situation .
We were in some sort of hibernation state .
This suggests we were previously “ stored ” somewhere .
We are not trusted enough to be allowed freedom without limits .
We have no idea who or what we are .
These things lead me to believe in the clone theory : that Chell ( our female protagonist ) is actually a clone .
Besides the implications of the meanings behind Chell ( namely that it is another term for a sheep ) , we learn throughout the game that she is certainly not human .
She is , in fact , an android ( GLaDOS indirectly tells us as such later ) , and has been modified with bionic jump boot implants .
While Chell was probably the daughter of founder Cave Johnson at one point , it does not appear that she is that exact individual any longer .
We are almost immediately informed as to what we are there to do , by the voice of the Antagonist , who we later find is named GLaDOS , the sentient AI who is here to run what we are led to initially believe is a series of tests regarding portals and our use and understanding of them .
However , GLaDOS immediately slips up and gives us our first “ clone ” clue in her opening line to Chell :
Hello , and again , welcome to the Aperture Science Computer Aided Enrichment Center .
On the surface , this line seems harmless enough .
The line is there to trick the first time player into thinking that they are just another test subject in this neat little puzzle game .
However , GLaDOS says “ and again . ”
This implies that she has greeted Chell in some manner before her / our first awakened moment .
The only way this is even possible is if Chell ’s memory has been wiped or if there were previous versions of Chell .
Later , in the 2nd test chamber , GLaDOS says to us
Remember , Take Your Daughter ot Work Day is the perfect time to have her tested .
Tested for what ?
Some people have speculated , I think incorrectly , that it was currently Take Your Daughter to Work Day , and that Chell is just someone ’s daughter volunteering running the course .
Anyone who has gotten 3 / 4 of the way through the levels could tell you this obviously is not the case .
However , I believe that GLaDOS is revealing a bit of a secret here , and that is that she now views Chell in a maternal sense .
Everyday is “ Take Your Daughter to Work Day ” for GLaDOS and Chell .
GLaDOS believes herself to be Chell ’s mother , if she is not in fact Chell ’s creator , as I will attempt to explain later .
At two points in the story , GLaDOS refers to Chell ’s performance with a form response .
It is missing two key points of data when said aloud to the player : “ SUBJECT NAME HERE , ” and “ SUBJECT HOME TOWN HERE . ”
While being an excellent ( if not hilarious ) game - ism in that it avoids attempting to tell the player what town their character is from ( and therefore does not break the illusion that the player is the avatar ) , it possibly tells us something more about Chell .
It is entirely possible that GLaDOS did not make an error when reporting the line as heard .
If Chell is indeed a clone , it means she does not have a “ home town . ”
While she does seem to have a name , it is also possible that Chell was Cave Johnson ’s daughter ’s name , and the Chell we are playing as may no longer have any memory of that name .
She could just be the genetic inheritor of Chell , not Chell in name , and therefore would not need to be addressed as Chell by GLaDOS .
Additionally , if Chell is indeed “ from ” the Aperture Science Labs , it makes a logical fallacy out of the statement :
The device is now more valuable than the organs and combined incomes of SUBJECT HOME TOWN HERE .
Because if Chell ’s “ hometown ” is ASL , the portal gun could not be more valuable than the individuals who made it .
Not only does
Chell not really have a hometown , it is far easier to just leave the line blank rather than fill it in and make the statement false .
Additionally , GLaDOS probably does n’t want to tell Chell that she is a clone ( the testing data is no doubt hampered by world - wrending truths ) , and therefore would not show her hand by giving this information away in a congratulatory statement .
Another line from GLaDOS which , while hilarious on the surface , clues the player in to Chell ’s cloned nature is the line
Any contact with the chamber floor will result in an unsatisfactory mark on your official testing record , followed by death .
Good luck !
Again , while hilarious , there seems to be a clue here , and that is that GLaDOS is more concerned about the performance evaluation than you dying .
She is letting you know that you should already know how to beat this section of the course , and if you fail , will mark it as an error on your testing record .
Death seems to be of little , if not lesser , consequence .
Probably because she will simply reactivate another clone of Chell and download the latest brainscan of Chell ’s last run through the course .
Further evidence of Chell being a clone can be found when the player discovers all of the little hide - outs that previous testing candidates have left behind :
The handwriting is always the same .
The hash marks on the walls are 90 - 100 days long .
It is unlikely that multiple people were allowed to stay in the testing environment that long while people still inhabited the ASL .
The name and password login written on one of the walls is : cjohnson .
The odds of someone other than Chell running this course previously and knowing Cave Johnson ’s name and password is astronomically small .
More to the point , this is probably not Cave Johnson ’s name and password , as previously thought , but the original Chell Johnson ’s name and password , from an earlier clone iteration who could remember who she was .
One could counter - argue that it ’s “ just a game ” and that the handwriting on the wall is just an artist throwing the same textures up on multiple hide - out hole walls , but that would be over simplifying what was displayed on those walls .
The fact that the login written on the wall actually works on the Aperture Science homepage tells me that those words were carefully crafted and thought out .
Now , remember when I said I would attempt to prove that Chell is an android now ?
I think GLaDOS tells us indirectly during testing chamber 16 .
Due to mandatory scheduled maintenance , the appropriate chamber for this testing sequence is currently unavailable .
It has been replaced with a live fire course designed for military androids .
The Enrichment Center apologizes for the inconvenience and wishes you the best of luck .
Again , on the surface , the player has a laugh at this and thinks “ oh that wacky AI making these crazy mistakes ! ”
When in reality , she has just hidden a larger truth :
You are a military grade android .
This course has been designed to test the latest and greatest version of you , Chell , who has by this iteration been upgraded to the status of a military android .
You have jump springs growing out of the back of your legs with some kind of bionic attachment joint holding them in place .
You can handle a radioactive portal gun with no ill side effects , and you do n’t need shoes , for crying out loud .
Raise your hand if you ’re a human and would even think of running that course without shoes .
Normally I ’d rest my case on such granite - solid logic , but fortunately GLaDOS backs me up with another line once you finish the course :
Well done , android .
The Enrichment Center reminds you that android hell is a real place where you will be sent at the first sign of defiance .
The line is intended to throw players off and make them think that GLaDOS has made a critical error and is giving you the android line for when androids complete the course , but in reality , she has delivered the proper line for when an android completes the course , meaning you .
Furthermore , it is one of the first signs of foreshadowing that GLaDOS is threatening to kill the player .
On the surface , it is an idle threat .
But if we explore her motivations for doing so , we can see that it is merely a pawn in the greater game of getting Chell to destroy GLaDOS .
I ’ll talk about that a bit more later .
This piece has been running super long and I ’m going to break it up into three parts .
Tomorrow , I ’ll talk about how I think I ’ve figured out the meaning behind the Weighted Companion Cube .
And you thought it was just a silly old cube !
Fears are mounting that many Wall Street banks and financial firms will refuse to participate in the US government 's $ 700 bn bail - out package , leaving global markets and world economies in a perilous state for months to come .
' There is a growing feeling that banks ... might instead decide to tough it out , ' said Thomas Caldwell , chairman and CEO of Caldwell Financial , a $ 1 bn - plus fund manager .
For the past two weeks all eyes in the market have been focused on US Congress and its attempts to pass Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson 's bail - out package - a bill to allow the US government to buy up to $ 700bn of toxic mortgage - related assets from American banks , which would in theory free the credit markets and set the gears of global commerce spinning once more .
Last Monday , after the bill was thrown out by the House of Representatives , more than $ 1 trillion was wiped off the value of US stocks as the market was gripped by panic .
The bill was passed on Friday afternoon , however , after the inclusion of $ 149bn of tax breaks and strict rules for participating banks .
But Wall Street analysts , believe the addition of so many terms to the bill might deter potential participants .
One of the least attractive elements is a section designed to curb executive pay at banks that participate in the bail - out package .
These include limiting stock - related pay and banning ' golden parachutes ' for executives .
' I think this hodge - podge of regulations and rules will be enough to put many [ chief executives ] off participating , ' Caldwell said .
Sources close to Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch indicated the banks might choose not to participate in the bail - out as there is a growing view on Wall Street that the market may be bottoming out .
Analysts also believe that the mere presence of the government as buyer of last resort will be enough to get credit markets moving again , and that a large number of banks would not need to take part for the legislation to succeed .
Wall Street ended its worst week in seven years with another tumble on Friday .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down more than 157 points on Friday at 10,325.38 .
Eine attraktive Erscheinung , Figur , Ausstrahlung hat nicht unbedingt jeder in die Wiege gelegt bekommen und bevor man hier an Fettabsaugen und andere medizinische Eingriffe denkt , sollte erstmal nach den ästhetischen Vorstellungen gefragt werden .
Immerhin sind diese nicht nur den Zeiten und damit den Moden unterworfen , ein gutes Beispiel ist hier Peter Paul Rubens , der seine Inspirationen sicher von keiner Fettabsaugung bekommen hätte ; es kommen zudem auch gesundheitliche Aspekte und Erkenntnisse hinzu .
Zuviel Fett ist ungesund , das ist keine Schmähung , sondern im Grunde genommen eine Binsenweisheit .
Und wenn wir mal ehrlich sind : Warum sollte man sich monate - oder gar jahrelang im Studio quälen , wenn die erblich bedingten Reiterhosen auch bei größtem Aufwand nicht verschwinden ?
Hier und bei vielen anderen Gelegenheiten ist das Fettabsaugen eine tolle Sache und es lohnt sich , die Umstände genaue zu betrachten .
Das Problem mit den Fettzellen
Um schlank , straff , athletisch auszusehen , ist die Beseitigung unschöner Fettpolster eine Grundvoraussetzung .
Der Teufel steckt hier jedoch im Detail , denn während Muskeln nach hartem Training zuverlässig wachsen , sind die Fettdepots nicht so leicht kleinzukriegen und der Grund dafür sind die hartnäckigen Fettzellen .
Sport , Diäten , eine gesunde Lebensweise haben auf diese Depots nur einen geringen Einfluss , da das Fett selbst zwar geringer oder auch mehr werden kann , die eigentlichen Zellen jedoch instand bleiben und jederzeit wieder Fett speichern .
So quält sich die Elite im Fitnesscenter und wundert sich , wenn die Polster einfach immer wiederkommen !
Dahinter steckt eine evolutionär sicher sinnvolle Absicht , für Notzeiten vorzusorgen , doch wer rechnet heute noch mit einer großen Hungersnot ?
Im Gegenteil , Essen wird in westlichen Nationen sogar weggeschmissen , so dass Fettabsaugen und das Beseitigen der Fettzellen physisch überhaupt kein Problem darstellen .
Körperregionen , die besonders profitieren
Am meisten wird Fett an den Beinen , am Bauch und am Gesäß abgesaugt .
Es entscheiden sich verhältnismäßig mehr Frauen als Männer für eine Fettabsaugung , was zum einen mit der unterschiedlichen Bindegewebsstruktur , zum anderen aber auch mit einer in vielen Fällen differenzierten Ästhetik zusammenhängt .
Wir können das hier nicht im Detail diskutieren , doch Probleme wie Reiterhosen oder Dellen durch Cellulitis sind vor allem bei Frauen anzutreffen , während beim Fettabsaugen eher den Bauch im Blick haben .
Manchmal leiden die Herren der Schöpfung auch an Lipomastie , einer hormonell bedingten Ausbildung von Brüsten , was dann durch das Absaugen zufriedenstellend gelöst werden kann .
Fettabsaugen und gesunde Lebensweise
Grundsätzlich gilt : Selbst die beste Fettabsaugung kann eine gesunde , abwechslungsreiche Ernährung und damit umsichtige Lebensweise nicht einfach so ersetzen .
Ein intelligentes Zusammenspiel ist gefragt !
Es ist nicht immer sofort der medizinische Eingriff nötig , doch wenn die Depots mit den Fettzellen sehr hartnäckig sind , dann bringt das Absaugen in Kombination mit ausreichend Bewegung und einer klugen Diät immer den gewünschten Erfolg .
Wer freilich an sehr großem Übergewicht leidet , sollte sich mit dem Arzt über andere Methoden unterhalten , denn hier reicht das blanke Fettabsaugen oft nicht aus , sondern muss durch weiterführende Varianten wie einen Magenballon oder das Magenband ergänzt werden .
Beratung ist also Pflicht und mit einem erfahrenen Mediziner und dem richtigen Equipment kann eigentlich auch nichts schief gehen bei dieser bewährten Methode .

The Washington Times reported today that the McCain campaign and the Republican National Committee have been “ negotiating with Rep. Ron Paul to win his support and acquire the names of his sympathizers among the 4,607 delegates and alternates at the Republican National Convention . ”
However , when CNN’s John King asked Paul this morning whether such reports were true , Paul laughed .
“ I would n’t put it in those words , ” he said .
In fact , he said the RNC seemed to be trying to keep him off the convention floor , even though as a congressman , he should be able to get floor passes without a problem .
Watch it :
Paul was barred from speaking at the convention “ because the the congressman would not change his position on the war in Iraq , which he opposes . ”
The Washington Times also reports that Paul “ was denied permission to address the Republican Platform Committee last week ” after “ the McCain forces who controlled the platform proceedings , as well as the Rules Committee and the Credentials Committee , objected . ”
The McCain campaign ’s stonewalling of Ron Paul may not have the support of his vice presidential pick , Gov. Sarah Palin .
In an interview with MTV earlier this year , Palin expressed support for Paul , saying that he was “ cool “ :
He ’s cool .
He ’s a good guy .
He ’s a good guy .
He ’s so independent .
He ’s independent of like the party machine , I ’m like , right on , so am I .
The party machinery , on both sides of the party , ya know , Americans are tiring of the incessant partisanship that gets in the way of just doing the right thing for this country .
Paul will at least be welcome at a “ counter convention ” held in Minneapolis for his supporters , where he is speaking today .
Paul said he expected around 18,000 people to attend today ’s rally .

Californians fed up with being charged for ending their cell phone service prematurely won a major victory in a Bay Area court decision that concluded such fees violate state law .
In a preliminary ruling Monday , Alameda County Superior Court Judge Bonnie Sabraw said Sprint Nextel must pay California mobile - phone consumers $ 18.2 million as part of a class - action lawsuit challenging early termination fees .
Though the decision could be appealed , it ’s the first in the country to declare the fees illegal in a state and could affect other similar lawsuits , with broad implications for the nation ’s fast - growing legions of cell phone users .
The judge – who is overseeing several other suits against telecommunications companies that involve similar fees – also told the company to stop trying to collect $ 54.7 million from other customers who have n’t yet paid the charges they were assessed .
The suit said about 2 million Californians were assessed the fee .
Whether Sabraw ’s ruling will stand is n’t clear .
Experts say an appeal is likely , and the Federal Communications Commission is considering imposing a rule – backed by the wireless industry – which might decree that only federal authorities can regulate early termination fees .
Sprint Nextel also argued in the lawsuit that such fees – which ranged from $ 150 to $ 200 – were outside the purview of California law .
But Sabraw rejected that argument .
“ This is a terrific ruling , ” said Chicago attorney Jay Edelson , who was not part of the case but has filed about 50 other suits nationwide against various cell phone charges .
“ The phone companies have a tremendous amount of power , ” he added .
“ They lock you into long - term contracts and then they allow all these charges to be put on your bill .
We have to make sure that consumers are protected . ”
“ We are disappointed , ” said Sprint Nextel spokesman Matthew Sullivan .
But he added that Sabraw ’s ruling was tentative and that she has given Sprint Nextel ’s attorneys the opportunity to file a rebuttal before she considers making it permanent .
Sullivan noted that similar suits have been filed in other states , but that Sabraw ’s decision was the first he knows of declaring such fees illegal .
Several other industry experts agreed , including John Walls , a spokesman with the CTIA , a Washington - based organization that represents the wireless telecommunications industry .
“ I do n’t know of any state that has gone to this extent , ” he said , adding that his group believes it makes more sense to have such fees solely policed by the federal government .
‘ National framework ’
“ A consistent , uniform , national framework of standards is the best - case scenario for consumers and for the industry to serve consumers , ” he said .
“ If you allow 50 states to regulate and legislate in 50 different ways , you can create a very confusing and obviously inefficient service . ”
At a public hearing last month , FCC Chairman Kevin Martin sketched out a plan in which cancellation fees would be reduced over the life of the cell phone contract .
Three companies – T - Mobile , AT&T and Verizon Wireless – already do that , and Sprint said it would begin prorating its fees next year .
The commission also is trying to resolve whether states have any role in regulating early termination fees , which are among the biggest source of complaints among wireless consumers , said spokesman Robert Kenny .
Fees or ‘ rates ’?
He said the agency may decide to define such fees as “ rates , ” which are subject to federal regulation under federal law .
But if that happened , it is unclear how that might affect lawsuits in California and other states , Kenny said .
“ That is something that will have to be addressed , ” he added , noting that the FCC hopes to resolve the issue by the end of the year .
Chris Murray , senior legal counsel for Consumers Union , said he hoped the California court decision would “ drive a stake through the heart ” of the industry ’s desire to remove state courts and state regulators from overseeing the fees .
That view was seconded by Scott Bursor , a lawyer for the victorious Sprint Nextel customers , who said the FCC likely would be persuaded by Sabraw ’s logic that states should have a role in policing the fees .
If the FCC does limit state oversight , “ it will get reversed ” by the courts , he added .
On June 12 , a jury in the Alameda County lawsuit ruled in favor of Sprint Nextel , determining that its customers who canceled their service early had breached their contracts with the company and that early termination fees were warranted .
But in overruling that decision , Sabraw said the jurors appear to have erred in assuming the fees were valid , and she took issue with the way Sprint Nextel determined that its customers owed the fees .
“ Sprint did no damage analysis that considered the lost revenue from contracts , the avoidable costs and Sprint ’s expected lost profits from contract terminations , ” she said .
Nonetheless , Sabraw preserved a portion of the jury ’s verdict and used that to scale back the amount of refunds the suit initially had sought .

Today the world marks a day when people start living in ecological debt , meaning that they have already used all the natural resources that Earth can provide in a calendar year , the Global Footprint Network reports .
Worldwide , we now need the amount of resources of 1.4 planets to correspond to our lifestyle .
According to the Global Footprint Network ( GFN ) data , the supply of natural resources is shrinking faster than ever due to overpopulation and indulging lifestyle that leads to the devastation of the forests and fisheries , decreasing biodiversity and soil quality .
In addition , the global warming contributes to droughts and flooding , which affect water supplies and agriculture , while the amount of waste , primarily carbon dioxide , is growing .
" Ecological Debt Day " is marked September 23rd , which is the earliest ever recorded day , when human demands exceeded the planet 's ability to produce and absorb .
Today people consume 40 % more resources than the planet can supply .
The first year when people entered the ecological debt was in 1986 .
In 2007 the " Ecological Debt Day " was marked on October 6 , the day when people started borrowing from the future .
According to the GFN analysis for 2006 , the United States is considered to be the top deficit spender .
If the world would have lived according to American lifestyle , people would require the equivalent of 5,4 " Earths " to meet the human demands .
The other biggest consumers are Canada , requiring resources of 4,2 " Earths " , Great Britain ( 3,1 ) and Germany ( 2,5 ) .
" There could be less than one hundred months to prevent catastrophic , global warming .
We need a programme now that is at least as bold as action to save reckless financiers . "
Andrew Simms , NEF policy director , said .

Who will protect us from the protectors ?
Sometimes things get out of hand .
And , usually , there is a group of people whose occupation it is to protect us from those situations .
But as was the case on Monday night in Minnesota , the people who are supposed to protect us got a little bit out of hand themselves .
On Monday night , three colleagues of mine from the Kentucky Kernel were arrested while documenting the protests outside the Republican National Convention .
Photographers Ed Matthews and Britney McIntosh , along with photo advisor Jim Winn were all arrested and charged with rioting .
Matthews and McIntosh were both charged with felonies , while Winn was charged with a misdemeanor .
>> More convention coverage at RG&B >>
Nothing indicates that any of the three were actually participating in the protests , much less violating any laws that would warrant their arrest .
The police officers subdued the Kernel staff members with the use of pepper spray and the threat of a gun , certainly unnecessary given that all evidence suggests that Matthews , McIntosh and Winn were not actually breaking any laws .
Regardless , we cannot know whether or not they were acting inappropriately , as they are still incommunicado in the Ramsey County Adult Detention Center .
If convicted , Matthews and McIntosh would face a minimum sentence of one year in jail and a $ 3000 fine .
Perhaps the bright spot in all of this is that at least we know what they have been charged with .
More so than the arrest of colleagues , the problem is that this conundrum of excessive police violence is not new .
From the unprovoked attack by a New York City police officer on a Critical Mass bicyclist , and the subsequent arrests of those documenting the unconstitutional and overtly violent police actions , to last week ’s encounters outside of the Democratic National Convention in Denver , or even this week ’s arrest of journalist Amy Goodman , police overreaction has become the expected norm in our society .
These previous instances are illustrative that the phenomenon of police violence is not exclusive to the typically high security conventions of the Republican party , but instead have begun to pervade even traditionally liberal or progressive institutions .
So , in the face of physical assault , felony charges and unwarranted jail time , how we reclaim our constitutional rights – not just to assemble and protest , but to document these actions as part of a free and open press ?
Or perhaps the better question is , can we still reclaim these rights ?

A recap of sorts and where everything stands now .
Since the Military led coup to oust Prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra in late 2006 Thailand has been on edge politically and it ’s now rapidly coming to a head .
The military coup of 2006 supported by the king was peaceful and largely uneventful as the prime minister was out of the country when it was staged .
The coup gave way to a ruling military junta that reigned over Thailand for a little over a year , bringing a new constitution to the people before promised general elections took place in December of 2007 .
During their year of reign the military Junta had former prime minister Thaksin ’s Thai Rak Thai Party dissolved by the courts .
During the run up to elections a new political party emerged called the Peoples power party ( PPP ) which was the same old Thai Rak Thai party with a new name and although the military junta did what it could to suppress the new Peoples Power Party they still managed to win 226 out of the 400 parliament seats during the general election .
This put the PPP in position to control the majority in the house of representatives and after much debate with the other parties winning seats in the house the PPP became part of a coalition that held majority and elected from it ’s ranks Thailand ’s new prime minister Samak Sundaravej .
Samak Sundaravej spelled trouble from the start .
He is not well liked due to his support of deadly force used on peaceful protests in the early 1970 ’s and again in the 1990’s .
More recently he is resented as just being a proxy for ousted prime minister Thaksin .
His coalition of parties led by the PPP are seen as anti military , anti-elite , and pro Thaksin in nature .
The rise of the Thai Rak Thai Party and the subsequent PPP relied heavily on rural support with programs to help rural farmers and end poverty .
The biggest problem for the PPP and it ’s new prime minister is that they are seen as just an extension of former prime minister Thaksin ’s corrupt administration .
Thaksin and his family profited handsomely during his tenure as prime minister and by all accounts he and his family pocketed billions of baht from shady land dealings to selling off his family ’s controlling share ’s of Shin Corp telecom to Singapore ’s Temasek Holdings which angered many as Thaksin was seen as using his political influence to build an empire .
Many people believe the new government led by the PPP will write a new constitution and help Thaksin absolve himself of any wrong doing .
Thaksin and his wife are now seeking asylum in England after fleeing Thailand before verdicts were handed down by the courts against his wife .
This brings us to The People ’s Alliance for Democracy ( PAD ) , a coalition of conservative elite ’s from Bangkok and the south with support from the military and Thailand ’s labor unions , originally formed to protest and help oust former prime minister Thaksin .
Once this was accomplished they dissolved but after the elections in late 2007 they reformed to protest what they saw as Samak ’s puppet led government .
In the past 2 months PAD has led many public protests against the government calling for Samak to step down and for the PPP led coalition to quit .
In the past 2 weeks PAD along with thousands of Thai citizens have seized the state run television station and the Government House where they have barricaded themselves in since .
There has been an uneasy truce between the police and the protesters with many citizens coming to PAD ’s aid with food , water , and clothing .
Prime minister Samak indignant in the face of these actions declared he would not quit which led to Airport labor unions joining the fray and shutting down several airports for a while .
Now with heightened tension and more labor unions joining the ranks of PAD it looks like there will be a nationwide shut down of services .
Yesterday pro government party The Democratic Alliance Against Dictatorship ( DAAD ) Clashed with PAD supporters in Sanam Luang .
Thai fighting Thai as Police were helplessly outnumbered by both sides to be of any help .
The protests that have been mostly peaceful with few altercations has now turned bloody and claimed it ’s first victim , Narongchai Korbthaisong , a DAAD supporter who was beaten to death by PAD security officers .
DAAD has now threatened to raid the Democrat Party ’s head office in retaliation to PAD ’s takeover of State run Television and the Government house .
The clash yesterday prompted Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej to put in place an emergency decree to quiet the protests in Bangkok .
Samak will order officials to investigate the violence but as with the handling of the protests to this point the governments investigation would be inept at best .
Now everyone in the country is awaiting a radio and Television address by Prime minister Samak due to take place 7 am Wednesday morning .
It ’s believed he will speak to the people about the recent turmoil in the country but some are speculating that he will Announce his resignation .
Sound like a soap opera ?
Hopefully this address , which Samak will give shortly , will be his decision to step down but whether or not that will quell the violence between rival protesters remains to be seen .
Thailand has a long hard road ahead of it , let ’s just hope it ’s not paved with the blood of it ’s citizens .
Update :
Samak addressed the nation this morning and declared he will not resign nor will he dissolve the House of Representatives .
He went on to claim that PAD is like a cult and is disobeying the law and called for the 9 leaders of PAD to turn themselves in and defend their actions in court .
He is under the belief as well that the various labor unions will keep the country going without any more shut downs .
Samak said the government would continue with it ’s soft approach to the protests but he would have the Government house , which has been taken over by PAD , cleared by the military soon and without violence .
Like Thaksin , Samak will hold on as long as he can which will mean continued protests and I fear continued and escalating violence .
Now would be a good time for the King to speak to the people as he is the only man in all of Thailand respected by all .

The most apparently foolproof formula in contemporary art , shark + tank +
Hirst , added up to substantial sum last night , when the latest fish off the production line sold for £ 9.6 m , well in excess of the top estimate of £ 6 m , and further confirmation that some people remain immune to the credit crunch .
All 96 lots in the first session of the most hyped art sale of the year sold , confounding the pessimists who wondered if Damien Hirst had finally pickled one shark too many .
Cheyenne Westphal , chairman of contemporary art at Sotheby 's , described it as " a truly historic occasion " , as the night 's total sales came to £ 70.5 m , comfortably ahead of the original £ 65 m prediction for the entire sale , including the buyer 's premium of 12 % .
Hirst stayed away last night , but afterwards said : " The market for art is bigger than anyone knows .
I love art and this proves I am not alone . "
" Banks fall over , art triumphs , " Sir Norman Rosenthal , former exhibitions secretary of the Royal Academy said .
But the prices were huge rather than insane , and auctioneer Ollie Barker had to work hard for them .
Bidding opened at £ 6.5 m on the star lot of the evening , the Golden Calf , but it eventually sold - like the shark to a telephone bidder - for £ 10.3 m , a record for the artist at auction , but well short of the top £ 12 m estimate .
Theology , Philosophy , Medicine and Justice , four small sharks in two tanks , sold for £ 2.35 m , below the lowest £ 3 m estimate .
People began to drift away from the saleroom , which had been standing room only long before the auction started .
There was a late flurry of excitement over Fragments of Paradise , a wall case filled with shelves of thousands of " manufactured diamonds " - cubic zirconium , the auctioneer explained kindly - which after one of the longest bidding battles finally sold for £ 5.2 m , more than three times the top estimate .
Like asteroids on an inexorable collision course , the spectacular sale had converged on the most spectacular bank collapse of the century : in the buzz of chatter in Italian , German and French before the sale , the question was whether there would be any millionaires left in the swirling clouds of space dust for Hirst to pick off .
There were , but they were hiding at the end of telephone lines or in the private boardrooms sheltering some of Sotheby 's very favourite customers .
There was no sign of celebrities such as Bono or Daria Zhukova , Roman Abramovich 's gallery owning girlfriend , who came to the pre-sale party .
On the big lots the bidders in the room , almost all with mobiles clamped to their ears as they gambled somebody else 's money , dropped out pathetically early at a bout the £ 1 m mark , leaving the battlefield to the anonymous voices on the banks of phones .
Hirst described the collection as his " greatest hits " , and the very first lot , Heaven Can Wait , was almost a parody compilation of his trademark motifs : spins , paint splashes , butterflies , scattered diamonds .
It was estimated at up to £ 500,000 , and sold for £ 850,000 .
Sotheby 's knows
Hirst well as a buyer : recent purchases , which may end up in his dream project of a vast country house museum of contemporary art , include a Francis Bacon self portrait , and a £ 3.2 m steel sculpture by the American pop artist Jeff Koons .
After last year 's hysteria over the diamond skull - at £ 50 m the most expensive piece of contemporary art ever sold albeit where two - thirds went to an investment consortium and the rest to a group including the artist himself - the big question was what would Hirst do next .
The answer was this auction , carefully constructed for maximum sensation , from the three volume £ 200 boxed catalogue to the big queues for the exhibition which , unprecedentedly for a single artist , filled all of Sotheby 's Bond Street galleries .
Eventually more than 21,000 came to see the show .
Normally
Hirst is represented by two of the biggest names in the contemporary art business , Jay Jopling 's White Cube gallery in Britain and Larry Gagosian in New York .
Both have gritted their teeth and insisted the auction has their blessing .
Jopling was present last night but not buying , in public at least .
Today , although more major pieces are to be sold , the bargain basement stuff will be offered : scores of spots , spin pictures and butterflies ; crates of skulls in painted plastic estimated to start at a mere £ 15,000 .
Many have raised eyebrows at the army of unacknowledged craft workers in Hirst 's workshops , but the drawings are his own work .
The sketch of the Golden Calf is estimated at up to £ 30,000 - but also carries a note which may be the artist 's enigmatic message to whoever paid so much more for the finished work last night : " do n't go worshipping false idols !
dont go chasing waterfalls ! "
Sale highlights
· The Golden Calf , with solid gold disc between gold horns , gold hoofs , in gold plate framed tank , on marble plinth .
One of Hirst 's four key pieces : estimate £ 12 m , sold for £ 10.3 m
· The Kingdom , below , the biggest of the new shark pieces and first of the new stuffed animals in tanks to be sold : estimated at up to £ 6 m , sold for £ 9.6 m
· Fragments of Paradise , wall case of manufactured diamonds , estimate £ 1.5 m , sold for £ 5.2 m
· Here Today , Gone Tomorrow , glass cases of stuffed fish and fish skeletons , top estimate £ 3.5 m , sold for £ 2.95 m
· The Black Sheep with the Golden Horn , top estimate £ 3 m , sold for £ 2.6 m
· Memories of / Moments with
You , gold plated steel and diamonds diptych , estimate £ 1.2 m , sold for £ 2.6 m

My father was one of the greatest professional bowlers of all time .
Seriously .
Billy Hardwick : PBA Hall of Fame , Player of the Year in ' 63 and ' 69 , and the first winner of the triple crown of bowling , among other things .
My parents met at my maternal grandfather 's bowling center , where my dad competed .
They even named me after their dear friend Chris Schenkel , the color commentator for ABC's Pro Bowlers Tour .
And me ?
For the first 13 years of my life I spent five hours a day on the lanes .
I bowled exhibition matches on TV — The Mike Douglas Show ( against Jimmy " JJ " Walker ) , The Richard Simmons Show ( it was weird ) , Captain Kangaroo ( hot , right ? ) .
Had I not discovered D&D and videogames , I might well have become the Tiger Woods of bowling ( but with a hilariously lower salary ) .
To this day I remain a careful observer of the game .
While the liberal media elite depict the bowler as a chubby guy with a comb - over and polyester pants , the reality is that bowling is one of the most tech - heavy sports today .
Robotic pinsetters and computerized scoring were just the beginning .
Today , synthetic lane surfaces ( designed to look like wood ) provide a more consistent plane than their organic forebears .
Balls made of reactive resin have the ability to grab lanes through the oil layer for harder hooking into the pocket — which conserves more of that sweet kinetic energy for the pins , thereby increasing the likelihood of fist - pumping and woot - woot - ing in bowling centers across America .
And I hate all of it .
These new balls and surfaces mean more strikes , which means higher scores and more perfect games .
By some counts , amateur bowlers can average 40 pins higher per game than a professional bowler did 40 years ago — and that 's not because of some recently evolved mutation in the human bowling gene .
Look , we all want to excel at bowling .
How else would we attract potential sex partners ?
Not to go all Harrison Bergeron on you , but when everyone bowls perfect games , then no one bowls a perfect game .
Sure , other sports have tech .
A titanium shaft and weighted clubhead will let you hit 300 - yard drives until your spine unhinges , but they 'll still slice .
With bowling , the equation is simpler .
More tech equals more strikes .
It turns out that the sport 's governing body , the United States Bowling Congress , is just as worried as I am .
In Greendale , Wisconsin , at a climate - controlled facility that was almost certainly well - stocked with funnel cakes , the USBC deployed a 7 - foot - tall robot named Harry .
Armed with laser guides , hydraulics , and a mechanical arm , Harry 's job was to bowl with the precision of a machine .
As an engineer controlled release points , axis tilt , speed , and rotation , 23 sensors along the lane measured things like position and velocity .
The goal , according to the USBC , was " to strike a better balance between player skill and technology . "
I am pretty sure the " strike " pun was intended .
The results , released earlier this year , were undeniable : Bowling ball composition had to be reined in .
Starting in April 2009 , precise limits will be set on how porous a competition ball 's cover stock can be , standardizing how it adheres to the lane .
Technology will be hobbled for the sake of the game .
As a purist of the sport , I 'm grateful for the change .
We should have to earn our marks the way our daddies ( or , at least , mine ) did : with hard rubber balls on wood , a hot lamp over the scoring table burning our hands and faces , and watered - down American beer lubricating each frame until we go home smelling like an ashtray in a chemical plant .
" Keep yer got - damn science off mah balls ! " we 'll cry , and life will be good and pure and true .
Full disclosure : I took five Wii bowling breaks during the writing of this article .
I 'm currently averaging around 260 .

David , you have no idea how I 've struggled with this .
You have no idea ....
None .
It was a good Labor Day Weekend .
Good from a productivity point of view .
In this little room I call home right now , we 've been able to build , test and place 9 computers for The HeliOS Project .
I say we built 9 ... actually we built 8 .
The ninth one was the one you sent to me last month .
I found a place for it this past week .
As most people know , school started within the last week all over the United States .
Here in Austin , that meant that we were going to get extremely busy .
We as in HeliOS Solutions .
This is the time of year that teachers discreetly ask their students who has or does n't have a computer at home .
A few of those teachers come to me and ask if I can build the computers they need .
We always say yes .
We 've yet to turn anyone down .
In the past 48 hours , we 've received requests for four more .
somehow , some way , we will build those computers and give them to those who need them .
Most often these days , it 's just me that builds the computers .
With Ryan Sommers in Afghanistan and the other volunteers either in college or new - found jobs , I am usually the one that does the building .
That 's fine .
This is a good thing for me right now .
I 'm going through some changes and this is good for me .
It is through the few but generous supporters of The HeliOS Project that we are able to do this .
Between them and second jobs I take , financially disadvantaged kids who normally would not have a computer are able to get one through our efforts .
As an aside , I want to take a minute and give my sincere thanks to Tom King for his help and support over the Labor Day weekend .
A wireless outage brought what we do here to a standstill and it was through Tom 's knowledge of networking that we were able to get things back on track again .
Tom also donated an extremely nice computer to The HeliOS Project .
That computer found a home yesterday .
Thank you Tom .
And David , as you know ... your computer found a home too .
Of course , you knew that already .
This is the part I struggled with David .
Seven letters .
Seven letters that make up your last name .
You have no idea how I 've agonized over typing those seven letters in this blog .
I so dearly want to .
You sanctimonious piece of trash .
Let me enlighten the others reading this blog David .
Let me explain to them what I am talking about .
As I am of the habit of doing , I email people who have donated their computers or money enough to build one complete computer , with the name of the recipient and a short bio .
It 's simply our way of showing folks where their efforts and generosity are going .
Our friend David it seems , has a problem with the recipient of his donated computer .
Yes , David was n't at all happy with our choice .
The child is in a single parent home and not living in a neighborhood many of us would feel comfortable entering .
Fact is , I was a bit aprehensive myself going there .
The boy was elated with his computer .
Unfortunately , David did n't much appreciate our canidate for his machine .
Dear Mr. Starks ,
Had I known you were going to waste my perfectly good computer on an idiot , I would have never donated it .
You can be assured you will receive no more support from me .
I trusted your judgement more than I should have .
David *******
Collin is the boy 's name and Collin was born with Downs Syndrome .
Apparently , David thinks that a person afflicted with Downs Syndrome is wasted human flesh .
David , as a self - described Linux Geek and FOSS supporter , I could absolutely ruin your day with one name .
One of the most gifted and talented members of our community has Downs Syndrome .
Google it .
I 'll not bring his good name into this .
And yet I still struggle ... for I 've not yet signed off of this blog and I still itch to make the world aware of who you are ... not that any one would recognize you ...
I simply want to punish you for being who you are .
In all David , I have given it some thought and you are right .
Collin was not deserving of the machine you donated to him .
In fact , I left his house at 4 PM this afternoon with your computer in my arms and placed it in my car .
I hope you are happy .
In it 's place , I installed a brand new HP A6560 .
With 17 inch Viewsonic monitor .
And Bose Sub - Woofer sound System .
Here is the best part David .
I told Collin and Marcy , his mother , that you had given it some serious thought and in doing so , decided that a used computer was n't going to do .
I told them that you said Collin deserved much more than a used , frankenstein machine and that you were happy to help someone with Collin 's obvious intelligence and talent .
He is quite an accomplished little artist at his young age David .
I am going to be eating a lot of mac and cheese the rest of the month David .
I paid for that computer and monitor out of my pocket and it took almost everything I had saved to do it but you know what ?
It was worth it .
And I would do it again .
The world is full of " Idiots " like Collin .
It grieves me to know the world is full of people like you as well David .
All - Righty
Then ...
Going outside today , Britons ?
Do watch for the sky falling .
Because Nintendo's dominance over the top end of the charts has been loosened by , of all things , a PC game , of which we 've seen maybe 3 or 4 in these charts over the past two years .
Sure , it was to be expected being Spore and all , but still , it 's a rarity to be savoured nonetheless .
Right behind Will Wright 's latest is Mercenaries 2 , proving that you do n't need flashy petrol giveaways to secure sales .
You just need some Peter Stormare .

Teenagers ( and adults ) would benefit from a bit more chivalry in their behavior .
For students , here are some suggested guidelines :
Boys
When you see a girl carrying something heavy , offer to carry it for her .
Stand up when a girl or woman enters the room .
Speak in a respectful manner in front of a girl , and even more so in the presence of her parents .
Be appreciative when girls bake cookies for the entire class .
Compliment girls ( appropriately ) .
Refrain from staring , commenting or whistling at attractive girls .
Open doors for girls .
If on a date with a young lady , behave with respect and decorum .
Offer to purchase tickets or meals for girls , and develop a work ethic to provide money for that .
Do not disparage or harass girls who you may find homely .
Never hit or physically harm a lady .
Girls
Put your superior social skills to good use by welcoming others .
Do not attempt to embarrass a boy , as in trying to beat him in arm - wrestling or bragging that you did better on a test .
When a boy does help you , as in carrying something or opening a door , thank him .
Avoid gossip .
Dress modestly , not provocatively or suggestively .
Avoid profanity .
Only agree to date those boys of whom your parents have approved .
The drug - sniffing dogs were coming .
They knew they were in trouble again – for carrying chocolate .
Even with their certified letter from the Department of Justice , which clearly outlined the organic chocolate they were carting across the U.S. border was , in fact , chocolate , Nadine Artemis and her partner , Ron Obadia , prepared themselves for the worst .
Sure enough , just like the last time , the couple was arrested and charged with exporting a controlled substance .
" It was absolutely crazy , " said Artemis , 37 .
" We do n't know what it is that sets the dogs off , but it does . "
This was Sept. 11 .
Just one month earlier , on Aug. 3 , the pair had attempted to board a plane bound for Minnesota at Pearson airport .
The couple run Living Libations , a natural food and beauty care company .
" I'm a botanical formulator , so we 're carrying all this strange stuff – little vials of jasmine , vanilla .
" We have a lot of exotic stuff , " she said .
They had also packed some raw , organic chocolate – made of unrefined , unprocessed cacao , maca root , hemp seeds and goji berries .
" At first the ( customs officials ) said , ' Oh , you guys are just holistic . '
Then the dogs came . "
The animals went nuts over the chocolate .
A rapid drug test was done , which returned a false positive result for hashish .
Artemis and Obadia , a yoga expert who once toured with the Barenaked Ladies , were arrested .
Their baby son was taken away .
" They took us into separate rooms and interrogated us .
That 's when they ( lied and ) told me Ron had confessed everything , " she said .
" We were absolutely dumbfounded , confounded , and , of course , afraid .
Utterly afraid . "
They contacted criminal lawyer Marcy Segal .
By month 's end , she had arranged for forensic testing that proved the chocolate was , in fact , just that .
The charges were dropped .
Business frequently takes the couple to the United States , so they were eager to clear their name .
They arranged to meet an immigration lawyer at the Lewiston bridge for a supervised trial run , armed with papers detailing the bogus arrest and a certified letter from the Department of Justice in Brampton explaining the product .
Customs officials initially accepted the papers , but said they still needed to bring out the dogs .
Those charges are still pending .

For Segal , the irony is outrageous .
" Neither of these people consume alcohol or marijuana .
They 're completely natural , " said Segal .
" Clearly , these NIK ( rapid drug ) tests are unreliable .
Whether or not anything is going to be done about it is yet to be determined . "
On the second try in a week , the $ 700 billion bailout ( “ rescue ” ) bill ( “ The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 ” ) was easily stampeded through the House with a vote of 263 to 171 , despite public opposition .
The measure strongly and eerily resembles the Reconstruction Finance Corporation ( RFC ) , which as Independent Institute Senior Fellow Robert Higgs has shown in his book , Depression , War and Cold War , was modeled after the corporatist War Finance Corporation of World War I .
The RFC was created in 1932 by President Herbert Hoover and then expanded by Franklin Roosevelt in an attempt to bail out and prop up insolvent , politically connected banks , railroads and other firms whose malinvestments resulted from the Federal Reserve ’s financial bubble of the late 1920s .
According to Hoover , “ We used such emergency powers to win the war ; we can use them to fight the depression . ”
FDR similarly stated that in describing the financial panic as “ a crisis in our national life comparable to war , ” he would seek “ broad executive power to wage a war against the emergency as great as the power that would be given me if we were in fact invaded by a foreign foe . ”
However , as Dr. Higgs documents , instead of being a “ rescue ” plan , the RFC was a major factor in deepening and prolonging the Great Depression and fomenting and protecting industrial cartelization .
Unfortunately , the myth of the New Deal and the need for federal dominance over the economy persists in American political culture and has been used to rationalize the new Paulson / Bush / Pelosi / Frank / Dodd / McCain / Obama bailout — the single largest redistribution of wealth in history from the general public to politically connected business interests .
And all of this while commercial and consumer credit shows no sign of a crisis .
All it apparently took to persuade a sufficient number of House members to change their earlier vote was a barrel of earmarks ( tax and subsidy provisions ) plus a meaningless increase in the level of bank savings “ insured ” by the federal government to $ 250,000 from $ 100,000 .
Yet , no sooner did the bailout bill pass and Bush quickly signed it , the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down 150 points .
Meanwhile , none of the causes of the subprime mortgage meltdown itself have been addressed .
Instead , many politicians and pundits have incredibly blamed the “ free market ” as if government was not the dominant influence in American banking and finance today .
However now in the new Independent Policy Report , Anatomy of a Train Wreck : Causes of the Mortgage Meltdown , Research Fellow Stan Liebowitz sets the record straight by showing how and why the federal government - dominated housing and regulatory establishment is responsible for creating the financial crisis starting in the early 1990s , in a misguided , politically - motivated attempt to increase home ownership .
As Dr. Liebowitz notes :
[ T ]he tool chosen to achieve this goal was one that endangered the entire mortgage enterprise : intentional weakening of the traditional mortgage lending standards .
. . . and the decline in mortgage underwriting standards was universally praised as an ‘ innovation ’ in mortgage lending .
For further information , please see the news release for Anatomy of a Train Wreck as well the cover story based on it in the new issue ( October 20 , 2008 ) of National Review ( subscription required ) .
This very timely and far - reaching Independent Policy Report is also included in the Independent Institute ’s forthcoming book , Housing America : Building Out a Crisis , edited by Randall G. Holcombe and Benjamin W. Powell .
The market has been working for the last three years to correct for the housing bubble caused by the Federal Reserve .
Government intervention over the last year has been an impediment to the correction process .
In the absence of these interventions and the promise of even more , the correction process would be much further along and more resources would have been reallocated and the recovery process would already be well underway .
Home builder stocks began their correction in late July of 2005 signaling the end of the housing bubble .
I knew one local home builder who sold off his inventory of homes and left the industry at this time .
By this time I was receiving calls and emails from prospective home buyers asking if they should still buy given what they had read on www.Mises.org
Off course the mortgage broker firms that were hawking all sorts of mortgage " products " were forced out of business long ago .
They exited without much fan fair .
It was a market correction to a problem brought about by the Federal Reserve .
Right before they started their exit the then Vice Chairman of the Fed , Ben Bernanke , said that regulators had looked into the mortgage market and that everything was fine .
More recently , home builders continue to downsize , bad banks are failing , and the financial retrenchment has reached Wall Street .
Hedge funds now see their glory days in the past , and once prominent Investment banks that were extremely leveraged have seen their risky schemes come undone .
Efforts to bailout and save these firms have only delayed the recovery .
The government schemes known as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have also been revealed as irrational .
Public - private partnership like this are extremely dangerous and they became the conduit to hiding the risks of the housing bubble .
It would have been far better for the government to force them into bankruptcy rather than " conservatorship " which puts the taxpayers at risk and perpetuates their danger to the economy .
Finally , the derivatives markets is coming undone .
Once touted as a way to eliminate risk , these " financial products " have been revealed as a dangerous illusion .
Hedging strategies are fine and good , but Wall Street used these new methods to take on ever increasing levels of risk , not to mitigate existing risk .
The rush to bailout Wall Street must cease and be reversed or they will bailout American into the next great depression .
Besides having this impossibly to resist round shape , the Solaleya domes are amazing inventions signed by Patrick Marsilli .
The first Solaleya saw the light of the sun in France , 1988 and 130 more were built up until present times .
The special mushroom shape and the huge windows allow a sun day long natural lighting .
There ’s also something special about this Solaleya houses – you can opt for a rotating dome because the Solaleya have sun rooftops and you can rotate the house following the sun .
The energy used for a 360 deg rotation equals a vacuum cleaner round in the entire house .
Even if the Solaleya is 90 % made of wood , it has been proven hurricane and earthquake resistant .
I do n’t know if I could get used to this round shape , but this dome looks wonderful !
The wood , the solar rooftop make from Solaleya one of my favorite houses .

ST . PAUL , Minn . —
Fearing demonstrations from Ron Paul delegates here at the Republican National Convention , the party has created a “ black - hat ” squad to track the Paulites and other potential troublemakers to make sure they do n’t cause a scene on the convention floor .
Identified by their black baseball caps emblazoned with a white star , squad members keep an eye on delegates they fear might cause a scene .
The squad is empowered by the convention managers to take delegates ’ credentials and kick them off the convention floor — a step one convention official said would be unprecedented .
Squad members have made “ their presence known , to let all people know big brother ’s watching them , ” said a Republican official familiar with the squad who has been involved in the last 10 GOP conventions .
Convention spokesmen did not respond to requests for comment .
The black - hat squad is on the lookout for T - shirts , unauthorized signs and anything else that could cause a disruption , according to people familiar with the operation who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to talk to the press .
Convention leaders always have been vigilant about outsiders gaining unauthorized access to their events , but this time the danger comes from within : Mr. Paul , who sought the Republican presidential nomination , won dozens of delegates to the convention and has hundreds of other supporters who are credentialed to attend .
What ’s more , Mr. Paul ’s supporters have been creative about getting attention for themselves .
“ Here they have a vocal group who are actually in the building who want to make a statement , ” the official said .
So far , Paul delegates and backers have remained subdued .
On Wednesday night the only disturbance in the hall came from two demonstrators from Code Pink , the anti-war organization .
They apparently gained access to the arena with press credentials but were scooped off the floor quickly by the black - hat squad , among others .
In addition to the black hats on the floor , there are also convention aides with yellow hats , who are the rapid - response team to handle disturbances ; those with red hats , who are the floor managers ; and those with white hats , who serve as ushers , helping with seating and passing out papers .
The floor and security managers include both lobbyists and longtime Washington political operatives .
The black hats ’ power comes from their authority to revoke credentials .
The fine print on the back of each credential says : “ This ticket is a revokable license .
Tickets may be revoked from persons engaging in inappropriate or disorderly behavior , or for any other reason deemed necessary by security personnel and / or the Republican National Committee .
Mr. Paul ’s spokesman , Jesse Benton , said Republican Party officials warned Paul supporters not to cause a commotion .
“ There have been some overtures to our political guys and our delegates that if they acted up , they would be removed , ” Mr. Benton said .
He said the Paul campaign has identified 260 delegates and hundreds of alternates to the convention who support Mr. Paul even though , by the rules of the convention , they are bound to other candidates .
Republican officials asked the campaign for a list of those supporters , but the Paul campaign declined , Mr. Benton said .
Mr. Paul conducted his own counter - convention in Minneapolis on Tuesday and made his way through the press areas of the Republicans ’ event Wednesday .
But he will not visit the convention floor this week .
Mr. Benton said Mr. Paul and his supporters were unable to reach an agreement on rules for his visit .
Mr. Paul , who as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Texas , is entitled to a pass and wanted credentials for a few staffers .
But Mr. Benton said convention officials wanted to control Mr. Paul ’s access and did not allow his staff on the floor , insisting that they have a party escort .

My friend Jamie* wants you to know she does n't hate children .
That 's not why , at age 24 , she decided to get sterilized .
She 's " just always known " she did n't want to have kids herself ; she says , " I think it 's just something you can know . "
She 's also aware that not everyone understands why a woman her age would want this procedure , so when a Jezebel reader requested a post on sterilization for younger women , she was happy to talk to me about her experience .
Turns out " getting fixed , " as she calls it , was actually the easy part .
Jamie did n't want surgery , but when she heard about the less invasive Essure , a metal coil that creates scar tissue in the fallopian tubes , she was intrigued .
She did a lot of research , especially on post - sterilization regret , which for young women seems to be greatest if you 've already had children .
Then she met with a doctor who she feared would turn her away because of her age .
He did ask her a lot of questions ( including the rather offensive , " What if you met a billionaire who wanted to have kids with you ? " ) , but he eventually approved her for the procedure .
I drove her to the appointment and waited at the clinic while she had the device inserted .
I wo n't say it was n't a weird experience — the clinic also did cosmetic surgery , so it was kind of a palace , and I sat there reading Vogue while my friend got screws shoved up her reproductive organs .
For her part , she says it did n't hurt at all .
They did have to dilate her cervix and pump her uterus full of water , so she came out a little nauseous and tired , but in good spirits .
The real fallout came when she told her parents .
Her mom cried , and asked why she could n't " just let her life unfold " the way other people did .
Up to that point I 'd been totally on board with Jamie 's decision , but her mom 's tears gave me a twinge of doubt .
I wondered if I 'd helped her carry out a choice she 'd later regret .
But Jamie tells me she does n't even think of it as a choice .
When a gay friend of hers found out about her parents ' reaction , he told her it sounded a lot like coming out .
She was revealing " an important fact about who she was , that could n't be changed , and her parents did n't want to accept it . "
She believes the desire not to have children can be something innate , as basic as the urge to procreate .
On the question of kids , she says , " sometimes the answer is just no . "
Her parents are n't the only ones who disapprove .
Even the nurse at the clinic assumed Jamie was " done having kids , " and was taken aback when Jamie explained that zero was enough for her .
Jamie says most people see not wanting kids as a function of youth , not a deeply held conviction .
When I asked how she felt about explaining her sterilization to people , she told me this : " Does it need to be defended ?
No .
But people will feel entitled to an explanation , and you can get mad about that , or you can think of something to say .
"
Which seems pretty good way to think about any big decision in your life , especially if it sets you apart from what people think of as normal .
* Not her real name .

Brad Paisley Arrested ( Video )
arrived in Nashville via private jet around 3:15 am on October 18th , and was promptly greeted and handcuffed by two police officers who informed the country music star he was being arrested for outstanding warrants in Texas and Tennessee .
The arresting officers were waiting on the tarmac in unmarked cars and told Paisley there were allegations that he had been involved with some serious crimes .
After a prank - filled tour with tourmates Jewel and Chuck Wicks , the " bust " was an elaborate prank carried out by Jewel and her tour crew .
On the last night of the tour in San Antonio , Texas on Saturday , Chuck pranked Brad by stepping onto the stage covered with maple syrup and feathers .
Then during Jewel 's set a large man dressed as a giant condom swung just feet over her head , and Brad thought he had the last laugh .
Paisley admits his guilt when the officers tell him he has been charged with " excessive noodling . "
View video of Brad Paisley 's " arrest " below .
Aliens are set to invade Alabama on October 14 , 2008 , for a full 72 hours , according to UFO " experts . "
Hey , I do n't make this stuff up .
I just report it .
Blossom Goodchild , an Aussie actress and author , has predicted " the eminent appearance of a massive extraterrestrial spacecraft for October 14th , 2008 . "
And if you can't trust an authoritarian named Blossom Goodchild to be accurate about these things , who can you trust ?
Well , apparently Blossom is n't the only one making the prediction .
It seems other " experts ' corroborate her prediction .
In a book titled " Secrets of the Light , " published in 2004 , author Dannion Brinkley wrote :
“ By the year 2008 , the fact that we are not alone in the universe will be made undeniably clear to everyone on the planet .
With millions of planets and billions of stars , I cannot fathom how we could ever thought in any other terms .
However , for those who have doubted , the extraterrestrials will make themselves known .
I believe they feel they have no choice but to show themselves as we verge on self - annihilation , genocide and toxic poisoning .
The truth of our inter-galactic lineage will become common knowledge .
If I am to believe the vision , the truth of our intergalactic lineage will cause humanity to take one wild ride . ”
So what did the Alabama aliens have to say to Blossom and the world at large ?
The cosmic beings , calling themselves " The Federation of Light , " channeled the following message :
TO LEADERS , GOVERNERS , POLITICIANS AND
ALL PEOPLE OF EARTH ….
We wish it to be understood that on the 14th day of your month of October in the year 2008 a craft of great size shall be visible within your skies .
It shall be in the south of your hemisphere and it shall scan over many of your states .
We give to you the name of Alabama .
It has been decided that we shall remain within your atmosphere for the minimum of three of your twenty four hour periods .
During this time there will be much commotion upon your earth plane .
Your highest authorities will be intruding into ‘ our ’ atmospherics that surround our ship .
This ‘ security field ’ is necessary for us , as there shall take place a ‘ farce ’ from those in your world who shall try to deny that we come in LOVE .
KNOW OF THIS
WE COME TO ASSIST YOUR WORLD .
WE DO NOT COME TO TAKE OVER .
WE DO NOT COME TO DESTRUCT .
WE COME TO GIVE YOU HOPE .
We are beings from other planets , who for many eons of your time have been preparing for these days ahead .
We ask each soul that reads of these words to accept in their heart the Truth that lies within .
For in that place there is the knowing that this is to take place .
There shall be many who deny .
There shall be many who dismiss .
There shall be those who KNOW of this TRUTH .
Which ever you may be … let this be understood .
IT SHALL TAKE PLACE .
We give you the opportunity to capture on screen this particular ship .
There shall be no contact in the form that those of your planet would like .
For this initial presentation , we shall simply be presenting our ship to you .
We say to you …
That shall certainly be enough to comprehend initially .
All kinds of methods shall be carried out in order to try and penetrate through our security barrier , but they shall be to no avail .
Until we can PROVE to you that we come in LOVE , we will not allow the fullness of our visits to be uncovered .
KNOW OF THIS …
THIS IS THE BEGINNING … NOT THE END
Your governments and your media will try to disguise us .
This will fail .
All avenues have been covered by us .
Your media will have no choice but to portray the TRUTH for it shall be there for all to see .
Friends of earth .
Do not be afraid .
We beseech you to TRUST that we come to bring the downfall of those who have misintentions for the well being of your planet .
If we do not intervene now … as has been planned for eons of your earth time … then we fear it would be too late .
WE ASK YOU TO ACCEPT US IN LOVE .
FOR THAT IS WHY WE COME .
The sayings that your world have been aware of via your movie screens etc were not merely make believe .
We have been planting and watering seeds of Truth on your planet in preparation for these days .
FOR INDEED
WE COME IN PEACE .
Fill your souls with TRUST in that knowledge .
We are your brothers and sisters from other places .
Our technology is far advanced .
There are those in high places of ruling that KNOW full well of this .
Therefore they know that there would be little point trying to ‘ pretend ’ that they need weapons to destroy us .
On this day that we appear , we ask you to listen only to your hearts and NOT to the words of those who shall be in great fear of losing their power .
For too long your world has lived under a cloud that most of you have been unaware of .
If you were to KNOW the Truths of what has been hidden from you , you would be appalled and in great disbelief .
It is time for your souls to be allowed to be who they are .
The veil is to be removed .
BE OF JOY .
IT IS A TIME FOR THAT .
YOU SHALL KNOW OF THIS AS YOUR HEART ACCEPTS THE TRUE REASON FOR OUR VISIT .
TO BRING YOU AN UNDERSTANDING OF LOVE .
KNOW THIS .
We choose to leave it at that .
Be vigilant .
Keep your eyes to the skies .
Keep LOVE in your heart .
WE … THE FEDERATION OF LIGHT … SIGN OFF , GIVING YOU ENCOURAGEMENT AND HOPE AS WE BEGIN THE ASCENSION INTO THE NEW WORLD .
Each one of you has chosen to be here for this ascension .
Choose now whether your human form will …
Accept it through LOVE Or Reject it through FEAR .
May the Highest aspect of your soul fill you with Light as you move bravely forward .
Gratitude to each one as they assist us in the cause
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Several big life insurance stocks fell sharply Thursday , dragged down by jitters about their role in the credit crisis and fears sparked by a comment from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nev. , Wednesday about a potential bankruptcy in the industry .
" We do n't have a lot of leeway on time .
One of the individuals in the caucus today talked about a major insurance company .
A major insurance company -- one with a name that everyone knows that 's on the verge of going bankrupt .
That 's what this is all about , " Reid said prior to the Senate 's approval of the $ 700 billion bailout bill .
Steven Schwartz , an analyst who covers insurance companies for Raymond James & Associates , said that even before Reid made his bankruptcy comment , investors were growing worried about life insurers ' exposure to real estate as well as " secondary exposure " via investments in troubled finance firms like Lehman Bros , Wachovia and Washington Mutual .
But the comment from Reid clearly caused even more fear .
" Harry Reid did n't help any , " Schwartz said .
New York - based MetLife ( MET , Fortune 500 ) was one of the hardest - hit insurers Thursday .
Its stock plunged nearly 16 % .
Thursday 's drop comes after a 14 % decline on Wednesday .
In light of this , MetLife issued a statement Thursday afternoon to address Reid 's comments .
" The statement yesterday by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid does not apply to MetLife .
MetLife is financially sound and has high ratings from all of the major insurance ratings agencies .
MetLife is fully able to meet all its obligations , " the company said .
Shares of Hartford Financial Services ( HIG , Fortune 500 ) fell about 33 % , following a 7 % decline on Wednesday .
The stock has lost more than half of its value this week .
Jeffrey Schuman , analyst for Keefe , Bruyette & Woods , wrote in a report that the sell - off stems from worries about the company 's third quarter results , which will be released later this month .
Schuman estimated that Hartford has " likely " experienced credit losses of up to $ 800 million from preferred stocks and debt tied to Lehman , AIG and Washington Mutual .
These concerns prompted Fitch Ratings to impose a " negative outlook " on the company Monday , raising more concerns about the company 's need for capital .
Schuman wrote in a note that the recent drop was " likely overdone " but added that Hartford will face " difficult operating headwinds and ongoing credit losses " in the near - term .
A call to Hartford for comment Thursday was not immediately returned .
But on Wednesday , the company said that its " core operating businesses are performing well and our liquidity remains strong . "
A spokesman for Sen .
Reid backtracked a bit Thursday and said that the senator was not aware of any company being in danger of bankruptcy .
" Senator Reid is not personally aware of any particular company being on the verge of bankruptcy .
He has no special knowledge about [ a bankruptcy ] nor has he talked to any insurance company officials , " said Jim Manley , spokesman for Sen.
Reid , in an email to CNNMoney.com .
" Rather , his comments were meant to refer to the conditions in the financial sector generally .
He regrets any confusion his comments may have caused , " Manley added .
Still , shares of other top life insurers also fell sharply Thursday .
Paris - based AXA ( AXA ) dropped 12.5 % % .
Other insurers -- including Canadian based Manulife Financial Corp. ( MFC ) , which owns John Hancock , Prudential Financial ( PRU , Fortune 500 ) and Principal Financial Group ( PFG , Fortune 500 ) -- also slipped , falling 6 % , 11 % and 15.5 % respectively .
Schwartz of Raymond James said some of the concerns about insurers are overblown .
He said that , generally speaking , insurers have n't invested in the types of " truly toxic assets " that have led to huge losses for some investment banks and commercial banks .
He described the failure of AIG , which lost billions of dollars on credit default swaps tied to subprime loans and was essentially taken over by the government in exchange for an $ 85 billion bridge loan , as " very atypical " for the insurance industry .
" The industry will get through this , " said Schwartz .
" [ But ] that 's not to say there wo n't be strains . "
I notice that the McCain campaign has now explicitly named Max Boot as a key advisor and campaign surrogate .
So I ’d be interested in seeing a list of all the completely insane things Max has said and written over the last decade .
My favorite is when he told me — circa 2002 — that the US should seize and confiscate the Saudi oil fields and run them as a protectorate .
There are plenty of examples .
And they ’re a good way to illustrate the nuthouse a McCain foreign policy would be .
Please take a look and see what you can find and then send in the best stuff with citations .

Last fall , scientist and provocateur David Keith offered one of the most conversation - provoking TEDTalks ever — calmly discussing ideas for geo-engineering our climate that border on shocking ( like shooting a cloud of sulphurous particles into the stratosphere to simulate the cooling effects of a major volcanic eruption ) .
It ’s a scary subject , but as Keith pointed out , someone , someday , is going to think that major geo- engineering is a very good idea .
( As a commenter said just this morning : “ / sigh . ” )
Now Philip Boyd of the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research in Dunedin , New Zealand , takes the next step in the New Scientist , and ranks the major ideas in geo- engineering by risk , cost , speed of implementation , and how well they would work .
The chart above comes from Nature Geoscience , which is behind a paywall , but the kind bloggers at The Great Beyond share it .

MILAN 
The metal shutters are closed at Shining Bar , a coffee shop near the central train station here .
On the facade , someone has written “ proud to be black ” and spray - painted “ Abba Lives ” in red .
Abba was the nickname of Abdul William Guibre , who was born in Burkina Faso , raised in Italy and beaten to death here last month by the bar ’s father - and - son proprietors .
The two , Fausto and Daniele Cristofoli , suspected Mr. Guibre , 19 , of stealing money and set upon him with a metal rod , the authorities said , when it was later determined he had stolen a package of cookies .
During the altercation , the attackers shouted “ dirty black , ” lawyers for both sides said .
Although there is some debate about whether the killing was racially motivated , the attack on Mr. Guibre was the most severe in a recent spate of violence against immigrants across Italy .
The attacks are fueling a national conversation about racism and tolerance in a country that has only recently transformed itself from a nation of emigrants into a prime destination for immigrants .
“ A black English person , or French person , or Dutch person , that ’s O.K. , ” said Giovanni Giulio Valtolina , a psychologist and scholar at the ISMU Foundation in Milan , which studies multiethnic societies .
“ But a black Italian is a very new thing . ”

The Article : Make - Believe Maverick : A closer look at the life and career of John McCain reveals a disturbing record of recklessness and dishonesty by Tim Dickerson in Rolling Stone .
The Text : At Fort McNair , an army base located along the Potomac River in the nation ’s capital , a chance reunion takes place one day between two former POWs .
It ’s the spring of 1974 , and Navy commander John Sidney McCain III has returned home from the experience in Hanoi that , according to legend , transformed him from a callow and reckless youth into a serious man of patriotism and purpose .
Walking along the grounds at Fort McNair , McCain runs into John Dramesi , an Air Force lieutenant colonel who was also imprisoned and tortured in Vietnam .
McCain is studying at the National War College , a prestigious graduate program he had to pull strings with the Secretary of the Navy to get into .
Dramesi is enrolled , on his own merit , at the Industrial College of the Armed Forces in the building next door .
There ’s a distance between the two men that belies their shared experience in North Vietnam — call it an honor gap .
Like many American POWs , McCain broke down under torture and offered a “ confession ” to his North Vietnamese captors .
Dramesi , in contrast , attempted two daring escapes .
For the second he was brutalized for a month with daily torture sessions that nearly killed him .
His partner in the escape , Lt. Col .
Ed Atterberry , did n’t survive the mistreatment .
But Dramesi never said a disloyal word , and for his heroism was awarded two Air Force Crosses , one of the service ’s highest distinctions .
McCain would later hail him as “ one of the toughest guys I ’ve ever met . ”
On the grounds between the two brick colleges , the chitchat between the scion of four - star admirals and the son of a prizefighter turns to their academic travels ; both colleges sponsor a trip abroad for young officers to network with military and political leaders in a distant corner of the globe .
“ I ’m going to the Middle East , ” Dramesi says .
“ Turkey , Kuwait , Lebanon , Iran . ”
“ Why are you going to the Middle East ? ” McCain asks , dismissively .
“ It ’s a place we ’re probably going to have some problems , ” Dramesi says .
“ Why ?
Where are you going to , John ? ”
“ Oh , I ’m going to Rio . ”
“ What the hell are you going to Rio for ? ”
McCain , a married father of three , shrugs .
“ I got a better chance of getting laid . ”
Dramesi , who went on to serve as chief war planner for U.S. Air Forces in Europe and commander of a wing of the Strategic Air Command , was not surprised .
“ McCain says his life changed while he was in Vietnam , and he is now a different man , ” Dramesi says today .
“ But he ’s still the undisciplined , spoiled brat that he was when he went in . ”
McCAIN FIRST
This is the story of the real John McCain , the one who has been hiding in plain sight .
It is the story of a man who has consistently put his own advancement above all else , a man willing to say and do anything to achieve his ultimate ambition : to become commander in chief , ascending to the one position that would finally enable him to outrank his four - star father and grandfather .
In its broad strokes , McCain ’s life story is oddly similar to that of the current occupant of the White House .
John Sidney McCain III and George Walker Bush both represent the third generation of American dynasties .
Both were born into positions of privilege against which they rebelled into mediocrity .
Both developed an uncanny social intelligence that allowed them to skate by with a minimum of mental exertion .
Both struggled with booze and loutish behavior .
At each step , with the aid of their fathers ’ powerful friends , both failed upward .
And both shed their skins as Episcopalian members of the Washington elite to build political careers as self - styled , ranch - inhabiting Westerners who pray to Jesus in their wives ’ evangelical churches .
In one vital respect , however , the comparison is deeply unfair to the current president : George W. Bush was a much better pilot .
This , of course , is not the story McCain tells about himself .
Few politicians have so actively , or successfully , crafted their own myth of greatness .
In Mc- Cain ’s version of his life , he is a prodigal son who , steeled by his brutal internment in Vietnam , learned to put “ country first . ”
Remade by the Keating Five scandal that nearly wrecked his career , the story goes , McCain re-emerged as a “ reformer ” and a “ maverick , ” righteously eschewing anything that “ might even tangentially be construed as a less than proper use of my office . ”
It ’s a myth McCain has cultivated throughout his decades in Washington .
But during the course of this year ’s campaign , the mask has slipped .
“ Let ’s face it , ” says Larry Wilkerson , a retired Army colonel who served as chief of staff to Secretary of State Colin Powell .
“ John McCain made his reputation on the fact that he does n’t bend his principles for politics .
That ’s just not true . ”
We have now watched McCain run twice for president .
The first time he positioned himself as a principled centrist and decried the politics of Karl Rove and the influence of the religious right , imploring voters to judge candidates “ by the example we set , by the way we conduct our campaigns , by the way we personally practice politics . ”
After he lost in 2000 , he jagged hard to the left — breaking with the president over taxes , drilling , judicial appointments , even flirting with joining the Democratic Party .
In his current campaign , however , McCain has become the kind of politician he ran against in 2000 .
He has embraced those he once denounced as “ agents of intolerance , ” promised more drilling and deeper tax cuts , even compromised his vaunted opposition to torture .
Intent on winning the presidency at all costs , he has reassembled the very team that so viciously smeared him and his family eight years ago , selecting as his running mate a born - again moose hunter whose only qualification for office is her ability to electrify Rove ’s base .
And he has engaged in a “ practice of politics ” so deceptive that even Rove himself has denounced it , saying that the outright lies in McCain ’s campaign ads go “ too far ” and fail the “ truth test . ”
The missing piece of this puzzle , says a former McCain confidant who has fallen out with the senator over his neoconservatism , is a third , never realized , campaign that McCain intended to run against Bush in 2004 .
“ McCain wanted a rematch , based on ethics , campaign finance and Enron — the corrupt relationship between Bush ’s team and the corporate sector , ” says the former friend , a prominent conservative thinker with whom McCain shared his plans over the course of several dinners in 2001 .
“ But when 9/11 happened , McCain saw his chance to challenge Bush again was robbed .
He saw 9/11 gave Bush and his failed presidency a second life .
He saw Bush and Cheney ’s ability to draw stark contrasts between black and white , villains and good guys .
And that ’s why McCain changed . ”
( The McCain campaign did not respond to numerous requests for comment from Rolling Stone . )
Indeed , many leading Republicans who once admired McCain see his recent contortions to appease the GOP base as the undoing of a maverick .
“ John McCain ’s ambition overrode his basic character , ” says Rita Hauser , who served on the President ’s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board from 2001 to 2004 .
But the truth of the matter is that ambition is John McCain ’s basic character .
Seen in the sweep of his seven - decade personal history , his pandering to the right is consistent with the only constant in his life : doing what ’s best for himself .
To put the matter squarely : John McCain is his own special interest .
“ John has made a pact with the devil , ” says Lincoln Chafee , the former GOP senator , who has been appalled at his one - time colleague ’s readiness to sacrifice principle for power .
Chafee and McCain were the only Republicans to vote against the Bush tax cuts .
They locked arms in opposition to drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge .
And they worked together in the “ Gang of 14 , ” which blocked some of Bush ’s worst judges from the federal bench .
“ On all three — sadly , sadly , sadly — McCain has flip - flopped , ” Chafee says .
And forget all the “ Country First ” sloganeering , he adds .
“ McCain is putting himself first .
He ’s putting himself first in blinking neon lights . ”
THE NAVY BRAT
John Sidney McCain III has spent most of his life trying to escape the shadow of greater men .
His grandfather Adm. John Sidney “ Slew ” McCain earned his four stars commanding a U.S. carrier force in World War II .
His deeply ambitious father , Adm. “ Junior ” McCain , reached the same rank , commanding America ’s forces in the Pacific during Vietnam .
The youngest McCain was not cut from the same cloth .
Even as a toddler , McCain recalls in Faith of My Fathers , his volcanic temper was on display .
“ At the smallest provocation , ” he would hold his breath until he passed out : “ I would go off in a mad frenzy , and then , suddenly , crash to the floor unconscious . ”
His parents cured him of this habit in a way only a CIA interrogator could appreciate : by dropping their blue - faced boy in a bathtub of ice - cold water .
Trailing his hard - charging , hard - drinking father from post to post , McCain did n’t play well with others .
Indeed , he concedes , his runty physique inspired a Napoleon complex : “ My small stature motivated me to . . . fight the first kid who provoked me . ”
McCain spent his formative years among the Washington elite .
His father — himself deep in the throes of a daddy complex — had secured a political post as the Navy ’s chief liaison to the Senate , a job his son would later hold , and the McCain home on Southeast 1st Street was a high - powered pit stop in the Washington cocktail circuit .
Growing up , McCain attended Episcopal High School , an all - white , all - boys boarding school across the Potomac in Virginia , where tuition today tops $ 40,000 a year .
There , McCain behaved with all the petulance his privilege allowed , earning the nicknames “ Punk ” and “ McNasty . ”
Even his friends seemed to dislike him , with one recalling him as “ a mean little fucker . ”
McCain was not only a lousy student , he had his father ’s taste for drink and a darkly misogynistic streak .
The summer after his sophomore year , cruising with a friend near Arlington , McCain tried to pick up a pair of young women .
When they laughed at him , he cursed them so vilely that he was hauled into court on a profanity charge .
McCain ’s admittance to Annapolis was preordained by his bloodline .
But martial discipline did not seem to have much of an impact on his character .
By his own account , McCain was a lazy , incurious student ; he squeaked by only by prevailing upon his buddies to help him cram for exams .
He continued to get sauced and treat girls badly .
Before meeting a girlfriend ’s parents for the first time , McCain got so shitfaced that he literally crashed through the screen door when he showed up in his white midshipman ’s uniform .
His grandfather ’s name and his father ’s forbearance brought McCain a charmed existence at Annapolis .
On his first trip at sea — to Rio de Janeiro aboard the USS Hunt — the captain was a former student of his father .
While McCain ’s classmates learned the ins and outs of the boiler room , McCain got to pilot the ship to South America and back .
In Rio , he hobnobbed with admirals and the president of Brazil .
Back on campus , McCain ’s short fuse was legend .
“ We ’d hear this thunderous screaming and yelling between him and his roommate — doors slamming — and one of them would go running down the hall , ” recalls Phil Butler , who lived across the hall from McCain at the academy .
“ It was a regular occurrence . ”
When McCain was not shown the pampering to which he was accustomed , he grew petulant — even abusive .
He repeatedly blew up in the face of his commanding officer .
It was the kind of insubordination that would have gotten any other midshipman kicked out of Annapolis .
But his classmates soon realized that McCain was untouchable .
Midway though his final year , McCain faced expulsion , about to “ bilge out ” because of excessive demerits .
After his mother intervened , however , the academy ’s commandant stepped in .
Calling McCain “ spoiled ” to his face , he nonetheless issued a reprieve , scaling back the demerits .
McCain dodged expulsion a second time by convincing another midshipman to take the fall after McCain was caught with contraband .
“ He was a huge screw - off , ” recalls Butler .
“ He was always on probation .
The only reason he graduated was because of his father and his grandfather — they could n’t exactly get rid of him . ”
McCain ’s self - described “ four - year course of insubordination ” ended with him graduating fifth from the bottom — 894th out of a class of 899 .
It was a record of mediocrity he would continue as a pilot .
BOTTOM GUN
In the cockpit , McCain was not a top gun , or even a middling gun .
He took little interest in his flight manuals ; he had other priorities .
“ I enjoyed the off - duty life of a Navy flier more than I enjoyed the actual flying , ” McCain writes .
“ I drove a Corvette , dated a lot , spent all my free hours at bars and beach parties . ”
McCain chased a lot of tail .
He hit the dog track .
Developed a taste for poker and dice .
He picked up models when he could , screwed a stripper when he could n’t .
In the air , the hard - partying McCain had a knack for stalling out his planes in midflight .
He was still in training , in Texas , when he crashed his first plane into Corpus Christi Bay during a routine practice landing .
The plane stalled , and McCain was knocked cold on impact .
When he came to , the plane was underwater , and he had to swim to the surface to be rescued .
Some might take such a near - death experience as a wake - up call : McCain took some painkillers and a nap , and then went out carousing that night .
Off duty on his Mediterranean tours , McCain frequented the casinos of Monte Carlo , cultivating his taste for what he calls the “ addictive ” game of craps .
McCain ’s thrill - seeking carried over into his day job .
Flying over the south of Spain one day , he decided to deviate from his flight plan .
Rocketing along mere feet above the ground , his plane sliced through a power line .
His self - described “ daredevil clowning ” plunged much of the area into a blackout .
That should have been the end of McCain ’s flying career .
“ In the Navy , if you crashed one airplane , nine times out of 10 you would lose your wings , ” says Butler , who , like his former classmate , was shot down and taken prisoner in North Vietnam .
Spark “ a small international incident ” like McCain had ?
Any other pilot would have “ found themselves as the deck officer on a destroyer someplace in a hurry , ” says Butler .
“ But , God , he had family pull .
He was directly related to the CEO — you know ? ”
McCain was undeterred by the crashes .
Nearly a decade out of the academy , his career adrift , he decided he wanted to fly combat in Vietnam .
His motivation was n’t to contain communism or put his country first .
It was the only way he could think of to earn the respect of the man he calls his “ distant , inscrutable patriarch . ”
He needed to secure a command post in the Navy — and to do that , his career needed the jump - start that only a creditable war record could provide .
As he would so many times in his career , McCain pulled strings to get ahead .
After a game of tennis , McCain prevailed upon the undersecretary of the Navy that he was ready for Vietnam , despite his abysmal flight record .
Sure enough , McCain was soon transferred to McCain Field — an air base in Meridian , Mississippi , named after his grandfather — to train for a post on the carrier USS Forrestal .
With a close friend at the base , an alcoholic Marine captain , McCain formed the “ Key Fess Yacht Club , ” which quickly became infamous for hosting toga parties in the officers ’ quarters and bringing bands down from Memphis to attract loose women to the base .
Showing his usual knack for promotion , McCain rose from “ vice commodore ” to “ commodore ” of the club .
In 1964 , while still at the base , McCain began a serious romance with Carol Shepp , a vivacious former model who had just divorced one of his classmates from Annapolis .
Commandeering a Navy plane , McCain spent most weekends flying from Meridian to Philadelphia for their dates .
They married the following summer .
That December , McCain crashed again .
Flying back from Philadelphia , where he had joined in the reverie of the Army - Navy football game , McCain stalled while coming in for a refueling stop in Norfolk , Virginia .
This time he managed to bail out at 1,000 feet .
As his parachute deployed , his plane thundered into the trees below .
By now , however , McCain ’s flying privileges were virtually irrevocable — and he knew it .
On one of his runs at McCain Field , when ground control put him in a holding pattern , the lieutenant commander once again pulled his family ’s rank .
“ Let me land , ” McCain demanded over his radio , “ or I ’ll take my field and go home ! ”
TRIAL BY FIRE
Sometimes 3 a.m. moments occur at 10:52 in the morning .
It was July 29th , 1967 , a hot , gusty morning in the Gulf of Tonkin atop the four - acre flight deck of the supercarrier USS Forrestal .
Perched in the cockpit of his A - 4 Skyhawk , Lt. Cmdr. John McCain ticked nervously through his preflight checklist .
Now 30 years old , McCain was trying to live up to his father ’s expectations , to finally be known as something other than the fuck - up grandson of one of the Navy ’s greatest admirals .
That morning , preparing for his sixth bombing run over North Vietnam , the graying pilot ’s dreams of combat glory were beginning to seem within his reach .
Then , in an instant , the world around McCain erupted in flames .
A six - foot - long Zuni rocket , inexplicably launched by an F - 4 Phantom across the flight deck , ripped through the fuel tank of McCain ’s aircraft .
Hundreds of gallons of fuel splashed onto the deck and came ablaze .
Then : Clank .
Clank .
Two 1,000 - pound bombs dropped from under the belly of McCain ’s stubby A - 4 , the Navy ’s “ Tinkertoy Bomber , ” into the fire .
McCain , who knew more than most pilots about bailing out of a crippled aircraft , leapt forward out of the cockpit , swung himself down from the refueling probe protruding from the nose cone , rolled through the flames and ran to safety across the flight deck .
Just then , one of his bombs “ cooked off , ” blowing a crater in the deck and incinerating the sailors who had rushed past McCain with hoses and fire extinguishers .
McCain was stung by tiny bits of shrapnel in his legs and chest , but the wounds were n’t serious ; his father would later report to friends that Johnny “ came through without a scratch . ”
The damage to the Forrestal was far more grievous :
The explosion set off a chain reaction of bombs , creating a devastating inferno that would kill 134 of the carrier ’s 5,000 - man crew , injure 161 and threaten to sink the ship .
These are the moments that test men ’s mettle .
Where leaders are born .
Leaders like . . . Lt. Cmdr. Herb Hope , pilot of the A - 4 three planes down from McCain’s .
Cornered by flames at the stern of the carrier , Hope hurled himself off the flight deck into a safety net and clambered into the hangar deck below , where the fire was spreading .
According to an official Navy history of the fire , Hope then “ gallantly took command of a firefighting team ” that would help contain the conflagration and ultimately save the ship .
McCain displayed little of Hope ’s valor .
Although he would soon regale
The New York Times with tales of the heroism of the brave enlisted men who “ stayed to help the pilots fight the fire , ” McCain took no part in dousing the flames himself .
After going belowdecks and briefly helping sailors who were frantically trying to unload bombs from an elevator to the flight deck , McCain retreated to the safety of the “ ready room , ” where off - duty pilots spent their noncombat hours talking trash and playing poker .
There , McCain watched the conflagration unfold on the room ’s closed - circuit television — bearing distant witness to the valiant self - sacrifice of others who died trying to save the ship , pushing jets into the sea to keep their bombs from exploding on deck .
As the ship burned , McCain took a moment to mourn his misfortune ; his combat career appeared to be going up in smoke .
“ This distressed me considerably , ” he recalls in Faith of My Fathers .
“ I feared my ambitions were among the casualties in the calamity that had claimed the Forrestal . ”
The fire blazed late into the night .
The following morning , while oxygen - masked rescue workers toiled to recover bodies from the lower decks , McCain was making fast friends with R.W. “ Johnny ” Apple of The New York Times , who had arrived by helicopter to cover the deadliest Naval calamity since the Second World War .
The son of admiralty surviving a near - death experience certainly made for good copy , and McCain colorfully recounted how he had saved his skin .
But when Apple and other reporters left the ship , the story took an even stranger turn : McCain left with them .
As the heroic crew of the Forrestal mourned its fallen brothers and the broken ship limped toward the Philippines for repairs , McCain zipped off to Saigon for what he recalls as “ some welcome R&R . ”
VIOLATING THE CODE
Ensconced in Apple ’s villa in Saigon , McCain and the Times reporter forged a relationship that would prove critical to the ambitious pilot ’s career in the years ahead .
Apple effectively became the charter member of McCain ’s media “ base , ” an elite corps of admiring reporters who helped create his reputation for “ straight talk . ”
Sipping scotch and reflecting on the fire aboard the Forrestal , McCain sounded like the peaceniks he would pillory after his return from Hanoi .
“ Now that I ’ve seen what the bombs and napalm did to the people on our ship , ” he told Apple , “ I ’m not so sure that I want to drop any more of that stuff on North Vietnam . ”
Here , it seemed , was a frank - talking warrior , one willing to speak out against the military establishment in the name of truth .
But McCain ’s misgivings about the righteousness of the fight quickly took a back seat to his ambitions .
Within days , eager to get his combat career back on track , he put in for a transfer to the carrier USS Oriskany .
Two months after the Forrestal fire — following a holiday on the French Riviera — McCain reported for duty in the Gulf of Tonkin .
McCain performed adequately on the Oriskany .
On October 25th , 1967 , he bombed a pair of Soviet MiGs parked on an airfield outside Hanoi .
His record was now even .
Enemy planes destroyed by McCain : two .
American planes destroyed by McCain : two .
The next day , McCain embarked on his fateful 23rd mission , a bombing raid on a power plant in downtown Hanoi .
McCain had cajoled his way onto the strike force — there were medals up for grabs .
The plant had recently been rebuilt after a previous bombing run that had earned two of the lead pilots Navy Crosses , one of the force ’s top honors .
It was a dangerous mission — taking the planes into the teeth of North Vietnam ’s fiercest anti-aircraft defenses .
As the planes entered Hanoi airspace , they were instantly enveloped in dark clouds of flak and surface - to - air missiles .
Still cocky from the previous day ’s kills , McCain took the biggest gamble of his life .
As he dived in on the target in his A - 4 , his surface - to - air missile warning system sounded : A SAM had a lock on him .
“ I knew I should roll out and fly evasive maneuvers , ” McCain writes .
“ The A - 4 is a small , fast ” aircraft that “ can outmaneuver a tracking SAM . ”
But McCain did n’t “ jink . ”
Instead , he stayed on target and let fly his bombs — just as the SAM blew his wing off .
To watch the Republican National Convention and listen to Fred Thompson ’s account of John McCain ’s internment in Vietnam , you would think that McCain never gave his captors anything beyond his name , rank , service number and , under duress , the names of the Green Bay Packers offensive line .
His time in Hanoi , we ’re to understand , steeled the man — transforming him from a fighter jock who put himself first into a patriot who would henceforth selflessly serve the public good .
There is no question that McCain suffered hideously in North Vietnam .
His ejection over a lake in downtown Hanoi broke his knee and both his arms .
During his capture , he was bayoneted in the ankle and the groin , and had his shoulder smashed by a rifle butt .
His tormentors dragged McCain ’s broken body to a cell and seemed content to let him expire from his injuries .
For the next two years , there were few days that he was not in agony .
But the subsequent tale of McCain ’s mistreatment — and the transformation it is alleged to have produced — are both deeply flawed .
The Code of Conduct that governed POWs was incredibly rigid ; few soldiers lived up to its dictate that they “ give no information . . . which might be harmful to my comrades . ”
Under the code , POWs are bound to give only their name , rank , date of birth and service number — and to make no “ statements disloyal to my country . ”
Soon after McCain hit the ground in Hanoi , the code went out the window .
“ I ’ll give you military information if you will take me to the hospital , ” he later admitted pleading with his captors .
McCain now insists the offer was a bluff , designed to fool the enemy into giving him medical treatment .
In fact , his wounds were attended to only after the North Vietnamese discovered that his father was a Navy admiral .
What has never been disclosed is the manner in which they found out : McCain told them .
According to Dramesi , one of the few POWs who remained silent under years of torture , McCain tried to justify his behavior while they were still prisoners .
“ I had to tell them , ” he insisted to Dramesi , “ or I would have died in bed . ”
Dramesi says he has no desire to dishonor McCain ’s service , but he believes that celebrating the downed pilot ’s behavior as heroic — “ he was n’t exceptional one way or the other ” — has a corrosive effect on military discipline .
“ This business of my country before my life ? ” Dramesi says .
“ Well , he had that opportunity and failed miserably .
If it really were country first , John McCain would probably be walking around without one or two arms or legs — or he ’d be dead . ”
Once the Vietnamese realized they had captured the man they called the “ crown prince , ” they had every motivation to keep McCain alive .
His value as a propaganda tool and bargaining chip was far greater than any military intelligence he could provide , and McCain knew it .
“ It was hard not to see how pleased the Vietnamese were to have captured an admiral ’s son , ” he writes , “ and I knew that my father ’s identity was directly related to my survival . ”
But during the course of his medical treatment , McCain followed through on his offer of military information .
Only two weeks after his capture , the North Vietnamese press issued a report — picked up by The New York Times — in which McCain was quoted as saying that the war was “ moving to the advantage of North Vietnam and the United States appears to be isolated . ”
He also provided the name of his ship , the number of raids he had flown , his squadron number and the target of his final raid .
THE CONFESSION
In the company of his fellow POWs , and later in isolation , McCain slowly and miserably recovered from his wounds .
In June 1968 , after three months in solitary , he was offered what he calls early release .
In the official McCain narrative , this was the ultimate test of mettle .
He could have come home , but keeping faith with his fellow POWs , he chose to remain imprisoned in Hanoi .
What McCain glosses over is that accepting early release would have required him to make disloyal statements that would have violated the military ’s Code of Conduct .
If he had done so , he could have risked court - martial and an ignominious end to his military career .
“ Many of us were given this offer , ” according to Butler , McCain ’s classmate who was also taken prisoner .
“ It meant speaking out against your country and lying about your treatment to the press .
You had to ‘ admit ’ that the U.S. was criminal and that our treatment was ‘ lenient and humane . ’
So I , like numerous others , refused the offer . ”
“ He makes it sound like it was a great thing to have accomplished , ” says Dramesi .
“ A great act of discipline or strength .
That simply was not the case . ”
In fairness , it is difficult to judge McCain ’s experience as a POW ; throughout most of his incarceration he was the only witness to his mistreatment .
Parts of his memoir recounting his days in Hanoi read like a bad Ian Fleming novel , with his Vietnamese captors cast as nefarious Bond villains .
On the Fourth of July 1968 , when he rejected the offer of early release , an officer nicknamed “ Cat ” got so mad , according to McCain , that he snapped a pen he was holding , splattering ink across the room .
“ They taught you too well , Mac Kane , ” Cat snarled , kicking over a chair .
“ They taught you too well . ”
The brutal interrogations that followed produced results .
In August 1968 , over the course of four days , McCain was tortured into signing a confession that he was a “ black criminal ” and an “ air pirate . ” ”
“ John allows the media to make him out to be the hero POW , which he knows is absolutely not true , to further his political goals , ” says Butler .
“ John was just one of about 600 guys .
He was nothing unusual .
He was just another POW . ”
McCain has also allowed the media to believe that his torture lasted for the entire time he was in Hanoi .
At the Republican convention , Fred Thompson said of McCain ’s torture , “ For five and a half years this went on . ”
In fact , McCain ’s torture ended after two years , when the death of Ho Chi Minh in September 1969 caused the Vietnamese to change the way they treated POWs .
“ They decided it would be better to treat us better and keep us alive so they could trade us in for real estate , ” Butler recalls .
By that point , McCain had become the most valuable prisoner of all :
His father was now directing the war effort as commander in chief of all U.S. forces in the Pacific .
McCain spent the next three and a half years in Hanoi biding his time , trying to put on weight and regain his strength , as the bombing ordered by his father escalated .
By the time he and other POWs were freed in March 1973 as a result of the Paris Peace Accords , McCain was able to leave the prison camp in Hanoi on his own feet .
Even those in the military who celebrate McCain ’s patriotism and sacrifice question why his POW experience has been elevated as his top qualification to be commander in chief .
“ It took guts to go through that and to come out reasonably intact and able to pick up the pieces of your life and move on , ” says Wilkerson , Colin Powell ’s former chief of staff , who has known McCain since the 1980s .
“ It is unquestionably a demonstration of the character of the man .
But I do n’t think that it is a special qualification for being president of the United States .
In some respects , I ’m not sure that ’s the kind of character I want sitting in the Oval Office .
I ’m not sure that much time in a prisoner - of - war status does n’t do something to you .
Does n’t do something to you psychologically , does n’t do something to you that might make you a little more volatile , a little less apt to listen to reason , a little more inclined to be volcanic in your temperament . ”
“ A BELLICOSE HAWK ”
The reckless , womanizing hotshot who leaned on family connections for advancement before his capture in Vietnam emerged a reckless , womanizing celebrity who continued to pull strings .
The real difference between the McCain of 1967 and the McCain of 1973 was that the latter ’s ambition was now on overdrive .
He wanted to study at the National War College — but military brass turned him down as underqualified .
So McCain appealed the decision to the top : John Warner , the Secretary of the Navy and a friend of his father .
Warner , who now serves in the Senate alongside McCain , overruled the brass and gave the POW a slot .
McCain also got his wings back , even though his injuries prevented him from raising his hands above shoulder height to comb his own hair .
McCain was eager to make up for lost time — and the times were favorable to a high - profile veteran willing to speak out in favor of the war .
With the Senate moving to cut off funds for the Nixon administration ’s illegal bombing of Cambodia , the president needed all the help he could get .
Two months after his release , McCain related his harrowing story of survival in a 13 - page narrative in U.S. News & World Report , at the end of which he launched into an energetic defense of Nixon ’s discredited foreign policy .
“ I admire President Nixon ’s courage , ” he wrote .
“ It is difficult for me to understand . . . why people are still criticizing his foreign policy — for example , the bombing in Cambodia . ”
In the years to come , McCain would continue to fight the war his father had lost .
In his meetings with Nixon , Junior was known for chomping on an unlit cigar , complaining about the “ goddamn gooks ” and pushing to bomb enemy sanctuaries in Cambodia .
His son was equally gung - ho .
“ John has always been a very bellicose hawk , ” says John H. Johns , a retired brigadier general who studied with McCain at the War College .
“ When he came back from Vietnam , he accused the liberal media of undermining national will , that we could have won in Vietnam if we had the national will . ”
It was the kind of tough talk that made McCain a fast - rising star in far - right circles .
Through Ross Perot , a friend of Ronald Reagan who had championed the cause of the POWs , McCain was invited to meet with the then - governor of California and his wife .
Impressed , Reagan invited McCain to be the keynote speaker at his annual “ prayer breakfast ” in Sacramento .
Then , at the end of 1974 , McCain finally achieved the goal he had been working toward for years .
He was installed as the commanding officer of the largest air squadron in the Navy — the Replacement Air Group based in Jacksonville , Florida — training carrier pilots .
It was a post for which McCain flatly admits , “ I was not qualified . ”
By now , however , he was unembarrassed by his own nepotism .
At the ceremony commemorating his long - sought ascension to command , his father looking on with pride , McCain wept openly .
BOOZE AND PORK
If heroism is defined by physical suffering , Carol McCain is every bit her ex-husband ’s equal .
Driving alone on Christmas Eve 1969 , she skidded out on a patch of ice and crashed into a telephone pole .
She would spend six months in the hospital and undergo 23 surgeries .
The former model McCain bragged of to his buddies in the POW camp as his “ long tall Sally ” was now five inches shorter and walked with crutches .
By any standard , McCain treated her contemptibly .
Whatever his dreams of getting laid in Rio , he got plenty of ass during his command post in Jacksonville .
According to biographer Robert Timberg , McCain seduced his conquests on off - duty cross-country flights — even though adultery is a court - martial offense .
He was also rumored to be romantically involved with a number of his subordinates .
In 1977 , McCain was promoted to captain and became the Navy ’s liaison to the Senate — the same politically connected post once occupied by his father .
He took advantage of the position to buddy up to young senators like Gary Hart , William Cohen and Joe Biden .
He was also taken under the wing of another friend of his father : Sen. John Tower , the powerful Texas Republican who would become his political mentor .
Despite the promotion , McCain continued his adolescent carousing :
On a diplomatic trip to Saudi Arabia with Tower , he tried to get some tourists he disliked in trouble with the authorities by littering the room - service trays outside their door with empty bottles of alcohol .
As the Navy ’s top lobbyist , McCain was supposed to carry out the bidding of the secretary of the Navy .
But in 1978 he went off the reservation .
Vietnam was over , and the Carter administration , cutting costs , had decided against spending $ 2 billion to replace the aging carrier Midway .
The secretary agreed with the administration ’s decision .
Readiness would not be affected .
The only reason to replace the carrier — at a cost of nearly $ 7 billion in today ’s dollars — was pork - barrel politics .
Although he now crusades against wasteful military spending , McCain had no qualms about secretly lobbying for a pork project that would pay for a dozen Bridges to Nowhere .
“ He did a lot of stuff behind the back of the secretary of the Navy , ” one lobbyist told Timberg .
Working his Senate connections , McCain managed to include a replacement for the Midway in the defense authorization bill in 1978 .
Carter , standing firm , vetoed the entire spending bill to kill the carrier .
When an attempt to override the veto fell through , however , McCain and his lobbyist friends did n’t give up the fight .
The following year , Congress once again approved funding for the carrier .
This time , Carter — his pork - busting efforts undone by a turncoat Navy liaison — signed the bill .
In the spring of 1979 , while conducting official business for the Navy , the still - married McCain encountered Cindy Lou Hensley , a willowy former cheerleader for USC .
Mutually smitten , the two lied to each other about their ages .
The 24 - year - old Hensley became 27 ; the 42 - year - old McCain became 38 .
For nearly a year the two carried on a cross-country romance while McCain was still living with Carol : Court documents filed with their divorce proceeding indicate that they “ cohabitated as husband and wife ” for the first nine months of the affair .
Although McCain stresses in his memoir that he married Cindy three months after divorcing Carol , he was still legally married to his first wife when he and Cindy were issued a marriage license from the state of Arizona .
The divorce was finalized on April 2nd , 1980 .
McCain ’s second marriage — rung in at the Arizona Biltmore with Gary Hart as a groomsman — was consummated only six weeks later , on May 17th .
The union gave McCain access to great wealth : Cindy , whose father was the exclusive distributor for Budweiser in the Phoenix area , is now worth an estimated $ 100 million .
McCain ’s friends were blindsided by the divorce .
The Reagans — with whom the couple had frequently dined and even accompanied on New Year ’s holidays — never forgave him .
By the time McCain became a self - proclaimed “ foot soldier in the Reagan Revolution ” two years later , he and the Gipper had little more than ideology to bind them .
Nancy took Carol under her wing , giving her a job in the White House and treating McCain with a frosty formality that was evident even on the day last March when she endorsed his candidacy .
“ Ronnie and I always waited until everything was decided and then we endorsed , ” she said .
“ Well , obviously , this is the nominee of the party . ”
THE CARPETBAGGER
As his marriage unraveled , McCain ’s naval career was also stalling out .
He had been passed over for a promotion .
There was no sea command on the horizon , ensuring that he would never be able to join his four - star forefathers .
For good measure , he crashed his third and final plane , this one a single - engine ultralight .
McCain has never spoken of his last crash publicly , but his friend Gen.
Jim Jones recalled in a 1999 interview that it left McCain with bandages on his face and one arm in a sling .
So McCain turned to politics .
Receiving advance word that a GOP congressional seat was opening up outside Phoenix , he put the inside edge to good use .
Within minutes of the incumbent ’s official retirement announcement , Cindy McCain bought her husband the house that would serve as his foothold in the district .
In sharp contrast to the way he now markets himself , McCain ’s campaign ads billed him as an insider — a man “ who knows how Washington works . ”
Though the Reagans no longer respected him , McCain featured pictures of himself smiling with them .
“ Thanks to my prisoner - of - war experience , ” McCain writes , “ I had , as they say in politics , a good story to sell . ”
And sell it he did .
“ Listen , pal , ” he told an opponent who challenged him during a candidate forum .
“ I wish I could have had the luxury , like you , of growing up and living and spending my entire life in a nice place like the first district of Arizona , but I was doing other things .
As a matter of fact , when I think about it now , the place I lived the longest in my life was Hanoi . ”
To finance his campaign , McCain dipped into the Hensley family fortune .
He secured an endorsement from his mentor , Sen .
Tower , who tapped his vast donor network in Texas to give McCain a much - needed boost .
And he began an unethical relationship with a high - flying and corrupt financier that would come to characterize his cozy dealings with major donors and lobbyists over the years .
Charlie Keating , the banker and anti-pornography crusader , would ultimately be convicted on 73 counts of fraud and racketeering for his role in the savings - and - loan scandal of the 1980s .
That crisis , much like today ’s subprime - mortgage meltdown , resulted from misbegotten banking deregulation , and ultimately left taxpayers to pick up a tab of more than $ 124 billion .
Keating , who raised more than $ 100,000 for McCain ’s race , lavished the first - term congressman with the kind of political favors that would make Jack Abramoff blush .
McCain and his family took at least nine free trips at Keating ’s expense , and vacationed nearly every year at the mogul ’s estate in the Bahamas .
There they would spend the days yachting and snorkeling and attending extravagant parties in a world McCain referred to as “ Charlie Keating ’s Shangri - La . ”
Keating also invited Cindy McCain and her father to invest in a real estate venture for which he promised a 26 percent return on investment .
They plunked down more than $ 350,000 .
McCain still attributes the attention to nothing more than Keating ’s “ great respect for military people ” and the duo’s “ political and personal affinity . ”
But Keating , for his part , made no bones about the purpose of his giving .
When asked by reporters if the investments he made in politicians bought their loyalty and influence on his behalf , Keating replied , “ I want to say in the most forceful way I can , I certainly hope so . ”
THE KEATING FIVE
In congress , Rep. John McCain quickly positioned himself as a GOP hard - liner .
He voted against honoring Martin Luther King Jr. with a national holiday in 1983 — a stance he held through 1989 .
He backed Reagan on tax cuts for the wealthy , abortion and support for the Nicaraguan contras .
He sought to slash federal spending on social programs , and he voted twice against campaign - finance reform .
He cites as his “ biggest ” legislative victory of that era a 1989 bill that abolished catastrophic health insurance for seniors , a move he still cheers as the first - ever repeal of a federal entitlement program .
McCain voted to confirm Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court .
In 1993 , he was the keynote speaker at a fundraiser for a group that sponsored an anti-gay - rights ballot initiative in Oregon .
His anti-government fervor was renewed in the Gingrich revolution of 1994 , when he called for abolishing the departments of Education and Energy .
The following year , he championed a sweeping measure that would have imposed a blanket moratorium on any increase of government oversight .
In this context , McCain ’s recent record — opposing the new GI Bill , voting to repeal the federal minimum wage , seeking to deprive 3.8 million kids of government health care — looks entirely consistent .
“ When jackasses like Rush Limbaugh say he ’s not conservative , that ’s just total nonsense , ” says former Sen.
Gary Hart , who still counts McCain as a friend .
Although a hawkish Cold Warrior , McCain did show an independent streak when it came to the use of American military power .
Because of his experience in Vietnam , he said , he did n’t favor the deployment of U.S. forces unless there was a clear and attainable military objective .
In 1983 , McCain broke with Reagan to vote against the deployment of Marine peacekeepers to Lebanon .
The unorthodox stance caught the attention of the media — including this very magazine , which praised McCain ’s “ enormous courage . ”
It was the beginning of a beautiful friendship .
McCain recognized early on how the game was played : The Washington press corps “ tend to notice acts of political independence from unexpected quarters , ” he later noted .
“ Now I was debating Lebanon on programs like MacNeil / Lehrer NewsHour and in the pages of The New York Times and The Washington Post .
I was gratified by the attention and eager for more . ”
When McCain became a senator in 1986 , filling the seat of retiring Republican icon Barry Goldwater , he was finally in a position that a true maverick could use to battle the entrenched interests in Washington .
Instead , McCain did the bidding of his major donor , Charlie Keating , whose financial empire was on the brink of collapse .
Federal regulators were closing in on Keating , who had taken federally insured deposits from his Lincoln Savings and Loan and leveraged them to make wildly risky real estate ventures .
If regulators restricted his investments , Keating knew , it would all be over .
In the year before his Senate run , McCain had championed legislation that would have delayed new regulations of savings and loans .
Grateful , Keating contributed $ 54,000 to McCain ’s Senate campaign .
Now , when Keating tried to stack the federal regulatory bank board with cronies , McCain made a phone call seeking to push them through .
In 1987 , in an unprecedented display of political intimidation , McCain also attended two meetings convened by Keating to pressure federal regulators to back off .
The senators who participated in the effort would come to be known as the Keating Five .
“ Senate historians were unable to find any instance in U.S. history that was comparable , in terms of five U.S. senators meeting with a regulator on behalf of one institution , ” says Bill Black , then deputy director of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation , who attended the second meeting .
“ And it has n’t happened since . ”
Following the meetings with McCain and the other senators , the regulators backed off , stalling their investigation of Lincoln .
By the time the S&L collapsed two years later , taxpayers were on the hook for $ 3.4 billion , which stood as a record for the most expensive bank failure — until the current mortgage crisis .
In addition , 20,000 investors who had bought junk bonds from Keating , thinking they were federally insured , had their savings wiped out .
“ McCain saw the political pressure on the regulators , ” recalls Black .
“ He could have saved these widows from losing their life savings .
But he did absolutely nothing . ”
McCain was ultimately given a slap on the wrist by the Senate Ethics Committee , which concluded only that he had exercised “ poor judgment . ”
The committee never investigated Cindy ’s investment with Keating .
The McCains soon found themselves entangled in more legal trouble .
In 1989 , in behavior the couple has blamed in part on the stress of the Keating scandal , Cindy became addicted to Vicodin and Percocet .
She directed a doctor employed by her charity — which provided medical care to patients in developing countries — to supply the narcotics , which she then used to get high on trips to places like Bangladesh and El Salvador .
Tom Gosinski , a young Republican , kept a detailed journal while working as director of government affairs for the charity .
“ I am working for a very sad , lonely woman whose marriage of convenience to a U.S. senator has driven her to . . . cover feelings of despair with drugs , ” he wrote in 1992 .
When Cindy McCain suddenly fired Gosinski , he turned his journal over to the Drug Enforcement Administration , sparking a yearlong investigation .
To avoid jail time , Cindy agreed to a hush - hush plea bargain and court - imposed rehab .
Ironically , her drug addiction became public only because she and her husband tried to cover it up .
In an effort to silence Gosinski , who was seeking $ 250,000 for wrongful termination , the attorney for the McCains demanded that Phoenix prosecutors investigate the former employee for extortion .
The charge was baseless , and prosecutors dropped the investigation in 1994 — but not before publishing a report that included details of Cindy ’s drug use .
Notified that the report was being released , Sen. McCain leapt into action .
He dispatched his top political consultant to round up a group of friendly reporters , for whom Cindy staged a seemingly selfless , Oprah - style confession of her past addiction .
Her drug use became part of the couple ’s narrative of straight talk and bravery in the face of adversity .
“ If what I say can help just one person to face the problem , ” Cindy declared , “ it ’s worthwhile . ”
FAVORS FOR DONORS
In the aftermath of the Keating Five , McCain realized that his career was in a “ hell of a mess . ”
He had made George H.W. Bush ’s shortlist for vice president in 1988 , but the Keating scandal made him a political untouchable .
McCain needed a high horse — so his long - standing opposition to campaign - finance reform went out the window .
Working with Russ Feingold , a Democrat from Wisconsin , McCain authored a measure to ban unlimited “ soft money ” donations from politics .
The Keating affair also taught McCain a vital lesson about handling the media .
When the scandal first broke , he went ballistic on reporters who questioned his wife ’s financial ties to Keating — calling them “ liars ” and “ idiots . ”
Predictably , the press coverage was merciless .
So McCain dialed back the anger and turned up the charm .
“ I talked to the press constantly , ad infinitum , until their appetite for information from me was completely satisfied , ” he later wrote .
“ It is a public relations strategy that I have followed to this day . ” Mr. Straight Talk was born .
Unfortunately , any lessons McCain learned from the Keating scandal did n’t affect his unbridled enthusiasm for deregulating the finance industry .
“ He continues to follow policies that create the same kind of environment we see today , with recurrent financial crises and epidemics of fraud led by CEOs , ” says Black , the former S&L regulator .
Indeed , if the current financial crisis has a villain , it is Phil Gramm , who remains close to McCain .
As chair of the Senate Banking Committee in the late 1990s , Gramm ushered in — with McCain ’s fervent support — a massive wave of deregulation for insurance companies and brokerage houses and banks , the aftershocks of which are just now being felt in Wall Street ’s catastrophic collapse .
McCain , who has admitted that “ the issue of economics is not something I ’ve understood as well as I should , ” relies on Gramm to guide him .
McCain also did his part to loosen regulations on big corporations .
In 1997 , McCain became chairman of the powerful Senate Commerce Committee , which oversees the insurance and telecommunications industries , as well as the CEO pay packages of those McCain now denounces as “ fat cats . ”
The special interests with business before the committee were big and well - heeled .
All told , executives and fundraisers associated with these firms donated $ 2.6 million to McCain when he served as the chairman or ranking member .
The money bought influence .
In 1998 , employees of BellSouth contributed more than $ 16,000 to McCain .
The senator returned the favor , asking the Federal Communications Commission to give “ serious consideration ” to the company ’s request to become a long - distance carrier .
Days after legislation benefiting the satellite - TV carrier EchoStar cleared McCain ’s committee , the company ’s founder celebrated by hosting a major fundraiser for McCain ’s presidential bid .
Whatever McCain ’s romantic entanglements with the lobbyist Vicki Iseman , he was clearly in bed with her clients , who donated nearly $ 85,000 to his campaigns .
One of her clients , Bud Paxson , set up a meeting with McCain in 1999 , frustrated by the FCC ’s delay of his proposed takeover of a television station in Pittsburgh .
Paxson had treated McCain well , offering the then - presidential candidate use of his corporate jet to fly to campaign events and ponying up $ 20,000 in campaign donations .
“ You ’re the head of the commerce committee , ” Paxson told McCain , according to The Washington Post .
“ The FCC is not doing its job .
I would love for you to write a letter . ”
Iseman helped draft the text , and McCain sent the letter .
Several weeks later — the day after McCain used Paxson ’s jet to fly to Florida for a fundraiser — McCain wrote another letter .
FCC chair William Kennard sent a sharp rebuke to McCain , calling the senator ’s meddling “ highly unusual . ”
Nonetheless , within a week of McCain ’s second letter , the FCC ruled three - to - two in favor of Paxson ’s deal .
Following his failed presidential bid in 2000 , McCain needed a vehicle to keep his brand alive .
He founded the Reform Institute , which he set up as a 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) nonprofit — a tax status that barred it from explicit political activity .
McCain proceeded to staff the institute with his campaign manager , Rick Davis , as well as the fundraising chief , legal counsel and communications chief from his 2000 campaign .
There is no small irony that the Reform Institute — founded to bolster McCain ’s crusade to rid politics of unregulated soft money — itself took in huge sums of unregulated soft money from companies with interests before McCain ’s committee .
EchoStar got in on the ground floor with a donation of $ 100,000 .
A charity funded by the CEO of Univision gave another $ 100,000 .
Cablevision gave $ 200,000 to the Reform Institute in 2003 and 2004 — just as its officials were testifying before the commerce committee .
McCain urged approval of the cable company ’s proposed pricing plan .
As Bradley Smith , the former chair of the Federal Election Commission , wrote at the time : “ Appearance of corruption , anyone ? ”
“ HE IS HOTHEADED ”
Over the years , John McCain has demonstrated a streak of anger so nasty that even his former flacks make no effort to spin it away .
“ If I tried to convince you he does not have a temper , you should hang up on me and ridicule me in print , ” says Dan Schnur , who served as McCain ’s press man during the 2000 campaign .
Even McCain admits to an “ immature and unprofessional reaction to slights ” that is “ little changed from the reactions to such provocations I had as a schoolboy . ”
McCain is sensitive about his physical appearance , especially his height .
The candidate is only five - feet - nine , making him the shortest party nominee since Michael Dukakis .
On the night he was elected senator in 1986 , McCain exploded after discovering that the stage setup for his victory speech was too low ; television viewers saw his head bobbing at the bottom of the screen , his chin frequently cropped from view .
Enraged , McCain tracked down the young Republican who had set up the podium , prodding the volunteer in the chest while screaming that he was an “ incompetent little shit . ”
Jon Hinz , the director of the Arizona GOP , separated the senator from the young man , promising to get him a milk crate to stand on for his next public appearance .
During his 1992 campaign , at the end of a long day , McCain ’s wife , Cindy , mussed his receding hair and needled him playfully that he was “ getting a little thin up there . ”
McCain reportedly blew his top , cutting his wife down with the kind of language that had gotten him hauled into court as a high schooler : “ At least I do n’t plaster on the makeup like a trollop , you cunt . ”
Even though the incident was witnessed by three reporters , the McCain campaign denies it took place .
In the Senate — where , according to former GOP Sen .
Bob Smith , McCain has “ very few friends ” — his volcanic temper has repeatedly led to explosive altercations with colleagues and constituents alike .
In 1992 , McCain got into a heated exchange with Sen. Chuck Grassley over the fate of missing American servicemen in Vietnam .
“ Are you calling me stupid ? ” Grassley demanded .
“ No , I ’m calling you a fucking jerk ! ” yelled McCain .
Sen .
Bob Kerrey later told reporters that he feared McCain was “ going to head - butt Grassley and drive the cartilage in his nose into his brain . ”
The two were separated before they came to blows .
Several years later , during another debate over servicemen missing in action , an elderly mother of an MIA soldier rolled up to McCain in her wheelchair to speak to him about her son ’s case .
According to witnesses , McCain grew enraged , raising his hand as if to strike her before pushing her wheelchair away .
McCain has called Paul Weyrich , who helped steer the Republican Party to the right , a “ pompous self - serving son of a bitch ” who “ possesses the attributes of a Dickensian villain . ”
In 1999 , he told Sen . Pete Domenici , the Republican chairman of the Senate Budget Committee , that “ only an asshole would put together a budget like this . ”
Last year , after barging into a bipartisan meeting on immigration legislation and attempting to seize the reins , McCain was called out by fellow GOP Sen .
John Cornyn of Texas .
“ Wait a second here , ” Cornyn said .
“ I ’ve been sitting in here for all of these negotiations and you just parachute in here on the last day .
You ’re out of line . ”
McCain exploded : “ Fuck you !
I know more about this than anyone in the room . ”
The incident foreshadowed McCain ’s 11th - hour theatrics in September , when he abruptly “ suspended ” his campaign and inserted himself into the Wall Street bailout debate at the last minute , just as congressional leaders were attempting to finalize a bipartisan agreement .
At least three of McCain ’s GOP colleagues have gone on record to say that they consider him temperamentally unsuited to be commander in chief .
Smith , the former senator from New Hampshire , has said that McCain ’s “ temper would place this country at risk in international affairs , and the world perhaps in danger .
In my mind , it should disqualify him . ”
Sen. Domenici of New Mexico has said he does n’t “ want this guy anywhere near a trigger . ”
And Sen . Thad Cochran of Mississippi weighed in that “ the thought of his being president sends a cold chill down my spine .
He is erratic .
He is hotheaded . ”
McCain ’s frequently inappropriate humor has also led many to question his self - control .
In 1998 , the senator told a joke about President Clinton ’s teenage daughter at a GOP fundraiser .
“ Why is Chelsea Clinton so ugly ? ” McCain asked .
“ Because her father is Janet Reno ! ”
More recently , McCain ’s jokes have heightened tensions with Iran .
The senator once cautioned that “ the world ’s only superpower . . . should never make idle threats ” — but that did n’t stop him from rewriting the lyrics to a famous Beach Boys tune .
In April 2007 , when a voter at a town - hall session asked him about his policy toward Tehran , McCain responded by singing , “ bomb bomb bomb ” Iran .
The loose talk was meant to incite the GOP base , but it also aggravated relations with Iran , whose foreign minister condemned McCain ’s “ jokes about genocide ” as a testament to his “ disturbed state of mind ” and “ warmongering approach to foreign policy . ”
“ NEXT UP , BAGHDAD ! ”
The myth of John McCain hinges on two transformations — from pampered flyboy to selfless patriot , and from Keating crony to incorruptible reformer — that simply never happened .
But there is one serious conversion that has taken root in McCain : his transformation from a cautious realist on foreign policy into a reckless cheerleader of neoconservatism .
“ He ’s going to be Bush on steroids , ” says Johns , the retired brigadier general who has known McCain since their days at the National War College .
“ His hawkish views now are very dangerous .
He puts military at the top of foreign policy rather than diplomacy , just like George Bush does .
He and other neoconservatives are dedicated to converting the world to democracy and free markets , and they want to do it through the barrel of a gun . ”
McCain used to believe passionately in the limits of American military power .
In 1993 , he railed against Clinton ’s involvement in Somalia , sponsoring an amendment to cut off funds for the troops .
The following year he blasted the idealistic aims of sending U.S. troops to Haiti , taking to the Senate floor to propose an immediate withdrawal .
He even started out a fierce opponent of NATO air strikes on Serbia during the war in the Balkans .
But such concerns went out the window when McCain began gearing up to run for president .
In 1998 , he formed a political alliance with William Kristol , editor of the neoconservative Weekly Standard , who became one of his closest advisers .
Randy Scheunemann — a hard - right lobbyist who was promoting Iraqi exile Ahmad Chalabi — came aboard as McCain ’s top foreign - policy adviser .
Before long , the senator who once cautioned against “ trading American blood for Iraqi blood ” had been reborn as a fire - breathing neoconservative who believes in using American military might to spread American ideals — a belief he describes as a “ sacred duty to suffer hardship and risk danger to protect the values of our civilization and impart them to humanity . ”
By 1999 , McCain was championing what he called “ rogue state rollback . ”
First on the hit list : Iraq .
Privately , McCain brags that he was the “ original neocon . ”
And after 9/11 , he took the lead in agitating for war with Iraq , outpacing even Dick Cheney in the dissemination of bogus intelligence about the threat posed by Saddam Hussein .
“ There ’s other organizations besides Mr. bin Laden who are bent on the destruction of the United States , ” he warned in an appearance on Hardball on September 12th .
“ It is n’t just Afghanistan .
We ’re talking about Syria , Iraq , Iran , perhaps North Korea , Libya and others . ”
A few days later , he told Jay Leno ’s audience that “ some other countries ” — possibly Iraq , Iran and Syria — had aided bin Laden .
A month after 9/11 , with the U.S. bombing Kabul and reeling from the anthrax scare , McCain assured David Letterman that “ we ’ll do fine ” in Afghanistan .
He then added , unbidden , “ The second phase is Iraq .
Some of this anthrax may — and I emphasize may — have come from Iraq . ”
Later that month on Larry King , McCain raised the specter of Saddam ’s weapons of mass destruction before he peddled what became Dick Cheney ’s favorite lie :
“ The Czech government has revealed meetings , contacts between Iraqi intelligence and Mohamed Atta .
The evidence is very clear .
. . .
So we will have to act . ”
On Nightline , he again flogged the Czech story and cited Iraqi defectors to claim that “ there is no doubt as to [ Saddam ’s ] avid pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them .
That , coupled with his relations with terrorist organizations , I think , is a case that the administration will be making as we move step by step down this road . ”
That December , just as U.S. forces were bearing down on Osama bin Laden in Tora Bora , McCain joined with five senators in an open letter to the White House .
“ In the interest of our own national security , Saddam Hussein must be removed from power , ” they insisted , claiming that there was “ no doubt ” that Hussein intended to use weapons of mass destruction “ against the United States and its allies . ”
In January 2002 , McCain made a fact - finding mission to the Middle East .
While he was there , he dropped by a supercarrier stationed in the Arabian Sea that was dear to his heart : the USS Theodore Roosevelt , the giant floating pork project that he had driven through over President Carter ’s veto .
On board the carrier , McCain called Iraq a “ clear and present danger to the security of the United States of America . ”
Standing on the flight bridge , he watched as fighter planes roared off , en route to Afghanistan — where Osama bin Laden had already slipped away .
“ Next up , Baghdad ! ” McCain whooped .
Over the next 15 months leading up to the invasion , McCain continued to lead the rush to war .
In November 2002 , Scheunemann set up a group called the Committee for the Liberation of Iraq at the same address as Chalabi ’s Iraqi National Congress .
The groups worked in such close concert that at one point they got their Websites crossed .
The CLI was established with explicit White House backing to sell the public on the war .
The honorary co-chair of the committee : John Sidney McCain III .
In September 2002 , McCain assured Americans that the war would be “ fairly easy ” with an “ overwhelming victory in a very short period of time . ”
On the eve of the invasion , Hardball host Chris Matthews asked McCain , “ Are you one of those who holds up an optimistic view of the postwar scene ?
Do you believe that the people of Iraq , or at least a large number of them , will treat us as liberators ? ”
McCain was emphatic : “ Absolutely .
Absolutely . ”
Today , however , McCain insists that he predicted a protracted struggle from the outset .
“ The American people were led to believe this could be some kind of day at the beach , ” he said in August 2006 , “ which many of us fully understood from the beginning would be a very , very difficult undertaking . ”
McCain also claims he urged Bush to dump Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld .
“ I ’m the only one that said that Rumsfeld had to go , ” he said in a January primary debate .
Except that he did n’t .
Not once .
As late as May 2004 , in fact , McCain praised Rumsfeld for doing “ a fine job . ”
Indeed , McCain ’s neocon makeover is so extreme that Republican generals like Colin Powell and Brent Scowcroft have refused to endorse their party ’s nominee .
“ The fact of the matter is his judgment about what to do in Iraq was wrong , ” says Richard Clarke , who served as Bush ’s counterterrorism czar until 2003 .
“ He hung out with people like Ahmad Chalabi .
He said Iraq was going to be easy , and he said we were going to war because of terrorism .
We should have been fighting in Afghanistan with more troops to go after Al Qaeda .
Instead we ’re at risk because of the mistaken judgment of people like John McCain . ”
MR. FLIP -FLOP
In the end , the essential facts of John McCain ’s life and career — the pivotal experiences in which he demonstrated his true character — are important because of what they tell us about how he would govern as president .
Far from the portrayal he presents of himself as an unflinching maverick with a consistent and reliable record , McCain has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to taking whatever position will advance his own career .
He “ is the classic opportunist , ” according to Ross Perot , who worked closely with McCain on POW issues .
“ He ’s always reaching for attention and glory . ”
McCain has worked hard to deny such charges .
“ They ’re drinking the Kool - Aid that somehow I have changed positions on the issues , ” he said of his critics at the end of August .
The following month , when challenged on The View , McCain again defied those who accuse him of flip - flopping .
“ What specific area have I quote ‘ changed ’ ? ” he demanded .
“ Nobody can name it . ”
In fact , his own statements show that he has been on both sides of a host of vital issues : the Bush tax cuts , the estate tax , waterboarding , hunting down terrorists in Pakistan , kicking Russia out of the G - 8 , a surge of troops into Afghanistan , the GI Bill , storing nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain , teaching intelligent design , fully funding No Child Left Behind , offshore drilling , his own immigration policy and withdrawal timelines for Iraq .
In March , McCain insisted to The Wall Street Journal that he is “ always for less regulation . ”
In September , with the government forced to bail out the nation ’s largest insurance companies and brokerage houses , McCain declared that he would regulate the financial industry and end the “ casino culture on Wall Street . ”
He did a similar about - face on Bush ’s tax cuts , opposing them when he planned to run against Bush in 2001 , then declaring that he wants to make them larger — and permanent — when he needed to win the support of anti-tax conservatives this year .
“ It ’s a big flip - flop , ” conceded tax abolitionist Grover Norquist .
“ But I ’m happy he ’s flopped . ”
In June of this year , McCain reversed his decades - long opposition to coastal drilling — shortly before cashing $ 28,500 from 13 donors linked to Hess Oil .
And the senator , who only a decade ago tried to ban registered lobbyists from working on political campaigns , now deploys 170 lobbyists in key positions as fundraisers and advisers .
Then there ’s torture — the issue most related to McCain ’s own experience as a POW .
In 2005 , in a highly public fight , McCain battled the president to stop the torture of enemy combatants , winning a victory to require military personnel to abide by the Army Field Manual when interrogating prisoners .
But barely a year later , as he prepared to launch his presidential campaign , McCain cut a deal with the White House that allows the Bush administration to imprison detainees indefinitely and to flout the Geneva Conventions ’ prohibitions against torture .
What his former allies in the anti-torture fight found most troubling was that McCain would not admit to his betrayal .
Shortly after cutting the deal , McCain spoke to a group of retired military brass who had been working to ban torture .
According to Wilkerson , Colin Powell ’s former deputy , McCain feigned outrage at Bush and Cheney , as though he too had had the rug pulled out from under him .
“ We all knew the opposite was the truth , ” recalls Wilkerson .
“ That ’s when I began to lose a little bit of my respect for the man and his bona fides as a straight shooter . ”
But perhaps the most revealing of McCain ’s flip - flops was his promise , made at the beginning of the year , that he would “ raise the level of political dialogue in America . ”
McCain pledged he would “ treat my opponents with respect and demand that they treat me with respect . ”
Instead , with Rove protégé Steve Schmidt at the helm , McCain has turned the campaign into a torrent of debasing negativity , misrepresenting Barack Obama ’s positions on everything from sex education for kindergarteners to middle - class taxes .
In September , in one of his most blatant embraces of Rove - like tactics , McCain hired Tucker Eskew — one of Rove ’s campaign operatives who smeared the senator and his family during the 2000 campaign in South Carolina .
Throughout the campaign this year , McCain has tried to make the contest about honor and character .
His own writing gives us the standard by which he should be judged .
“ Always telling the truth in a political campaign , ” he writes in Worth the Fighting For , “ is a great test of character . ”
He adds : “ Patriotism that only serves and never risks one ’s self - interest is n’t patriotism at all .
It ’s selfishness .
That ’s a lesson worth relearning from time to time . ”
It ’s a lesson , it would appear , that the candidate himself could stand to relearn .
“ I ’m sure John McCain loves his country , ” says Richard Clarke , the former counterterrorism czar under Bush .
“ But loving your country and lying to the American people are apparently not inconsistent in his view . ”

The Obama campaign made a big effort this week to encourage debate - and - vote parties like the one at Ms. Marshall ’s home here in Larimer County , another pivotal county with a lot of mail - balloting .

Mail - in voting has put down its deepest roots in Oregon , Washington and California , but election experts say the significance of Colorado ’s mail - in voting this year has been amplified because the state is one of the few tossups left on the electoral map .
Previously , voting by mail in Colorado has been most common in rural areas , where distances make a trip to the polls problematic and Republican voters usually dominate .
But the clerk and recorder for Weld County , Steve Moreno , said the Obama campaign , in particular , had embraced the idea of voting - by - mail this year and met with him about how to expand the numbers .
Ms. Marshall , the debate - and - vote party hostess , said she was voting by mail for the first time partly because the Obama campaign , for which she has volunteered , had pushed it hard as a tool to increase turnout .
“ I have the time to go wait in line at the polling place , but the person behind me in line maybe doesn’t , ” said Ms. Marshall , a graduate student in ecology at Colorado State University .
“ They might have only half an hour to wait on line at lunch break , and if they ca n’t get through the line , they may not vote . ”
Statewide , officials said , there are broader reasons for the spike in mail - in voting , a subset of so - called early voting , which also includes voting in advance at polling places .
The reasons range from anxiety over the state ’s voting machines after a scare involving their technical reliability this year , to a state ballot with more issues and referenda on it than any in 96 years .
County clerks also pushed the shift with advertising and mailings , hoping to avoid the long lines that plagued polling places in 2004 and 2006 .
“ I like the fact that you can sit down and think about it , ” said Jim Richardson , a 56 - year - old retired school teacher and coach who lives in Greeley , about 40 minutes from Fort Collins , in Weld County .

It evokes images of the vintage days of aviation , when flying around the world was a luxury few could afford .
But propeller - driven aircraft , inspired by the iconic Spirit of St Louis , could make a return thanks to innovative fuel - saving designs .
The Guardian has learned that Rolls - Royce recently cleared a major hurdle in testing its new design for a propeller - driven engine , involving a double rotor and new blade shape .
Engineers have called Rolls - Royce 's design a " tremendously significant " step forward .
The company claims the design could cut an airline 's fuel bills and greenhouse gas emissions by 30 % .
" We 're talking about saving $ 3 m or 10,000 tonnes of CO2 per year per aircraft if you introduce an open - rotor on to a 100 - 200 - seater aircraft , " said Mark Taylor , an engineer at Rolls - Royce who is leading a project to design the next generation of aircraft engines .
Modern propeller - driven engines , also known as advanced open rotors or turboprops , are acknowledged to be more fuel efficient than the turbofan and turbojet engines used by most aircraft today .
But , despite much research and testing by all the major engine manufaturers in the early 1980s , they never caught on , partly because they are far noisier .
But with the growth in aviation causing major environmental concerns , aeronautical engineers believe that the open - rotor engine could have a new lease of life .
" We believe that , based on our test , we can produce a quiet and efficient open - rotor engine , " said Taylor .
The company believes its design would be quieter than any aircraft in operation today .
Rod Self , an acoustic engineer who works on aircraft engines at Southampton University said Rolls - Royce 's latest work was " tremendously significant — they are a significant player in this market .
On the noise front , they 've got the best models going and … a lead on others in the field . "
Efficiency improvements are sorely needed , said Alice Bows , a climate scientist at the University of Manchester 's Tyndall Centre who specialises in aviation 's environmental impact , said : " The amount of CO2 from aviation looks to be 2 - 3 % , a relatively small proportion of the world 's total .
But you 've got annual growth of 6 - 7 % in terms of passenger kilometres with efficiency improvement only at around 1 % . "
Turbofan engines work by sucking in air with a enclosed fan at the front of the engine .
Most of this air is pushed out of the back to produce the thrust needed , with the rest used to burn fuel to drive the fan .
The more air that is pushed out rather than burned , known as the bypass ratio , the more efficient the engine is .
Put simply , open - rotor engines have a higher bypass ratio than turbofans or turbojets for an equivalent - sized device .
Another reason for the higher efficiency of open - rotor engines is that , unlike traditional engines , they do not have a casing around the propeller .
The casing increases weight and drag .
" Because you 've removed the [ casing ] , you 're able to go to much bigger fan diameters and not incur the weight and drag penalties , " said Taylor .
The airline industry has been here before .
The oil crisis in the late 1970s encouraged engineers to design engines inspired by the old propeller - aircraft of the first half of the 20th century but incorporating the jet technology used in the more modern aircraft engines .
American engine manufacturers Pratt & Whitney and General Electric , both funded by Nasa , flew open - rotor designs for several hundred hours on McDonnell Douglas and Boeing aircraft .
But two factors prevented open rotors from being used commercially — noise and propeller designs .
In addition , the drop in the price of oil meant there was no great incentive to save fuel .
But the rise in the price of oil over the past year coupled with environmental concerns mean that efficient engine designs once again look attractive .
Rolls - Royce 's design uses two sets of propellers near the rear of the engine , which rotate in opposite directions .
This reduces the energy wasted when propellers twist some of the air , rather than pushing it all straight backwards .
" If you have a second set spinning in the opposite direction , you untwist it and recover the energy from that air .
That goes into useful force to drive the aircraft forward , " said Self .
" But it 's even more noisy . "
The sources of noise in an open - rotor engine come from different aspects of the propeller , such as their thickness and whether the tips spin faster than the speed of sound .
Rolls Royce 's engineers specifically tackled these problems by increasing the number of blades on the rotors , changing their shape from the traditional elongated to a more squat design and making the blades thinner .
The result was , claims Rolls - Royce , a set of rotors that can turn at a slower speed — and hence make less noise — while maintaining a high efficiency .
The British - based company is not the only one investigating the open - rotor concept .
General Electric , Pratt & Whitney and French company Snecma all have open - rotor prototypes under construction , though commercial secrecy means their progress is unclear .
Taylor said there was a choice for airlines .
" You could go for a low - noise advanced turbofan or you could trade that for some noise and go for a much more efficient engine and that is the question we 're asking the aviation industry .
What would you rather have — a bit better noise profile or better fuel burn and lower CO2 ? "

Me : “ Oh , that .

Having watched John McCain and Barack Obama resolutely pledge their allegiance  and their countrymen ’s lives and treasure  to the defense of Israel via AIPAC , the media , and personal meetings with Israeli leaders , it is worth asking what could possibly drive these men to so ardently commit America to participation in other people ’s religious wars .
This question is particularly important today as the Bush administration and the Israel - firsters continue to push for an unprovoked U.S. attack on Iran .
Let me say that I harbor no resentment over the actions of Israel ’s leaders .
For more than 60 years , they have knowingly made their country a pariah in the Arab and Islamic worlds , just as the Palestinians have made themselves pariahs in much of the West .
This is , of course , the right of both parties , but neither seems to want to face the consequences of their decisions .
With demographic realities and increasingly radical , well - armed Arabs making them panicky about Israel ’s security , Israel ’s leaders naturally to try to lock down as much U.S. support as possible .
Having consciously  if unwisely  put all their eggs in the U.S. basket since the 1973 War , Israel ’s leaders must do everything possible to protect their relationship with Washington .
The U.S. invasion of Iraq , it seems , was not enough for the Israel - firsters .
Now , according to Sen. Joseph Lieberman , a U.S. - launched war on Iran is needed because " the threat that the U.S. and Israel face from the Islamic Republic of Iran is today greater than ever . "
Though based on the fantasy that Ahmedinejad ’s tin - pot regime is a threat to the world ’s only superpower , this is a perfectly commonsense position for Israel and its U.S. - citizen backers in AIPAC to champion .
In their view , U.S. wars with Muslims are the ultimate good for Israel .
Recall , if you will , the perfectly accurate April 2008 , words of Benjamin Netanyahu , likely Israel ’s next prime minister : " We [ Israel ] are benefiting from one thing , and that is the attack on the twin towers and the Pentagon , and the American struggle in Iraq . "
These wars , Netanyahu said , have " swung American public opinion in our favor . "
How much more must Netanyahu and AIPAC believe that a U.S. war with Iran would add to this " swing " in Israel ’s favor ?
My own anger falls not on Israel , then , or on Palestine , for that matter ; as I have written elsewhere , America would do just fine and would be better off without either or both .
It falls rather on the lobbying efforts of AIPAC , that organization ’s blatant purchasing of fealty from U.S. politicians in both parties , and the media ’s obsequious parroting of specious canards about " Israel ’s right to exist " and " the duty of Americans to support an island of democracy in the Middle East . "
While few would question the right of AIPAC leaders to lobby U.S. politicians , legally bribe them with campaign contributions , or limit their right to speak as they please in public , not matter how scurrilous or libelous their words , I sometimes wonder if Americans have focused on what AIPAC lobbies for and what its acolytes in politics and the media support .
It is a commonplace to say that lobbying is a pervasive activity in U.S. politics at all levels of government , especially at the federal level .
People lobby for tax advantages for business or tax breaks for individuals ; for the right to own guns or laws to ban them ; for subsidies for agriculture or vouchers for private schools ; for universal health care or smaller government .
Across this diverse array of lobbyists there are two common threads : ( A ) None are working to push the United States to participate in other peoples ’ wars ; and ( B ) All are arguing for things that will  from their perspective  improve America , whether by making it richer , better protected , more competently educated , healthier , freer , etc .
The anti-gun lobby , for example , is no less confident than the NRA and its affiliates that they are working for the best interests of Americans .
One or the other is wrong , but their activities are shaped by their perception of what is best for America .
It is this last point that separates the lobbyists working for and with AIPAC  most of whom are U.S. citizens  from almost all other U.S. - based lobbyists .
AIPAC does not lobby , bribe , and libel to make Americans and America better off .
It lobbies solely , forthrightly , and cynically to make Israel richer , better protected , and able to do as it pleases in its relations with Muslim states .
AIPAC makes no pretense of doing things meant to benefit America ; rather , its members take pride in seeking a goal that runs directly counter to the economic welfare and physical security of almost all other U.S citizens by seeking to keep them involved in a religious war in which no U.S. national interest is at stake .
Now , there are a few other similar anti-American lobbies  those for Armenia , Lebanon , Greece , etc.  but AIPAC is clearly primus inter pares in this dastardly group .
And given that every AIPAC success is a net loss for U.S. security and the U.S.
Treasury , it seems odd that our so - called political leaders take orders and funds from this fundamentally anti-U.S. organization .
Odd or not , however , that is the reality .
Senators Obama and McCain have become AIPAC poster boys , each strengthening his support for Israel over the course of the current presidential campaign .
Obama ’s position , in fact , has changed so drastically in a pro-Israel direction that the Illinois senator appears to have no mind of his own on this issue .
He has simply and obsequiously adopted the Democrats ’ traditional abject subservience to their small but powerful pro-Israel constituency .
McCain is an Israel - firster of the deepest hue .
Coached by Joe Lieberman  who argues there is a U.S. duty to ensure God ’s promise to Abraham about Israel is kept  McCain is now considering Republican Congressman Eric Cantor for his running mate .
Rep. Cantor , needless to say , is eager to spend American blood and treasure to secure Israel .
Speaking in Israel , Cantor pushed the same false assertion that is the staple of U.S. leaders in both parties .
" What befalls Jerusalem , " Cantor said , " threatens the security of the United States and its allies worldwide .
That ’s because Jerusalem and Israel are Ground Zero in the global battle between tyranny and democracy , radicalism and moderation , terrorism and freedom . "
This , of course , is nonsense of a high order , and Lieberman and Cantor know it .
Both men are committed to Israel as a religious idea , not because it has anything to do with U.S. security .
According to Lieberman , " The rabbis say in the Talmud that a lot of rabbinic law is to put a fence around the Torah so you do n’t get near to violating it .
Well , McCain has a series of very clear - headed policies toward terrorism and Islamic extremism [ that put ] extra layers behind his support for Israel . "
He also told a conference of Christians United for Israel that he was pleased they recognized it was America ’s duty to defend Israel , blithely lying to them that " President Washington and the Founding Fathers " would support America fighting Israel ’s wars .
Cantor , playing to both the Israel - firsters and their U.S. evangelical allies , also has made clear where his primary loyalty lies :
" Jerusalem is not merely the capital of Israel but the spiritual capital of Jews and Christians everywhere .
It ’s the site of the First and Second Temples , which housed the Holy of Holies , and it ’s the direction in which we Jews face when we pray .
This glorious City of David is bound to the Jewish people by an undeniable 3,000 - year historical link . "
My own view is that if God promised Palestine to the Israelis , God is perfectly capable of keeping that promise , and America is no way committed to expend the lives of its soldier - children in a war over conflicting interpretations of God ’s word .
The Israelis and the Muslims should be perfectly free to fight over whether Yahweh and Abraham or Allah and Mohammed are right , and Americans should be perfectly free to draw the correct conclusion , that the United States does not have a dog in this fight .
In addition , there is a genuine constitutional question of church - state separation on this issue .
Why should American taxpayers have their earnings and children ’s lives spent to defend a theocracy in Israel or , for that matter , to protect an Islamic theocracy in Saudi Arabia .?
( Imagine the howls of protest and torrents of church - state separation rhetoric from the media and both parties if a congressman introduced a bill calling for the U.S. to designate that an amount equivalent to what ’s spent to protect Israel and Saudi Arabia be sent to the Vatican  a nation - state like Israel and Saudi Arabia  to improve its defenses against the now well - articulated threat from al - Qaeda and other Islamists . )
Objectively , three realities are clear : ( 1 ) U.S. survival is not at stake in the Israeli - Muslim war ; ( 2 ) the taxes of Americans should not be spent to defend theocratic states ; and ( 3 ) holy books are insane tools to use as guides for U.S. foreign policy .
In America , however , these realities lie unspoken because of the lobbying efforts of AIPAC and the pro-Israel mantras of the politicians it purchases with campaign contributions and promises of media exposure , including McCain and Obama .
By their consistent anti-American actions , AIPAC and the U.S. politicians who do its bidding have fully validated the words of the real George Washington  not the figment of Washington painted by Joe Lieberman .
" Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence , " President Washington wrote in 1796 , " the jealousy of a free people ought to be constantly awake , since history and experience prove that foreign influence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government . "
1. I am here with John Lam of the IronRuby Team of the Microsoft .
We are going to talk a little bit about IronRuby and both why is it important in the .NET and Ruby space .
Let us start with the .NET space .
True .
I think that Ruby as a language has been interesting for a lot of people for quite some time and , if you look at why Ruby , the language is interesting .
To me there has always been this idea that it spends a generation gap of programmers , that the kids coming out of school now , you know the " I am going to take over the world " crowd , those guys are very excited about the Ruby .
If you walk around , is kind of like the Rails scout for the average age is under 20 , mid 20s butter folks , and they are very excited and very interested in the language .
But what is also very interesting is that not just the young kids are interested into this thing , but guys being around the block for a while are also very interested into this language - and I 'd like to use the example that I always use in my slide deck :
Dave Patterson was one of the guys who invented a lot of things , being the one who invented random risk , and he is a professor at the Berkley and is a huge fan of Ruby .
In fact not only does he teach Ruby and Rails as a classical , but he is also using it to build data center operating systems , which is his area of research today .
So it is interesting to see guys that have been around the block , as well as the kids that are fresh out of school , both being attracted to the qualities of the language .
To take the ideas that make Ruby an attractive language and turn around and bring them to the .NET , as well as the Java programmers of the world , is also something that is very interesting .
So there is ongoing work to make that happen .
JRuby is a on the Java side out of the house , and also on our side of the house we have the IronRuby project , which is run by Microsoft .
There is a lot of ideas that , I think , are interesting for the dynamics and development of a bunch of scenarios .
Ruby is a dynamic language , so as a dynamic language is very different from the language that they are used to program in - C# , VB .
Those languages give you additional expressive power , which can be used in certain scenarios , which I think are very appealing , potentially .
One of them is the testing on the side of the house .
So more and more , in 2008 , unit testing is not this wacky crazy thing that it used to be at one point in time .
Most people are using this and most people are running the tests .
Using a dynamic language to test your statically typed libraries that you are building in C # or VB today , turns out to be a very useful thing and , if you look at some of the advances in testing that have happened in the Ruby world , there is actually some very interesting work that has been done there .
Perhaps a leading candidate for mentioning is RSpec .
In RSpec , the way a unit tests are written read very naturally , is a very fluent interface , you read your tests from left to right , " 1+1.shouldEqual ( 2 ) " , is the way you write that test , not " assert true 2 , 1+1 " , which is the way you write it in C# , and that plus this soft documenting feature - the fact that the code reads very nice ends up being an excellent place to start entering into the .NET world , or the Ruby world as a .NET programmer .
Ruby makes it trivial for you to do marking as well , inside of the interfaces , so that is another place where you could potentially use Ruby to mark out some of your .NET objects as well that you might want to use in tests .
Using Ruby as a marking framer is very simple because all classes and all objects are open to modification all the time .
So for example , I can construct an object whose only role in life is to record all method calls to it and all the parameters , and do various assertions about it .
To build a mock in Ruby is so simple , it is almost trivial , it is 5 - 10 lines of code to build a mock framework .
A real contrast to the kind of effort you have to do in .NET , there you have to do some more things , so I think that winds up being a really interesting place for at least .NET programmers to get started inside of Ruby .
Now , another angle that is interesting is this idea of the so called " polyglot programmer " and the fact that the software stack of the future or today - depending on how progressive you happen to be - is one where you have some statically typed stuff at the bottom layer , you have some dynamically typed stuff as the middle layer , and you have this top level layer of this thing called the domain specific language , or the DSL .
On the DSL piecewall , most likely being implemented in terms of the dynamic language layer , and the dynamic language layer is probably implemented in terms of the statically typed layer , in a world like that you allow people to do this DSL stuff at a high level .
Like the RSpec example that I gave you earlier , it is an example of a domain specific language we are testing .
There are some other cases , such as some of the build systems that are out there as well , so if you take a look at the build system today like ANT or MSBuild , they are all built on top of the XML , right in this way that we describe what a built thing looks like .
But these things are not really programs , when you get down to it , there are things that you have to break lower chunks of stuff that interact with your source control system or maybe do some float control , or some conditionals or some exception handling .
In a world like that it is very challenging to do the content switching , because you are writing stuff in XML and your tasks are written in C # or VB or Java or whatever your language is that these things are building on top of .
In addition , you have to put a high level logic right inside of XML which is horrible .
I think the really interesting thing about using a language like Ruby , which has got a DSL for doing build things called Rake , and Rake is very good at describing declaratively or in a fashion that feels declaratively at least the relationships between different targets , or they call them tasks , but these things are really targets and mostly they build systems .
You always program in Ruby , you never context switch out into some other language like a C # or VB in order to do something , you always stay in Ruby and that makes it very useful .
So thinking the testing angle and the build deployment angle , there are some very interesting places where you can do some Ruby programming to make your life simple , even if your core application that you are building continues to be built using whatever you are using today - C# , VB and other things .
At least , what that is going to do is , that is going to give you some exposure to the ways in which you can think about problems in these domain specific languages , as well as in dynamic languages .
2 . I am sure it has been quite challenging to try to bring these ideas to .NET developers .
What have the reactions been so far ?
Depends on who you ask , lot of things : there are folks that have already solved the " preaching to the choir " thing .
Certainly at this event here at ALT .
NET , it really is preaching to the choir here .
Other folks are skeptical and they are skeptical for perfectly valid reasons .
About a month ago , I gave similar set of talks over to some folks in MSR , in our programming language and theory group .
There is a bunch of PhD guys who think that C# is way too weakly typed for their purposes and needs and they want much more statically strongly typed systems and they want to be able to prove things , they want to be able to prove correctness and those are absolutely lofty goals and admirable goals to have , and it is very difficult to reconcile the two world views , one which is " software is crappy and sloppy " and kind of all thrown together , but the reality is that shipping software trumps all else , even if it is shipping software that does n't necessarily work in all cases , but it works in the cases you tend to care about a lot .
There is definitely value to shipping , even at the expense of correctness in certain problem domains , and with the idea that down the road you can fix all those things .
Certainly , if you take a look at start - up companies today , shipping is everything for those guys - they are heavily constrained resource wise and time wise , and they have to ship stuff as quickly as possible and they have almost all universally gravitated towards using dynamic languages as their way to build locations for the web tool stuff and the things that people are building today .
So I think that in trying to deal with the nay - sayers , there are different tools for different jobs and there are cases where you need that absolute correctness and that preciseness that you only get from a statically typed language .
Maybe with some other theory improvers and their analysis tools that they have - and there are some very critical security tools or code or some of the base class libraries - it depends very heavily on having these things being provably correct .
I see value in that , because most people are consuming that stuff and their job is to try and get applications being built quickly and inexpensively and deployed .
Dynamic languages fill a very good role there as well .
3 . I am sure that , generally , Ruby side of things has been much friendlier and reacting towards you .
You would be surprised by that , because I would n't say that people in Ruby community are hostile towards our efforts : I think it is worse than that .
Cathy Sear , who was an awesome blogger back in the days when she was blogging before she went chased off the Internet , had this wonderful document where there was this diagram where she described " Where you do n't want to be " .
On one end , there was " People love you " and on the other there was " People hate you " and in the middle there was this vast thing that she called " The zone of mediocrity " .
When you are in the zone of mediocrity , or when people are indifferent to you , it is really bad .
You really want people rather hate or love you , because , at least , when they hate you they care enough to hate you , but when they are indifferent , they think " It does n't affect my life " .
That describes a reasonable chunk of the Ruby community , and by this community I would rather narrow it down to somewhat - say - the Rails community , because in their world they build Rails applications almost universally on Macs , if you go to Rails conf you find one or two crazy people that have Windows laptops , they are probably from Microsoft , and everybody else is just carrying a Mac .
They build on Mac , they deploy on Linux , that is the MO for building these kinds of applications and , because of that , we are just basically irrelevant to them , they are saying " It does n't really impact my life one way or another " .
What we want to do is that we want to try and change all their perception and show them we can add some value even to their world .
So you as a Rails programmer building your stuff on a Mac , deploy on Linux , you stole an opportunity to use some part of our stack because of Silverlight .
Silverlight is a very interesting opportunity for folks on Rails who might want to be able to use Ruby on both ends of the wire , because today IronRuby is the only implementation with a good deployment story into the browser .
Now this good deployment story is predicating some of the things happening , like wide - spread adoption of Silverlight 2 and I think that this is going to happen , some of the things are going to happen in the summer , and also the efforts of the rest of the company is trying to expend .
If we assume that Silverlight 2 is widely deployed , then you have this opportunity to run Ruby in the browser and for Rails applications that could involve doing interesting work , like having your views being in the browser , as your controllers being in the browser as well , and I think that , if there is a minimal amount of impact to the rest of your application logic and Rails application , this sounds a very compelling scenario for these guys , because now you are not dealing contact switching in the JS and other things , but , instead , you are doing Ruby programming and have to reach into different browsers and I think that scenario is something that they simply can do today .
4 . Could you go more into the scalability themes you can reach from there ?
Scalability is an interesting term , because it is overloaded to the N - th degree .
I think what is interesting to the scalability angle is the idea that , if you initially built an application as a more traditional web app , that there is not so much AJAX and Rails allows you do that kind of stuff .
If you discover all of a sudden that for whatever reason that does n't scale particularly free well your needs , you now need to AJAXify the application , you need to add a lot of stuff , you are now in full world of hurt , because all of a sudden you are doing all sorts of stuff to add a JavaScript to your application and , as well , it is modifying the way your application behaves .
So it is not just a simple " I am going to switch a little bit a configuration and have the things running magically on the client " , it is the " I know I got to rewrite big chunks of my application logic , which I already wrote to run on the server , so now I have to turn around and run on the client " .
It is unclear to me whether or not many applications today start off as being serviceable only one way with no job description on the part of the client , it seems that a lot of folks are probably starting out with that as a default assumption .
But for the folks that are in that first case , it buys them a very interesting avenue to hopefully make that migration to having larger chunks of a code run on the client , just much more straightforward because they are still on Ruby , and it is just literally a matter of hopefully making just some small changes toward the controllers without having a rewrite , which is what they are effectively having to do today .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A new national poll suggests that only a quarter of Americans think things are going well in the country today , while the rest of those questioned are angry , scared and stressed out .
Two - thirds of those questioned say they 're scared about the way things are going in the U.S .
Seventy - five percent of those surveyed in a CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll released Tuesday said things are going badly in the United States .
An equal portion of those polled said they are angry about the way things are going .
Two - thirds of those questioned said they 're scared about the way things are going and three in four said the current conditions in the country are stressing them out .
" It 's scary how many Americans admit they are scared , " said Keating Holland , CNN 's polling director .
" Americans tend to downplay the amount of fear they have when facing tough times .
The fact that more than six in 10 say that they are scared shows how bad things are getting . "
The 25 percent who said things are going well in the country is another indicator of the negative mood among Americans .
" Prior to 2008 , we have seen that level of dissatisfaction only three times in the past four decades -- during Watergate , the Iranian hostage crisis and the recession of 1992 , " Holland added .
The survey also suggests that most Americans are not happy with President Bush .
Seventy - two percent of those questioned disapprove of the president 's handling of his job .
Watch what Bush has to say about the economy »
The war in Iraq also continues to be unpopular with Americans , with 32 percent of those questioned favoring the war .
The CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll was conducted Friday through Sunday , with 1,058 adult Americans questioned by telephone .
The survey 's sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points .

Parisians and their Vélib bikes .
Photo by stttijn .
As any of my friends will confirm , I ’m pretty much obsessed with Vélib , the public bike - sharing system here in Paris that makes it super - convenient to zip around the city on two wheels .
It also gets my geek on : Vélib is a complex system that neatly tucks away its complexity behind a simple interface and some clever behavioral incentives .
Here ’s how Vélib works :
There are over 20,000 bikes distributed among 1,500 stations throughout the city .
Pick up a bike from one station , return it to another .
You purchase a daily , weekly or annual subscription , which allows you to ride the bike as much as you like in 30 - minute chunks .
The bikes are n’t for leisure rentals ; they ’re intended to be used for quick , direct one - way trips of 30 minutes .
You have to pay for longer trips , and overage fees add up quickly .
As you might expect , these one - way trips are not evenly distributed throughout the city at certain hours .
Bikes tend to clump in some areas and empty out in others .
To address this , workers circulate in trucks , moving the bikes from full stations to empty ones .
It turns out that this is an uphill battle .
Literally .
See , Paris has a handful of steep hills .
The Montmartre neighborhood , for example , is perched at the top of a rise some 450 feet above the Seine .
Taking a bike down the hill has a certain obvious appeal , but riding back up to the top … not so much .
The uphill penalty is financial as well as physical .
The hills are at the outer edges of the city , so the extra time to get up a hill for trips from the city center can easily nudge you over the 30 - minute free period .
It can cost money to ride a Vélib bike up the hill .
The result :
In Vélib ’s first year of service , bike stations in Montmartre were always empty .
The brute - force method of moving bikes by truck could n’t keep up .
Over the summer , though , the good people of Vélib added a simple behavioral incentive to the system :
Return your bike to one of 100 stations perched over 60 meters above the rest of the city , and 15 minutes of free riding is added to your account .
Riding uphill is now a power - up .
They turned a hassle into a game , pain into points .
Riding uphill is now a power - up .
The free minutes are a bonafide reward , too , saving money on destinations that are often outside of the free 30 - minute radius .
More bikes make it back up the hill .
Since the program was launched in June , over nine years of bonus minutes have been awarded .
As a software developer , I obsess over performance bottlenecks , inefficient areas of code that bog down the rest of the application .
It turns out that the best solution often is n’t a brute - force route through the problem ( “ let ’s truck the bikes up the hill ” ) but rather an elegant sidestep around the issue ( “ how can we get the riders to do it instead ? ” ) .
So the systems guy in me loves this solution , but even more , it appeals to something more playful .
I love that this simple tweak made an uphill commute feel more like a game , where you earn points and reward for your effort .
It reminds me of Jane McGonigal ’s spirited encouragement to do more to “ make the real world more like games , ” which I wrote about a few months ago :
Her idea :
By introducing game - like systems into our work and home lives , we can imbue otherwise tedious tasks with the spirit of reward and collaboration that makes gameplay fun .
Jane pointed to a game called Chore Wars which turns housework into gameplay for families .
( “ Finally you can get experience points for housework ! ” )
She also pointed to the Nike + iPod gizmo that transforms running into a community video game .
Vélib fixed a performance bottleneck by introducing a game into the system .
What ’s not to love ?
It 's one small step for Tardigrada , and one giant leap for the animal kingdom :
The toughest creature on Earth has survived a trip into space .
Except for a few hardy strains of bacteria , any other creature would have been destroyed – but tardigrades handled the voyage as though it were a dry spell on their local moss patch .
" They have claws and eyes .
They are real animals .
And this is the first time such an animal was tested in space , " said Petra Rettberg , an Institute of Aerospace Medicine microbiologist .
Better known as water bears , tardigrades are eight - legged invertebrates visible to the naked eye and found throughout the world , making them a biology class favorite .
They 're capable of halting their metabolisms during times of extreme privation , and can repair DNA damage caused by extraordinary doses of radiation – a phenomenon that 's piqued scientific curiosity and prompted researchers to shoot tardigrades into naked orbit around the Earth .
" The repair – how fast , how efficient , with or without errors – is different , but basic damage is the same , " said Rettberg , who helped design a tardigrade containment system attached to the Foton - M3satellite , launched last September by a consortium of national space agencies .
The tardigrades had already been coaxed into an anhydrobiotic state , during which their metabolisms slow by a factor of 10,000 .
This allows them to survive vacuums , starvation , dessication and temperatures above 300 degrees Fahrenheit and below minus 240 degrees Fahrenheit .
Once in orbit , the tardigrade box popped open .
Some were exposed to low - level cosmic radiation , and others to both cosmic and unfiltered solar radiation .
All were exposed to the frigid vacuum of space .
Back on Earth , tardigrades that had basked in cosmic radiation revived and reproduced at rates comparable to an unexposed control group .
Those dosed with solar radiation were less likely to wake – but that even a few survived , wrote Rettberg 's team in findings published today in
Current Biology , was remarkable .
Just how the invertebrate astronauts protected themselves " remains a mystery , " wrote the researchers .
Rettberg 's next task is to identify the responsible genes – a basic step , perhaps , in better understanding and improving human DNA repair .
Tardigrades may even provide insights into adaptations necessary for survival in off - Earth colonies , though they could not live actively in the extreme and nutrient - poor environments of Mars or the moon .
However , Rettberg cautioned against expecting too much from such early findings .
" It 'll just be interesting to see what the mechanisms are in tardigrades , compared to the very simple ones in bacteria and more complex systems in higher organisms , " she said .
" But in addition , it 's just fun . "

For 28 years , Robert Mugabe has reigned like an absolute monarch .
The power - sharing deal to be signed on Monday in theory closes that chapter in Zimbabwe 's troubled history .
It whittles down his powers in key respects .
But some analysts are unsure whether the complex arrangement brokered by South African President Thabo Mbeki will hold together long enough to produce effective government .
The octogenarian President will now have to contend with a cabinet dominated by the combined factions of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) .
Authoritative sources say the deal to be announced on Monday creates 31 cabinet posts , of which Mr Mugabe will pick up 15 , Morgan Tsvangirai 13 , and the remaining three will go to a smaller breakaway faction of the MDC led by Arthur Mutambara .
However , contrary to suggestions that Mr Mugabe 's role will be reduced to a ceremonial one , he will very much remain in the driving seat as President and head of cabinet .

" If the two MDC factions work together , which they must in the national interest , they will enjoy a majority in cabinet , " said David Coltart , the legal affairs secretary of Mr Mutambara 's smaller splinter faction .
This means the MDC should be able to drive the policy agenda and seek to abolish the apparatus of repression that Mr Mugabe has nurtured over the years .
But there is also the real possibility that the MDC factions might remain at loggerheads , which will effectively benefit Mr Mugabe .
Some analysts see a major bottleneck emerging from the complex institutional arrangements created to mollify both the Mugabe and Tsvangirai sides during months of negotiations .
The dialogue had remained stalled over Mr Tsvangirai 's refusal to deputise Mr Mugabe as chair of cabinet .
The MDC leader had contended that as Prime Minister , the prerogative of chairing and overseeing the work of cabinet should be his .
The 84 - year - old President argued that stripping him of the chairmanship of cabinet would reduce him to a " ceremonial drama queen " .
The stalemate was broken by Mr Mbeki , who proposed two centres of power , instituting a new " council of ministers " while keeping the normal cabinet .
Mr Mugabe and his two deputies will have no seats in the council of ministers chaired by Mr Tsvangirai .
Mr Mugabe would remain chair of the cabinet and the " council of ministers " would be accountable to cabinet .
The council will be charged with recommending policy to cabinet and overseeing its implementation .
Potential for conflict thus remains high , notes an analyst , Noah Chifamba .
" What happens if Mugabe rejects policy proposals from the council and vice - versa ?
It is not clear whose decisions take precedence , " he said .
Eldred Masunungure , a political scientist at the University of Zimbabwe , said : " It 's a potential minefield and some very treacherous terrain will have to be navigated . "
Mr Coltart echoed that fear , noting that most opposition cabinet members would at one stage have been " brutalised on the instructions of those they will now have to work with " .
The power - sharing deal calls for a new " people - driven " constitution to be enacted within 18 months and for the way to be prepared for future elections under a new democratic dispensation .
If the latter is achieved , that will perhaps be the most significant outcome of the deal as it will enable the opposition to fight and win future elections with ease .
More important is the share - out of powerful security cabinet portfolios .
It is understood that the MDC has been allocated the Ministry of Home Affairs in charge of the police .
If the MDC can overhaul the force into a credible professional body , then it would have achieved a milestone in the re-democratisation process of Zimbabwe .
The problem for Mr Tsvangirai is that he wo n't have power to hire and fire the police commissioner .
Such key appointments will still be made by Mr Mugabe on the advice of the Prime Minister .
Mr Mugabe would also retain the Ministry of Defence with all its power to annihilate his enemies still intact .

" I would agree that this [ deal ] is a fragile initial step and it wo n't work unless the political foes involved bury the hatchet and decide to just work for the good of the country , " said Mr Chifamba , warning that any " minor irritation " from either of the parties could break it .
" Let 's give it a few months and see .
I think if it survives the first three to six months , when important policy decisions will have to be taken , it will probably survive the duration of its envisaged existence . "
Western donors , whose money will be required for reconstruction , are likely to adopt a wait - and - see attitude .
Many , like the US and Britain , will be disappointed that Mr Mugabe still wields so much power .
The first task of the new government will be to come up with a viable economic reconstruction programme .
Mr Tsvangirai will then have to embark on a resource mobilisation exercise to fund it .
But getting agreement for such a programme , which would in some instances entail reversing many of Mr Mugabe 's nationalisation laws , will be a mammoth task .
Mr Mugabe has already declared there will be no going back on his land reforms despite the fact that once productive farms dished out to incompetent cronies are lying fallow .

The Nkomo precedent
* The fate of Joshua Nkomo is a worrying precedent for Morgan Tsvangirai .
In December 1987 , Nkomo , leader of Zimbabwe 's main opposition party , Zapu , signed an agreement with President Robert Mugabe for a national unity government .
Mr Nkomo , whose supporters in southern and western Zimbabwe had suffered years of political violence after independence , served as a figurehead vice - president .
The cabinet also included three Zapu leaders .
The two parties were officially merged to become Zanu - PF , but in reality the deal led to the absorption of Mr Nkomo 's party and enabled Mr Mugabe to rule unchallenged for a further decade .
Mr Nkomo remained as vice - president until his death in 1999 .
In this era of strip malls and outlet stores it ’s getting difficult to tell one suburban community from another .
Some people might like the fact that you can hardly tell your hometown from a city across the country or even in another part of the world , but it was n’t always like this .
All these ubiquitous chains started somewhere with only one location , so if you ever wanted to know where to go to shake your fist in the air to curse the strip - malling of America , these 15 locations below would be a good start .
McDonalds
Original McDonald ’s in San Bernardino
In perhaps the most famous of all franchising stories , Dick and Mac McDonald opened the first McDonald ’s restaurant in May , 1940 , in San Bernardino , California .
Their “ fast food ” philosophy was a big success , and in 1953 the brothers opened their first franchised McDonald ’s in Phoenix , Arizona , which was also the first one with the golden arches .
In 1954 , milkshake - mixer salesman Ray Kroc visited the original location of the now - four - strong chain , and was so impressed he made a deal to sell the franchises himself not long after he opened his own McDonald ’s in Des Plaines , Illinois .
The rest , as they say , is history .
The current headquarters are in Oak Brook , Illinois , and there are over 31,000 locations around the world .
Gap
Fall into The Gap in San Francisco
Back in the hippie days of 1969 , people often referred to the ‘ generation gap ’ between parents and children of the era .
That same summer a couple named Donald and Doris Fisher opened a store on Ocean Avenue in San Francisco called The Gap , based on that phrase , and it sold Levis , records , and tapes , although the music offerings were dropped shortly thereafter in favor of more clothes .
The following year a second store was opened in San Jose , and the march through California and then across the country was on .
In 1983 the company bought the Banana Republic chain , and in 1994 they launched the Old Navy chain as a more budget oriented line .
The Gap is now the United States ’ largest specialty retailer with over 3,100 locations worldwide , with the majority of those being in the US .
KFC
Replica original KFC in Corbin , KY
Harland Sanders was born in 1890 , and he served as a private in the army ( stationed in Cuba ) long before he was operating a gas station along Route 66 in Corbin , Kentucky , which is about 60 miles south of Lexington .
He began serving chicken meals out of his residence at the station at the age of 40 in 1930 .
The governor of Kentucky made Sanders an honorary colonel in 1936 for his contribution to the state ’s cuisine , and though his restaurant ’s popularity continued to grow , it was n’t until the early 1950s that he began franchising the operation .
In 1952 ( at age 62 ) the first Kentucky Fried Chicken franchise opened in Salt Lake City , and things took off quickly after that .
The name was officially changed to KFC much later , and now the chain is owned by Yum !
Brands , with over 11,000 locations in over 80 countries around the world .
Hilton
Original Hilton in Dallas , now the Aristocrat
Conrad Hilton was a representative in the first legislature of the newly formed State of New Mexico in 1912 , and then he enlisted in the U.S. Army to serve in WWI .
Upon return he moved to Texas where in 1919 he bought the Mobley Hotel in Cisco , which is about 140 miles west of Dallas .
He began opening hotels throughout Texas , including the first high - rise , which was also the first called “ The Hilton ” in Dallas in 1925 .
That hotel still stands , although it recently changed hands yet again , and is now known as the Hotel Indigo Dallas Aristocrat , after having been a Holiday Inn not long ago .
The Hilton chain continued to expand through the decades , becoming international with its Puerto Rico hotel in 1949 , and into Europe with its Madrid location in 1953 .
There are now over 500 branded Hilton hotels around the world , and according to Google , the Paris location is by far the most searched for .
Burger King
Insta Burger King , Miami
In late 1954 , which is the same year Ray Kroc discovered the successful McDonald ’s restaurant in California , business partners James McLamore and David Edgerton wanted to enter the growing fast food industry , so they opened “ Insta Burger King ” at 3090 NW 36th Street in Miami , Florida , about a mile east of the airport .
Three years later they introduced ‘ the Whopper ’ to the menu , at 37 cents , and two years after that the franchise plan got underway .
Momentum quickly built , and now the chain operates over 11,000 restaurants in around 60 countries around the world .
Wal - Mart
This storefront still exists in Bentonville
In another story that is fairly well known , in the 1940s Arkansas businessman Sam Walton learned the retail game working at a JC Penney , and then went on to run a couple discount stores which became very successful by undercutting competitor ’s prices .
In 1950 he opened his first Walton ’s 5 & 10 in Bentonville , Arkansas .
In 1962 he had eleven Walton ’s stores , and he decided to start a new discount store chain .
That year the first Wal - Mart was opened in Rogers , Arkansas .
Expansion of the new chain was rapid , with 78 stores by 1974 , 330 stores by 1980 , 1,114 stores by 1985 , and over 1,500 locations by 1990 .
Like it or not , the expansion has continued , and also includes the Sam ’s Club warehouse stores , and the Wal - Mart Supercenters .
They are by far the largest retailer in the world , and the largest private employer in the world .
They have over 4,200 locations in the United States alone , and over 3,100 more locations spread in 13 other countries .
Wendy ’s Old Fashioned Hamburgers
The original Wendy ’s finally closed in 2007
Dave Thomas gained success in the early 1960s turning around four underperforming locations of Kentucky Fried Chicken , and with the profits of selling his locations he invested in the first Wendy ’s restaurant , which opened in 1969 in Columbus , Ohio .
The name Wendy ’s comes from the nickname of his youngest daughter , Melinda Lou , who was unable to say her own name properly so she became known as Wenda , and then later Wendy .
The Columbus location was very successful , and aggressive franchising has led to almost 7,000 locations in over 20 countries , though most are in the United States .
In 2007 the original location in Columbus finally closed down .
Starbucks
The relocated original Starbucks is still open
Inspired by Dutch immigrant Alfred Peet , who opened a small coffee bean store in Berkeley , California in 1966 , three friends opened the first Starbucks in 1971 at 2000 Western Avenue , just a block away from the famous Pike Place Market in Seattle .
( The name Starbuck comes from Captain Ahab ’s first mate in the book Moby Dick . )
In 1976 the original store moved a block away to 1912 Pike Place , which is still open and operating today .
It was n’t until 1987 that Starbucks , shortly after the original partners sold the small chain to Howard Schultz , began selling fresh coffee and espresso in addition to the roasted beans they were known for .
By the time they went public in 1992 the company had grown to 165 stores , and their rapid expansion since then has been missed by very few .
By early 2008 they had over 16,000 worldwide locations , though not long after that they announced they would close around 600 under - performing shops .
7 - Eleven
Tokyo is filled with 7 - Elevens
In 1927 , John Jefferson Green approached the owners of the Dallas Southland Ice Company about selling milk , eggs , and bread through their retail ice docks , and soon the first - ever known convenience store was born in Dallas , Texas .
The following year the name was changed to Tote ’m Stores , after a manager returned from an inspirational trip to Alaska .
By 1946 the chain covered much of north - central Texas , and the name was changed to 7 - Eleven , to emphasize the unusually long operating hours at each store .
Franchising did n’t begin until 1963 , and the Slurpee did n’t appear until two years after that .
In spite of its heartland America heritage , the company has been controlled by a Japanese parent corporation since 1991 , which is a little less surprising when you consider that over 12,000 of the 34,200 worldwide 7 - Eleven locations are in Japan , with over 1,500 in Tokyo alone .
There are also around 1,500 7 - Elevens in Bangkok , Thailand alone , and over 6,000 in the United States .
The chain currently has more worldwide locations than any other in any category .
Subway sandwiches
Original Pete ’s Submarines
Fred DeLuca was only 17 - years - old in 1965 , when a family friend named Dr. Peter Buck loaned him $ 1,000 along with the advice to open up a submarine sandwich shop to earn money for college .
The young man soon opened Pete ’s Super Submarines in Bridgeport , Connecticut , and after noticing that radio ads for Pete ’s Submarines sounded too much like “ Pizza Marines , ” the name was changed to Pete ’s Subway , and then later to just Subway when they began franchising the successful shops in 1974 .
The franchising has grown exponentially , partly due to a relatively low cost of entry for owners , as well as the relentless advertising campaign starring former - fatty Jared Fogle , which debuted in January , 2000 .
There are currently almost 30,000 locations in 87 countries .
Motel 6
Original Motel 6 , Santa Barbara , CA
It launched with its first location in 1962 in Santa Barbara , California , already with the concept of building a large chain of budget motels from the outset .
Two California building contractors who specialized in low cost housing decided they could enter the lodging field with no -frills rooms that rented for $ 6 per night .
Within four years they ’d built twenty - six Motel 6’s , and their success grew from there , although the original partners sold the growing chain in 1968 .
The original Santa Barbara location is still there and operating , and it ’s one of a group of over 900 locations in the chain that is now owned by French hotel group Accor .
There is at least one Motel 6 in each of the lower 48 states , and yet the only international locations are a few in Canada .
Baskin- Robbins
Co-founder Irvine Robbins , who died in May , 2008
Shortly after WWII was over , entrepreneurs Burton Baskin ( who made ice cream while in the U.S. Navy ) and Irvine Robbins wanted to open ice cream shops in the Los Angeles area .
Irv opened Snowbird Ice Cream in Pasadena , and Burt opened Burton ’s Ice Cream in nearby Glendale , and by 1948 they had 6 stores between them .
One year later they ’d grown to 40 stores , and bought their own dairy in Burbank , which allowed them full control over their product .
In 1953 they combined the huge operation into the Baskin - Robbins 31 Ice Cream chain , with the number added to the name that implied there was a different flavor for every day of the month .
By the mid-1960s they had 400 stores across the country , and in the 1970s they opened their first international stores in Japan , Saudi Arabia , Korea , and Australia .
It ’s now by far the world ’s largest ice cream chain , with over 2,800 stores in the United States , and over 5,800 around the globe .
Arby’s
The Raffel Brothers
In 1964 brothers named Leroy and Forrest Raffel decided they wanted to create a fast food chain that was n’t all about hamburgers , and their first location opened on July 23 of that year in Boardman , Ohio , which is just south of Youngstown , and about 50 miles from either Cleveland or Pittsburgh , PA .
The name Arby ’s comes from the initials for Raffel Brothers , though many have long suspected it comes from the initials for roast beef , which has been the signature product since day one .
Some beef aficionados wonder why the texture of Arby ’s “ roast beef ” does n’t really resemble that of actual roast beef , but this has n’t stopped them from opening over 3,700 locations in the years since .
They are currently owned by Triarc , and in the process of merging with the Wendy ’s hamburgers chain , which will give them over 10,000 locations combined , still not even close to McDonald ’s or Subway , but in the same ballpark as Burger King or KFC in their quest for future world dominance .
Barnes & Noble
Barnes & Noble , Union Square , NYC
Back in 1873 , Charles M. Barnes started a book business out of his home in Wheaton , Illinois , and it was n’t until 1917 that his son William went to New York City to open a bookstore with G. Clifford Noble at 31 West 15th St. in Manhattan .
In 1932 , at the height of the Great Depression , the pair opened what would become the flagship store at 18th Street and Fifth Avenue .
That store remains open still today as the foundation of their college books division , and due to a number of additions over the years it made it into the Guinness Book of World Records as the world ’s largest bookstore .
In the 1970s they began opening smaller stores elsewhere , and they bought the 797 locations of competitor B. Dalton Bookseller in 1987 , only to close most of those stores in the following decades as Amazon and others helped put bookstores on the endangered list .
Barnes & Noble is currently the largest bookstore chain in the United States , with almost 800 locations as well as a thriving web business .
Taco Bell
Founder Glen Bell anchors this Taco Bell montage
Former Marine Glen
Bell came home to San Bernardino , California after WWII , where he opened up Bell ’s Drive - In , which he sold in 1952 in order to pay for three new restaurants called Taco Tio in the same area .
The chain grew from there until Bell sold his shares to new business partners , so in 1962 he could open his first Taco Bell in the Los Angeles suburb of Downey , California .
By the time Bell sold the chain to PepsiCo in 1975 , there were 868 locations .
Not slowed down at all by the fact that every item on the menu tastes the same , dramatic expansion has continued and there are now over 5,500 locations in the United States , and 240 locations elsewhere in the world .
DETROIT  General Motors is in preliminary talks about a possible merger with Chrysler , a deal that could drastically remake the landscape of the auto industry by reducing the Big Three of Detroit automakers to the Big Two .
The talks between G.M. and Cerberus Capital Management , the private equity firm that owns Chrysler , began more than a month ago , and the negotiations are not certain to produce a deal .
Two people close to the process said the chances of a merger were “ 50 - 50 ” as of Friday and would most likely still take weeks to work out .
A merger would be a historic event , with two of the most iconic names in American industry coming together to survive in an increasingly difficult environment .
Both have roots dating back decades in Detroit and , with Ford , long dominated the auto industry  until Japanese and other foreign car makers began making inroads into the American market .
The auto industry is being pummeled from all sides  by high gas prices that have soured consumers on profitable S.U.V.’s , by a softening economy that has scared shoppers away from showrooms , and by tight credit that is making it difficult for willing buyers to obtain loans .
Both G.M. and Chrysler have been struggling with product lineups that are out of sync with consumer demand for smaller , more fuel - efficient cars .
WASHINGTON  A judge unsealed a new batch of court documents in the anthrax case on Wednesday , filling in further details of the bizarre behavior of Bruce E. Ivins , the Army scientist who the F.B.I. has said carried out the letter attacks of 2001 .
Last September , according to a sworn statement from an F.B.I. agent , Dr. Ivins sent himself an exuberant e-mail message under the heading “ Finally !
I know Who mailed the anthrax ! ”
He did not identify the perpetrator but said he was close to assembling the final proof .
“ I ’m not looking forward to everybody getting dragged through the mud , but at least it will all be over , ” Dr. Ivins wrote , adding , “ I should have been a private eye !!!! ” and signing the message “ Bruce . ”
The documents do not speculate about his motive , though Dr. Ivins was aware by that time that he was under suspicion and might have believed that his e-mail  he maintained at least eight e-mail addresses  was being monitored .
Maybe you disagree with your Senator 's stance on an issue .
Or maybe you are discontent with his or her voting policies .
Contrary to what you may believe or wish , you cannot recall members of the U.S. Congress .
Recalling a member of the Senate is not allowed by the Constitution , and no one has been removed from the Senate from a recall .
1 Historical Discussion About Recalling U.S. Senators
Even though no one in the Senate has been recalled , that does n't mean that it has not been a topic of discussion in the past .
In fact , when the nation 's founders were at the Constitutional Convention , they considered adding a provision to the Constitution regarding a recall and decided against it – arguing that the provisions already in the Constitution provided enough balance of power and stability .
Iranians ’ hatred of America dates back to the CIA ’s violent 1953 overthrow of democratic Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh ’s government in order to arrange sweetheart contracts for western oil companies , author Stephen Kinzer writes in “ Overthrow : America ’s Century of Regime Change From Hawaii to Iraq . ”
The CIA ’s installation of despot Shah Mohammed Reza Palevi on a throne , Kinzer writes , “ ultimately set off a revolution that brought radical fundamentalists to power ” in Iran and led to the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington , D.C. “
Not satisfied with the humiliation they visited on the United States by holding 54 American diplomats hostage for 14 months , ” Kinzer writes , “ these radicals sponsored deadly acts of terror against Western targets , among them the United States Marine barracks in Saudi Arabia and a Jewish community center in Argentina .
Their example inspired Muslim fanatics around the world , including in neighboring Afghanistan , where the Taliban gave sanctuary to militants who carried out devastating attacks against the United States on September 11 , 2001 . ”
“ None of this ” would have happened , Kinzer continued , quoting one Iranian diplomat , “ if Mossadegh had not been overthrown . ”
In his new book , “ An Enemy of The People ” ( Doukathsan ) , Lawrence Velvel , dean of the Massachusetts School of Law at Andover , notes that after Kermit Roosevelt , ( grandson of President Theodore ) , then head of Mideast Operations for the CIA , created a state of anarchy that toppled the legitimate government , the U.S. oil companies cashed in .
“ Our oil companies --- Gulf , Standard of New Jersey , Texaco and Mobil --- received a 40 percent share of the new National Iranian Oil Company , and the shah established a tyrannical dictatorship , with the dreaded Savak doing dirty work for him , ” Velvel writes .
“ So our misconduct of yesterday contributed greatly to , ( and ) probably caused , the terrible situation in the Middle East we find ourselves in today . ”
Velvel points out how Great Britain and the U.S. engineered the coup together .
Britain from 1901 had a monopoly on Iranian oil allowing them to pay Iran just 16 % of what they got for selling it .
When Mossadegh took over in 1951 , he nationalized the oil industry “ just as , he would say , Britain had nationalized its coal and steel industries for its own people ’s benefit ” and paid the British a fair price , Velvel added .
The outraged British attempted to organize a coup against Mossadegh but he shut their embassy and forced their intelligence agents out of the country , so the British proposed Roosevelt for the task .
“ Under the plan drawn up by the British , ” Velvel wrote , “ We would bribe journalists , preachers and other opinion leaders to create hostility to Mossadegh , ( and ) would hire thugs to attack people , making it look as if the attacks were by Mossadegh … ”
When these tactics failed , Roosevelt paid street gangs to set off riots .
According to Kinzer , “ a plague of violence descended on Tehran .
Gangs of thugs ran wildly through the streets , breaking shop windows , firing guns into mosques , beating passerby , and shouting ‘ Long live Mossadegh and Communism ! ”
A cooperative Army general finally used tanks to attack the Prime Minister ’s residence and he surrendered .
Kinzer writes that when Shah Palevi seized power he repressed opposition newspapers , political parties , trade unions and civic groups .
“ As a result , the only place Iranian dissidents could find a home was in mosques and religious schools , many of which were run by obscurantist clerics .
Through their uncompromising resistance to the regime , these clerics won the popular support that secular figures never achieved .
That made it all but inevitable that when revolution finally broke out in Iran ( against Palevi ) , clerics would lead it . ”
By 1979 , Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini became so powerful he forced Palevi from the throne and a few months later sanctioned the seizure of the U.S. embassy in Tehran and the taking of U.S. diplomats ’ hostage .
“ The hostage crisis deeply humiliated the United States , destroyed Jimmy Carter ’s presidency , and turned millions of Americans into Iran haters , ” Kinzer writes .
“ Because most Americans did not know what the United States had done in Iran in 1953 , few had any idea why Iranians were so angry at the country they called ‘ the Great Satan . ’ ”
Dean Velvel is cofounder of the Massachusetts School of Law at Andover , purposefully dedicated to providing a quality , affordable education to the working class , mid-life people , minorities , and immigrants who would otherwise not be able to get a legal education .
Velvel is a leader in the movement to reform legal education and has been honored for his work by The National Law Journal .
ABC News :
Despite pledges by President George W. Bush and American intelligence officials to the contrary , hundreds of US citizens overseas have been eavesdropped on as they called friends and family back home , according to two former military intercept operators who worked at the giant National Security Agency ( NSA ) center in Fort Gordon , Georgia … .
She said US military officers , American journalists and American aid workers were routinely intercepted and “ collected on ” as they called their offices or homes in the United States … .
Faulk says he and others in his section of the NSA facility at Fort Gordon routinely shared salacious or tantalizing phone calls that had been intercepted , alerting office mates to certain time codes of “ cuts ” that were available on each operator ’s computer .
“ Hey , check this out , ” Faulk says he would be told , “ there ’s good phone sex or there ’s some pillow talk , pull up this call , it ’s really funny , go check it out .
It would be some colonel making pillow talk and we would say , ‘ Wow , this was crazy ’ , ” Faulk told ABC News …
Asked for comment about the ABC News report and accounts of intimate and private phone calls of military officers being passed around , a US intelligence official said “ all employees of the US government ” should expect that their telephone conversations could be monitored as part of an effort to safeguard security and “ information assurance . ”
“ They certainly did n’t consent to having interceptions of their telephone sex conversations being passed around like some type of fraternity game , ” said Jonathon Turley , a constitutional law professor at George Washington University who has testified before Congress on the country ’s warrantless surveillance program .
“ This story is to surveillance law what Abu Ghraib was to prison law , ” Turley said … .
NSA awarded Adrienne Kinne a NSA Joint Service Achievement Medal in 2003 at the same time she says she was listening to hundreds of private conversations between Americans , including many from the International Red Cross and Doctors without Borders .
“ We knew they were working for these aid organizations , ” Kinne told ABC News .
“ They were identified in our systems as ‘ belongs to the International Red Cross ’ and all these other organizations .
And yet , instead of blocking these phone numbers we continued to collect on them , ” she told ABC News .

Argh , why does everyone seem to think that religion and science must be two seperate things ?
Why can't they be connected ?
And about the bible not having any proof : I 'm not so sure its always supposed to being taken so completely literally .
A lot if it is probably speaking spiritually , like in metaphors and all that .

From out - of - this world flying vehicles to abductions and experimentation on humans , authorities come up with absurd explanations while the public scratches their heads in confusion and fear .
That is where ufologists come in .
Their mission is to uncover the truth about the existence of UFOs , to determine their origin , their intentions , and their relationship to the government .
Occasionally , they get on a History Channel UFO documentary as an expert .
If this sounds like your dream career , you ’ll need to get versed in the ocean of reports , de-classified government documents , and investigations that are available .
3. Parapsychologist
For ages , people have exhibited some unexplainable talents ( no , I do n’t mean Paris ’s appetite for idiocy and self - mockery ) .
I ’m talking about reading minds , moving things with pure mental willpower , and seeing things with your mind ’s eye from hundreds of miles away .
Parapsychology includes all of these phenomena and the possibility of the survival of consciousness beyond death .
Parapsychologists mostly try to prove the existence of these extraordinary abilities .
They test people using random number generators .
They put them in rooms and ask them to picture something very far away .
Personally , I saw this kid in my high school throw a freshman without touching him .
Much research has been done by both the government and private organizations , supposedly without any conclusive evidence that this phenomena actually exists .
If you would like to be the first to finally prove that humans can bend spoons with their minds or cause things to spontaneously burst into flames , you will need to get updated on the history and theories of parapsychology and maybe take a few classes in Psychology .
4. Paranormal Investigator
– With the success of the Sci Fi TV series Ghosthunters , this field has gained an enormous amount of popularity in the last few years .
Death and what happens afterward will always excite a great deal of curiosity .
Many people believe they have seen or communicated with spirits from beyond the grave .
As seen on Ghosthunters , paranormal investigators typically visit alleged haunted places ( houses , hotels , graveyards , etc. ) .
They take temperature and electromagnetic field readings .
They record the entire process on video .
Sometimes they find nothing .
Other times they experience something frightening .
If you are a night person and do n’t mind those shivers running up your spine , you might consider this career .
There ’s no degree or research necessary , just a willingness to go into really scary places .
5. Conlinguist
– If you ’ve watched Lord of the Rings , Star Wars , or Star Trek , you ’ve heard a variety of exotic languages spoken by Klingons , elves , and Hutts .
As convincing as they sound , these are not languages that developed and grew naturally over centuries like Spanish or Hindi .
They are constructed , or intentionally created , languages ( I hate to break it to you ) .
Conlinguists are the people who create these languages , usually for movies , books , or video games .
Conlinguists have to hold some primary knowledge of languages and how they work .
They may borrow from real , existing languages , but the more convincing ones are constructed from the ground up .
As one may imagine , there is n’t a lot of demand for conlinguists .
Unless they create a wildly popular language like Klingon , which sports its own dictionary and set of language tapes , conlinguists must work other jobs to pay the bills .
If you ’re interested in this career path , learn a language and study linguistics .

VATICAN CITY ( Reuters ) - Pope Benedict told a gathering of scientists including the British cosmologist Stephen Hawking on Friday that there was no contradiction between believing in God and empirical science .
Pope Benedict XVI ( R ) greets British professor Stephen Hawking during a meeting of science academics at the Vatican October 31 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Osservatore Romano
Benedict , who briefly met the wheelchair - bound physicist at an event hosted by the Pontifical Academy of Sciences , described science as the pursuit of knowledge about God ’s creation .
“ There is no opposition between faith ’s understanding of creation and the evidence of the empirical sciences , ” the pontiff said .
“ Galileo saw nature as a book whose author is God . ”
The Catholic Church found the 17th - century astronomer Galileo guilty of heresy for insisting the earth revolved around the sun .
It did not rehabilitate him until 1992 .
Hawking is a guest at the week - long event , which will explore the theme : “ Scientific Insights into the Evolution of the Universe and of Life . ”
In an interview with Reuters last year , Hawking said he was “ not religious in the normal sense . ”
“ I believe the universe is governed by the laws of science , ” he said .
“ The laws may have been decreed by God , but God does not intervene to break the laws . ”
The Catholic Church teaches “ theistic evolution , ” which accepts evolution as scientific theory .
Proponents see no reason why God could not have used an evolutionary process in forming the human species .
The Pontiff admired the technology that allows Hawking to speak through a voice synthesizer .
Hawking is crippled by a muscle disease and has lost the use of his natural voice .
Hawking , author of the best - selling “ A Brief History of Time , ” will speak about the origin of the universe at the closed - door event .
Dear Cecil : Samurai swords are reputed to be among the best ever produced , a fact attested to by the practice of testing the swords on human cadavers , usually those of condemned criminals .
My question is , just how sharp were these blades ?
I 've read accounts declaring certain swords could cut through the hip bones of three grown men set side by side .
In my opinion , that 's sharp — maybe too sharp to believe .
Where human - cleaving blades are concerned , did any other culture come close technologically ( Toledo and Damascus come to mind ) , or were the Japanese truly at the head of the field ?
Mr Slick
Cecil replies :
At first I thought this would be the perfect opportunity for a demonstration of Straight Dope home science .
However , on investigating the available resources , I discovered we lacked ( a ) a samurai sword and ( b ) three volunteers .
So we ’re back to shoe leather , the Internet , and spies .
First things first .
Could historical swords cut clear through somebody ?
We ’re fairly sure at least some samurai swords — katana , they ’re called — were tested on the bodies of convicted criminals as part of the practice of tameshigiri , or test cutting .
One Japanese sword made in 1662 is inscribed “ Two persons completely cut into two pieces ( one stroke ) , ” a scholarly article informs us , and reportedly blades bearing five - body ratings can be found in Japanese museums .
I ’m skeptical — honestly now , five ? — but in any case remember we ’re talking about stationary , unarmored targets .
Remains found at old Japanese battle sites do n’t suggest that combatants were routinely cut in two .
Furthermore , while we lack adequate comparative data on how many human bodies a good modern sword can slice through , a perusal of the photos in trauma journals indicates a common knife can make surprisingly deep cuts .
So do n’t get an exaggerated idea of the inherent lethality of Japanese swords .
For more we turn to the Association for Renaissance Martial Arts , which goes the extra mile in testing modern - day swords .
These guys have a section on their Web site ( http://thearma.org/) where you can watch footage of folks cutting through bamboo poles , pieces of armor , and hunks of dead animal .
We contacted ARMA director John Clements , who told us the group has experimented with “ accurate replicas of medieval and Renaissance European war swords on freshly culled deer carcasses and pig carcasses and seen first hand that these weapons easily shear and cleave through flesh and bone with basic cutting blows . ”
He said historical swords used in combat were n’t necessarily as sharp as many assume : “ There are videos on our website of fairly blunt blades achieving the same effects as notoriously sharp samurai katana .
So , edge sharpness [ alone ] is not nearly as important as a hard and well - honed edge hitting forcefully with the correct geometry and energy . ”
Now to your other question :
Did smiths in other locales produce swords as technologically advanced as the celebrated Japanese blades ?
Comparisons are tough .
For one thing , different swords were made for different purposes .
The light , wieldy katana was effective against the lacquered leather armor commonly worn in Japan , but would have been less so against European plate - steel armor , which demanded a heavier blade .
In addition , we ’re still not certain how some historical swords were made .
The technology behind the katana is reasonably well understood and , no question , involved some cunning metalwork .
One trick was repeatedly folding over and hammering out the hot blade , producing steel with thousands of layers in which the all - important carbon alloy was uniformly distributed ; another was fusing a cutting edge of hardened steel to a softer spine .
Result : a blade of exceptional strength , flexibility , and sharpness .
By contrast the secrets of the Damascus - steel swords favored by Islamic armies were largely lost and remain conjectural .
One study claims Damascus steel contained carbon nanotubes — superstrong cylindrical molecules — that helped give the swords their remarkable flexibility .
Another researcher believes naturally occurring trace elements such as vanadium may have been essential constituents of the famed “ wootz ” steel used by Damascus smiths , and that the exhaustion of the ore source led to the demise of their art .
Let ’s not get goofy about this .
Today we have an incredible variety of materials and techniques that can produce blades surely rivaling or surpassing the best of olden times .
Still , you hear stories of metallurgical know - how lost , some of them quite recent , that give you pause .
Twentieth - century Nebraska cutler Frank Richtig , for instance , was famous in certain circles for producing blades that could be driven through steel stock and still retain their sharpness .
After painstaking analysis , a couple of Lawrence Livermore scientists think they ’ve figured out how he did it ( Wadsworth and Lesuer , Materials Characterization , 2000 ) — no thanks to Richtig , who took his method with him to the grave in the 1970s .
“ A man is entitled to some secrets , ” he said , “ and that ’s mine . ”

it is easier to read
reordering conditions is easier because they are not nested
the link between a condition and the corresponding Exception is more obvious
keep the indentation lower , which makes life easier with the limit of 80 chars / line
less line are changed across revisions which decrease the number of SVN conflicts possible and easier the code review .
Take a look at the following pictures showing the same change requests ( doing nothing if old and new password are the same + checking that password contains 8 + chars ) implemented with the two styles :

Facebook has decided to share some details about its system architecture and make public the source code that powers it .
In a note posted by one of the company ’s engineers , Facebook describes how it went about choosing its technology stack and ultimately arrived at the decision to build its own server – called Scribe – to make sure Facebook could scale to hundreds of millions of users .
Scribe is available as a project on SourceForge , where developers can track updates , request features , and submit bug reports .
Facebook has a number of other open source projects in the works , including Facebook Open Platform , which offers up much of the Facebook code and enables other social networks – like Friendster – to let developers easily migrate their Facebook applications over .
Unlike other social networks like Friendster , MySpace , and Twitter – all of whom have run into serious scalability issues at different points during their growth - Facebook has been mostly reliable throughout its rise .
So , if you have the bravado to think your Web app may someday handle “ a few billion messages a day ” ( as Facebook says in their note ) , you may want to give Scribe a look .
Video interviews by confrontational Barack Obama supporters at John McCain rallies are shooting up the YouTube charts , revealing angry and nasty anti-Obama sentiment that is in turn motivational for the Democratic presidential contender ’s supporters .
You almost feel like Joe Francis is behind the camera asking girls to flash him .
And watching brings the same voyeuristic and embarrassed emotional response .
A video titled The McCain - Palin Mob is the No. 3 most - discussed video on YouTube today , with more than 675,000 views since it was posted Wednesday .
In the clip , Ohio rally - goers tell blogger Tim Russo ( who ’s behind the camera ) they have reason to believe Obama is a terrorist .
Russo ’s questioning is clearly aimed at putting his subjects on the defensive , but they take it to another level , in particular one woman who keeps pushing her way back on camera .
Viewership of the video is partisan as well , but on the other side of the spectrum , with more than 130,000 views coming from the Huffington Post and many more from other liberal blogs .
Another , separate video from a Pennsylvania rally has McCain supporters calling Obama a “ commie faggot ” among other epithets , and is the No. 25 most - discussed YouTube clip today .
In a campaign where off - hand remarks by candidates regularly become leading nightly news items , citizens with video cameras wield a lot of journalistic power .
And so it ’s a bit hard to take Russo ’s point of view , in that his disdain for his subjects is so clear ( see some unprintable , for us , comments he makes about them on his blog ) .
But at the same time , the mocking response he evokes from the woman at the McCain rally , which would have never aired at length ( or at all ) on TV , made its way out into the world .
We live in interesting times !

ABC released an excerpt from Charles Gibson ’s interview with Sarah Palin that will air nationally tonight .
Apparently Alaska ’s proximity to Russia provides her with special insight .
When asked by Gibson if under the NATO treaty , the U.S. would have to go to war if Russia again invaded Georgia , Palin responded : “ Perhaps so .
I mean , that is the agreement when you are a NATO ally , is if another country is attacked , you ’re going to be expected to be called upon and help .
Palin advocated the accession of Georgia and Ukraine into NATO , meaning that if attacked again in the future , the United States would be bound to go to war … .
“ I mean , that is the agreement when you are a NATO ally , is if another country is attacked , you ’re going to be expected to be called upon and help , ” she said .
Palin , who obtained her first passport this year and who has served just two years as Alaska ’s governor , told Gibson that she was up to the challenge of being Sen.

The fundamentals of social networking differ to other forms of online marketing .
Social networking is n’t about spending money to create visibility for your web site , blog or business .
It ’s about participation , being part of a community and contributing to it – in essence the fundamentals of social networking are :
Creating Awareness – especially in the early days you must be an extremely active user Developing Relationships – make contact and develop relationships with influential users Creating Something of Value – only content which is fun , interesting or useful will gain visibility Building your Reputation – be active , contribute to the community and avoid overly promoting your content
There are a number of social networks – and the ones that really make a difference are ( StumbleUpon , Reddit , Digg and Propeller ) .
Each type of social network requires a slightly different marketing approach , although they all require the four fundamentals – creating awareness , developing relationships , creating something of value , and building your reputation .

Tissue from two mummies found in present - day Mexico bore evidence of the bacterium that causes ulcers .
Two Mexican mummies had ulcers when they were alive .
Remnants of the bacterium Helicobacter pylori were discovered in gastric tissue from the mummies , human remains believed to predate Columbus ' discovery of the New World .
" It is only through the use of the stomach tissue of these incredible mummies that we were able to make this discovery , " said researcher Yolanda Lòpez - Vidal .
" Infection is established when the micro-organism infiltrates the stomach lining and induces a local inflammatory response .
This is unlike colonization , which does not cause such a response and does not occur in the stomach . "
This is the first time that H. pylori infection has been shown to occur in native populations , Lòpez - Vidal said .
The research is detailed in BioMed Central 's open access journal BMC Microbiology .
" Our results show that H. pylori infections occurred around 1350 A.D. in the area we now know as Mexico , " Lòpez - Vidal said .
Her research team included colleagues at the National Autonomous University of Mexico .
Mummification , or the preservation of a body in the process of putrefaction , can take place as a result of environmental effects ( such as climate or where the body is left ) or as a result of human intervention , as in the case of the mummies found in Egyptian pyramids .
In Mexico , mummies are found in dry places such as caves and rock shelters , where rapid dehydration occurs .
The internal organs are the last to dehydrate , Lòpez - Vidal wrote .
The mummies for this research were recovered in a funeral cave of La Ventana , in the Chihuahua State desert , and in a cave in the state of Durango .
As well as stomach ulcers , H. pylori causes gastritis , duodenitis and cancer .
The helix - shaped bacteria is thought to be transmitted by the ingestion of food or water contaminated with fecal matter .
Lòpez - Vidal 's team studied the stomach , tongue - soft palate and brains of two naturally mummified corpses — one infant male and one adult male , found in Northern Mexico .
The researchers looked for the presence of telltale fragments of H. pylori DNA in the remains after the genetic material was amplified by a common biological technique called polymerase chain reaction .
Although previous research has suggested that H. pylori was present in these communities , this is the first evidence that it caused gastric infections .
I 've been desperately scrambling around for something positive to say today - and the best I can come up with is that the remarkable fall we 've seen in the value of sterling today ( again ) should n't make the Bank of England so anxious about importing inflation that it postpones the widely anticipated further cuts in interest rates .
The Scarborough Evening News is responsible for this insight ( if such it proves to be ) , because it contains some striking remarks by the Deputy Governor of the Bank of England , Charlie Bean :
" This is a once - in - a - lifetime crisis and possibly the largest financial crisis of its kind in human history " said Bean .
" In terms of the impact on the real economy we are still in early days . "
Those do not seem to me to be the views of an economist whose main anxiety is the outlook for inflation .
They 're the words of a central banker worried about the possibility of a deep dark slump .
I f the Bank of England does n't cut a further ½ % off the policy rate - either at its next meeting or in another round of global cuts in co-ordination with other central banks - I 'll be somewhat surprised .
Also , some of sterling 's weakness can be seen as the corollary of dollar strength , rather than a wholesale decision by international investors to shun sterling assets .
The dollar and the yen have both risen today as the last vestiges of the years of the carry trade - in which investors borrowed cheaply in yen and dollars to invest in emerging economies - is unwound .
Hedge funds and other institutional investors are liquidating any assets they perceive as even mildly risky , especially in eastern Europe , Russia and South America ( see my note on this yesterday , " Now there are runs on countries " ) .
And such liquidation inevitably leads to purchases of the US and Japanese currencies .
But just because part of sterling 's weakness reflects a flight to the safety of the dollar and yen , there 's no real comfort there for us .
Sterling today hit a record low against the euro and is at a 12 - year low on a trade - weighted basis .
Why do n't international investors love our currency any more ?
You know where the smell is coming from :
1 ) our huge and tumbling housing and property markets ;
2 ) a banking sector massively dependent on flighty wholesale funding from overseas ;
3 ) a fast - growing budget deficit that has to be funded by massive sales of sterling government bonds , at a time when central banks , sovereign wealth funds and institutional investors are suffering a squeeze on cash available for such investment ( Michael Saunders of Citigroup estimates that the Treasury will have to flog around £ 100 bn net of gilts every year for the next three years - which , as a percentage of GDP , takes us back to the horrible deficit years of the early 1990s ) ;
4 ) oh yes , and we appear to be in recession .
Now the capital flight out of the UK is mild compared with the currency crisis hitting Eastern Europe and Russia , which may well be translated into severe economic difficulties .
But all that means is that we should n't expect vast numbers of the recent émigrés from those countries to return home when the job market tightens here .
If Poles have a choice between being unemployed here or in their homeland , it 's not obvious they 'll all decide to repatriate .
But while we are on the subject of the vulnerability of Eastern European , Russian and South American economies , here 's something positive to say about our banks : their loans to these regions are limited .
If there are big loans losses to be suffered by banks exposed to emerging economies , disproportionate pain will be suffered by continental banks .
Science is the domain of logic , of data , of mathematics and argument and proof .
Scientists are supposed to be trained to recognize their biases and then to ignore or compensate for them in order to discover reality in all its awful glory .
Politics is not usually considered a domain of science as politics is almost definitionally biased .
And for that reason , politics almost never enters into the annals of stringently dispassionate and skeptical scientific journals such as the journals Science and Nature .
That is what makes the endorsement of a presidential candidate by a premier scientific journal newsworthy here at Scholars & Rogues .
“ To the best of the anyone ’s knowledge currently here at the magazine , this
is the first time [ Nature has endorsed a presidential candidate ] . ” – M. Mitchell Waldrop , editorial page editor
Yesterday ’s issue of the journal Nature endorsed Barack Obama for President in its editorial pages .
Both candidates were praised for various parts of their platforms and histories ( Obama for clearly stating what his research goals were , McCain for taking on his party on climate disruption ) .
But apparently the journal ’s editors decided that this year they could n’t stop with acknowledging that both candidates recognition of “ science ’s inspirational value and ability to help achieve national and global goals . ”
The editorial points out that Obama appears to have surrounded himself with a diverse group of advisers in an attempt to ensure that his own decisions are based on a pragmatic assessment of all the information available and to immunize himself from groupthink .
In the opinion of the editors , McCain ’s advisers are not similarly diverse in their opinions , and McCain appears to be less inclined to educate himself on all the issues .
And the editors singled out his choice of running mate as a particularly worrying sign .
But what seems to ultimately have pushed Nature ’s editors over to endorse , for the first time in available memory , a presidential candidate comes down to these two things :
Placing a disinterested view of the world as it is ahead of our views of how it should be ; recognizing that ideas should be tested in as systematic a way as possible ; appreciating that there are experts whose views and criticisms need to be taken seriously : these are all attributes of good science that can be usefully applied when making decisions about the world of which science is but a part .
Writ larger , the core values of science are those of open debate within a free society that have come down to us from the Enlightenment in many forms , not the least of which is the constitution of the United States .
and
[ A ] commitment to seeking good advice and taking seriously the findings of disinterested enquiry [ sic. ] seems an attractive attribute for a chief executive .
Science in all its various forms has the ability to point the country and the world toward answers to our most difficult problems .
But we ’ve had eight years of and administration treating science like it was just another belief system ; like it was witchcraft .
Four more years of a president uninterested in unbiased and pragmatic advice from all of the best minds in the world , not just the best minds our president agrees with , would simply be too much .
Hey kids here 's something you might wanna put on your Christmas gift list especially if one day you want to be a physicist .
A new model of evolution 's origins traces the possible outlines of a critical and mysterious stage in Earth 's infancy , when a few odd chemicals developed into the molecular ancestors of life as we know it .
" This was the basis of all life on Earth , " said Harvard University evolutionary dynamicist Martin Nowak , " and it 's a good starting point to ask , how does life begin ?
How does evolution begin ? "
That some molecules crossed a critical threshold from inanimate to animate is widely assumed by evolutionary biologists , but four billion intervening years have erased the details of this passage .
Nowak and fellow Harvard biologist Hisashi Ohtsuki posit a transitional stage : molecules subject to the forces of selection and mutation , incapable of replication – the final condition necessary for life – but drawn inexorably towards it .
" Evolutionary dynamics are a universal principle .
They can operate with whatever is at hand , " said Nowak .
Key to Nowak 's model , published yesterday in the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences , is the basic concept of selection and mutation in the absence of replication .
He called this period prelife , and characterized it as a " generative system that can produce information . "
" All I need is some chemical system that produces all sorts of chemicals , and some have the property of forming strings , " said Nowak . "
In model units of one and zero , Nowak replicated the bonding of simple molecules in the primordial soup .
In this context , mutation occurred at the level of chemical reactions available to the newly - formed strings – or , in their real - world prelife analogue , in the precursors of RNA , the single - stranded relative of DNA .
Some strings grew faster than others , and were prone to different types of reactions .
" Now I can ask which strings are more abundant than others , and this is a form of selection , " said Nowak .
" This is prelife .
All that 's missing is replication . "
The replication may have taken a form known as template - directed polymerization , in which molecules attract chemicals that assemble in mirror copies beside them .
" Many DNA - like molecules have this property , " said Nowak .
" Now I can ask , under what condition can replication emerge ? "
That condition remains unknown , but synthetic biologists hope to replicate it in a laboratory .
" The transition between chemistry and biology is extremely murky , " said Irene Chen , a Harvard University systems biologist and specialist in early biomolecules .
She was not involved in the research .
" This helps an experimentalist like myself narrow in on the interesting questions .
It 's a clear framework for starting to tackle these problems experimentally , " she said .

Two whistleblowers have come forward to ABC News with allegations that the NSA routinely listened in on the phone calls of ordinary Americans , journalists , aid workers , and military personnel who were living in the Middle East and calling friends and loved ones back in the US .
Both of these whistleblowers were employed by the NSA as intercept operators at a facility in Fort Gordon , Georgia , where they were tasked with intercepting , recording , and monitoring satellite phone calls into and out of Baghdad 's Green Zone .
According to the ABC report , these operators allege that it was common practice at the NSA facility to not only record the phone conversations of ordinary Americans with no connection whatsoever to terrorism , but to single out the exchanges that were somehow novel or salacious for sharing , ridicule , and general discussion .
One of the whistleblowers described to ABC how he would be told by his follow operators , " Hey , check this out , there 's good phone sex or there 's some pillow talk , pull up this call , it 's really funny , go check it out .
It would be some colonel making pillow talk and we would say , ' Wow , this was crazy ' . "
While the whisteblowers ' stories of phone sex recordings being passed around the facility are extremely disturbing , they are n't even the most troubling aspect of the report .
A waste of time ?
The two whistleblowers confirmed that the intercept program has saved the lives of American troops by yielding IED locations and other bits of intel , but they take this to be evidence that the agency 's monitoring of ordinary phone conversations is a waste of time .
In spite of the fact that the agents believed intercepting such calls to be pointless , they were nonetheless ordered to record them and transcribe them anyway .
The fact that the NSA remains interested in these calls even after they 're identified as non-terrorism - related is truly remarkable , and it leads me to believe that the information collected is being archived for data mining purposes .
I suggest data mining as an explanation for retaining them , because I can't think of any legitimate reason for the NSA to order the archiving of a phone sex call made by an American military officer .
But even so , the data mining explanation makes little sense on its face , since why would you feed into a data mining program information that two experienced and trained human agents had already screened and found innocuous .
That 's precisely backwards , but at least that explanation does n't involve blackmail , suppression of political dissent , or any of the other nasty stuff that the US government has been known to do with recordings of its citizens ' phone conversations .
Posts on Apple 's own discussion boards suggest the Mac maker knew about potentially toxic odors being linked to its computers as early as December last year .
While benzene was not mentioned in the posts , many users complained of experiencing headaches , nausea and dizziness .
The smell has been variously described as " new car smell " , " musty " , " rotting carpet " and even cannabis .
" My entire room smells bad and I have had to resort to a few air fresheners just to be able to work on it , " one report read .
Another user on Apple 's discussion board linked the toxic odour to the death of their bird : " I recently have had a bird die ' mysteriously ' which was caged near my MacPro which has had the terrible smell for months .
The vet said it was likely he inhaled something toxic !!! "
In Liberation 's article , written in French , the researcher said his eyes , nose and throat became irritated after 10 days of using the computer .
" The computer emitted fumes which , after a week of use , caused a pronounced irritation of the cornea and respiratory passages , " he said .
Apple changed the researcher 's power supply before replacing the entire computer but the strange smell remained .
He then contacted Greenpeace , which sent the computer to the Analytica lab for analysis .
Seven " volatile organic contaminants " were identified , including styrene , benzene and its derivatives .
Benzene , a known carcinogen , damages bone marrow and can cause a decrease in red blood cells , leading to leukemia and other blood cancers .
It can be found in tobacco smoke , plastics , styrene and products such as glues , paints and detergents .
But the chemical 's presence in consumer products such as computers has dropped sharply as its severe health consequences have come to light .
Although officially Apple says it has found no evidence of the toxins , its customer support staff have allegedly told some callers that the company was aware of the problem , which concerned Mac Pro computers built before this year .
Liberation , which has a daily circulation of about 130,000 copies , reported Apple France as saying its engineers were working on the problem .
Apple 's public relations team is notorious for refusing to acknowledge reported faults in its products .
But some users on the company 's discussion boards have come up with their own solution .
Some reports say the smell - apparently caused by a protective resin coating on some of the circuit boards - disappears after an initial " burn - in " period .
Others have fixed the problem by removing small plastic strips from the side door of the computer case .

Scientifically speaking , where is the best place on the Moon to set up a colony for research ?
Hands down , it has to be the Moon ’s south pole .
Mountainous areas near the rim of Shackelton Crater provide areas of almost continual sunlight , meaning solar power would be constantly available .
In addition , the shadowed craters are in constant darkness and may hold water ice , a potential water supply that would be a vital resource for any lunar base .
Plus it would be a great place to set up a lunar telescope .
Recently , three - dimensional views of this region were released by the European Space Agency , taken by the SMART - 1 spacecraft , providing unprecedented details of what has been called the “ Peak of Eternal Light . ”
Moon base designers , take a look …
This image from the Clementine mission shows seven possible colony sites on the Moon ’s south pole .
Circled in red the highest mountain , the so - called “ Peak of Eternal Light . ”
The images were taken by the AMIE camera on board the SMART - 1 , which has since plunged into the moon ’s surface in a planned crash in 2006 .
The camera team has been working with the data to create digital elevation model of the peaks .
“ AMIE is not a stereo camera , so producing a 3 - D model of the surface has been a challenge , ” said researcher Dr. Detlef Koschny .
“ We ’ve used a technique where we use the brightness of reflected light to determine the slope and , by comparing several images , put together a model that produces a shadow pattern that matches those observed by SMART - 1 . ”
AMIE took a total of 113 images of the peak , located close to the rim of the Shackleton Crater .
The team , led by Dr Bjorn Grieger of ESA ’s European Space Astronomy Centre in Madrid , took five of the best images showing the peak illuminated from different angles .
They mapped all the pixels onto a grid , defining the bright and dark areas .
The data from the five images were then compared to produce estimates of the slope angles and the rendered elevation model was iteratively adjusted to produce a shadow match .
The original AMIE images were then projected onto the retrieved model .
To clearly visualise the topography , the elevation has been exaggerated five times .
Here ’s the elevation map :

" Mommy , Daddy ... Are we real ? " my daughter asked from the back seat of the car , as we made our way home .
She 's nearly six , and she asked this as if it were a perfectly ordinary question .
" Um . . . "
My wife and I glanced at each other and shrugged .
" What do you mean , sweetheart ? " I asked .
She clarified : " Could we just be characters in a story ? "
My son , seven - and - a - half , piped up and reiterated the original question : " Yeah , are we real ? "
And so began a deep philosophical discussion , the first I 've ever been in with participants under the age of eight .
My wife and I patiently explained that yes , as far as we could tell , we were real , but that it was possible that the world as we perceived it was all an illusion .
Since there was no way of knowing whether the world was real , we said , we might as well accept that it is , because we really do n't have a lot of choice .
As for whether we could be characters in a story , we said , that 's impossible because we have free will .
It took some explaining that yes , kids have free will too , even though their parents make a lot of choices for them .
But they really seemed to get it , to internalize the reasoning we discussed to the point where I could tell they were processing it over and over in their minds .
Now , I think that , for being caught completely flat - footed , my wife and I did a pretty good job .
But I wondered how many other parents encounter questions in the same genre from kids that young , and how they deal with it when they do .
I know more , similar , questions will be coming from my kids any day now , and I want to be prepared the next time it happens .
I went looking for books , and found several that look promising : Philosophy for Kids : 40 Fun Questions That Help You Wonder About Everything ! and its sequel The Examined Life : Advanced Philosophy for Kids ; Little Big Minds ; and The Philosophers ' Club .
I have n't read any of them , yet , but I may just have to buy a few for my kids .
I just love the fact that they 're already thinking critically about the world around them , and I want to nurture that as much as possible .
I also came across the website of the Kids Philosophy Slam , an academic competition open to kids from Kindergarten through 12th Grade .
So , what kind of philosophical questions have your kids dropped on you when you were n't ready for them ?
How did you handle it , and do you think you did a good job ?
Storing the solar energy as disassociated hydrogen and oxygen is far easier and cheaper than storing the solar power as electrical energy in a capacity .
With the difficulty and expense of energy storage forming a major hurdle in the way of providing affordable solar power , this new technique may be the first step towards fulfilling significant energy demands with solar power .
And considering the high price and limited available of fossils fuels , along with the fact that 174 thousand trillion watts of sunlight hit the Earth every day , a breakthrough in solar energy could n't come at a better time .
Of course , cars still cant ' use the hydrogen fuel generated by this process , but at least it 's a step in the right direction .
New Relic Goes Free : Quality Rails Monitoring Now Free To All
Disclaimer : New Relic sponsors Ruby and Rails Inside .
This announcement is not advertorial , however , and is written as objectively as possible .
Similar items have been written for non-sponsors , such as this item on Scout .
New Relic is best known as a provider of Rails application monitoring services to large sites - such as all of 37signals ' applications and Shopify - with prices to match .
New Relic invited me to tour their product recently and while I was extremely impressed with the range of features offered , the pricing seemed odd ( being based on the number of Mongrels used - what if you do n't use Mongrel ? ? ) and a little out of reach .
No more .
In conjunction with some rather impressive additional features for their paid customers , New Relic has unveiled a Lite version of their main " RPM " product for free .
RPM
Lite gives you New Relic 's high quality Rails application performance monitoring for free with , naturally , the ability to upgrade to the extended features at a later date .
Mongrel , Thin , Litespeed , Passenger ( mod_rails ) , and JRuby / Glassfish are now all supported .
As well as monitoring your controller actions , ActiveRecord and database utilization , CPU and memory use , and highlighting the slow spots of your application , you also get a " real - time dashboard " ( see screenshot above ) , weekly e-mail reports , an iPhone - compatible client , and there 's no limit to the number of hosts or applications you can monitor .
This is n't a New Relic commercial , so I 'm going to pass on describing the more advanced features their pay - for product offers , although I was pretty impressed by their demo , and certainly see how companies like 37 signals are getting a lot of value out of it .
Naturally , the free product interests me a lot more , and I 'd encourage you to check it out .
No credit card numbers are required and it only takes a few minutes to get up and running .
Eating their own dogfood
Interestingly , all of New Relic 's software is written in Ruby and all of RPM is Rails - based .
Further , New Relic uses its own technology to monitor its own products - RPM is used upon itself !
As founder Lewis Cirne says :
We use RPM on itself : that is , we use RPM Developer mode development to analyze performance issues before they reach production .
And in production , we use RPM Gold to monitor how our production site is performing in realtime , detect problems , isolate bottlenecks , and improve scalability .
RPM tells us that the response time on our data collection tier averages 40 ms and we have not had an outage in at least the last 2 months .
Not bad for a platform that the pundits say " ca n't scale ! "
He goes on to say that RPM collected " over 14 billion records of performance data " in August alone , and he believes that their Engine Yard dedicated cluster could " handle 4 x that load . "
The model of giving away a handful of features for free and encouraging people to pay for significant upgrades is n't an old one , but is reasonably unique in the Rails space .
It 's worth keeping an eye on New Relic to see how it pans out in the long term .

This morning as I woke up to my clock radio , the one minute Project Green segment came on the Rush Limbaugh leaning KNCO AM .
It reported on a recent meeting of California wine growers , all 26 of which are talking preliminary to major efforts to green their operations , product , and packaging .
Somehow this does n’t surprise me .
Vintners are acutely aware of the health of their environment , their plants , and the resulting product .
With the refined and particular tastes of many of their consumers , a lackluster wine will lead to lackluster profits .
Beyond that though , their customers are , I would venture to guess , more likely to be of the LOHAS mindset , choosing what they consume based on more factors then simply the cheapest available .
They want everything they touch to have thought , consciousness , and a lighter impact on the planet factored into them .
How can a wine be green ?
The grapes themselves can of course be organic , the growing method biodynamic .
But what else ?
The bottle .
Glass is recyclable , but the bottles are quite heavy , and shipping them takes much more resources then is ultimately necessary .
New options are emerging , such as French Rabbit ’s Tetrapak based packaging , putting wine into an intriguing shape , in a material that is apparently becoming increasingly recyclable , due to Tetrapak ’s efforts .
It saves resources , both in the actual container , and the shipping of it , since it ’s foldable .
But is the broader wine drinking population ready for this ?
Then there ’s the top : Cork or screw top ?
This has been a topic of debate , as aluminum is recyclable , but it ’s not clear how well it helps the wine “ age . ”
Cork , it turns out , is renewable .
It comes from trees , the material shaved off them much like shearing a sheep , growing back , providing 100,000 people with jobs .
And they can be recycled , through companies like Terracycle , that have cork “ brigades , ” paying people per cork , turning them into new products .
What else ?
Water .
Lots of it .
From the fields to the tasting room , a lot of water is used at a vineyard .
Can wine be grown with less water ?
Can the water used in the tasting room be reused to water the field ?
Will that affect taste ?
These are questions currently being asked .
Or they should be , as water is n’t or wo n’t be the given abundant resource it used to be thought of .
The equipment .
Can vehicles run on biodiesel ?
Reprocessed wine dregs ?
Agricultural waste ?
What other ways can the processing plant be powered ?
Solar , wind , and other on site options come to mind first , but beyond that , perhaps they can take cues from beer companies like New Belgium and Sierra Nevada and reuse waste heat to power , heat , or even cool other parts of the facility ?
There ’s much more that can be done , but I invite you to put your mind around it .
How else do you see a vineyard , or for that manner , any beverage producing company , becoming greener ?
Chime in , below .

Spam is the bane of blogs , ugly links trying to nest its way into your blog comments section to trick your readers to buy their products , download spyware , or just build links .
We do n’t want it , none of us do , and luckily there are ways to stop it .
Solutions in the Blog Platform
You can do it manually , which will work perfectly fine to start with .
Just moderate every comment , no problem right ?
Wrong .
That will take time , and the more readers and Google juice your blog gets , the more spam will hit you .
It is just not humanly possible to manage spam on a larger blog , it will get out of hand really quick .
Enter the anti-spam measures taken by the blogging platforms .
In WordPress you can set up a blacklist and stop all comments with more than two links , for instance , which will help out a bit .
Similar solutions are available for Movable Type .
Problem is , spammers are sometimes very bright , which means that they alter their spam comments to trick you , so you ’ll end up with a bunch of spam comments getting by your line of defence .
Enter the Spam Fighting Plugins
The real way to tackle blog spam is using plugins .
Akismet is something of an industry leader , developed by Automattic and shipped with WordPress .
The plugin is free for personal use , but there are problogger licenses .
Akismet started as a WordPress plugin , but nowadays it is available for other platforms as well , including Movable Type , various forum software , and more .
Defensio is a fairly new anti-spam solution similar to Akismet .
It is available for both WordPress and Movable Type , as well as other platforms , which is a good thing .
The plugin is free for personal use , but commercial adopters will have to pay .
TypePad AntiSpam is Six Apart ’s brand new anti-spam plugin built on the TypePad platform ’s spam protection .
It ’s in beta and totally free at the moment , and available for both Movable Type and WordPress , with more platforms coming soon .
The plugin got a very good testimonial from TechCrunch ’s Michael Arrington , who puts it in the same level of effectiveness as Akismet , which is a great start .
TypePad AntiSpam is a plugin that learns from what you mark as spam , which means that you need to work a bit to get the plugin to be really effective .
It will be very interesting to follow this one .
Other options are of course available , mostly for WordPress .
Spam Karma 2 used to be a lifesaver for me , until Akismet got really effective , and I ’ve had clients being happy with Bad Behaviour .
I ’d also like to flag for Mollom , an anti-spam plugin for Drupal that is available for WordPress and apparently is looking go the same way as Akismet and TypePad AntiSpam , with wider platform support .
My Weapons of Choice in the Spam War
I used to have a combination of Akismet and Spam Karma 2 on my WordPress blogs , which means most of my sites , and it ’s been working really well .
However , the last 6 months or so I ’ve settled for Akismet , and actually have n’t had the need to utilize any other anti-spam plugin .
Defensio is yet to impress me , although I would n’t rule it out .
I am waiting for more users to report on how it is working for them , should it get a lot of positive press I ’ll probably give it a serious go on one of the larger public sites .
Six Apart ’s TypePad AntiSpam plugin is the most interesting one , however , and I ’ll be using it on an upcoming project to see how it turns out .
How do you battle comment spam on your blog , and how is the war coming along ?
Share your experiences in the comments .
Here ’s another great installment from The Wasilla Project .
Remember back when everyone was saying “ Sarah Who ? ” and reading an email that went completely viral from a woman who lives in Wasilla ?
Her name was Anne Kilkenny , and she is featured prominently in this clip .
You ’ll also see some of those famous Wasilla landmarks I photographed on my photo safari through Wasilla all those weeks ago .
Also featured is the quickly - becoming - infamous sports complex that was built just down the road from the Palin home at the exact same time that Todd was building the Palin house with the help of a couple contractor “ buddies ” .
Palin ’s fiscal conservatism is still being touted by the Republican Party as one of her “ selling points ” .
Hats off to the Wasilla Project for their outstanding work in showing once again that the Empress has no clothes .
And if it took Sarah Palin $ 50,000 to redecorate the mayor ’s office in Wasilla , I shudder to think how much it would take to redo the “ undisclosed location ” where Cheney ’s been hanging out ?
I ’d have to take that place down to the studs .
Sept. 4 , 2008  --
The sun may still be shining most of the day , the temperatures may still be above 70 degrees , and the pro football season has n't kicked off yet .
But around the country , some doctors are already receiving their shipments of flu vaccine .
With the start of flu season less than a month away , we took a look at 10 common bits of advice about colds and flu .
Some of these common wisdom gems are , indeed , things you can and should do ( it turns out that it 's not too early for a flu shot -- and you might want to pick up some chicken soup ) .
Others , however , are things you might want to pass on ( the zinc and echinacea -- at least for now ) .
Visit the OnCall + Cold & Flu Center
While you may have heard some of these rumors since childhood , they are n't all things you really need to worry about .
But some are useful to keep in mind .
Fact or Myth ?
If you get the flu vaccine too early in the year , your protection will wear off before flu season ends .
Answer : Myth
Some physicians already have their first flu vaccine shipments in , so people who believe this myth may be holding out when they do n't need to .
The flu vaccine -- once understocked and reserved for the people most at risk -- is now readily available and recommended for everyone , so some doctors receive their shipments as early as August .
" I have now heard , this season , several times already , a concerned expressed that you can get vaccinated too early -- that you should wait until November because your protection may not last through February , " when you are statistically most likely to get the flu , said Dr. William Schaffner , chairman of the department of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt Medical School .
But the vaccine lasts for at least a year , he said .
Schaffner said he has heard this expressed more among older patients .
While he said that the flu vaccine may not respond or provoke as good a protection in those patients , it 's not foreshortened .
" You can get vaccinated right now , and your protection will persist , " he said .
Fact or Myth ?
You can catch the flu from a flu shot .
Answer : Myth
" That 's the biggest myth , that 's really huge .
And it inhibits many people from thinking about getting their influenza injection , " said Schaffner .
The idea rises from the popular misconception that the flu vaccine shot is a weakened form of the flu virus .
The flu vaccine contains components of the flu virus but not a complete virus .
" There 's no way that the shot can give you a complete influenza virus that can then make you ill , " Schaffner said .
The reason many might believe that the vaccine can cause the flu , said Schaffner , is that people tend to get the flu vaccine in October or November , and then catch a cold from someone else .
Since the viruses that cause cold are contagious 24 hours before the symptoms appear , someone who had a flu shot and then caught a cold might believe he or she has the flu and can't think of another source because the person whom they got it from did n't appear sick .
Of course , in recent years , another form of the flu vaccine -- a nasal spray known as FluMist -- has also become popular .
The nasal spray , Schaffner explains , is a " tamed virus . "
In this case , it has been engineered to multiply in the nose , but it can't get down into the rest of the body because the rest of the body is a degree or two warmer than the nose , and the virus is incapable of multiplying at that higher temperature .
" It 's a miracle of modern science , " he said .
However , the nasal spray form of the flu vaccine may leave someone symptomatic for a day with a runny nose and a sore throat .
" That 's a small price to pay , in my opinion , " said Schaffner .
Fact or Myth ?
Stress increases your chances of getting a cold or the flu .
Answer : Undetermined
" This is a very good question and a question we do n't know all the answers to , " said Dr. Erica Brownfield , an associate professor of medicine at Emory University School of Medicine .
But while medicine may not be able to tell us if stress increases the risk of catching a cold or the flu , stress can make either of those conditions worse once you have it .
" What we do know is that those people who are under chronic stress are probably more likely to develop complications from a cold or the flu , " said Brownfield .
While people may need to relax once they 're sick , the anxiety of putting yourself at higher risk is n't worth adding to an already stressful lifestyle .
" For those individuals who have acute stress in their life , they should n't be concerned about developing more colds and flu under typical circumstances , " said Brownfield .
Fact or Myth ?
Lingering in wet clothes , going outside in cold weather with wet hair or just being cold can increase your chances of getting a cold .
Answer : Myth
" No , being out in the cold or being cold or having wet clothes does not increase your chance of having a cold or the flu , " said Dr. Jon Abramson , chairman of the department of pediatrics at Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center .
" This is one of the myths that do exist both about the common cold or the flu , and clearly from a lot of studies this is not the case . "
Since this myth persists , the likely reason behind it is the rise in cases once the temperature drops in the United States .
" It is true , however , [ that ] the flu virus circulates mainly in the fall and the wintertime , and that therefore , you do see a lot more flu during that time than the rest of the year in temperate countries , such as the United States , " said Abramson .
While the viruses are more common during these times of the year , the consensus among physicians seems to be that this is caused by people staying indoors to avoid the cold -- not from the cold itself .
Fact or Myth ?
Flying on an airplane will increase your risk of catching a cold or the flu .
Answer : Fact
Riding on an airplane may increase your flu risk , but it 's not clear if it makes it any higher than do other crowded areas .
" I think anytime that you are in a crowd of people , the risk that you might catch a cold or catch the flu is increased .
We tend to catch these illnesses from other people .
And so when you 're in a crowd , the likelihood that you 'll come in contact with somebody who 's infected naturally goes up , " said Dr. Ronald Turner , a pediatrician at the University of Virginia School of Medicine .
Flu risk may be particularly elevated in these situations , because it is spread by germs in the air .
" Influenza ... is spread by aerosols , which is when the virus gets into the air .
And so , when you 're in a crowd with somebody who has influenza , your risk of catching influenza does go up , " Turner said .
Your greatest cold risk may not be from strangers in a crowd but from little ones close to you .
" The types of interactions that are associated with colds are more typically the types of interactions that we have with children , where the interaction is more direct and maybe less guarded .
And those situations are the situations in which you 're most likely to catch a cold , " said Turner .
Fact or Myth ?
Echinacea or zinc can help prevent or shorten the length of a cold .
Answer : Probably a Myth
Both zinc and echinacea have had a number of studies done on them , and neither has been shown conclusively to help battle colds .
" There have been a number of studies of echinacea .
Some have purported to show some modest benefit .
However , I think the weight of the evidence is that echinacea has no benefit , either on incidence of illness or severity of illness , " said Turner .
He said the results for zinc have been similarly ambiguous .
" There are a number of studies that have been done looking at the effect of zinc , primarily on the severity of illness and duration of illness , " said Turner .
" Those studies have been split really between studies that show fairly dramatic effects and then an equal number of studies at least that show very little or no effect . "
While the evidence is not entirely conclusive , Turner said , he would n't be rushing out to get his hands on some zinc .
" I think it 's a little hard to know exactly what the final answer is on zinc right now , although , in my opinion , I suspect that it does n't have a whole lot of impact on common cold illness , " he said .
Fact or Myth ?
Putting on extra clothing or covering yourself in blankets can help you " sweat out " a cold .
Answer : Myth
Frustration with an illness we can't cure may lead to these attempts , explained Dr. Lisa Bernstein , an assistant professor of medicine at Emory University .
" Unfortunately we have n't gotten smart enough in modern medicine to cure the common cold , so a lot of people are looking for their own way to do so .
One of those is to possibly cover yourself with blankets and try to sweat out a cold . "
But trying to sweat out a cold wo n't accomplish much , she said .
" Unfortunately , that 's not going to do it .
The cold is caused by over 200 viruses , and it just takes its time up to several days to several weeks for your cold to get out of your system . "
However , feeling better may be just as important as getting better , Bernstein said , especially with an illness that takes time to get over .
" Do whatever makes you feel better -- whether it 's putting more blankets on if you feel a chill , drinking warm liquids , or taking over - the - counter medication .
It 's just going to take time , " she said .
Fact or Myth ?
" Feed a cold , starve a fever . "
Or " Starve a cold , feed a fever . "
Answer : Myth
Regardless of which version you 've heard , you wo n't be hearing either from your doctor .
" That 's a very common old wives tale to say feed a cold and starve a fever .
Unfortunately you really should n't do the extreme of either when you 're treating a cold or the flu , " said Bernstein .
Forcing yourself to eat wo n't accomplish much , she said .
" Oftentimes when we get a cold or the flu , we lose our appetites , and that 's very , very common .
It 's not important to force feed yourself in order to keep up with the cold . "
Instead , you should focus on drinking enough .
" It 's very important to stay hydrated when you have upper respiratory infection or a cold , and especially the flu , as well , because when you sweat a lot you 're going to lose a lot of moisture , " said Bernstein .
" If you can eat that 's wonderful because good nutrition will definitely help you get better faster as well .
But at least stay hydrated . "
Eating can help , but not when it 's forced .
" It 's important to drink lots of fluids and try to eat as much as possible and keep good nutrition when you are ill .
However , it 's absolutely not important to starve yourself or to overeat in order to treat either of these conditions , " said Bernstein .
Fact or Myth ?
Chicken soup , hot liquids or honey can help you feel better sooner if you have a cold .
Answer : Fact
" You might have heard from your mother or your grandmother in the past that chicken soup is the cure for the common cold , " said Bernstein .
While this tip goes at least as far back as the 12th century physician Maimonides ( who some historians believe heard it from his mother ) , there is now solid medical evidence behind a remedy that was once only thought of as merely a comfort food .
" Even Maimonides , years and years ago , said that chicken soup is a great medication as well as food .
But things like chicken soup , up until recently , were thought to only help by being a warm liquid that would soothe the nasal passages , keep the mucus flowing a little bit better and just make you feel better by eating something warm , " said Bernstein .
In 2000 , University of Nebraska researchers showed this old remedy had wider benefits .
" There was a study ... that showed that it does actually have an anti-inflammatory effect , mobilizing the neutrophils or the inflammatory cells and making them work a little bit better -- and also keeping the mucus in the nose moving so that the virus , which sits in the nose , would mobilize a little bit faster and , maybe , potentially , get you better faster , " explained Bernstein .
The evidence is n't quite as clear on other home food remedies , however .
" Things like warm tea or honey or other foods , however , have not been shown medically to help .
Although they might make you feel better just from their warmth and their soothing effect , " said Bernstein .
" So it 's important to just keep your nutrition up , keep hydrated , and if you like chicken soup , go right ahead . "
Fact or Myth ?
There is no way to reduce the duration of a cold or the flu .
Answer : Myth

" You have to get in to see the doctor within the first 48 hours , " he said .
