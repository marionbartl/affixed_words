For international investment expert Doug Casey , there�s more than a recession on the horizon � he recommends battening down now for the rough seas ahead ... with some special information about making sure your investments can weather the coming storms .
I believe in the existence of the business cycle .
That �s partly because almost everything in life is cyclical , which has been recognized at least since the tale about Joseph and the seven fat years and seven lean years .
The Austrian school of economic thinking explains why the business cycle keeps coming around and does so without relying on a soothsayer to interpret your dreams .
I urge you to read the appropriate chapters in either Crisis Investing for the Rest of the 90�s or Strategic Investing for a full explanation .
But , in a nutshell , government intervention in the economy � through taxes , regulation and , most importantly , currency inflation � causes distortions and misallocations of capital that must eventually be unwound .
The distortions degrade the general standard of living , and the economy goes into a recession ( call that an incomplete cleansing ) .
Or it goes into a depression � wherein the entire sickly structure comes unglued .
The last real depression took place in the 1930s .
The economy very nearly went over the edge again in the early �70s and again in the early � 80s .
Both times massive re-inflation of the currency papered the problems over ( but at a cost ) .
Meanwhile , most importantly , continuing technological innovation and increased savings ( motivated by the fear of bad times ) led to recovery .
Since then we�ve had 25 years of what Herman Kahn predicted would be � The Long Boom . �
Unfortunately , much , much more severe taxes , regulations , and inflation have caused much , much more severe distortions in the economy � especially over the last 15 years .
And the boom was financed largely by debt , which made everybody feel and act much wealthier than they really were .
It �s as though you borrowed a million dollars and spent it all on wine , song and high living .
For a while , you�d have a high standard of living and perhaps have a lot of fun .
But eventually , when you either paid the money back with interest or were forced into bankruptcy , your standard of living would take a painful drop .
The U.S. , in particular , has been living far above its means , burning up its own capital and trillions more borrowed from abroad .
This is n�t news to readers of International Speculator or even the intelligent layman who follows the news .
Oddly enough , there�s one glaringly obvious thing that is not in the news today at all .
That �s the fact that interest rates � nominal rates too , but especially �real , � after - inflation rates � are close to their lowest levels in history .
And in today�s extraordinarily risky environment , they �re artificially low .
This , and the reasons for it , should be headlines .
All over the world , but especially in the U.S. , currencies are being inflated radically ; M3 is rising at about 18 % per year .
Without exception , interest rates eventually reflect inflation .
Therefore interest rates are going to rise radically .
Governments are currently suppressing rates by lending money cheaply and promiscuously , to keep both borrowers and commercial lenders from going under .
But rates are soon going to explode �especially long - term rates .
My guess is that we�ll see at least the levels of the early � 80s , which would mean 15 % + for long - term Treasury bonds .
And I 'll say that �s coming within a couple or three years at the outside .
The government wants low rates , obviously , because low rates make it a lot easier for homeowners to pay their mortgages , among other things .
But they forget that low rates also discourage saving � which is the one thing that can actually bring down real rates .
Officialdom is between a rock and a hard place , and they 're choosing to inflate the currency , hoping to stave off an epidemic of bankruptcy among consumers who borrowed and among the financial institutions that did the lending .
The effort will fail and both groups will go bankrupt , simply because the whole society has been living above its means .
That will result in large - scale commercial bankruptcies and unemployment .
Higher interest rates will absolutely hammer the economy .
It seems to me a near certainty that we�re about to enter something I have long called � The Greater Depression . �
I suspect it will be inflationary ( in the direction of what Germany underwent in the early � 20s , or Zimbabwe today ) , rather than what the U.S. had in the �30s .
I should somehow trademark the term � Greater Depression , � except that I �m sure Boobus americanus would then blame me for it .
Here I�d like to pinpoint my prime candidate for the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire , since it almost seems America has been reading pages from their playbook since day one .
Many reasons have been evoked for the fall : moral turpitude , immigration , barbarian invasion , Christianity , lead pipes , etc. , etc .
My candidate is economic stagnation brought on by taxes , regulation and inflation .
I�d love to discuss that assertion in detail , but that �s not what this article is about .
What should you do ?
Reduce your standard of living now ( while the situation is still under control ) , greatly increase your savings ( in gold , which is real money ) and rig for greatly changed patterns of production , consumption , employment and business for a considerable time .
The hurricane that �s just starting to hit the economy will both trigger and worsen problems in other areas .
Starting with politics , because nearly everyone today believes the ridiculous notion that the government should guide the economy .

Previous Articles by Doug Casey
McCain ’s campaign unveiled a new 30 - second TV ad called “ Chicago Machine , ” drawing links between Obama and Bill Daley , the brother of Chicago Mayor Richard Daley ; Antoin “ Tony ” Rezko , a former Obama fundraiser and a top fundraiser and adviser for Blagojevich who was convicted on federal corruption charges in June ; Senate President Emil Jones , Obama ’s mentor in the state Senate ; and Blagojevich , whose administration is under myriad federal investigations .
But Monday , Republican presidential contender John McCain tried to link Obama to the embattled Blagojevich in an effort to tarnish the Democratic presidential contender by noting his connections to controversial Chicago politicians .
Last week , Illinois Democratic Gov. Rod Blagojevich warned home - state presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama was falling into a Republican trap by siding against the governor ’s rewrite of a state ethics reform bill .
It was a move that prompted critics to question whether Blagojevich was trying to place his own self importance above Obama .
You can see the commercial on The Swamp .
“ Barack Obama , ” an announcer intones , “ born of the corrupt Chicago political machine . ”
The ad quotes Obama saying , “ In terms of my toughness , look first of all , I come from Chicago . ”
Then the announcer continues :
“ His economic adviser , William Daley .
Lobbyist .
Mayor 's brother .
His money man , Tony Rezko .
Client .
Patron .
Convicted Felon .
His " political godfather . "
Emil Jones .
Under ethical cloud .
His governor , Rod Blagojevich .
A legacy of federal and state investigations .
With friends like that , Obama is not ready to lead . ”
During a conference call with reporters , Steve Schmidt , a top McCain strategist , said the TV ad was a “ real buy ” that would air nationally and “ will air across the depth and breadth of the battleground states . ”
Schmidt also belittled the media for not providing a “ symmetry ” to their probing of Obama ’s background compared to the scrubbing that the team of McCain and Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin has received .
Rick Davis , McCain ’s campaign manager , said the ad was “ some level of response ” to the increasing negative tenor of an Obama campaign that has labeled the Republicans ’ efforts as full of lies and distortions .
He also said the ad was an attempt to educate voters .
“ It focuses on the relationship between Barack Obama and some of his friends from Chicago - - Bill Daley , Tony Rezko , Emil Jones and the governor , ” Davis said .
“ It , I think , adequately points out that these people play important roles in his political future and past and should be subject to the same kind of scrutiny that Barack Obama has tried to promote on our side . ”
Asked what Obama ’s association was with Blagojevich , Schmidt said , “ they obviously have a close relationship , ” though the McCain aide never elaborated .
Obama , however , has never held what Springfield watchers could describe as a particularly close relationship with the governor .
As a presidential candidate , Obama went out of his way at the recent Democratic National Convention to feature potential third - term challengers to Blagojevich .
“ He ’s someone who is under investigation .
He comes out of a corrupt machine , ” Schmidt said of Blagojevich .
“ Sen .
Obama very directly has introduced the issue of associations in this campaign , ” he said .
“ I think ( Obama has been ) raising fundamentally , that you can tell something about people by the company they keep , and that ’s a debate we look forward to having over the next 43 days of the campaign as we focus on these questions and what it says about each man as the American people get ready to make their decision to who to elect to be the 44th president of the United States . ”
Republicans in Illinois have been pointing out the dysfunction that has exists in state government and politics under Democrats ’ one - party rule of the governor ’s office and the state legislature .
But Obama ’s links to Blagojevich are tenuous , at best .
Obama last week made a phone call to Jones , Blagojevich ’s biggest legislative ally , asking for an expedited vote to override Blagojevich ’s changes to a state ethics bill aimed at curbing pay - to - play politics and putting the brakes on the governor ’s aggressive fundraising .
The bill is expected to be considered Monday and Blagojevich ’s changes were largely viewed by opponents as an attempt by the governor to kill the original measure .
Bill Burton , Obama ’s spokesman , called the new ad a “ false , gratuitous attack ” mounted on the same day that reports circulated that Rick Davis , McCain ’s campaign manager , had previously been paid $ 2 million to lobby against tighter regulation of housing giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
“ Barack Obama was elected to the Illinois Senate as an independent Democrat , ” Burton said .
“ He took on the Chicago Democratic organization in a primary to win a seat in the U.S. Senate .
And in both Illinois and Washington , he has challenged the old guard for landmark ethics reforms . ”
Obama did win a heavily contested Democratic primary in 2004 to win the U.S. Senate seat , but taking on the “ Chicago Democratic organization ” as Burton asserts is pretty strong language .
Mayor Richard Daley provided no public support for Obama in a crowded field and another mayoral brother , John Daley , a Cook County commissioner and head of the county board ’s powerful finance committee , backed Comptroller Dan Hynes in the race .
Hynes is the son of former Cook County assessor and ex-Senate President Tom Hynes .

Writing a Package
Its intents are :
To shorten the time needed to set up everything before starting the real work , in other words the boiler - plate code
To provide a standardized way to write packages
To ease the use of a test - driven development approach
To facilitate the releasing process
It is organized in the following four parts :
A common pattern for all packages that describes the similarities between all Python packages , and how distutils and setuptools play a central role
How generative programming ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_programming) can help this through the template - based approach
The package template creation , where everything needed to work is set
Setting up a development cycle
A Common Pattern for All Packages
The easiest way to organize the code of an application is to split it into several packages using eggs .
This makes the code simpler , and easier to understand , maintain , and change .
It also maximizes the reusability of each package .
They act like components .
Applications for a given company can have a set of eggs glued together with a master egg .
Therefore , all packages can be built using egg structures .
This section presents how a namespaced package is organized , released , and distributed to the world through distutils and setuptools .
Writing an egg is done by layering the code in a nested folder that provides a common prefix namespace .
For instance , for the Acme company , the common namespace can be acme .
The result is a namespaced package .
For example , a package whose code relates to SQL can be called acme.sql .
The best way to work with such a package is to create an acme.sql folder that contains the acme and then the sql folder :
setup.py , the Script That Controls Everything
The root folder contains a setup.py script , which defines all metadata as described in the distutils module , combined as arguments in a call to the standard setup function .
This function was extended by the third - party library setuptools that provides most of the egg infrastructure .
The boundary between distutils and setuptools is getting fuzzy , and they might merge one day .
Therefore , the minimum content for this file is :
from setuptools import setup
setup( name='acme.sql ' )
name gives the full name of the egg .
From there , the script provides several commands that can be listed with the - help - commands option .
$ python setup.py -- help - commands
Standard commands :
build build everything needed to install
...
install install everything from build directory
sdist create a source distribution
register register the distribution
bdist create a built ( binary ) distribution
Extra commands :
develop install package in ' development mode '
...
test run unit tests after in - place build
alias define a shortcut
bdist_egg create an " egg " distribution
The most important commands are the ones left in the preceding listing .
Standard commands are the built - in commands provided by distutils , whereas Extra commands are the ones created by third - party packages such as setuptools or any other package that defines and registers a new command .
sdist
The sdist command is the simplest command available .
It creates a release tree where everything needed to run the package is copied .
This tree is then archived in one or many archived files ( often , it just creates one tar ball ) .
The archive is basically a copy of the source tree .
This command is the easiest way to distribute a package from the target system independently .
It creates a dist folder with the archives in it that can be distributed .
To be able to use it , an extra argument has to be passed to setup to provide a version number .
If you do n’t give it a version value , it will use version = 0.0.0 :
from setuptools import setup
setup( name='acme.sql ' , version = ' 0.1.1 '
This number is useful to upgrade an installation .
Every time a package is released , the number is raised so that the target system knows it has changed .
Let ’s run the sdist command with this extra argument :
$ python setup.py sdist
running sdist
...
creating dist
tar - cf dist / acme.sql-0.1.1.tar acme.sql-0.1.1
gzip - f9 dist/acme.sql-0.1.1.tar
removing ' acme.sql-0.1.1 ' ( and everything under it )
$ ls dist /
acme.sql-0.1.1.tar.gz
Under Windows , the archive will be a ZIP file .
The version is used to mark the name of the archive , which can be distributed and installed on any system having Python .
In the sdist distribution , if the package contains C libraries or extensions , the target system is responsible for compiling them .
This is very common for Linux - based systems or Mac OS because they commonly provide a compiler .
But it is less usual to have it under Windows .
That ’s why a package should always be distributed with a pre-built distribution as well , when it is intended to run under several platforms .
The MANIFEST .in File
When building a distribution with sdist , distutils browse the package directory looking for files to include in the archive .
distutils will include :
All Python source files implied by the py_modules , packages , and scripts option
All C source files listed in the ext_modules option
Files that match the glob pattern test / test *.
py
README , README.txt , setup.py , and setup.cfg files
Besides , if your package is under Subversion or CVS , sdist will browse folders such as .svn to look for files to include . sdist builds a MANIFEST file that lists all files and includes them into the archive .
Let ’s say you are not using these version control systems , and need to include more files .
Now , you can define a template called MANIFEST .
in in the same directory as that of setup.py for the MANIFEST file , where you indicate to sdist which files to include .
This template defines one inclusion or exclusion rule per line , for example :
include HISTORY.txt
include README.txt
include CHANGES.txt
include CONTRIBUTORS.txt
include LICENSE
recursive - include *.txt *.py
The full list of commands is available at http://docs.python.org/dist/sdist-cmd.html#sdist-cmd.
build and bdist
To be able to distribute a pre-built distribution , distutils provide the build command , which compiles the package in four steps :
build_py : Builds pure Python modules by byte - compiling them and copying them into the build folder .
build_clib : Builds C libraries , when the package contains any , using Python compiler and creating a static library in the build folder .
build_ext : Builds C extensions and puts the result in the build folder like build_clib .
build_scripts : Builds the modules that are marked as scripts .
It also changes the interpreter path when the first line was set ( !# ) and fixes the file mode so that it is executable .
Each of these steps is a command that can be called independently .
The result of the compilation process is a build folder that contains everything needed for the package to be installed .
There ’s no cross -compiler option yet in the distutils package .
This means that the result of the command is always specific to the system it was build on .
Some people have recently proposed patches in the Python tracker to make distutils able to cross -compile the C parts .
So this feature might be available in the future .
When some C extensions have to be created , the build process uses the system compiler and the Python header file ( Python.h ) .
This include file is available from the time Python was built from the sources .
For a packaged distribution , an extra package called python - dev often contains it , and has to be installed as well .
The C compiler used is the system compiler .
For Linux - based system or Mac OS X , this would be gcc .
For Windows , Microsoft Visual C++ can be used ( there ’s a free command - line version available ) and the open - source project MinGW as well .
This can be configured in distutils .
The build command is used by the bdist command to build a binary distribution .
It calls build and all dependent commands , and then creates an archive in the same was as sdist does .
Let ’s create a binary distribution for acme.sql under Mac OS X :
$ python setup.py bdist
running bdist
running bdist_dumb
running build
...
running install_scripts
tar - cf dist/ acme.sql-0.1.1.macosx-10.3-fat.tar .
gzip -f9 acme.sql-0.1.1.macosx-10.3-fat.tar
removing ' build/bdist.macosx-10.3-fat/dumb ' ( and everything under it )
$ ls dist /
acme.sql-0.1.1.macosx-10.3-fat.tar.gz acme.sql-0.1.1.tar.gz
Notice that the newly created archive ’s name contains the name of the system and the distribution it was built under ( Mac OS X 10.3 ) .
The same command called under Windows will create a specific distribution archive :
C:acme.sql > python.exe setup.py bdist
...
C:acme.sql > dir dist
25/02/2008 08:18 .
25/02/2008 08:18 ..
25/02/2008 08:24 16 055 acme.sql-0.1.win32.zip
1 File(s ) 16 055 bytes
2 Dir(s ) 22 239 752 192 bytes free
If a package contains C code , apart from a source distribution , it ’s important to release as many different binary distributions as possible .
At the very least , a Windows binary distribution is important for those who do n’t have a C compiler installed .
A binary release contains a tree that can be copied directly into the Python tree .
It mainly contains a folder that is copied into Python ’s site - packages folder .
bdist_egg
The bdist_egg command is an extra command provided by setuptools .
It basically creates a binary distribution like bdist , but with a tree comparable to the one found in the source distribution .
In other words , the archive can be downloaded , uncompressed , and used as it is by adding the folder to the Python search path ( sys.path ) .
These days , this distribution mode should be used instead of the bdist - generated one .
install
The install command installs the package into Python .
It will try to build the package if no previous build was made and then inject the result into the Python tree .
When a source distribution is provided , it can be uncompressed in a temporary folder and then installed with this command .
The install command will also install dependencies that are defined in the install_requires metadata .
This is done by looking at the packages in the Python Package Index ( PyPI ) .
For instance , to install pysqlite and SQLAlchemy together with acme.sql , the setup call can be changed to :
from setuptools import setup
setup( name='acme.sql ' , version = ' 0.1.1 ' ,
install_requires=[' pysqlite ' , ' SQLAlchemy ' ] )
When we run the command , both dependencies will be installed .
How to Uninstall a Package
The command to uninstall a previously installed package is missing in setup.py .
This feature was proposed earlier too .
This is not trivial at all because an installer might change files that are used by other elements of the system .
The best way would be to create a snapshot of all elements that are being changed , and a record of all files and directories created .
A record option exists in install to record all files that have been created in a text file :
$ python setup.py install -- record installation.txt
running install
...
writing list of installed files to ' installation .
txt '
This will not create any backup on any existing file , so removing the file mentioned might break the system .
There are platform - specific solutions to deal with this .
For example , distutils allow you to distribute the package as an RPM package .
But there ’s no universal way to handle it as yet .
The simplest way to remove a package at this time is to erase the files created , and then remove any reference in the easy - install . pth file that is located in the sitepackages folder .
develop
setuptools added a useful command to work with the package .
The develop command builds and installs the package in place , and then adds a simple link into the Python site - packages folder .
This allows the user to work with a local copy of the code , even though it ’s available within Python ’s site - packages folder .
All packages that are being created are linked with the develop command to the interpreter .
When a package is installed this way , it can be removed specifically with the -u option , unlike the regular install :
$ sudo python setup.py develop
running develop
...
Adding iw.recipe.fss 0.1.3dev-r7606 to easy - install.pth file
Installed / Users/repos/ingeniweb.sourceforge.net/iw.recipe.fss/trunk
Processing dependencies ...
$ sudo python setup.py develop -u
running develop
Removing
...
Removing iw.recipe.fss 0.1.3dev-r7606 from easy - install.pth file
Notice that a package installed with develop will always prevail over other versions of the same package installed .
test
Another useful command is test .
It provides a way to run all tests contained in the package .
It scans the folder and aggregates the test suites it finds .
The test runner tries to collect tests in the package but is quite limited .
A good practice is to hook an extended test runner such as zope.
testing or Nose that provides more options .
To hook Nose transparently to the test command , the test_suite metadata can be set to ‘ nose.collector ’ and Nose added in the test_requires list :
setup (
...
test_suite='nose.collector ' ,
test_requires =[' Nose ' ] ,
...
)
register and upload
To distribute a package to the world , two commands are available :
register :
This will upload all metadata to a server .
upload :
This will upload to the server all archives previously built in the dist folder .
The main PyPI server , previously named the Cheeseshop , is located at http://pypi.python.org/pypi and contains over 3000 packages from the community .
It is a default server used by the distutils package , and an initial call to the register command will generate a . pypirc file in your home directory .
Since the PyPI server authenticates people , when changes are made to a package , you will be asked to create a user over there .
This can also be done at the prompt :
$ python setup.py register
running register
...
We need to know who you are , so please choose either :
1. use your existing login ,
2. register as a new user ,
3. have the server generate a new password for you ( and email it to
you ) , or
4. quit
Your selection [ default 1 ] :
Now , a . pypirc file will appear in your home directory containing the user and password you have entered .
These will be used every time register or upload is called :
[ server - index ] username : tarek
password : secret
There is a bug on Windows with Python 2.4 and 2.5 .
The home directory is not found by distutils unless a HOME environment variable is added .
But , this has been fixed in 2.6 .
To add it , use the technique where we modify the PATH variable .
Then add a HOME variable for your user that points to the directory returned by os.path.expanduser (‘~’ ) .
When the download_url metadata or the url is specified , and is a valid URL , the PyPI server will make it available to the users on the project web page as well .
Using the upload command will make the archive directly available at PyPI , so the download_url can be omitted :
Distutils defines a Trove categorization ( see PEP 301 : http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0301/#distutils-trove-classification) to classify the packages , such as the one defined at Sourceforge .
The trove is a static list that can be found at http://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=list_classifiers, and that is augmented from time to time with a new entry .
Each line is composed of levels separated by “ : : ” :
...
Topic :: Terminals
Topic :: Terminals :: Serial
Topic :: Terminals :: Telnet
Topic :: Terminals :: Terminal Emulators / X Terminals
Topic :: Text Editors Topic :: Text Editors :: Documentation
Topic :: Text Editors :: Emacs
...
A package can be classified in several categories , which can be listed in the classifiers meta -data .
A GPL package that deals with low - level Python code ( for instance ) can use :
Programming Language :: Python
Topic :: Software Development :: Libraries :: Python Modules
License :: OSI Approved :: GNU General Public License ( GPL )
Python 2.6 . pypirc Format
The .pypirc file has evolved under Python 2.6 , so several users and their passwords can be managed along with several PyPI - like servers .
A Python 2.6 configuration file will look somewhat like this :
[ distutils]index- servers =
pypi
alternative - server
alternative - account - on - pypi
[ pypi] username : tarek
password : secret
[ alternative - server ] username : tarek
password : secret
repository : http://example.com/pypi
The register and upload commands can pick a server with the help of the -r option , using the repository full URL or the section name :
# upload to http://example.com/pypi
$ python setup.py sdist upload -r alternative - server
# registers with default account ( tarek at pypi )
$ python setup.py register
# registers to http://example.com
$ python setup.py register -r http://example.com/pypi
This feature allows interaction with servers other than PyPI .
When dealing with a lot of packages that are not to be published at PyPI , a good practice is to run your own PyPI - like server .
The Plone Software Center ( see http://plone.org/products/plonesoftwarecenter) can be used , for example , to deploy a web server that can interact with distutils upload and register commands .
Creating a New Command
distutils allows you to create new commands , as described in http://docs.python.org/dist/node84.html.
A new command can be registered with an entry point , which was introduced by setuptools as a simple way to define packages as plug-ins .
An entry point is a named link to a class or a function that is made available through some APIs in setuptools .
Any application can scan for all registered packages and use the linked code as a plug-in .
To link the new command , the entry_points metadata can be used in the setup call :
setup ( name = " my.command " ,
entry_points = " " "
[ distutils.commands ] my_command = my.command.module.Class
" " " )
All named links are gathered in named sections .
When distutils is loaded , it scans for links that were registered under distutils .
commands .
This mechanism is used by numerous Python applications that provide extensibility .
setup.py Usage Summary
There are three main actions to take with setup.py :
Build a package .
Install it , possibly in develop mode .
Register and upload it to PyPI .
Since all the commands can be combined in the same call , some typical usage patterns are :
# register the package with PyPI , creates a source and
# an egg distribution , then upload them
$ python setup.py register sdist bdist_egg upload
# installs it in - place , for development purpose
$ python setup.py develop
# installs it
$ python setup.py install
The alias Command
To make the command line work easily , a new command has been introduced by setuptools called alias .
In a file called setup.cfg , it creates an alias for a given combination of commands .
For instance , a release command can be created to perform all actions needed to upload a source and a binary distribution to PyPI :
$ python setup.py alias release register sdist bdist_egg upload
running alias
Writing setup.cfg
$ python setup.py release
...
Other Important Metadata
Besides the name and the version of the package being distributed , the most important arguments setup can receive are :
description : A few sentences to describe the package
long_description : A full description that can be in reStructuredText
keywords :
A list of keywords that define the package
author :
The author ’s name or organization
author_email :
The contact email address
url :
The URL of the project
license :
The license ( GPL , LGPL , and so on )
packages :
A list of all names in the package ; setuptools provides a small function called find_packages that calculates this
namespace_packages :
A list of namespaced packages
A completed setup.py file for acme.sql would be :
import os
from setuptools import setup , find_packages
version = ' 0.1.0 '
README = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__ ) , ' README.txt ')
long_description = open( README ) .read ( ) + ' nn '
setup( name='acme.sql ' ,
version=version ,
description= ( " A package that deals with SQL , "
" from ACME inc " ) ,
long_description=long_description ,
classifiers= [
" Programming Language :: Python " ,
(" Topic :: Software Development :: Libraries ::
" Python Modules " ) ,
] ,
keywords=' acme sql ' ,
author= ' Tarek ' ,
author_email= '[ email protected ] ' ,
url= ' http://ziade.org',
license= ' GPL ',
packages=find_packages ( ) ,
namespace_packages=[' acme ' ] ,
install_requires=[' pysqlite ' , ' SQLAchemy ' ] )

Crystalline Tower Office Building in Manhattan
BofA ’s new 2.1 million square foot , 54 story tower is being heralded as the world ’s greenest skyscraper .
This $ 1 billion glass , steel , and aluminum skyscraper will use significantly less water and energy , while providing a healthy indoor environment .
It features a passive solar design , the use of recycled and renewable materials , and work stations with individual climate controls .
Natural elements include the use of rain water and a green roof reduces energy use for heating and cooling .
A graywater system will reuse waste water from sinks to flush toilets .
A 4.6 megawatt cogeneration plant will generate heat and electricity .
First of all , it is the right thing to do for the planet , ” said Senior Vice President , John Saclarides , when asked about the greening of the BofA tower .
“ No. 2 is the corporate responsibility .
Bank of America is one of the leading corporations in the world , including profitability .
We feel it is our responsibility to set an example for others to follow and show it can be done .
This also causes the advancement of technologies used in green engineering . ”
This building will have lower operating costs compared to most due to the reduced use of energy and water .
The cogeneration plant for example has an estimated payback period of 10 years .
The PR value of the building however is priceless , as it serves as a global example of an eco-friendly design .
Green Banking Centers
Of the $ 20 billion for green initiative , $ 1.4 billion is earmarked for achieving LEED ( U.S. Green Building Council ’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design ) certification for all new office space and bank centers .
Located in Adelanto , California , BofA recently opened one of the most eco-friendly banks in the nation .
The roof is lined with 64 photovoltaic solar panels that generate 60 % of the bank ’s electricity .
20 % of the building is comprised of recycled materials .
All the insulation for example is made from old blue jeans and counters are made of wheat byproducts .
The bank will use 40 % less water than most due to a drip irrigation system , low - water landscaping and water efficient plumbing fixtures .
Saving Trees
BofA decreased paper used for internal operations by 32 % from 2000 to 2005 , as the customer base grew by 24 % .
This initiative saved over a billion sheets of paper and undoubtedly save money .
Their internal recycling program processes 30,000 tons of paper annually , saving roughly 200,000 trees every year .
Hybrid Vehicle Reimbursement
185,000 U.S. employees are eligible for a reimbursement of $ 3,000 for the purchase of a hybrid vehicle .
As of May , 2008 , nearly 2,000 workers had taken advantage of this unique offer .
“ This benefit began as a pilot in 2006 in L.A. , Boston and Charlotte and was so well received internally that last year we expanded it to all associates company - wide , ” says Senior Vice President of Media Relations Colleen Haggerty .
Credit Card Reduces Carbon Footprint
Partnering with Brighter Planet , BofA offers a Visa card that helps fund renewable energy projects .
By spending $ 1000 , one ton of carbon emissions are offset , which is the equivalent of taking a car off the road for 2,000 miles .
Funding Coal Creates Scrutiny
Despite all of these green initiatives , BofA has been boycotted by the Rainforest Action Network .
The group states that BofA spent 100 times more money on highly polluting projects than on cleaner alternatives in 2006 .
BofA has been the top funder of mountain top removal mining and a lead financial backer of new coal - fired power plants .
Coal is the leading contributor to climate change and is responsible for nearly one third of the United State ’s carbon emissions .
It is also the leading cause of mercury contamination and a top contributor to asthma , air pollution , and wildlife habitat destruction .
Mountain top removal mining is a highly invasive practice that involves clear cutting forests , using dynamite to remove up to 1000 feet of mountain top , and dumping it in a nearby valley .
This highly destructive practice has destroyed 1,200 miles of streams , flooded communities , and disrupted sources of drinking water .
Reclamation efforts are extremely difficult and many mining sites are left looking like the surface of the moon .
The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that 1 million acres in the Appalachian Mountains have been destroyed by this practice .
BofA has relationships with all of the top five producers of coal extracted by this method .
Funding Coal - Fired Power Plants
Despite the dark side of coal , there are plans for 150 coal - fired power plants in the United States and BofA ranks as a leading lender for these projects .
The bank was part of a lending syndicate that provided Duke Energy with $ 3.2 billion for constructing several new coal - fired power plants in Indiana and North Carolina .
With a lifespan of 50 years , these coal plants can have a major impact on climate change and public health for decades .
“ This new coal rush would add between 600 million and 1.1 billion tons of additional carbon dioxide emissions annually and negate nearly every other effort currently on the table to combat climate change , ” states the Rainforest Action Network .
“ Unlike the credit crisis , we ca n’t bail out a dead planet , ” said Rebecca Tarbotton , director of RAN ’s Global Finance Campaign .
“ Bank of America ’s reckless investments in new coal - fired power plants are locking in an outdated energy infrastructure that threatens our climate , our communities , and our economy . ”
The Carbon Principles however might change the way that many leading banks fund coal - fired power plants .
The Principles establish guidelines for banks to consider the risk factors of loans to power companies and were adopted by BofA .
The Principles take into consideration that the U.S. may eventually cap carbon emissions and that there may be a cost for them , thus factoring in future liabilities that may be incurred .
Although the Principles certainly help protect banks and can be in their best financial interests , it also has environmental benefits .
BofA did however fund Duke Energy in the same month that they signed the Carbon Principles , so it is unclear at this point the impact it will have on lending practices that involve coal .
Is BofA a Pale Green ?
Do the BofA ’s initiatives have enough teeth to green the bank or are they mostly just a greenwashing effort ?
Although they certainly excel in making their daily operations eco-friendly and by offering some innovative programs to employees and customers , does that outweigh their involvement with coal ?
As one activist said , “ Bank of America is watering the flowerpot while they help burn the whole house down . ”
This puts into perspective the scale and gravity of their practices that support coal .
Installed wind power grew by 45 % and the solar market grew by 67 % in 2007 .
There is no explanation for BofA to fund highly polluting projects 100 time more than cleaner alternatives during a time when cleaner alternative are so growing dramatically .
Unfortunately , it might take a cap and trade system to change these practices , which could have a huge financial impact on a bank that is so heavily involved in the coal industry .

GUANTANAMO BAY NAVAL BASE , Cuba ( CNN ) -- A U.S. military jury Wednesday convicted Osama bin Laden 's former driver of providing material support to al Qaeda , but cleared him of terrorism conspiracy charges .
Osama bin Laden 's ex-driver , Salim Hamdan , in an undated photo , faces a possible life sentence .
The same jury of six officers began deliberating Salim Hamdan 's sentence Wednesday afternoon .
Hamdan , who has been imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay since 2002 , faces a sentence of up to life in prison .
Hamdan was found guilty of being the terror leader 's bodyguard and driver , and of receiving weapons training and transporting and delivering arms .
However , jurors found Hamdan not guilty of conspiracy to aid a terror organization -- a charge alleging he conspired with others in carrying out al Qaeda attacks , including those of September 11 , 2001 .
To find Hamdan guilty of conspiracy , jurors would have needed to find that he had an intent to aid and plan attacks .
Hamdan 's attorney said the defendant cried as the verdict was read .
Both the Pentagon and White House said Hamdan received a fair trial .
" The full extent of the law and the facts were presented in the courtroom .
Hamdan is now considered a convicted war criminal and is no longer considered an enemy combatant , and will be held separately from the other detainees at Guantanamo because of his new status , " Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said .
Hamdan has been at Guantanamo since 2002 .
The trial began at Guantanamo on July 22 , and deliberations began Monday .
Watch as CNN's Jamie McIntyre explains the split verdict »
Prosecutors argued that Hamdan , who was picked up in southern Afghanistan in November 2001 , had become a member of al Qaeda in 1996 and conspired with the group on terrorist attacks .
They alleged that Hamdan overheard conversations about 9/11 and had other information that showed he was part of bin Laden 's inner circle .
However , the defense said Hamdan was a low - level driver who knew little about the workings of bin Laden 's al Qaeda network .
They said he worked for wages , not to wage attacks against the United States .
During the trial , a U.S. soldier who was present when Hamdan was captured originally said Hamdan was driving a car that had SA - 7 surface - to - air missiles intended for al Qaeda .
But on cross-examination , the soldier , identified only as Maj .
Smith , said he could not be sure Hamdan was the driver of one of the three vehicles carrying the missiles .
Hamdan pleaded not guilty at the start of the trial .
The trial is the first conducted under the Military Commissions Act , a law passed in 2006 after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against an earlier Bush administration plan for trying Guantanamo Bay detainees under military rules .
" We 're pleased that Salim Hamdan received a fair trial , " White House deputy press secretary Tony Fratto said .
" We look forward to other cases moving forward to trial . "
The presumptive GOP presidential nominee , Sen. John McCain , welcomed the verdict .
" This process of bringing terrorists to justice has been too long delayed , but I 'm encouraged that it is finally moving forward , " McCain said in a statement .
McCain took the opportunity to praise the use of military courts for the trials of suspected terrorists .
" Unlike Sen . [ Barack ] Obama , who voted against the [ Military Commissions Act ] and favors giving al Qaeda terrorists direct access to U.S. civilian courts to contest their detention , I recognize that we cannot treat dangerous terrorists captured on the battlefield as we would common criminals , " he said .
Obama , the Democrats ' presumptive presidential nominee , said the fact that the trial " took several years of legal challenges to secure a conviction for material support for terrorism underscores the dangerous flaws in the administration 's legal framework . "
" It 's time to better protect the American people and our values by bringing swift and sure justice to terrorists through our courts and our Uniform Code of Military Justice , " Obama said .
" And while it is important to convict anyone who provides material support for terrorism , it is long past time to capture or kill Osama bin Laden and the terrorists who murdered nearly 3,000 Americans . "
Carol Chodroff , the U.S. advocacy director for Human Rights Watch , was critical of the military trial system , saying there was too much secrecy related to evidence and testimony .
" The verdict ... I think was in in this case long before the jury went out to deliberate , " Chodroff said .
" That is that the military commission system at Guantanamo Bay is deeply flawed , that Mr. Hamdan could not and did not receive a fair trial . "
Others have complained that Hamdan , who has been at Guantanamo since 2002 , had to wait too many years before getting a trial .

The LA Times reports on a DEA raid at Organica Collective , a Culver City medical marijuana dispensary .
Gina Ferazzi's photos of the raid are wonderful .
My favorite is the one of a hipster - looking agent with a healthy soul - patch on his chin and a giant pistol on his belt .
The federal operation came on the same day an appellate court in San Diego ruled that federal law does not preempt the state 's law allowing the use of medical marijuana — a ruling touted by supporters of California 's medical marijuana law as a significant win .

Clyde Carey , 50 , of Marina del Rey was at the store Friday visiting a friend when agents burst in through the locked front door , he said .

" It was like , literally , an episode of " 24 , " when they bust in on a terrorist cell . "
Carey , who said he has multiple sclerosis and has been a dispensary customer since February , stood across the street near a Starbucks with about half a dozen people who had witnessed the raid , watching agents walk in and out .
He said DEA agents searched and cuffed the roughly 25 people inside the building , which also includes four upstairs rooms .
Then agents started searching the premises , removing computers , medicine and money , and using a steel cylinder battering ram to get into the upstairs bedrooms , Carey said .
The Wind Technician Boom is Here
July 31st , 2008 by Joshua S Hill
Looking for a job ?
Do n’t want to do much in the way of training ?
Want to help out the environment ?
You may be the perfect person to become a wind technician !
At least , that would definitely seem to be the way of things if the latest news is to be believed .
Apparently , community colleges in North Dakota , among other states , are beginning to train wind turbine technicians ; those who are trained in maintaining and repairing those giant wind turbines that make us all that lovely energy .
“ The demand ( for wind technicians ) is such that some ( colleges ) have been trying to keep companies away from the program because they want everybody to graduate first , ” said Christine Real de Azua , a spokeswoman for the American Wind Energy Association .
“ In some cases , students are being picked up after only a couple of months . ”
According to that same association , there are now more than 25,000 wind turbines out there , with nowhere near enough people to service them .
And apparently , the biggest challenge for the community colleges is getting their students to stay around for the whole course .
No , they do n’t get tired of it .
They get hired !
But beware if you choose the life of a wind technician .
It is n’t for everyone , says Dwaine Higgins , who recently graduated from a college training program in Iowa Lakes .
“ You never know what you may have to deal with , ” he said .
“ When you are 300 feet in the air , it is not always easy to get a hand from another person . ”
It comes as no surprise to many of us that new jobs are being created through the use of environmentally friendly processes .
And in a day and age where the unemployment rate is crashing through the roof , one would imagine – or at least hope – that such other trends will become evident as the months and years go by , and advances and steps forward are made .

Answers in Genesis — the group that runs the Creation Museum — is n’t on board with the other conservative Christian groups in supporting Sarah Palin as John McCain ‘s Vice Presidential nominee .
Why not ?
To quote Happy Jihad , AiG is “ undecided about whether or not Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin is scientifically illiterate enough to run America . ”
In other words , while she may not accept evolution , they do n’t know if she ’s a Young Earth Creationist .
And that ’s just unacceptable to them .
In 2006 , then - candidate Palin indicated in a TV debate that creation should be taught alongside evolution in the state ’s public schools , declaring that schools should “ teach both .
You know , do n’t be afraid of information .
Healthy debate is so important , and it ’s so valuable in our schools .
I am a proponent of teaching both . ” 3
Now , in stating this , she may have been advocating the teaching of scientific creationism , as opposed to biblical creationism4 ( the latter having been deemed unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in 19875 ) , but we do n’t really know .

After nearly eight years of voting in virtual lock step with President Bush on everything from tax cuts to torture , House Republicans decided on Monday to break ranks on the survival of the nation ’s financial system .
The rejected bailout bill that was on the floor after a weekend of hard negotiating was objectionable in many ways , but it was a Republican - generated bill and was improved from the administration ’s original version .
Sixty percent of House Democrats voted for the bill , enough to easily pass the measure if the Republicans had not decided to put on their display of pique and disarray .
The question now is whether the stock - market plunge that followed the House ’s failure to lead  and a renewed credit freeze  will be enough to get the 133 Republicans who voted against the measure to change their minds .
And , more important , whether the damage that the no vote has inflicted is readily reversible .
Republican no votes were rooted less in analysis or principle than in political posturing and ideological rigidity .
The House minority leader , John Boehner , conceded as much : “ While we were able to move the bill drastically to the right , it was n’t good enough for our members . ”

The Future of Freedom Foundation posted online today my article from the June issue of Freedom Daily .
TSA is an agency that never gets enough of what it deserves .
But it ’s fun to try anyhow .
FEDERAL ATTITUDE POLICE
by James Bovard
The Transportation Security Administration has created more gantlets at American airports than most travelers realize .
It has continually changed the rules for flying since it first deployed its 40,000 + army of screeners across the land .
Americans are at much greater risk of being arrested or fined in the airport for not kowtowing to federal agents .
The rise of the TSA vivifies how low contemporary Americans have fallen .
James Madison observed in The Federalist Papers , “ It will be of little avail to the people that the laws are made by men of their own choice if the laws be … so incoherent that they cannot be understood ; if they be repealed or revised before they are promulgated , or undergo such incessant changes that no man , who knows what the law is today , can guess what it will be tomorrow . ”
Today , “ law ” and regulations have become tools to force people to behave in ways government officials approve of , rather than a clear line that citizens can respect in order to live their lives in privacy and peace .
Government agencies now routinely covertly change their regulations .
The rule of law — the classical concept endorsed by the Massachusetts constitution of 1780 as a restraint on government power — has been replaced by the “ rule of memo , ” whereby federal officials on a whim create new rules to bind private citizens .
Americans of the Revolutionary era glorified the law because it was seen as a means to restrain government and to secure the rights of the citizens .
Nobel Laureate Friedrich
Hayek defined the rule of law in 1944 : “ Government in all its actions is bound by rules fixed and announced beforehand — rules which make it possible to foresee with fair certainty how the authority will use its coercive powers .
The rule of law aims to minimize discretionary power .
But the TSA maximizes its discretion to change the rules travelers must obey at any time . ”
Fining for fun
TSA agents are entitled to reverential treatment , regardless of how much damage they inflict on people ’s travel schedules or luggage .
The TSA slapped fines on almost 5,000 people in 2003 , yet never made any public announcement that people faced fines for violations .
There were no warnings and people who received a fine in the mail were never informed of their right to contest or appeal the fine .
TSA waited until early 2004 to announce the fine system , at which time the maximum fine was raised from $ 1,100 to $ 10,000 .
TSA agents at Baltimore - Washington International Airport confiscated a small steak knife from the briefcase of Susan Brown Campbell , a California lawyer .
After she received a $ 150 fine in the mail , she called TSA seeking information on how to challenge the fine .
A TSA lawyer phoned Campbell and , as she later stated , was “ very , very intimidating , ” warning “ that the penalty could be up to $ 10,000 . ”
Campbell was told she would have to travel back to Baltimore to contest the fine .
TSA punished Campbell ’s insolence by doubling her fine to $ 300 .
Travelers can be heavily fined for inadvertently possessing the same kind of object TSA now approves giving to first - class passengers during flights .
It ruled in September 2003 that airlines would be permitted to provide metal knives to first - class passengers at mealtime .
TSA spokeswoman Yolanda Clark said of a typical airline knife , “ Even though it ’s stainless steel , it has rounded edges and the chances of it actually being used to bring down an aircraft are probably minimal . ”
The metal knives given to first - class passengers may be potentially more dangerous than most items seized at TSA checkpoints .
But the agency has no plans to boost its seizure totals by launching raids on first - class cabins .
The fines are an extension of the power the feds awarded themselves in a February 2002 Federal Register notice , which announced that people could be arrested if they acted in a way that “ might distract or inhibit a screener from effectively performing his or her duties … .
A screener encountering such a situation must turn away from his or her normal duties to deal with the disruptive individual , which may affect the screening of other individuals . ”
Practically any comment or behavior that makes a TSA screener “ turn away ” from whatever he was doing can thus be a federal offense .
A thousand people were arrested in airports at TSA ’s behest in 2002 , and roughly 1,500 were arrested in 2003 .
( Many of those arrested were caught with firearms or bona fide dangerous weapons . )
Since the TSA is now intercepting 15,000 prohibited items a day from travelers , the new system of fines could raise enough money to pay for fancy new epaulets for every TSA agent ’s uniform .
TSA agents can fine Americans up to $ 1,500 for any alleged “ nonphysical interference ” at a TSA checkpoint .
There is no formal definition for this offense .
TSA spokeswoman Ann Davis said the offense included “ any nonphysical situation that in any way would interfere with the screener and his or her ability to continue to work or interfere with their ability to do their jobs . ”
This penalty would seem to be limited solely by the imagination or the malice of TSA agents .
TSA agents can slap fines on Americans based on “ attitude , ” which TSA classifies as one of the “ aggravating factors ” in determining financial punishments .
TSA has issued no guidance on the precise amount of obligatory groveling at airport checkpoints .
People who question TSA commands are probably far more likely to be fined .
The Wall Street Journal reported in 2005 that individual TSA airport “ federal security directors ” have sweeping discretion to impose penalties on travelers — or not .
The frequency of fines ranged from 300 per million passengers to zero per million passengers .
The Manchester , New Hampshire , airport had by far the highest rate of fines for travelers .
The airport ’s manager , Kevin Manger , complained , “ Far too much discretion has been given to the federal security directors . ”
Ann Davis explained why the 160 federal security directors had such varying policies : “ I ’m sure they and their regulatory staff have differing philosophical approaches . ”
But passengers hit with TSA fines are not facing a philosophical conundrum .
Instead , they are being hit by the Iron Fist of Uncle Sam .
It is not a philosophical dispute : it is an issue of arbitrary power and intimidation .
The TSA ’s system of fines is a travesty of the Administrative Procedures Act — which guarantees Americans due process rights in dealings with federal agencies .
Instead , TSA simply concocted a system of fines , failed to give people warning or notice , failed to define the key terms , failed to notify violators of their right to appeal .
And if people are unsatisfied with the TSA ’s “ justice ” — they must go through the Coast Guard ’s administrative law judge system to dispute the fee .
This guarantees years of delay and makes it far more difficult for an American citizen to let a jury of his peers in a federal courtroom decide the justice of the government ’s action .
Petty tyrants
The TSA has made little or no effort to control the attitude or arrogance of many of its own screeners .
In March 2004 , airline passengers filed almost 3,000 formal complaints with the federal government over the conduct of TSA screeners .
Hundreds of people complained about the rudeness of TSA screeners .
And yet , none of these complaints by taxpayers and citizens will result in a single attitude fine for a TSA employee .
( Air travelers filed four times more complaints against the TSA than against airlines . )
These fines have nothing to do with preventing terrorist attacks .
The 9/11 hijackers intensely studied American airport - security procedures .
Once the system of attitude fines becomes known , savvy hijackers will simply work around it — the same way that the hijackers learned how to bypass obstacles at airport checkpoints prior to the 9/11 attacks .
The TSA ’s attitude - fine regime may soon become far worse .
The TSA is unleashing a horde of “ behavior detection officers ” into airports , aiming to have 500 spread across the land by the end of this year .
The BDOs will be surveilling passengers for “ body language and facial cues … for signs of bad intentions . ”
The TSA ’s latest intrusion is based on an Israeli model .
McClatchy Newspapers reported last August that Jay M. Cohen , undersecretary of Homeland Security for Science and Technology , said in May that he wants to automate passenger screening by using videocams and computers to measure and analyze heart rate , respiration , body temperature and verbal responses as well as facial micro-expressions .
There is no word yet on whether the TSA will begin fining passengers who break into a sweat because of all the government nonsense they encounter at airports .
Attitude fines exemplify that TSA aims to rule airports by fear .
Anyone who is not properly docile can be treated as a public enemy .
The attitude fines illustrate how power has gone to the heads of TSA chiefs .
Amidst a surge of private and congressional complaints about TSA abuses , the TSA aspires to shut the American people up , once and for all .
Intimidating people is the same as protecting them , and exalting federal agents the same as protecting public safety , apparently .

Burnaby , BC - Photon Control Inc. is proud to announce the completion of its first series of fiber optic temperature sensors capable of accurately measuring extremely low temperatures in the cryogenic range 77 K or - 196C .
This is the lowest temperature range for existing commercial fiber optic sensing technologies and a significant advancement for Photon because it opens new , large original equipment manufacturer ( OEM ) markets .
" Expansion of the operating range of our Photon sensors to cryogenic temperature was driven by the need to measure low temperatures using non-electrical means for industrial applications including liquid natural gas ( LNG ) measurement as well as scientific applications such as temperature measurement of magneto - resonance imaging ( MRI ) and magneto - encephalographic ( MEG ) sensor coils , " says Ivan Melnyk , Photon 's Acting President and Chief Operating Officer .
" Photon 's development team has achieved another technological milestone , just a few short months after announcing significant advancement in high - temperature measurement , " comments Daryl James , Product Development Manager .
" We continue to push the limits of fiber optic sensing in all aspects - operating range , accuracy , and repeatability .
At the same time , our sensing solutions are the most cost - effective on the market .
This makes Photon 's sensors attractive for many volume applications where other technologies are considered prohibitively expensive and impractical . "
Photon 's advanced fiber optic sensing solutions will be demonstrated again at the Annual Meeting of the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine which will be held in Toronto May 3 - 9 , 2008 ( booth 114 ) and which will be attended by more than 5,000 leading MRI users from around the world .

Three weeks ago The Wall Street Journal kicked off a debate on how best to allocate scarce resources to solve the world 's problems .
Bjorn Lomborg offered a summary of the latest findings from his Copenhagen Consensus project , where he has enlisted some of the world 's top economists to address the issue .
Now we 're offering views on the subject from top political and business leaders .
How would you spend $ 10 billion of American resources ( either directly or through regulation ) over the next four years to help improve the state of the world ?
How would I spend a hypothetical $ 10 billion ?
I can't help noting , at the outset , that it 's not just a question of priorities .
It 's also a question of fiscal responsibility .
After all , President Bush managed to turn a projected $ 5.6 trillion budget surplus into a projected $ 4 trillion deficit in less than eight years .
So unless we 're willing to make some tough fiscal choices , the money we 're talking about will have to remain highly hypothetical .
But if I had the cash on hand , and had to choose from the list of worthy causes , I 'd focus on one issue : energy .
A dramatic investment in clean energy would be the most effective check on aggressive petroregimes from Moscow to Tehran .
It would be the best long - term solution to global warming .
And energy independence is the most effective step we can take for American families staggering under the burden of high gas prices .
That 's because the forces that have produced this summer 's record prices are not going away .
We are facing skyrocketing world demand for an ever - shrinking quantity of oil , and unless Congress figures out a way to amend the laws of supply and demand , that fundamental fact is not going to change .
This is a large - scale problem , and it 's going to take large - scale solutions .

Upgrading Ubuntu 8.04 to 8.10
I upgraded my 13 ″ MacBook and 24 ″ iMac from Ubuntu 8.04 to Ubuntu 8.10 ( still in beta ) this past week .
My favorite part of Ubuntu 8.10 : the tabbed file browser !
The upgrade to 8.10 is remarkably simple just open your terminal and type :
There should now be an “ Upgrade ” button in the Update Manager window .
Press it and let it run … the process was long , but painless .
On my 13 ″ MacBook everything upgraded well and it works better than before .
On my 24 ″ iMac I was pleasantly surprised to find its wireless internet now works ( it never did in Ubuntu 8.04 ) .
But the sound is now off and I cannot figure out how to get it working again .
I like dark themes , so I tried the new dark theme that came with 8.10 .
It works well , but I am really liking the Intrepid Ibex theme based on Willwill ’s mockup .
Here is a screenshot of my 24 ″ iMac and 23 ″ Cinema Display running Ubuntu 8.10 and willwill ’s dark theme .

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) --
Gold futures rose more than 5 % Monday to end above $ 900 an ounce for the first time in seven weeks , as a massive government plan to rescue the financial sector pressured the U.S. dollar , increasing the metal 's appeal as an alternative investment .
Gold for December delivery rose $ 44.30 , or 5.1 % , to close at $ 909 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange , ending above $ 900 for the fist time since Aug .
4 . Other precious metals also moved higher .
" The rally was sparked by a proposal that the government would create a massive reserve fund designed to soak up to $ 700 billion of mortgage instruments , " said Edward Meir , a commodities analyst at futures brokerage MF Global .
The Bush administration proposed a plan over the weekend that would allow the government to buy the bad debt of U.S. financial institutions for the next two years .
It gives the Treasury secretary authority to buy $ 700 billion in mortgage - related assets , and would raise the statutory limit on the national debt from $ 10.6 trillion to $ 11.3 trillion .
See full story .
The plan " has been largely dollar negative , " said James Hughes , analyst at CMC Markets , as a higher debt will endanger the dollar 's global position as a dominant currency .
The dollar was trading lower against the euro , the British pound and the Japanese yen .
The dollar index DXY , +0.07 % , a measure of the greenback against a trade - weighted basket of currencies , dropped 1.9 % .
A weakening greenback tends to push up dollar - denominated gold prices .
See Currencies .
" Commodity prices have risen quite sharply as the dollar has weakened , and we do not think that is a one - day rebound , " said Dennis Gartman , author of commodities newsletter the Gartman Letter .
The government 's plan is " inordinately inflationary and are highly supportive of commodity prices , " he added .
More government debt will also likely weigh on the price of government bonds .
Treasury prices fell by the most in two decades on Friday , as investors sold in anticipation of new supply coming on the market .
International investors may respond to the prospect of holding U.S. - denominated paper in the face of expanding supply by turning to assets such as gold and other commodities , analysts at Bank of New York Mellon said .
Indeed , most commodities moved higher Monday , with the benchmark crude - oil contract rallying more than $ 16 to close at $ 120.92 a barrel .
See Futures Movers .
The Reuters / Jefferies CRB Index CRB , - 1.01 % , a benchmark gauging the prices of major commodities , rose 3.9 % .
Gold had seen dramatic changes in prices last week .
The December contract surged $ 70 on Wednesday , the biggest daily gain in dollar terms .
But it slumped as much as 7.6 % on Friday , the biggest percentage loss in 25 years .
Gold ended the week up 13 % , the biggest weekly gain in nine years .
Some analysts said gold could rise further as its appeal as an investment safe haven will strengthen .
In other metals , December silver surged 7.8 % to $ 13.45 an ounce , October platinum rallied 7.5 % to $ 1,235.80 and December palladium surged 7.9 % to $ 255.75 an ounce .
Copper for December delivery added 2.6 % to $ 3.26 a pound .
In spot trading , the London gold fixing price 38099902 , used as a benchmark for gold for immediate delivery , stood at $ 889 an ounce Monday afternoon , up $ 20 from Friday afternoon .
On the equities side , the Amex Gold Bugs Index HUI , jumped 9.4 % to 354.13 points .
Yes , you read that right .
It really has gotten that absurd .
I just had coffee with fellow blogger and Anchorage talk radio phenom Shannyn Moore .
While we were fuming over the McCain hijacking of the Troopergate investigation , she got a call from MSNBC .
They asked if she ’d come on Keith Olbermann ’s show tonight to talk about ‘ the witch hunter ’ .
The witch hunter , aka Pastor Muthee , was the guest pastor from Kenya that appeared at Palin ’s church , The Wasilla Assembly of God , and “ prayed over ” Sarah to help her become governor .
Muthee began his life in ministry in Africa by hunting down a local woman named Mama Jane after proclaiming her a witch .
According to the Christian Science Monitor , six months of fervent prayer and research identified the source of the witchcraft as a local woman called Mama Jane , who ran a “ divination ” centre called the Emmanuel Clinic .
Her alleged involvement in fortune - telling and the fact that she lived near the site of a number of fatal car accidents led Pastor Muthee to publicly declare her a witch responsible for the town ’s ills , and order her to offer up her soul for salvation or leave Kiambu .
After Pastor Muthee declared Mama Jane a witch , the townspeople became suspicious and began to turn on her , demanding that she be stoned .
Public outrage eventually led the police to raid her home , where they fired gunshots , killing a pet python which they believed to be a demon .
After the witch hunting incident , Muthee founded the World Faith Church , also known as the “ Prayer Cave . ”
The Prayer cave has birthed more than 400 churches across Africa – in Kenya , Uganda , Tanzania , Sudan and Rwanda .
While Palin was mayor of Wasilla , Muthee came to speak at her church .
Here ’s what Sarah Palin has to say about the experience , captured on video taken in the church .
Keep in mind , this quote did n’t come from her long ago past .
This happened IN JUNE , 2008 … three months ago .
“ As I was mayor and Pastor Muthee was here and he was praying over me , and you know how he speaks and he ’s so bold .
And he was praying “ Lord make a way , Lord make a way . ”
“ And I ’m thinking , this guy ’s really bold , he does n’t even know what I ’m going to do , he does n’t know what my plans are .
And he ’s praying not “ oh Lord if it be your will may she become governor , ” no , he just prayed for it .
He said “ Lord make a way and let her do this next step .
And that ’s exactly what happened . ”
“ So , again , very very powerful , coming from this church . ”
Muthee has spoken at the Wasilla Assembly of God church no less than 10 times , including the time he prayed over then Mayor Sarah Palin , giving her the divine shortcut to governorship .
He did n’t ask questions .
He did n’t blink .
Now , he ’s coming back .
He is scheduled for multiple speaking engagements in Wasilla this week .
The official vision statement of Muthee ’s church ( taken directly from the website ) is …are you ready ?…
Touching lives for total community transformation , thereby taking cities and nations .
Taking cities and nations ?
Most of us would like our cities and nation to stay just where they are , thankyouverymuch .
When Shannyn was talking in a serious , businesslike way about coordinating with a major media outlet to discuss the ‘ witch hunter ’ , it struck me how absurd this is .
We both started to laugh so hard , we could n’t stop .
Our governor believes in the power of a guy who believes that demons live in pythons , and witches cause traffic accidents .
She believes that a Kenyan witch - hunter prayed her into office .
Ladies and Gentlemen , behold the Republican candidate for Vice President of the United States of America , and tell me what that says about the Presidential candidate who nominated her .
When you decide whether to laugh or cry , let me know .
Meanwhile , grab a beer , or some popcorn , and tune in to Keith Olbermann ’s show tonight , hear the conversation with Shannyn , and marvel at the frightening absurdity that we ’ve come to know as Sarah Palin .
Cold War warming up ?
Russia is considering arming its Baltic fleet with nuclear warheads for the first time since the cold war , the London - based Sunday Times has reported , quoting senior military sources .
The new Russian threat comes in response to the violent conflict in the Caucasus and a deal signed between the United States and Poland for a missile defense shield in Europe .
Poland agreed on Thursday to host elements of a US global anti-missile system after Washington agreed to boost Warsaw 's own air defenses .
Accusations US - Poland missile shield deal seen aimed at Russia Reuters Moscow 's envoy to NATO says missile defense system will not be deployed against Iran but rather against his country US - Poland missile shield deal seen aimed at Russia
According to the report , under the Russian plans nuclear warheads could be supplied to submarines , cruisers and fighter bombers of the Baltic fleet based in Kaliningrad , a Russian enclave between Poland and Lithuania .
A senior military source in Moscow admitted that the fleet had suffered from underfunding since the collapse of communism , but told The Sunday Times that “ that will change now . "
" In view of America ’s determination to set up a missile defense shield in Europe , the military is reviewing all its plans to give Washington an adequate response , ” said the source .
' Russia 's reaction is unfortunate '
According to the report , the proposal to bring back nuclear warheads was condemned by Kurt Volker , the US ambassador to Nato , who said he knew of the threat .
“ It is really unfortunate that Russia chooses to react by putting nuclear warheads in different places – if indeed it does that – when the rest of the world is not looking at some kind of old - fashioned superpower conflict , ” he said .
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said on Friday that Washington 's deal with Poland to shows the rocket shield is really directed against his country .
" This decision clearly demonstrates everything we have said recently , " Medvedev said when asked about the agreement at a joint news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in the Black Sea resort of Sochi .
A top Russian general said Friday that Poland 's agreement to accept a US missile interceptor base exposes the ex-communist nation to attack , possibly by nuclear weapons , the Interfax news agency reported .
The statement by General Anatoly Nogovitsyn was the strongest threat that Russia has issued against the plans to put missile defense elements in former Soviet satellite nations .
" Poland , by deploying ( the system ) is exposing itself to a strike — 100 % , " Nogovitsyn , the deputy chief of staff , was quoted as saying .
He added , in clear reference to the agreement , that Russia 's military doctrine sanctions the use of nuclear weapons " against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them . "
That would include elements of strategic deterrence systems , he said , according to Interfax .
The White House immediately said it supported Mr. Cox , who has said he would resign at the end of the Bush administration .
Mr. Cox said he had moved against short sellers and was doing all he could to stem the financial crisis .
“ Now is not the time for those of us in the trenches to be distracted by the ebb and flow of the current election campaign , ” Mr. Cox said in a statement released by the commission .
“ It is precisely the wrong moment for a change in leadership that inevitably would disrupt the work of the S.E.C. at just the wrong time . ”
Mr. Cox is a former White House aide to President Ronald Reagan and a former Republican congressman from California .
Some conservative columnists and commentators , including Robert Novak , supported him as a running mate for Mr. McCain .
Writing in The American Spectator earlier this year , Quin Hillyer said that conservatives would rally to a Cox selection and called him “ the best choice , bar none . ”
In recent weeks , Mr. Cox has also stepped up his criticism of short - sellers , particularly those who engage in “ naked ” short selling .
While short sellers are supposed to borrow shares before selling them , naked shorts do not borrow .
That saves the cost of borrowing , though the trader is still vulnerable to losses if the share price rises .
Opponents of short selling believe that it can force share prices down and destroy confidence in a company that might otherwise survive .
Regulators have long thought that the practice was crucial for efficient markets to function , but earlier this year the S.E.C. imposed temporary limits on short selling of some financial stocks .
Financial share prices rallied when those limits were announced but fell during the period in which the rule was in effect .
Share prices for many financial companies shot up Thursday afternoon after plunging the day before in the wake of the government decision to take control of the American International Group , a large insurance company , to prevent it from collapsing .
Financial shares were especially hard hit Wednesday , with Morgan Stanley plunging 24 percent , to $ 21.75 , and its chief executive , John J. Mack , blaming false rumors spread by short sellers .
On Thursday , Morgan Stanley regained part of that loss , rising 3.7 percent , to close at $ 22.55 .

The latest moves against short sellers began Wednesday .
In the morning , Mr. Cox announced new rules to prevent brokerage firms from selling a stock short if they previously had sold the stock short without having borrowed it .
That night , he said that he would propose more rules , to force large short sellers to disclose their positions .
At a moment of serious challenge , battered by two wars , ballooning debt , and a faltering economy , the United States appears to have lost its capacity to think clearly .
Consider what passes for national discussion on the matter of Iran .
The open question is whether the United States should or will attack Iran if it continues to reject American demands to give up uranium enrichment .
Ignore for the moment whether the United States has any legal or moral justification for attacking Iran .
Set aside the question whether Iran , as Secretary of Defense Robert Gates recently claimed in a speech at West Point , “ is hellbent on acquiring nuclear weapons . ”
Focus instead on purely practical questions .
By any standards Iran is a tough nut to crack : it is nearly three times the size of Texas , with a population of 70 million and a big income from oil which the world cannot afford to lose .
Iran is believed to have the ability to block the Straits of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf through which much of the world ’s oil must pass on its way to market .
Keep in mind that the rising price of oil already threatens the world ’s economy .
Iran also has a large army and deep ties to the population of Shiite coreligionists next door in Iraq .
The American military already has its hands full with a hard - to - manage war in Iraq , and is proposing to send additional combat brigades to deal with a growing insurgency in Afghanistan .
And yet with all these sound reasons for avoiding war with Iran , the United States for five years has repeatedly threatened it with military attack .
These threats have lately acquired a new edge .
President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney are the primary authors of these threats , but others join them in proclaiming that “ all options ” must remain “ on the table . ”
The option they wish to emphasize is the option of military attack .
The presidential candidates in the middle of this campaign year agree that Iran is a major security threat to the United States .
Senator Hillary Clinton in the last days of April threatened to “ totally obliterate ” Iran — presumably with nuclear weapons — if it attacked Israel .
Senator Barack Obama dismissed Clinton ’s threat as “ bluster ” in the familiar Bush style but agrees that Iran cannot be permitted to build nuclear weapons , and he too insists that a US attack on Iran is one of the options which must remain “ on the table . ”
The presumptive Republican candidate , John McCain , takes a position as unyielding as the President ’s : Iran must abandon nuclear enrichment , stop “ meddling ” in Iraq with support for Shiite militias , and stop its sponsorship of “ terrorism ” carried out by Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza .
Any of these threatening activities , in McCain ’s view , might justify a showdown with Iran .
Sometimes the President ’s threats are chillingly explicit .
In April the administration released details of the intelligence that explained an Israeli air strike last September on a large , blocklike building in which Syria , with the help …

Continuing with the theme of a prior blog entry , I want to discuss two practical ways to reuse code across multiple applications .
Suppose I have some general - purpose utility code that I find to be reusable in a number of programs that I ’m authoring .
Rather than cut-and - pasting the code into various programs ( which has all kinds of maintenance issues – if you are cut - and - pasting code within your projects , you are probably doing something wrong ! ) , there are two common techniques in Visual Studio for reusing code .
Code library projects , and solutions with multiple projects
Perhaps the commonest way to reuse code is to put it in a library .
An F# library project ( File > New Project ) :
is a project that compiles down to a DLL ( as you can see in the Output Window below ) :
So now I have a library that I can reference to access this functionality .
I can reference this functionality from a different program by creating a solution with multiple projects .
First , I create a new project for my app :
Next , I add an existing project to the solution :
and select the library project that I just created .
Now my solution contains two projects :
Note that the project is " by reference " – Visual Studio has n’t copied anything , the source code and the project file still have their same old location on disk , we are just referencing them from a different solution .
To make the library accessible to my application , I add a project reference by doing an ‘ Add Reference ’ on the app :
and selecting the ‘ Projects ’ tab to add a reference to the Library1 project :
I see the new reference appear in the solution explorer :
And now I can write code in my app that references code from the library , has working Intellisense , etc :
That ’s a project - to - project reference , and it ’s a common way to reuse code – I can reference Library1 from whatever other applications I write , in whatever language ( e.g .
I could just as well have referenced the F# library project from a new C# console application project ) using this technique .
Including individual source code files by reference using ‘ Add as Link ’
Another way to reuse source code is to recompile the same code into different applications .
I covered the mechanics of how to achieve this ( ‘ Add as Link ’ ) in a prior blog entry , check it out .
I can create a new F# Application project in a new solution , and ‘ Add as Link ’ a source code file from the Library 1 project , resulting in :
The little ‘ arrow ’ sub -glyph on the ‘ Module1.fs ’ icon shows that this is a linked file .
As a linked file , no copying has been done – the source file still just lives in a single place on disk ( under the Library1 folder ) , but that source file is going to get compiled into this project .
As a result , again I can reference that code from other code in the current application :
This ‘ code reuse ’ strategy is probably used less often than project - to - project references .
It has a number of disadvantages ( functionality often cannot simply be ‘ lifted out ’ of a project on a per - file basis – often the code in the file references other files in the project , or has dependencies on references ( ‘ add reference ’ ) from the original project ) , but does have some potential advantages as well ( the code is re-compiled directly into the referencing project , so with this strategy I just have a .EXE that contains everything , rather than a .EXE and a .DLL that the .EXE references ) .
So I ’ve demonstrated a couple ways to reuse code in Visual Studio without resorting to cut -and - paste .
Nothing too earth - shattering here , but I often find that people are blissfully ignorant of lots of useful Visual Studio features ( I count myself in this group – until I started working on the F# Visual Studio integration , there were tons of VS features I knew nothing about , despite using VS for years ) , so I hope this helps demo the mechanics of some features and suggests how you will use them in practice .
Next time
Whereas recent blog entries have discussed some pragmatics regarding the physical aspects and tooling aspects of structuring your code ( e.g. files and folders on disk , as well as VS projects and solutions ) , next time I hope to discuss how F# and functional programming affect the structure of actual source code that you write , compared to writing code with OO languages .
Just when the 20th century had reached a point where the concept of war seemed obsolete , things changed .
The last part of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century saw the re-emergence of violence as a means to achieve peace !
Hence , the words of wisdom in famous war quotes are so relevant .
This is a top 10 list of war quotes .

As the NYPD is caught in the controversy of a police officer apparently shoving a Critical Mass bicyclist to the ground for no reason , another disturbing video has surfaced showing a police officer beating a man repeatedly with a baton .
WNBC aired the footage which shows Brooklyn resident Michael Cephus being struck on Delancey Street in Manhattan earlier this month .
According to police , Cephus was allegedly drinking and had swung at police officers with an umbrella , hit two cops with his fists and had refused to be handcuffed . "
The tape shows police officer Maurice Harrington beat Cephus while another cop handcuffs him .
Cephus was charged with assault , criminal possession of a weapon ( the umbrella ) , menacing and resisting arrest .
However , Cephus denied drinking and the charges and told the station , " I would never strike an officer .
Why should I get beat up ?
Why should anybody get beat up ? "
And he said to the Post , " I was with some friends at a cookout .
I stepped out of the park to get some ice .
The officers told me I could n't return because they said I had alcohol .
I told them it was only ice .
They thought I was drunk and they just came at me .
They started swinging and hitting me with the batons . "
Harrington , who works out of the 52nd Precinct in the Bronx ( he was on the Lower East Side working a July 4th detail ) , was placed on modified duty .
The Patrolmen 's Benevolent Assocation 's Patrick Lynch said Harrington 's actions were necessary , " Partial video never tells the whole story .
That person was not only not complying but gripping in a death grip that baton .
That 's a danger to the police officer . "
John A. Junior Gotti Arrested on Racketeering and Conspiracy ( Photos )
, 61 , boss of the Gambino crime family , received a rather rude awakening earlier today when he was arrested at his upscale Oyster Bay Cove home in New York on charges of racketeering and murder conspiracy in three deaths .
The arrest by FBI agents took place at 5:00 a.m. eastern time .
The New York City mobster took over the reins of the Gambino crime family of Cosa Nostra after his father John Gotti received a life prison sentence in 1992 .
The patriarch of the family died of cancer in 2002 while behind bars .
Junior has been tried three times for racketeering and a plot to kidnap Guardian Angels founder Curtis Sliwa .
The 2005 and 2008 trials ended with hung juries and mistrials .
According to Seth Ginsberg , Junior Gotti's attorney , his client was brought to the Melville , NY office of the FBI and was being driven to Manhattan Federal Court on Tuesday , August 5th for a court appearance later this morning .
Michael Finnerty and David D'Artino , known associates of Gotti , were also in custody on charges that originated with the Tampa U.S. Attorneys office .
The charges are tied to their dealings with another Gambino member Ronald ' One Arm Ronnie ' Trucchio , who is currently serving a life sentence in the U.S. Penitentiary in Lewisburg , PA .
Before his arrest he ran the infamous crew known as the Ozark Park Boys based in Queens .
They were reportedly raking in $ 30 million a year in bookmaking and illegal gambling enterprises before being busted by the feds .
Junior Gotti was quoted as saying this about his father and growing up a Gotti :
" I know my father loved me , but I got to question how much , to put me with all these wolves .
This is the world you put your kid in ?
So much treachery ....
My father could n't have loved me , to push me into this life . "
Junior married Kimberly Albanese , daughter of Gambino crime family mobster Phillip Albanese in 1990 .
The have a two year old son Joseph .
Gotti's sister Victoria , wife of jailed mobster Carmine Agnello , starred in a A&E Network reality show Growing Up Gotti with her sons John , Carmine and Frank .
The show was canceled due to poor ratings .
A press conference is being planned in Tampa later today .

Scotland Leapfrogs Europe 's Wind Energy Industry
Announcing the new windfarm approval ahead of the World Renewable Energy Congress in Glasgow , First Minister Alex Salmond said the 152 - turbine Clyde windfarm near Abington in South Lanarkshire is " another step towards making Scotland the green energy capital of Europe . "
" The Clyde windfarm will represent a very important step in the development of renewable energy in Scotland and in meeting shared European targets , " Salmand said on Monday .
Clyde will be built in two phases , with commissioning of the first phase set for 2010 and completion of both phases scheduled for 2011 .
A new energy source will replace the old .

The Scottish government has set a target of supplying a third of Scotland 's electricity demand from renewable sources by 2011 and half by 2020 , said Salmond .
" Today 's announcement makes it virtually certain that the 2011 target will be met early and exceeded by the end of this Parliamentary term and represents a significant milestone on the way to achieving the 2020 target , " he said .
The Clyde windfarm application was submitted by Airtricity .
It became part of Scottish and Southern Energy 's development portfolio when the company acquired Airtricity in February 2008 .
The development is expected to require an investment of £ 600 million ( US $ 1.195 billion ) .
Scottish and Southern Energy , SSE , estimates that half of the total investment will be placed with Scottish companies .
SSE Chief Executive Ian Marchant said Monday , " Projects like Clyde are essential if Scotland and the UK are to have any hope of meeting legally - binding EU targets for renewable energy .
Scottish Ministers aim to make Scotland the green energy capital of Europe , and giving the Clyde wind farm consent is evidence of a willingness to take decisions which are consistent with that ambition . "
The windfarm will be built in clusters of turbines on either side of the M74 motorway in southern Scotland .
Clyde will have a total capacity of up to 548 megawatts of power , more than double the biggest windfarm currently operating in Europe - the Maranchon windfarm in Guadalajara , Spain , which has a generating capacity of 208 megawatts .
Another large windfarm is under construction in Scotland but it will not come close to the generating capacity of Clyde .
Whitelee , on Eaglesham Moor , south of Glasgow , will consist of 140 wind turbines with a total capacity of 322 megawatts once it is completed next summer .
It is expected to produce enough power for over 180,000 homes , more than two percent of the Scotland 's annual electricity needs , and will hold the title of largest windfarm in Europe until Clyde is completed in 2011 .
" Clyde is clearly going to be a major project , with significant economic opportunities for the local community , " said SSE 's Marchant .
During construction , the Clyde project is expected to create 200 jobs , with some 30 staffers employed when the windfarm is fully operational , he said .
Wind turbines already dot the Lanarkshire moors .

" Scotland has a clear , competitive advantage in developing clean , green energy sources such as wind , wave and tidal power , " said Salmand .
" We have put renewable energy at the heart of our vision of increasing sustainable , economic growth . "
Current installed renewables capacity in Scotland totals 2,800 megawatts , while installed nuclear generating capacity is 2,090 megawatts .
" Installed renewables capacity is already greater than nuclear capacity .
But this announcement demonstrates that we are only at the start of the renewables revolution in Scotland , " the first minister said .
" Combined with the crucial announcement of a new biomass plant in Fife on Friday , the Clyde declaration today makes this weekend one of the biggest advances ever in energy technology in Scotland , " Salmand said .
On Friday , the first minister visited the future site of the 45 megawatt combined heat and power biomass plant in Markinch , Glenrothes , where he met with representatives from energy supplier RWE npower Cogen and papermaker firm Tullis Russell .
The joint venture will be built and operated by npower Cogen , the cogeneration division of RWE npower , a UK developer of industrial combined heat and power , often called cogeneration .
It will provide Tullis Russell with steam and electricity , reducing the papermill 's emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide by around 250,000 metric tonnes each year .
Approval of the Clyde windfarm means that the total installed capacity of renewable power plants either built or consented and under construction will be 4.55 gigawatts - just 450 megawatts short of the five gigawatts needed to reach the Scottish government 's interim target of generating 31 percent of Scotland 's electricity demand from renewable sources by 2011 .
The Scottish Government 's Energy Consents
Unit is currently processing 37 renewable project applications - 28 wind farms , eight hydropower projects and one wave power project .
A friend serving in the Bush administration called Sunday to try to talk me out of my doubts about the $ 700 billion financial bailout the administration was asking Congress to approve .
I picked up the phone , and made the mistake of good - naturedly remarking , in my best imitation of Oliver Hardy , “ Well , this is a fine mess you ’ve gotten us into . ”
People who ’ve been working 18 - hour days trying to avert a meltdown are entitled to bristle at jocular comments from those of us not in public office .
So he bristled .
He then tried to persuade me that the only responsible course of action was to support the administration ’s request .
I ’m not convinced .
It ’s not that I do n’t believe the situation is dire .
It ’s not that I want to insist on some sort of ideological purity or free - market fastidiousness .
I will stipulate that this is an emergency , and is a time for pragmatic problem - solving , perhaps even for violating some cherished economic or political principles .
( What are cherished principles for but to be violated in emergencies ? )
And I acknowledge that there are serious people who think the situation too urgent and the day too late to allow for a real public and Congressional debate on what should be done .
But  based on conversations with economists , Wall Street types , businessmen and public officials 
I ’m doubtful that the only thing standing between us and a financial panic is for Congress to sign this week , on behalf of the American taxpayer , a $ 700 billion check over to the Treasury .
For many people today , perhaps most , humanism is tantamount to atheism .
The leading humanist organisations , which are atheistic , appear to have sealed the impression .
They have lobbied for humanism to be taught as an alternative to faith in schools , and have won .
Little wonder , then , that in religious circles , the H - word is almost a dirty word .
But if humanism makes believers feel uncomfortable , might it be because their institutions need to recover a human face ?
Consider , say , religious institutions ' attitude towards women and gay people - which is to say , the majority of human beings .
It is characterised by equivocation at best , and very often outright denunciation .
Or think of the concept of liberalism , another great humanist cause .
It finds a religious articulation with Elizabeth I and her refusal to make " windows into men 's souls " .
Her desire was to keep faith with human individuals , as God did when he made a covenant with the ancient people of Israel .
In short , it 's Biblical .
So why do so many contemporary religious leaders seem wary of being thought a liberal ?
In fact , perhaps contemporary humanism is actually a friend , only in the guise of a foe .
What is it calling believers to remember and revive ?
Well , consider the history .
Humanism was originally a religious movement that emerged in the late medieval period .
There was Averroes , the great scholar of Islamic humanism , who wrote such a masterful commentary on Aristotle that for centuries in Europe he was known simply as " The Commentator " .
Or there is Maimonides , the Jewish philosopher .
In his book , The Guide for the Perplexed , he argued that scientific and religious knowledge are intimately related , with advances in the former directly shaping the latter .
Moving into the Renaissance , the golden age for humanism , we encounter the Italian , Ficino .
An enormously influential translator of Plato , he followed the ancient Athenian in describing how human love moves from the physical to the spiritual and so towards the divine .
( Moreover , Ficino was not bothered by the fact that Plato thought of human love mostly in the guise of homosexual love . )
Or again : perhaps the greatest humanist scholar of the period was the devout Christian , Erasmus .
His book , Praise of Folly , pricked ecclesiastic pretensions with abandon .
He might also be called the father of Biblical criticism : he posed brave questions about the authorship of books in the New Testament as early as 1516 .
In the 20th century , humanism found new champions .
Dietrich Bonhoeffer , who was killed by the Nazis , argued that Christianity should reject supernaturalism and otherworldliness to become non-religious and secular .
He thought the modern world had come of age because it could be accountable to itself .
Alternatively , the Catholic theologian , Karl Rahner , championed humanist approaches to doctrine at the second Vatican council .
He wrote that when human beings are human in the fullest sense , they are " God 's existence in the world " .
It is hard to define humanism .
Throughout the 20th century there have really been humanisms - Marxist , pragmatist and existentialist varieties , alongside the atheistic and religious .
What they have in common is their anthropocentrism : the celebration of human science , human scholarship , human sentiments .
Surely , people of faith should not shy from them today but continue to embrace them ?
Philip Pullman has called on atheists to " not distort or misrepresent " religion .
They should look to the best in the tradition , as they look to the best in science and philosophy .
Well , people of faith need to respond to that challenge too , and keep their eyes focused on the best .
The word " humanism " captures much of that .
Mark Vernon is the author of Teach Yourself Humanism ( Hodder Education ) , with a foreword by Philip Pullman , published this month .

NASA Data Show Arctic Saw Fastest August Sea Ice Retreat on Record
Kathryn Hansen
NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center
Following a record - breaking season of arctic sea ice decline in 2007 , NASA scientists have kept a close watch on the 2008 melt season .
Although the melt season did not break the record for ice loss , NASA data are showing that for a four - week period in August 2008 , sea ice melted faster during that period than ever before .
Each year at the end of summer , sea ice in the Arctic melts to reach its annual minimum .
Ice that remains , or " perennial ice , " has survived from year to year and contains old , thick ice .
The area of arctic sea ice , including perennial and seasonal ice , has taken a hit in past years as melt has accelerated .
Researchers believe that if the rate of decline continues , all arctic sea ice could be gone within the century .
" I was not expecting that ice cover at the end of summer this year would be as bad as 2007 because winter ice cover was almost normal , " said Joey Comiso of NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. " We saw a lot of cooling in the Arctic that we believe was associated with La Niña .
Sea ice in Canada had recovered and even expanded in the Bering Sea and Baffin Bay .
Overall , sea ice recovered to almost average levels .
That was a good sign that this year might not be as bad as last year .
" The 2008 sea ice minimum was second to 2007 for the record - lowest extent of sea ice , according to a joint announcement Sept. 16 by NASA and the University of Colorado 's National Snow and Ice Data Center ( NSIDC ) in Boulder , Colo .
As of Sept. 12 , 2008 , the ice extent was 1.74 million square miles .
That 's 0.86 million square miles below the average minimum extent recorded from 1979 to 2000 , according to NSIDC .
Contributing to the near - record sea ice minimum in 2008 was a month - long period in the summer that saw the fastest - ever rate of seasonal retreat during that period .
From August 1 to August 31 , NASA data show that arctic sea ice extent declined at a rate of 32,700 square miles per day , compared to a rate of about 24,400 square miles per day in August 2007 .
Since measurements began , the arctic sea ice extent has declined at an average rate of 19,700 miles per day at the point when the extent reaches its annual minimum .
Observations of changes to sea ice over time are possible due to a 30 - year record of data from NASA and other agency satellites , including Nimbus - 7 , Aqua , Terra and the Ice , Cloud , and land Elevation Satellite ( ICESat ) .
Researchers say that the recent seasonal acceleration could be in part due to conditioning going on in the Arctic .
For example , research by Jennifer Kay of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder , Colo. , and colleagues reported this April in Geophysical Research Letters that reduced cloud cover in 2007 allowed more sunlight to reach Earth , contributing to a measureable amount of sea ice melt at the surface .
Reduced cloud cover also contributed to warmer ocean surface temperatures that led to melting of the ice from below .
" Based on what we 've learned over the last 30 years , we know that the perennial ice cover is now in trouble , " Comiso said .
" You need more than just one winter of cooling for the ice to recover to the average extent observed since the measurements began .
But the trend is going the other way .
A warming Arctic causes the surface water to get warmer , which delays the onset of freeze up in the winter and leads to a shorter period of ice growth .
Without the chance to thicken , sea ice becomes thinner and more vulnerable to continued melt . "

The following is an excerpt from a report posted by Cindy Sheehan at the San Francisco Bay Area Independent Media Center :
The most troubling thing happened , though , when I arrived back to my hotel .
We got back early because the altitude and sleeplessness were starting to take a toll on us .
We did not march after the rally , so we decided to rest before the next event at 7 pm .
As I walked toward my room , I noticed that the door was opened with the security bolt blocking the complete closing of the door .
I knew immediately that I had not left the door open , and I double checked to make sure it was the right room because , as a frequent traveler , I have been known to forget my room number , but it was the right room .
I was upset at first thinking that housekeeping had made a mistake and left my room open and I was worried that something might be missing .
So I walked into my room and bigger than life , there was a man standing by my desk holding the room phone with a screwdriver in his hand !
I immediately said ; “ What the hell are you doing ?
Are you putting a bug on my phone ? ”
He looked like he got caught with his hand in the cookie jar and stammered out : “ N–no , we are having problems with the phone . ”
I told him to get out of my room because my phone was fine and I called the front desk and the person at the front desk stammered something out about “ problems ” with some of the phones .
This room was reserved soon after we got to Denver last night because the room we had was inadequate for 3 people .
The room was reserved under my campaign manager ’s name with a CFC debit card .
By the time we left for the march , it could have very well been ascertained that I was the one in this room , and the room we did reserve could be bugged , also .
I am confident that that ’s what was happening when I walked in on the “ maintenance ” man and I am becoming more shocked every day with what the ruling class are capable of …. that ’s why …
My phones are in the room fridge .
Let them listen to refridgerator noise …

McCain likes to boast about his “ straight talk ” brand , claiming that he will answer difficult questions with straight answers , but it looks like this claim is just PR .
Candidates all hold conference calls with reporters , sometimes on a daily basis .
Conference calls are like press conferences , but held on the phone .
But it appears that McCain ’s campaign is only taking questions in these calls from friendly reporters .
What kind of straight talk is that ?
Reporters who have been less than flattering to McCain report that they are never called on to ask questions during the conference calls , and one even was asked to leave a call ( even though they had not asked a question ) .
The McCain campaign has been asked if they are screening reporters during the conference calls , but their response is disingenuous , and the campaign has yet to deny that they are doing it .
In contrast , the Obama campaign ( and even the now mothballed Clinton campaign ) strongly denied any screening of reporters .
In addition , a 61 - year - old librarian was arrested at a “ public ” McCain event in Denver because she had a sign that read “ McCain = Bush ” .
Recall that in 2005 , the White House had three activists expelled from an event in Denver , which seems to prove the librarian ’s point .
UPDATE : In his book , McCain wrote that :
I would henceforth accept every single request for an interview from any source , prominent or obscure , and answer every question as completely and straightforwardly as I could . …
It is a public relations strategy that I have followed to this day , and while it has gotten me in trouble from time to time , it has on the whole served both my interest and that of the public well .
Sigh .

tagged jruby and scalability .
Among my friends , it 's not a secret that I personally do n't like Java .
During my time at the university , I had to deal with it for some courses , but somehow nobody could convince me to really like the language .
With Ruby , it was the exact opposite -- I saw a few code examples , read some articles about it and I immediately started to like the language and its charming way of doing OO like I always wanted it to be .
When I discovered JRuby , I therefore did n't take it serious and overlooked its potential .
Today , I 'm starting to like JRuby .
Why ?
Because JRuby is actually pretty cool .
It runs code of my favorite language ( Ruby ) on a wide - spread and highly optimized platform ( the Java Virtual Machine , aka JVM ) .
You can use JRuby to run Ruby code without even knowing a single bit about Java -- but it runs on the JVM ( which has several advantages as stated below ) .
Java actually consists of two different parts .
On the one hand , there 's the Java compiler that reads programs written in the Java language and translates them to bytecode -- and on the other hand , there 's the Java Virtual Machine that executes bytecode .
But the JVM does n't only run Java programs -- actually there are several compilers that translate various programming languages into bytecode that runs on a JVM -- amongst them is JRuby which compiles my favorite programming language into bytecode for a JVM .
Interestingly , JRuby seems to have hard times getting accepted in the Ruby community .
Charles Nutter from the JRuby team recently told how he experienced hate and anger against JRuby in the Ruby community -- in contrary to the Python community , where Jython is very appreciated .
That 's kind of strange , since even Matz seems to like JRuby .
I have to admit that I also found JRuby uninteresting at first .
I did n't hate it , I just ( to quote Charles ) " ... found it interesting ... for Java developers " .
Today , I 'm starting to like JRuby , and here 's why :
JRuby advantages
JVM runtime optimization
The Java VM is a runtime environment that has been worked on for years now and can be considered very stable and mature .
It does pretty cool stuff to optimize the runtime execution of bytecode .
There are two execution modes :
In - client mode ( which is the default ) , the program startup time and memory usage is minimized ( which is good for a local application or an applet , since you usually want to bring it up fast if you start it ) .
The other mode - server optimizes for runtime speed ; an application takes more time to start up and needs more memory in this mode , but it runs slightly faster .
The JVM can even dynamically optimize the bytecode during runtime ( e.g. optimize inner loops ) .
Therefore , a server application becomes faster after a while , once the JVM has " warmed up " .
Compared to the original Ruby ( also called MRI ) , JRuby runs faster , but needs more memory .
Memory usage
The memory usage of a single instance of a Ruby application is higher in JRuby if compared to original Ruby .
However , this drawback disappears if you run multiple application instances ( like multiple mongrels on a production server ) .
JRuby can run multiple instances of an application in a single JVM ( e.g. with jrubysrv ) .
This way , memory can be shared between application instances so that e.g. the Rails framework is only kept in memory once .
I do n't have any practical experience with this topic , but JRuby is told to be more memory efficient especially when running many smaller applications on a single server .
Native Threads
JRuby has real native threads so you can easily spread work on multiple processor cores .
And with upcoming thread - safe Rails 2.2 , it'll greatly reduce the memory usage of a Rails application .
Garbage collection
The JVM is told to have a great garbage collection , making memory usage more efficient .
( However , I do n't have any experience on this topic yet ) .
JIT and AOT compilation
We all love open source software , but to be honest , sometimes there are situations in business where you cannot or do n't want to give out the source ( no , I do n't want to hide my bad coding style ... it 's just that most companies are n't happy with publishing sources ) .
Using ahead - of - time ( AOT ) compilation , an application can be compiled into bytecode and can therefore be shared without exposing the source .
Integration with Java libraries
From JRuby , you can use other Java libraries and vice - versa .
This one is mostly unimportant to me , since I do n't use / know Java libraries , but this feature probably is very attractive to Java programmers who want to switch to Ruby .
Running Rails applications on existing Java application servers
Using Warbler , a Rails application can easily be packed into a .
WAR file , which is the default archive format for a Java web application .
Warbler packs the Rails application , all required gems , the JRuby library and a little wrapper plus the required metadata into a .
WAR file .
This way , the resulting .
WAR file can be easily deployed to an existing application server infrastructure .
This compatibility certainly is attractive for people with existing java application servers .
Documentation and Specs
JRuby ( amongst others ) is told to bring the Ruby language a big step forward by helping to create a clear language documentation and language specs .
The language itself was told to be not so well documented and MRI 's release management is told to be kind of clumsy .
( more on this in the Google talk about Rails scalability ; again , I do n't have personal experiences here ) .
JRuby disadvantages
Nothing comes without a price -- so here are the JRuby disadvantages I found so far .
Larger memory footprint and startup time
A single JRuby instance needs more memory than a single Ruby instance , but in a typical production server environment with multiple mongrels , memory can be shared so that I expect a lower or at least equal memory usage in total .
JRuby 's startup time is higher than MRI , but once the JVM has " warmed up " after a few minutes , it usually runs faster than MRI .
No native C extension
Due to the nature of Java , it is impossible to run any native extension .
So there are several gems that do n't work since they rely on a C extension .
However , there 's ongoing effort to create alternative gems that are compatible to JRuby .
E.g. mongrel uses a native C extension , but if you install the mongrel gem using JRuby , it automatically installs a java - enhanced version .
JRuby is not technically complete
It 's told that there are cases where JRuby is not 100 % compatible with MRI , however , I think these are very special cases ; at least I did n't encounter any problems yet .
Big Frameworks like Rails are tested with JRuby , so I currently do n't expect any problems with it .
Conclusion
I 'm starting to like JRuby and I think I 'll use it in production for my next project to see myself how it works out .
However , for development , I currently still use MRI since the long startup time of JRuby is kind of annoying during development .
The L.I.R.R. has been successful under Ms. Williams in reducing overtime and some penalty payments , but eliminating those penalties is another matter .
“ We have not been successful in achieving that in collective bargaining , ” she said .
One penalty payment agreed to by management proved so embarrassing that the union was willing to give it up .
In the 1980s , workers who maintained the track corridors got an extra two hours of pay if it rained .
But because the agreement was poorly constructed , it opened the gates to abuse .
The intent was to pay extra for work performed in the rain , but workers got paid even if it rained going to or from the work site .
In one year , they got rain pay on 42 days when no rain fell , transportation authority investigators said in a 1989 report .
One union official was quoted as saying that workers deserved the supplement “ even if a bird flies over and urinates on them . ”
In one six - month period , rain pay cost the railroad $ 1.1 million .
“ Some of these things are ridiculous , ” said Gerard P. Bringmann , general chairman of the Long Island Rail Road Commuter Council .
“ It makes absolutely no sense .
Any company would go bankrupt that operates that way . ”
White - Collar Disabled
If L.I.R.R. managers had decided in years past to investigate disabilities , they would not have had to look very far ; most of them were retiring and getting disability payments , too .
Records show that in one recent three - year period , more than 60 white - collar managers retired and were classified as disabled .
Like union members , many managers can retire at age 50 or 55 with benefits .
One such retiree was Janet Lewis , a former director of government and community affairs .
Ms. Lewis declined to discuss the nature of her disability , saying it was a private matter .
Her husband , Michael J. Canino , is also retired on disability .
He is a former authority board member and chairman of the L.I.R.R. labor council , which represents all of the L.I.R.R. unions .

On a conference call with reporters on Monday morning , Rick Davis , John McCain ’s campaign manager , and Steve Schmidt , a top McCain strategist , were asked about a New York Times article reporting that Davis had been paid nearly $ 2 million for running a Washington outfit set up by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to stop stricter regulation of these two entities .
Davis said he had never engaged in any lobbying for that group and downplayed Fannie and Freddie ’s role in the organization .
He joked that he appreciated “ all the exposure I get ” in The New York Times .
He added that the newspaper must have “ Davis envy . ”
Schmidt then went bad - cop .
“ We ’re First Amendment absolutists , ” he said , noting journalists are free to “ write whatever they want to write . ”
But , he continued , “ whatever the New York Times once was , ” it is no longer a journalistic entity .
Schmidt called it a “ pro-Obama advocacy organization ” and claimed the paper “ attacks ” McCain every day .
Schmidt went on : the Times is “ an organization completely , totally 150 - percent in the tank for the Democratic candidate ” and has “ cast aside its journalistic integrity and tradition ” to get McCain .
It was a blistering slam .
And several times throughout the call , Schmidt chided the media for treating Obama more kindly than McCain .
( In recent weeks , many news outlets have scored McCain ’s ads as being full of falsehoods . )
Clearly , the candidate who once was beloved by the national media ( and who joked the press was his base ) has calculated that the old Republican play of bashing the media , especially The New York Times , will help him get elected .
Also , Schmidt might also have been trying to establish a context for judging any future Times investigations that might pose a problem for McCain .
( “ See ?
I told you they were out to destroy Senator McCain . ” )
By the way , neither Davis nor Schmidt pointed out one error in the Times ‘ story about Davis .

July 12 , 2008 --
The visit to Sydney for World Youth Day ( WYD ) , July 15 - 20 , by Pope Benedict XVI and 300,000 Catholic pilgrims is set to become the scene for protests .
Ironically , the protests are being fuelled by the clumsy efforts of the NSW state Labor Party government to suppress them — passing laws making it illegal to “ annoy ” pilgrims and defining “ annoy ” broadly enough to include having signs , or even wearing t- shirts , with messages that the doctrinally rigid pope or his followers disapprove of .
* * *
Sydney
Brisbane
* * *
Protesting against the “ thou shalt not annoy ” laws and in defence of free speech is important , as is opposing the state government ’s handout of $ 86 million of taxpayers ’ money for WYD to an extremely wealthy private organisation .
A more important reason to protest , though , is the pope ’s political agenda .
While the pope ’s reactionary utterances on homosexuality , euthanasia , contraception and abortion are generally portrayed as “ moral ” rather than political viewpoints , this distinction works to undermine democracy .
In 1997 , for example , a law was passed by federal parliament overturning the legalisation of euthanasia in the Northern Territory , despite 80 % of Australians supporting voluntary euthanasia .
Assisting the powerful
Furthermore , the pope , or Cardinal Josef Ratzinger as he was known before becoming “ infallible ” in 2005 , played an active role in the suppression of liberal and anti-imperialist currents within Catholicism in the 1980s and ’90s .
In 1981 , Ratzinger was appointed head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith ( the successor to the medieval inquisition ) by Pope John Paul II .
Ratzinger used the powers at his disposal — banning from teaching , sacking from the priesthood and excommunication from the Church — to silence those who opposed the drive to extinguish the modernising reforms introduced by the Second Vatican Council in 1965 .
The main targets of Ratzinger , described in an April 16 , 1999 article in the National Catholic Reporter as “ the Vatican ’s enforcer ” , were proponents of liberation theology — the doctrine that the place of the Church was with the poor .
In Latin America , liberation theology was an important current in opposition to US imperialism .
In El Salvador , pro-poor Archbishop Oscar Romero was gunned down by a pro-US death squad as he performed mass in 1980 , while in Nicaragua , priests served in the left - wing Sandinista government that came to power after the 1979 revolution against US - backed dictator Anastasio Somoza .
More importantly , Christian Base communities established by liberation theologists played an important role in empowering and mobilising the masses throughout Latin America .
The Vatican ’s suppression of liberation theology assisted in the maintenance of US hegemony over Latin America — although the influence of the doctrine can still be seen in the highly eclectic ideology of Venezuela ’s Bolivarian revolution .
The powerful reciprocate
The US has reciprocated by incorporating the puritan sexual politics of John Paul II and Benedict XVI into foreign aid policy .
This began in 1984 when then - president Ronald Reagan instituted the “ global gag ” rule , preventing US development aid going to any organisation that gave out any information on abortion .
This was rescinded by president Bill Clinton ’s administration but reinstated by President George Bush on the first day of his administration .
Bush expanded the policy to prevent any US aid going to organisations that do n’t condemn prostitution and restricting funding for HIV / AIDS prevention to institutions not promoting the abstinence model .
These policies help sabotage the fight against the HIV / AIDS epidemic .
Furthermore , serving mammon as well as God , the US has campaigned against the production of cheap , generic drugs and tied US aid to the buying of expensive brand - name drugs to boost the profits of multinational pharmaceutical corporations .
Western financial institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund even insist that poor countries producing generic drugs pay royalties to the patent - holding corporations .
At the end of 2007 , there were approximately 33.2 million people in the world with HIV / AIDS .
Over two thirds of these are in sub-Saharan Africa .
More than 25 million people have died of AIDS since 1981 — 2.1 million in 2007 .
Almost 70 % of people in the Third World who develop AIDS ( as opposed to being just HIV positive ) will die due to lack of drugs .

The number of unnecessary deaths due to US policies cannot be quantified .
However , while religious believers have a right to preach that premarital and extramarital sex are immoral ( and live their own lives accordingly ) , to claim , as both Bush and Benedict XVI do , that promoting premarital abstinence and marital fidelity is an effective way of combatting the spread of HIV , or any other sexually transmitted infections ( STIs ) , is a deadly lie .
In September 2007 , the New York Civil Liberties Union released a report on abstinence - until - marriage “ sex education ” programs in New York schools that , despite annual funding of more than US $ 14 million from state and federal governments , appeared to make no difference to adolescent sexual behaviour in terms of decreasing premarital sex , but left teenagers in New York with higher rates of HIV infection and unwanted pregnancies than in jurisdictions with medically accurate comprehensive sex-education programs .
The NYCLU report pointed to numerous inaccuracies and religious prejudices in the material used in the abstinence - based programs .
These ranged from the ridiculous ( that AIDS can be spread by French kissing ) to the dangerous : exaggerating the medical dangers of abortion and misleadingly suggesting that condoms were not effective in preventing pregnancy or the spread of STIs .
The material demonised homosexuality and reinforced gender roles : one program citing “ financial support ” as one of the “ five major needs of women ” and “ domestic support ” as one of the “ five major needs of men ” .
Good example undermined
The experience of Uganda , which until recently was one of the few success stories in combatting HIV / AIDS in Africa , graphically illustrates what does and does n’t work in HIV / AIDS prevention .
By the turn of the century the prevalence of AIDS had been reduced to a third of what it was in the early ’90s .
While the Ugandan strategy combined promoting abstinence and fidelity with mass distribution of condoms , the February 24 , 2005 San Francisco Chronicle reported that research in the Rakai district suggesting that abstinence and fidelity were actually declining in that region but , thanks to increased condom use , so was the HIV infection rate .
However , in 2003 , when Bush launched his $ 15 billion fund for combatting AIDS globally , the Ugandan experience was cited as an example of the effectiveness of the abstinence - based model .
In 2004 , Ugandan policy changed , with free condoms being recalled , allegedly for quality - control reasons , and condoms subsequently sold with a high sales tax imposed .
Sam Okware , a senior health ministry official and architect of Uganda ’s HIV / AIDS prevention strategy cited the financial imperatives imposed by Bush ’s fund as the reason for the policy change , the June 1 , 2006 Independent reported .
The results have been predictably tragic .
By 2005 , new HIV infections in Uganda had risen to 130,000 — up from 70,000 in 2002 .
The demand that US AIDS / HIV prevention funds only go to organisations that publicly condemn prostitution is equally disastrous given that sex workers are a high risk group , particularly if unable to access condoms .
“ How can we help the girls if we condemn them ? ” , Maurisia Ssebuggwawo , a volunteer midwife and health worker in a slum district of Kampala told the Independent .
In 2004 , Brazil rejected $ 40 million in already promised US funding when it was made clear that organisations receiving it would have to denounce prostitution .
Brazil ’s policies , among the most successful in the world , had involved working closely with high risk groups including sex workers and IV drug users , and had succeeded in limiting the number of HIV - positive Brazilians to half what had been predicted by epidemiologists .
Benedict XVI ’s host in Sydney , Cardinal George Pell , hails from the same conservative wing of the Catholic Church as Ratzinger .
Like the pope , he periodically makes inflammatory remarks attacking Muslims .
He shares the pope 's puratanical views on sexuality and has even described AIDS as a form of divine retribution against homosexuals .
However , this inflexibility on sexual morality does not apply to cases of priests sexually assaulting parishioners , including children .
Over the past week complaints about Pell ’s role in covering up sex abuse scandals have resurfaced .
In 2002 , at World Youth Day celebrations in Toronto , he explained his attitude : if someone from your parish asks you about the child abuse scandal within the Catholic Church , just tell them that abortion is a worse moral scandal .
Preaching intolerance , practicing hypocrisy and closely tied to the rulers of the world , the likes of Pope Benedict and Cardinal Pell deserve to be targets of protest .
Protest the unholy father
By Rachel Evans
July 12 , 2008 - Pope Benedict XVI is coming to town .
Sydney is once again to be subject to a special police regime as this saintly , celibate white man bravely preaches the joys of sexual abstinence in the very Circus Maximus of Sin City ( Randwick race course ) .
Pope Benedict is also the CEO of a very big company called the Catholic Church .
The third largest landowner in the world , if this company were incorporated it would be listed in Australia ’s top 10 .
So this pope is also loaded .
When George Bush , CEO of another very powerful institution , sauntered into Sydney last September , the NSW Labor government snapped to attention , creating massive exclusion zones , placing snipers on rooftops and bringing out the biggest toy in the Australian public order toy chest — the NSW police ’s $ 600,000 water cannon .
Here ’s an interesting conundrum involving nuclear decay rates .
We think that the decay rates of elements are constant regardless of the ambient conditions ( except in a few special cases where beta decay can be influenced by powerful electric fields ) .
So that makes it hard to explain the curious periodic variations in the decay rates of silicon - 32 and radium - 226 observed by groups at the Brookhaven National Labs in the US and at the Physikalisch - Technische Bundesandstalt in Germany in the 1980s .
Today , the story gets even more puzzling .
Jere Jenkins and pals at Purdue University in Indiana have re-analysed the raw data from these experiments and say that the modulations are synchronised with each other and with Earth ’s distance from the sun .
( Both groups , in acts of selfless dedication , measured the decay rates of silicon - 32 and radium - 226 over a period of many years . )
In other words , there appears to be an annual variation in the decay rates of these elements .
Jenkins and co put forward two theories to explain why this might be happening .
First , they say a theory developed by John Barrow at the University of Cambridge in the UK and Douglas Shaw at the University of London , suggests that the sun produces a field that changes the value of the fine structure constant on Earth as its distance from the sun varies during each orbit .
Such an effect would certainly cause the kind of an annual variation in decay rates that Jenkins and co highlight .
Another idea is that the effect is caused by some kind of interaction with the neutrino flux from the sun ’s interior , which could be tested by carrying out the measurements close to a nuclear reactor ( which would generate its own powerful neutrino flux ) .
It turns out , that the notion of that nuclear decay rates are constant has been under attack for some time .
In 2006 , Jenkins says the decay rate of manganese - 54 in their lab decreased dramtically during a solar flare on 13 December .
And numerous groups disagree over the decay rate for elements such as titanium - 44 , silicon - 32 and cesium - 137 .
Perhaps they took their data at different times of the year .
Keep em peeled beause we could hear more about this .
Interesting stuff .

The rebels say they are preparing to defend themselves Sudan 's government has launched a major offensive against rebel bases in the far north of Darfur , two rebel factions have said .
A commander from a faction of the Sudanese Liberation Army ( SLA ) said about 270 vehicles and 500 Janjaweed fighters were involved in the attack .
Nine rebels and nine civilians had been killed , he said .
An army spokesman declined to comment .
The government has previously denied links to Janjaweed fighters .
A commander from the Abdul Wahed faction of the SLA , Sulieman Marajan , told the BBC that the Janjaweed had attacked on camel and horseback .
He said the attacks were part of a plan by the government to destroy all of the rebel bases in northern Darfur , adding that he believed rebels from neighbouring Chad were taking part in the operation .
Chad has accused Sudan of harbouring and supporting Chadian rebels .
Analysts say the two countries are fighting a proxy war using each other 's rebel forces .
Oil exploration
The Sudanese army now controlled the area around Wadi Atron , near the border with Libya , the SLA commander said .
A spokesman for a rival rebel group , the SLA 's Unity faction , said rebels had been expecting an attack and were preparing to defend themselves .
The government was trying to clear the rebels out of the far north of Darfur so that Chinese companies could explore for oil , he said .
North Darfur is part of Sudan 's oil Block 12A , operated by a consortium led by the Saudi Arabian company al - Qahtani , the BBC's Amber Henshaw reports from Sudan .
Sudan 's oil ministry could not immediately confirm whether any exploration had begun in Block 12A .
Violence in Darfur began in 2003 when rebel groups complaining of discrimination against black Africans began attacking government targets .
The government mobilised what it called " self - defence militias " in response , but denies any links to the Janjaweed , accused of trying to " cleanse " black Africans from Darfur .
The UN estimates that more than 300,000 people have been killed and two million displaced during five years of fighting .

Senators Chuck Hagel ( R -NE ) and Jack Reed ( D - RI ) were on CBS ’s Face The Nation this morning , and Hagel had a strong response to John McCain ’s new strategy of attacking Obama ’s patriotism .
Hagel was asked about McCain ’s recent campaign line that Obama would rather lose a war in order to win a campaign .
“ They ’re better off to focus on policy differences .
I think John is treading on some very thin ground here when he impugns motives and when we start to get into , “ You ’re less patriotic than me .
I ’m more patriotic . ” I admire and respect John McCain very much .
I have a good relationship .
To this day we do .
We talk often .
I talked to him right before I went to Iraq , as a matter of fact .
John ’s better than that . ”
Hagel then offered some advice to both candidates , “ And he ’s not asked for advice on this , but since you ’ve asked me the question , I think both he and Barack have to be very careful here because it ’s just not responsible to be saying things like that .
Again if for no other reason for the good of this country and the world , one of these two men on January 20 , next year , is going to have to bring this country together and the world to deal with huge problems .
I think the next president is going to inherit an inventory of challenges as big as Franklin Roosevelt inherited on March 4 , 1933 . ”

For almost 60 years the patriotism argument has been a standby of Republican candidates at all levels , when they are either trailing or do n’t want to talk about the issues .
The only difference today is that the Communists have been replaced with terrorists , but no amount of flag waving is going to create jobs , lower prices , give the uninsured healthcare , or change our foreign policy course .
Hagel is correct in saying that the next president is going to have a tall order ahead , and will need a unified country behind him .
Attacks and ads like the ones McCain is running now will only serve the purpose of tearing the nation apart politically .
I think that people have gotten tired of the red state - blue state America , and would like to see a unified country , but McCain knows that the nation will never unify around him , so his best chance of winning is to make sure that they do n’t unify around Obama either .

Former vice president Al Gore was on NBC ’s Meet the Press today and he talked about why hen thinks offshore oil drilling is a bad idea .
Host Tom Brokaw asked Gore why we should not have offshore drilling .
Gore answered , “ Well , we , we already have offshore drilling in the areas where it does make sense , and there are already leased lots and lots of other offshore sites that could be drilled in .
There ’s a shortage of drill rigs and engineers , and they ’re , they ’re , they ’re going full out now .
But the areas that are protected now are protected for a reason .
The coastal economy has been hurt in the past by oil spills , and I think states like California should have the right to protect the , the areas that they know are in danger .
Brokaw followed up by asking if Florida approves it should they be allowed to drill .
“ I think that the areas that have environmental values and economic values connected to the environment at stake should be protected .
And the larger reason why is even if they went in that direction , everybody acknowledges , it would have zero impact on gasoline prices or oil prices .
It ’s a drop in the bucket that would pose high risk of very important values .
It would n’t even start until 10 or 15 years from now and would likely to be–likely be sold to China anyway .
And going back over and over and over again to the old ways of the past just puts off the reckoning with the , the opportunity that we need to seize now to shift over to renewable sources of energy , ” Gore said .

Gore is right .
The oil probably will be sold to China or somewhere else , because I really do n’t see the Republicans in Congress allowing a clause in any new offshore drilling contracts that states that the oil must be sold in the United States .
In their eyes , that would an example of the government regulating a free market .
The truth is that offshore drilling is a campaign gimmick that no one on both sides of the aisle is serious about .
Everyone knows that any large scale offshore drilling program would not impact the market for 10 - 15 years .
Even Bush and McCain talk about the value of offshore drilling being psychological .
As we have seen with the falling price of oil over this past week , gimmicks and mind tricks do n’t help , but lowering demand does .
The best way to get out of this crisis is to continue to lower our demand , and switch to alternative sources .
That is Econ 101 .
The full transcript of Gore ’s interview
Despite early reports that there were no deaths , the government later confirmed that at least 45 people had been killed and 40 injured in the crash .
Spanish media said the real toll was much higher .
Cat Genie takes the small unpleasantness of daily cleaning the litter and it saves it up and releases that unpleasantness as one big unscheduled , unpleasant inconvenience every week or two .
Advanced monitors will ensure that the device failure will occur during the workday , as you prepare for your important meeting with your prospective client .
Nothing like cleaning out wet cat poo in your nicest suit .
Or , you may be pleasantly awoken in the middle of the night by the repeating three beeps of " there 's poo and hair in the hopper . "
You will become more familiar with your cat 's feces every day as the cat genie gently fills your home with the aroma of baking excrement .
Plus , you get to pay over $ 300 for technology that was " designed " and built for less than $ 2 .
The " processor " unit was designed in 1967 and allows all the functionality of the most advanced microchip devices of its era .
It has both on and off modes .
( Note : off mode available only while unplugged . )
Actually , the real reason for the high cost of the device is to cover the costs of all the customer support that they must provide and to cover the costs of all of the returned units .
The question is not IF , but WHEN you will find yourself hunched over your cat 's feces floating in a pool of fetid water , picking small plastic pellets out of the opaque , pungent water with your fingers so that you can get the device put back together .
And your cats will thank you by depositing their love bundles beside the machine that 's half filled with water and beeping away forlornly if you happen to be away when it fails .
We have three cats , they had no trouble adjusting to the machine over about a week .
The small plastic pellets getting everywhere in the house is not really any big deal .
Roomba takes care of most of them well .
We 've now had the machine for three months .
We received a replacement base last week for a leaky drain hose .
We 've called their customer service line enough times that we now know the " secret " diagnostic techniques of their experts .
We do n't know if we 're going to keep it or return it .
If we keep it , we 're definitely going to install an exhaust fan in the laundry room , and set it to a timer to go when the unit is on .
For some reason there are little bits of poo that fall between the tines of the hopper , and they get slow baked every time the unit dries itself .
The stench is really outstanding .
It 's hard to describe .
I 'm a doctor , and I 've rarely ever smelled anything so bad .
My recommendation is to wait for the next generation cat sanitation solution .
That device will need to be a complete redesign to solve the myriad of problems with this unfortunate device .
To say something positive , the customer support line is manned by kind , well - meaning kids who really do feel badly that you 're having a hard time with your mechanical poo soup maker .
If you do buy this device , get some thick rubber gloves and a couple of towels that you wo n't use for anything else .
Over at TPMCafe , Elizabeth Warren has a new theory to throw into the bailout ring :
At a Harvard panel discussion yesterday , economics professor Ken Rogoff made an interesting point :
The liquidity crisis is n't real .
Or , to restate it :
Any liquidity crisis is caused by the promise of a government bailout .
Ken said that his many friends in investment banking said that there is plenty of money to invest in financial services , but right now it is " sitting on the sidelines . "
Why ?
Because the financial services industry does not want to pay the terms demanded .
As he put it , why do business with Warren Buffett who will negotiate a tough deal , if you believe that the government will ride in soon with cheaper cash ?
Now , I think Rogoff is exaggerating some here - waiting for a bailout is not the sole cause of the problem , because the problem was there before anyone talked of a bailout - but he has some goodly part of a point now that a bailout seems imminent .
And this is partly why only a bailout " in exchange for equity stake " plan makes any kind of sense .
Once they 're faced with losing sizable amounts of their company shares to the government as stakeholder , we 'll see that Rogoff is partly right and financiers will suddenly decide that some of their " toxic debt " is n't so smelly after all if they 're going to be punished for offloading it .
Then , if the bankers think they can make more money for themselves from using their own money to inject liquidity into the system than by letting the government do it at a cost in shares , we 'll see credit markets unfreeze some of their own accord .
It 's like Pavlovian conditioning for financiers .
That in turn means any rescue attempt - which I still think has to happen in some form , although I favor Bernie Sanders ' version - can be smaller and fits perfectly with the Dem plan to allocate money in tranches .
Republican presidential candidate Senator John McCain ( R - AZ ) smiles as he addresses a League of United Latin American Citizens conference in Washington , July 8 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Jonathan Ernst
PITTSBURGH ( Reuters ) - Presidential candidate John McCain , who once sang in jest about bombing Iran , on Tuesday reacted to a report of rising U.S. cigarette exports to the country by saying it may be “ a way of killing ‘ em . ”
McCain , known for acerbic comments and for sometimes firing verbally from the hip , was responding to a report that U.S. exports to Iran rose tenfold during President George W. Bush ’s term in office despite hostility between the two states .
A rise in cigarette sales was a big part of that , according to an Associated Press analysis of seven years of U.S. trade figures .
“ Maybe that ’s a way of killing ‘ em , ” McCain said to reporters during a campaign stop in Pittsburgh .
“ I meant that as a joke , as a person who has n’t had a cigarette in 28 years , 29 years , ” he added , laughing .
He declined further comment on the report .
At a campaign meeting in South Carolina last year the Arizona senator , asked if there is a plan to attack Iran , began his answer with a variation on the lyrics of a well - known pop song , Barbara Ann .
“ You know that old Beach Boys song , Bomb Iran ? ” he said , then sang “ Bomb bomb bomb , bomb bomb Iran ” before discussing what he considered Iran ’s serious threat to Israel and international security .
Tension is high between the two countries over Iran ’s nuclear program , which Washington says is aimed at making an atomic bomb but Tehran says is for generating energy .
There has been media speculation of a possible U.S. or Israeli military strike against Iran ’s nuclear facilities .
This essay was written in the mid-2000 ’s when the economies of Europe were thriving and the U.S. was unknowingly on the threshold of one of the biggest financial disasters in our history .
This essay asks an important question that is perhaps even more valid today :
Are our entrenched practices holding us back in the modern economy ?
One startling example of this is the advances made in China .
As we read in the article Why California ca n’t compare with China , “ China has built almost 30,000 kilometers of high - speed rail lines since the beginning of the century , while the US has completed virtually none . ”
Obviously , our Democratic principles have a lot to do with this .
Rightfully , we are unwilling to stifle the rights of the people for progress .
But we still need to consider workable solutions because , while our people are not being stifled , our country may be .
Enjoy the article below from the early 2000’s .
Sitting in Union Square , in the heart of San Francisco , you will find many languages spoken .
People come here from all over the world to experience San Francisco , one of Americas , if not the worlds , best cities .
They also come here to shop .
If you walk into any of the stores outlining the beautiful palm - tree lined park of Union Square , Macy ’s , Saks , Nieman Marcus , you will find foreigners here to buy goods on the cheap .
Foreigners , especially Europeans , are flocking here to get goods on the cheap ( at Saks , no less ) like Americans use to do in their countries .
What is going on ?
Is America the new Mexico , with foreigners coming to our shores to get all their proverbial silver on the cheap ?
The answer may be right here in Union Square , where I sit with my laptop amidst all the foreigners .
Here , I can get wireless Internet access provided by Google .
Google offered to blanket all of San Francisco with free wireless Internet access in early 2005 , but they were refused and had to deal with an endless bureaucracy .
Why would a city refuse or delay an offer for free wireless to all of its citizens ?
Perhaps a better question to ask is this :
Who stands to lose if Google provides free wireless access to the whole city ?
We need look no further than my situation to answer that question .
I currently pay about $ 80 per month to the phone company , AT&T , which is broken down as follows : $ 40 a month for the active phone line ( which I need for Internet ) and $ 40 a month for the actual Internet .
If google provided reasonably fast free wireless Internet access , I would cancel my phone service immediately .
I use my cell phone for all calls anyway ; the only people who call my land line are salespeople .
Thus , AT&T would lose $ 80 a month from me .
No big deal right ?
Well , let ’s assume that 500,000 residents of San Francisco are in my exact situation .
In that case , AT&T would lose $ 40,000,000 , yes that ’s $ 40 million , dollars a month in revenue .
Now , Google would like to implement this wireless service nationwide .
Let ’s assume then , perhaps conservatively , that 30 million people would cancel their land phone and Internet service .
That would amount to $ 2.4 billion dollars each month in lost revenue to the phone company .
With these huge potential losses , do you not think that the phone companies are using every last lobbyist and lawyer on the payroll to block this progression ?
And therein lies the problem .
America ’s past success story inhibits future successes , inhibits advances , inhibits progression .
Many other countries bear no such burden of past successes and , because of this , might just pass us right by .
For example , many third world countries are unencumbered by entrenched land - based communication services .
Thus , they will go straight to wireless unimpeded by lawyers and lobbyists .
In this article in Technology in Society , the authors posit that “ as emerging markets look for opportunities to “ leap - frog ” , they can quickly adapt to next - generation wireless technologies like Wi-Fi and WiMAX , thereby gaining advantages over other traditional wired infrastructures . ”
This phenomenon is not exclusive to the communications industry ; it exists in many industries - entrenched companies preventing , or deliberately squashing , technologies that will enable America to compete in the future .
Paying a lot for gas right now ?
Do you ever wonder what happened to the idea of the electric car ?
Read more about how the auto industry squashed the electric car .
In an article Electric Dreams , Patrick Quinton writes “ how the automakers are so distracted by the effort to maintain the status quo that they short circuit the technology and neuter the ingenuity that could ultimately save their futures . ”
Hyperbole ?
Well , it might not be unreasonable to ask this question : Would America be at war with Iraq right now if everyone drove an electric car ?
If the answer to this question is “ no ” , General Motors , who deliberately squashed the development of the electric car , is directly responsible for the lost lives of countless Americans .
I do n’t sit here in Union Square in San Francisco intending to bash General Motors , AT&T , or any other company for that matter .
That ’s Michael Moore ’s purview .
However , I do wonder aloud why our country has become the new Mexico , with foreigners all around us not to embrace our culture , but to exploit our weak economy and buy stuff cheaply .
I wonder about this .
Do you ?
There is hope .
Recently , Google , combined with Earthlink , did receive the contract for free wireless throughout San Francisco .
This proves that companies like AT&T will fold when they realize that they are fighting a losing battle .
However , when these companies finally acquiesce , will the battle already be lost ?
Two days after someone broke into the email account of vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin , unknown intruders have hacked the website of conservative commentator Bill O'Reilly and posted personal details of more than 200 of its subscribers .
The breach into BillOreilly.com came as retaliation for remarks O'Reilly made on FoxNews condemning the attack on Palin's Yahoo email account , according to Wikileaks , a site that makes it easy for whistleblowers , hackers and anyone else to leak documents .
As proof , Wikileaks posted a screenshot of the BillOreilly.com administrative interface that showed the names , email addresses , passwords , and home town of 20 subscribers of the website .
In all , information belonging to 205 subscribers was intercepted , according to Eric Marston , CTO of Nox Solutions , the company that maintained the O'Reilly website .
The hack came in response to comments O'Reilly made on Fox News about the posting of contents of Palin 's email account , including pictures of her daughter and her contact list .
" I 'm not going to mention the website that posted this , but it 's one of those despicable , slimy , scummy websites , " O'Reilly said , according to this snippet from YouTube .
" Everybody knows where this stuff is , OK , and they know the people who run the website , so why can't they go there tonight to the guy 's house who runs it , put him in cuffs and take him down and book him ? "
It 's evident from the remark that no one bothered to tell O'Reilly that Wikileaks , the first site to publish the Palin email , is a multi-national , bulletproof organization that has successfully withstood serious take - down efforts before .
He 's not the first conservative to have his lack of tech credentials in doubt .
In July , Republican presidential candidate John McCain confessed he was still " learning to get online " and " becoming computer literate to the point where I can get the information that I need . "
According to Marston , the hackers were able to access the unsecured list by trying a large number of variations of the website 's administrative URL .
He said all affected members have received an email and a phone call informing them of the breach and urging them to change their password anywhere they may have used it .
No credit card information was stolen , and the site has since been completely locked down , Marston said .
BillOreilly.com charges $ 4.95 for monthly premium membership .
The O'Reilly Store sells hats , mugs , T - shirts and other assorted schwag .
While the information exposed on Wikileaks may seem minimal , it has the potential to imperil the BillOreilly .com subscribers listed in ways they may not have anticipated .
A case in point is Carolyn Carpenter , 68 , of Henderson , Nevada .
The list showed she used a six - letter word from the English language to access her account .
Early Friday evening , when told she should change all accounts that used the password , she replied : " Oh damn , I use it all over the place . " ®

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Bush has expressed his " deep concern " and regret to Iraq 's prime minister over the desecration of a Quran by an American soldier , the White House said Tuesday .
President Bush called Nuri al - Maliki over the incident , al - Maliki 's office says .
The leaders are seen in September .
National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe said Bush spoke to Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki on Monday in one of their regularly scheduled secure video teleconferences .
" President Bush expressed his deep concern over the incident and told Prime Minister Maliki that the soldier has been reprimanded by his commanders and removed from Iraq , " Johndroe said .
Al - Maliki's office on Tuesday said Bush issued an apology for the action on behalf of the United States and " promised to present the soldier to the courts . "
The office said Bush made the apology in a call to al - Maliki on Tuesday morning .
An American staff sergeant -- a sniper section leader -- used a Quran for target practice in Iraq earlier this month .
The U.S. commander in Baghdad issued a formal apology Saturday and read a letter of apology by the shooter .
Watch the U.S. military formally apologize »
The sergeant has been relieved of duty as a section leader " with prejudice , " officially reprimanded by his commanding general , dismissed from his regiment and redeployed -- reassigned to the United States , the U.S. military said .
Reports of the Quran desecration have enraged Muslims in Iraq and elsewhere around the world .
The soldier , whose name was not released , shot at a Quran on May 9 , villagers said .
The Quran used in the incident was discovered two days later , according to the military .
A tribal leader said " the criminal act by U.S. forces " took place at a shooting range at the Radhwaniya police station on Baghdad 's western outskirts .
After the shooters left , an Iraqi policeman found a target marked in the middle of the bullet - riddled Quran .
Pictures of the Quran show multiple bullet holes and an expletive scrawled on one of its pages .
Officials said the soldier asserted he was n't aware the book was the Quran , but U.S. officials rejected the claim .
On Saturday , Maj. Gen. Jeffery Hammond , commander of U.S. forces in Baghdad , appeared with leaders from Radhwaniya and apologized .
" I come before you here seeking your forgiveness , " Hammond said to tribal leaders and others at the ceremony .
" In the most humble manner I look in your eyes today and I say please forgive me and my soldiers . "
Hammond also read a letter from the shooter , who called his actions " shortsighted , very reckless and irresponsible , " but he insisted he was not being malicious .
" I sincerely hope that my actions have not diminished the partnership that our two nations have developed together , " the letter said .
Hammond said the soldier 's actions were tantamount to " criminal behavior . "
" I 've come to this land to protect you , to support you -- not to harm you -- and the behavior of this soldier was nothing short of wrong and unacceptable , " the general said .
Another military official kissed a Quran and presented it as " a humble gift " to the tribal leaders .
Many Iraqi leaders said the apology alone would not suffice .
Watch villagers protest the desecration »
On Monday , the Iraqi Islamic Party , the movement of Vice President Tariq al - Hashimi , condemned what it said was a " blatant assault on the sanctities of Muslims all over the world . "
The party said it reacted to the news " with deep resentment and indignation " and wants the " severest of punishments " for the action .
" What truly concerns us is the repetition of these crimes that have happened in the past when mosques were destroyed and pages of the holy Quran were torn and used for disgraceful acts by U.S. soldiers , " al - Hashimi said .
" I have asked that first this apology be officially documented ; second a guarantee from the U.S. military to inflict the maximum possible punishment on this soldier so it would be a deterrent for the rest of the soldiers in the future . "

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The House 's failure to pass a $ 700 billion bailout package Monday not only held back billions for Wall Street but also was a major blow to Sen.
John McCain 's presidential campaign .
Sen .
John McCain says he is ready to work to get a financial rescue plan through Congress .
The Republican presidential nominee raised the stakes for himself last week when he suspended his campaign and returned to Washington for negotiations over a solution to the financial crisis .
" Even before the House vote , voters blamed Republicans more than Democrats for the crisis .
Then McCain suspended his campaign to come back to Washington to rally support for a rescue plan , " said Bill Schneider , a CNN political analyst .
" He failed , so he gets blamed by both supporters and opponents of the rescue plan . "
During a campaign event in Des Moines , Iowa , on Tuesday , McCain appeared to distance himself from Monday 's House vote , saying the congressional inaction had " every American and the entire economy at the gravest risk . "
" Yesterday , the country and the world looked to Washington for leadership , and Congress once again came up empty - handed , " he said .
But over the weekend , McCain had involved himself in the efforts to get the bailout package to the president 's desk .
iReport :
Do you support the bailout ?
Rep. John Boehner of Ohio , the top Republican in the House , said that McCain was actively involved in lobbying Republican House members Sunday to line up behind the bailout .
" He has been making calls to members in support of this bill ... and I 'm grateful for his support , " Boehner said .
But it was a majority of McCain 's own Republicans in the House who voted against the bailout by a 2 - 1 ratio Monday afternoon , leaving the outcome of the bailout in doubt and sending the stock market diving 778 points .
Despite McCain 's lobbying efforts , 133 House Republicans voted against the bill .
Watch the candidates ' reaction to the bailout 's failure »
After the vote , McCain was defensive , accusing his Democratic rival , Sen. Barack Obama , of just wanting to " phone it in " when it came to the bailout and introducing partisanship into the process .
" Sen. Obama and his allies in Congress infused unnecessary partisanship into the process .
Now is not the time to fix the blame .
It 's time to fix the problem , " he said after the vote .
Watch politicians point fingers after the vote »
But on Tuesday morning , McCain said the bill failed " because we have n't convinced people that this is a rescue effort , not just for Wall Street , but for Main Street America , for working families , for small businesses , for the heartland of America . "
" I may fail a first or second or third time , but we have to get this job done for America .
And I have a plan to restore our economy , " McCain added .
Watch McCain say he has a plan »
Before the House vote , McCain was losing ground to Obama because of the increasingly bad economic news .
A CNN / Opinion Research Corporation poll conducted September 19 - 21 found that Obama was leading McCain 51 percent to 46 percent .
Earlier , after the Republican convention , the two had been tied in the polls .
And the CNN poll found that Obama leads McCain 49 percent to 43 percent among those surveyed when asked who had showed better judgment in the economic crisis .
Terry Jeffries , a Republican strategist and CNN contributor , also said McCain may have hurt himself among conservatives by losing sight of his party 's free - market principles .
" I think that John McCain failed to lead , " Jeffries said .
" He should be right there pushing the principles , and the conservatives in the House are doing that right now . "
While Obama and McCain have mostly agreed on the principles of the bailout , Obama has mostly stayed out of negotiations and has used the financial crisis to attack the economic policies of the Bush administration and tie McCain to the unpopular President Bush .
Watch Obama call for calm »
" He did n't put himself in that process .
He was smart enough to realize he could n't control the House Republicans or Democrats , " said Ed Rollins , another Republican strategist and CNN contributor .
But McCain 's allies still said the Arizona senator made the right move when he inserted himself into the talks .
" He wanted to come back to Washington and to help with the crisis .
And the fact it did n't work out , it 's not on his shoulders , " said Ron Bonjean , a Republican strategist .
" Frankly , it's on the Democrats ' shoulders .
They 're the ones who run Congress . "
CNN 's Ed Henry and Scott J. Anderson contributed to this report .
All About John McCain
The Harper government approved 148 appointments to federal boards and agencies , long used as rewards for supporters of the party in power , as the election neared , The Canadian Press has learned .
Cabinet handed out the posts in three rounds , the first only two days before Parliament recessed for the summer , the second on July 30 , at peak holiday time for politicians and political journalists , and the third less than a week before Prime Minister Stephen Harper 's Sept. 7 election call .
Harper , who railed against Liberal patronage in the 2006 election , later failed to deliver on a campaign pledge to put an independent commission in charge of vetting cabinet appointments .
He shelved the idea after opposition MPs refused to ratify his nomination of Gwyn Morgan , a Calgary oil baron who is also a friend of the prime minister , as the commission chair .
It 's difficult to determine how many of the recent appointments went to members of the federal Conservative party or to provincial Progressive Conservative parties .
Many have had no comment on their new jobs , but interviews and public records outlining the backgrounds of others suggest Harper was courting the party faithful in a number of cases .
A retiring Halifax physician who was named to the Canada Pension Plan review board described how he received a call from a prominent provincial Conservative who asked him if he was interested in the spot .
The physician , Ronald Gregor , said he helped a prominent provincial Progressive Conservative candidate campaign in his neighbourhood in the last Nova Scotia election , but only for a week of door - knocking .
He described how his name first went to the office of Defence Minister Peter MacKay , the federal political minister for Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island , and then to the office of Human Resources Minister Monte Solberg .
A retired Ottawa lawyer who also received an appointment to the pension review board , whose members primarily hear applications for disability pensions , said he simply told a prominent Ontario Progressive Conservative he was looking for something to do in his retirement .
The lawyer , Murray Young , said he told longtime provincial cabinet minister Norm Sterling , who represented an Ottawa riding , that he " wanted something , a week a month . "
Young said he does n't know Environment Minister John Baird , the federal political minister for the Ottawa region , and has never met him .
He said that after he spoke with Sterling he found a CPP board vacancy on a government website , but he could n't remember the name of the site .
The 148 appointments to low - profile but rewarding agencies — including the pension review board , employment insurance referee boards , immigration and refugee appeal boards and port authorities — were among a host of jobs filled by cabinet in the three rounds , government records show .
Other posts filled included superior court and national parole board vacancies , both of which involve a screening process , and higher - echelon nominations to federal commissions or Crown corporation boards .
Salary or other remuneration for some of the agencies , such as the CPP review board , are established by Treasury Board and not published .
The port authorities , responsible for establishing their own levels of remuneration , likewise do not publish the figures .
But , as an example , Privy Council Office documents show that part - time members of the Immigration and Refugee Appeal Board receive a per diem between $ 480 and $ 560 .
Full - time members are paid between $ 95,500 and $ 112,300 annually .
The appointees included a 2007 director of the Vancouver Quadra federal riding association , Marlie Oden ; a past defeated provincial Tory in Newfoundland and Labrador , Wilson Wiseman ; and a Sudbury , Ont. , woman , Lyne Demers , who worked for the whip 's office in the Ontario government of Mike Harris .
Others included in the Harper appointments were Brian Ketcheson of St. Andrews , Man. , who lost an election bid for the provincial Tories in 1995 ; Faith Collins of Victoria , who ran unsuccessfully for the federal Progressive Conservatives in 1993 ; and David Saxton of Yarmouth , N.S. , a provincial Progressive Conservative supporter and donor .
A Conservative party spokesman played down the significance of the appointments .
" We do n't believe political involvement should preclude people from serving in these capacities , " said Mike Storeshaw , the communications director for Treasury Board President Vic Toews , who is on leave to act as a party spokesman during the election .
Storeshaw also dismissed the extent of the appointments and the fact they were made as the government was likely preparing for an election call , contending that a snap election could have occurred anytime with a minority Parliament .
But the Canadian Taxpayers Federation criticized Harper for not carrying through with his promise to change the patronage system .
" It 's business as usual , rewarding party faithful , " said Adam Taylor , acting national director of the federation .

Yet again , Jon Stewart asks the questions no one else does and confronts another architect of the War in Iraq , the noted British liberal and former prime minister , Tony Blair .
Tony Blair : None of this is easy …
Jon Stewart : Look I know , and I do appreciate even having the conversation .
No one believes they took the decisions lightly .
The only point for me is : nineteen people flew into the towers ; it seems hard for me to imagine that we could go to war enough to make the world safe enough that nineteen people would n’t want to do harm to us .
So it seems we need to re-think a strategy that is less military - based and more [ unintelligible ] .
This exchange comes towards the end of the interview with Blair , which overall , I do n’t think was not one of Stewart ’s best .
But the catharsis that comes when Jon Stewart confronts these powerful men and speaks common sense to these once formidable powers – it ’s hard to describe .
Somehow , it is as if he is doing more than anyone to hold the men and women who made the disastrous decisions that led to war in some way accountable .

As I wrote about Stewart confronting Douglas Feith earlier this year :
I ’m not sure if it should be so cathartic to see one of the planners of this misbegotten gamble scolded by a comedian .
But it was .

Garbage collectors would inspect San Francisco residents ' trash to make sure pizza crusts are n't mixed in with chip bags or wine bottles under a proposal by Mayor Gavin Newsom .
And if residents or businesses do n't separate the coffee grounds from the newspapers , they would face fines of up to $ 1,000 and eventually could have their garbage service stopped .
The plan to require proper sorting of refuse would be the nation 's first mandatory recycling and composting law .
It would direct garbage collectors to inspect the trash to make sure it is put into the right blue , black or green bin , according to a draft of the legislation prepared by the city 's Department of the Environment .
The program is designed to limit the amount of food and foliage that goes into the city - contracted landfill in Alameda County , where the refuse takes up costly space and decomposes to form methane , one of the most potent of greenhouse gases .
It will also help San Francisco , which city officials say currently diverts 70 percent of its waste from landfills , achieve a goal set by the Board of Supervisors to divert 75 percent by 2010 and have zero waste by 2020 .
" If we 're truly going to be the city we promote ourselves to be , a world - class , 21st century city that advances its values and principles , we 're going to have to try new things , " Newsom said Thursday .
" People are used to doing things a certain way .
And when you change that , they say it can't be done .
Well , we 've proved them wrong . "
He pointed to a doubling in the city 's recycling rate from 1996 to 2008 , but acknowledged " it will take some time " to win over hearts and minds .
" People do n't knowingly want to waste , " Environment Department Director Jared Blumenfeld said .
" At the moment , we have a missed opportunity , which is that we 're at a 70 percent recycling rate .
Overnight we could be at 92 percent if everything people are throwing away that could be reused or recycled actually was . "
Mandating habits
Plenty of other cities , from Pittsburgh to San Diego , have mandatory recycling .
None , however , requires all food waste be composted .
Seattle passed a law in 2003 requiring people to have a compost bin but it did not mandate that all food waste go in there .
" If they want to throw away food , that 's their right , " said Brett Stav , a planning and development specialist at Seattle Public Utilities .
" We 're not banning food from the garbage . "
Skeptics call Newsom 's plan unworkable and see it as the latest intrusion from heavy - handed city government , which has outlawed smoking in parks and feeding pigeons in much of the city .
Duboce Triangle resident Mark Cromwell , a 53 - year - old personal assistant , called the proposed law " laughable . "
" Do we want our garbage collectors to be the meter maids of trash ? " Cromwell said .
" Good luck placing blame on the recycling criminal , especially in big apartment buildings .
I will stop recycling if this law goes into effect just to become an eventual test case .
Dictators are anathema , no matter which side of the political spectrum they come from . "
The company with the city 's garbage and recycling contract also is hesitant to take on enforcement , saying it could slow down service and require extra data entry and information tracking .
" We support the goals of the proposed ordinance but believe it needs refinements to be workable for everyone involved , especially the customers , " said Robert Reed , a spokesman for Norcal Waste Systems .
Norcal is the parent company of San Francisco collectors Sunset Scavenger Co. and Golden Gate Disposal and Recycling Co .
" We are concerned about draft provisions that envision our drivers policing the contents of refuse containers and possibly withholding service if violations were found , " Reed said .
" A significant increase in time required to service each customer location would mean we would need to have more routes , which means more drivers , trucks , fuel and related resources . "
Plan 's details
The proposal , which city officials said the mayor could bring to the Board of Supervisors in about a month , calls for every residence and business in the city to have three separate color - coded bins for waste : blue for recycling , green for compost and black for trash .
Food vendors would have to supply them for customers .
Managers of multifamily or commercial properties would be required to provide them for tenants or employees .
Trash collectors would be required to check the bins for proper sorting , which Blumenfeld said would require only a cursory visual inspection , not combing through the contents .
If they found a bin with the wrong material in it , collectors would leave a tag on the container identifying the problem .
A second time would result in another tag and a written notice to the service subscriber .
On a third offense , the collector could refuse to empty the container , although this would not apply to multifamily properties like apartment buildings or to commercial properties with multiple tenants and joint collection .
The city could also levy a fine of up to $ 500 for the first violation , $ 750 for the second in one year and $ 1,000 for the third in a year .
Apartment landlords are concerned that they 'll have to pay for a tenant 's behavior and wo n't be able to pass the fine along , said Sean Pritchard , the government affairs director for the San Francisco Apartment Association .
" How do you determine which tenant is at fault ? " Pritchard said .
" Or do we indiscriminately start fining all tenants for one tenant 's poor choice of judgment ? "
Blumenfeld called that fear unnecessary , saying , " We wo n't enforce against owners of apartment buildings if their tenants do n't do this . "
In Seattle , self - policing often brings compliance , Stav said .
" When you 're the one guy on the block with the little tag on your garbage can , everyone knows you screwed up , " he said .
" There 's a little bit of shame , a ' Scarlet Letter ' effect , to this program that seems to work with people . "
Newsom said fines would only be levied in egregious circumstances .
" We do n't want to fine people , " the mayor said .
" We want to change behavior . "

It 's been a week now since that " TR2N " teaser trailer ran at Comic - Con .
And Disneyana & sci-fi fans are desperate for additional information about this Summer 2010 release .
Well , let me share some info that I 'm sure will send all of you " TRON " fanboys out there straight off the Game Grid .
Guess who 's the real power - behind - the - throne ( The Master Control Program , if you will ) on this particular Walt Disney Pictures production ?
Would you believe John Lasseter ?
Yep , the Chief Creative Officer of Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios has quite the soft spot when it comes to the original " TRON . "
Lasseter still remembers when he first saw this Steve Lisberger film .
Which was back in 1981 when John was just a lowly animator toiling away on " Mickey 's Christmas Carol . "
One lunch hour while wandering around the Disney lot , Lasseter came upon the trailers where all of the 16 X 20 Kodalith cels that were used in this 1982 production were stored .
And it was here that John first saw " TRON " 's lightcycle sequence .
And as Lasseter looked at this CG sequence ...
" It absolutely blew me away !
A little door in my mind opened up .
I looked at it and said , ` This is it !
This is the future ! ' "
Mind you , John was quite taken with the look of " TRON " ( as well as -- of course -- that film 's use of computer animation ) .
But as for that movie 's storyline ...
Lasseter was n't really a fan .
He felt that Lisberger had missed some obvious opportunities to create a truly compelling piece of entertainment .
Something that would have touched an audience 's emotions as it dazzled their eyes .

Which is why -- even though Steve ( i.e. " TRON " 's original director & co-writer ) has spent the past five years developing a script for a sequel -- none of that material will now be used in the production of " TR2N . "
Do n't get me wrong , folks .
Lasseter is still extremely respectful of all the groundbreaking work that Lisberger & his production team did on the first " TRON . "
Which is why Steve will receive a co-producer credit on this 2010 Walt Disney Pictures release .
But as for Lisberger having any real creative input on the sequel ... " GAME OVER ! , " man .
" So -- if Steve is n't working on the ' TR2N ' screenplay anymore -- who is then ? , " you ask .
Well ...
Allegedly at John 's insistence , Disney hired Eddie Kitsis & Adam Horowitz to create a script for this sequel .
Given their long association with " Lost , " Kitsis & Horowitz have lots of experience when it comes to guiding colorful characters through surreal settings .
Which made Eddie & Adam an obvious choice for the " TR2N " assignment .
And if Lisberger 's no longer slated to helm the " TRON " sequel , who 's Disney now going to get to direct this movie ?
Joseph Kosinski .
Who has yet to actually direct a full - length feature film but has created some award - winning commercials for Saab , Nike and X - Box .
In fact , if you want to get some sense of the visual look that Joseph wants to bring to " TR2N , " click on the above links .
Or -- better yet -- check out Kosinski's animated architectural renderings .
These will give you a better sense of Joseph 's eye .
The way this guy moves a camera .
Which offers a hint of how truly dazzling a Kosinski - directed version of " TRON " could be .
Speaking of which ...
To convince Disney executives that his vision for " TR2N " was commercially viable , Joseph spent six months working in secret with the folks at Digital Domain .
Laboring to create a vivid , updated version of " TRON " 's famous lightcycles .
With the hope that this three - minute - long sequence would then prove to the suits that a sequel to this 26 - year - old film would actually appeal to today 's gamers .
Which brings us to Disney Interactive Studios ' involvement in the " TR2N " project ...
To help prime the pump for this potentially - hugely - profitable profect , Disney 's gaming division actually released an Xbox 360 version of those classic arcade games , " TRON " and " Discs of TRON , " last summer .
Given the huge number of units that were then sold to video game players as well as " TRON " fans ...
It was clear that there are a lot of people out there who -- just like John Lasseter -- have a very soft spot in their hearts when it comes to this particular Walt Disney Productions release .
But that said ...
There are still those at the Studio who are saying that it may be a mistake to release a " TRON " sequel 28 years after the fact .
Which is kind of ironic , given that Walt Disney Pictures ' other big picture for 2010 is also a sequel .

What film am I talking about ?
" Toy Story 3 . " Which rolls into theaters nearly 15 years after the first " Toy Story " film debuted .
So what do you folks think ?
Do you think that " TR2N " has a better chance of becoming a truly entertaining motion picture now that you 've learned that John Lasseter is shepherding this project ?
Or is it just too late for a " TRON " sequel to connect with today 's audiences ?
Your thoughts ?

The Day the American People Bitch Slapped Washington
“ Bitch Slap ” :
The act of unexpectedly slapping someone across the face .
Usually done in front of several people in order to humiliate the slappee .
– UrbanDictionary.com
Monday was definitely an interesting day in Washington .
The day started with an address from President George W. Bush , urging Members of Congress to pass what he thought was a strong piece of legislation that was designed with the best interest of the American people in mind .
This address to the nation was so important that it was held at 7:35 am EST ( 4:35 am PST ) , ensuring that maybe 1 % of the population would actually see it .
That 1 % however , was targeted very carefully to a demographic that is very important to Bush Administration : Wall Street and Politicians .
Following the President ’s remarks , the media went into full spin mode , rallying behind the President and Congressional leadership , leading the American people to believe that this bill was expected to pass , and that both sides of the House thought that they had the votes needed to move this on to the Senate .
Of course this is exactly what the spin machines from within the Bush administration and the Congressional leadership wanted the American people to think .
Unfortunately for them , there was no amount of PR tricks , and no number of feuxservative think - tanks that the White House could sell on this Socialist plan that would lead the American people to trust something that obviously did n’t have the best interest of taxpayers in mind .
Did an Administration with an approval rating of 27 % and a Congress with one of 17 % really expect the American people to trust them with $ 700,000,000,000 bailout package ?
Unfortunately , when you drink too much of the Potomac Kool - Aid , it appears that hallucinations and bad judgment follow .
Luckily , through the efforts of some true free - market , limited government organizations like FreedomWorks , National Taxpayers Union , Campaign for Liberty , and even some groups on the left , coupled with good ole ’
American common sense , taxpayers rose up and told Congress how they feel .
I ’m happy to be able to say that with one strong backhand , the American people were able to forcefully reach back and bitch slap both the Bush Administration for pushing this bill , and Congressional leadership on both sides for trying to sugarcoat what was obviously a flawed piece of legislation .
Just on one petition alone , NoWallStreetBailout.com ( created by FreedomWorks ) , nearly 30,000 people signed up within days of this bailout being announced .
Even as John McCain and Barack Obama jumped on board with something they obviously did n’t understand , the American people said they were n’t going to stand for it .
Throughout the day on Monday , Congressional switchboards were jammed by phone calls coming in from all corners of the United States , with the overwhelming majority having a similar message to their Members : Hell No .
I ’m going to have a lot more on this as it all unfolds , because it obviously is n’t over it yet .
But the very fact that a traditionally apathetic American public rallied against this legislation in overwhelming numbers , on both sides of the aisle , sends a strong message to Congress .
Their games are over .
Blogs also discussing the bailout :
MobileMe is advertised as push messaging service , so some users were disappointed to find that some desktop updates may take as long as fifteen minutes to find their way up to the cloud .
However , the service does also support push IMAP email as well as full desktop push updates from the cloud , at least on Mac OS X .
Here 's how Apple 's service works with the client software on desktop Macs and PCs and on the iPhone .
Inside MobileMe : Mac and PC cloud sync and mobile push
MobileMe on the Mac desktop
To synchronize with the cloud 's push messaging services in MobileMe , specialized desktop software is required .
On the Mac , Apple talks to Mac OS X's Sync Services to sync to the cloud , and configuration is done through System Preferences ' MobileMe pane , which replaces the former .
Mac version . Â
The only visible difference ( apart from updated branding ) is that MobileMe can now be set to ' automatically ' sync bookmarks , calendar events , contacts as well as other data designed to sync with .
Mac , such as Dashboard widgets , Dock icons , Keychains , Mail account settings , rules , and signatures , Notes , and System Preferences ( below ) .
Microsoft also includes Mac OS X Sync Services support ( and therefore MobileMe sync support ) in the Mac version of Office , so users of Entourage can keep their calendar and contacts up to date with everything on the MobileMe cloud as well .
And of course any other application that either keeps its own data in sync with Sync Services , or directly uses the Mac OS X Address Book or iCal 's event data pool will also be stay updated with the MobileMe cloud and the devices it pushes updates to , including both the iPhone and iPod touch .
Mac OS X's Sync Services uses a central âsync engineâ that maintains a âtruth database.â 
This allows multiple devices , applications , and online services to plug into the service to share and sync data .
An app with new data pushes its updates to the engine , which syncs the changes to its truth database .
Other applications can then request updates from the truth database .
The connection between the sync engine and MobileMe is trigged on the schedule set by the user in System Preferences .
The MobileMe cloud also enables multiple Mac OS X systems to sync their local data with each other . Â
Bonjour , you have new messages
Once updates arrive at the cloud , either from MobileMe sync or from entries made directly in MobileMe web apps , the cloud pushes those updates down to any registered iPhones or iPod touches connected to the account .
On Mac OS X Tiger or Leopard , Apple also triggers push updates from the cloud that should show up immediately in Address Book and iCal , or âgenerally within a minuteâ according to Apple 's site . Â
Updates made on the Mac desktop are not immediately pushed up to the cloud unless you manually Â initiateÂ a sync ( or wait for the system to trigger an update sync itself ) .
However , Â updates are pushed down to Leopard desktop apps , typically within around ten to fifteen seconds of making changes from the web or on the iPhone .
Updates pushed to the mobile are similarly fast .
This unique desktop push feature uses the same Wide - Area BonjourÂ mechanismÂ used by MobileMe 's Back to My Mac for remote file and screen sharing .
For this to work , the Mac desktop must first be securely registered into Apple 's Dynamic DNS server by simply turning BTMM on ( which happens when you install the MobileMe update , if it 's not already on ) .
Â
This then allows the MobileMe cloud servers to target updates to the machine as required without the desktop system needing to initiate the transactions .
BTMM also automatically configures an encrypted , point to point IPSec connection to secure transactions over the Internet .
Other push messaging alternatives either use an expensive mobile network to keep track of mobile devices ( as RIM 's BlackBerry service does ) , or require a team of administrators to configure and maintain a Local Area Network supplying Â DNS and directory servicesÂ ( as Exchange Server does ) .
Exchange can notÂ remotely update desktop client machines unless they connect to the corporate network over a VPN or dialup networking link themselves .
Â
Thanks to the automatic Wide - Area Bonjour configuration of MobileMe 's BTMM , none of that is needed .
Â Â
MobileMe on Windows
Apple 's BTMM push updating service does not update Windows desktop apps , which must sync on a regular interval to be kept up to date with the cloud .
Rather than using Microsoft 's own desktop ActiveSync in Windows XP ( not to be confused with Exchange Server 's unrelated push messaging component of the same name ) , or its successor in Windows Vista , the âWindows Mobile Device Center , â 
Apple brought over its own sync technology , bundled within iTunes .
This is not new to MobileMe ; iTunes for Windows has long provided iPod , iPhone , and .
Mac data sync with Outlook on the PC .
This fact did n't prevent conspiracy theorists from complaining that iTunes 7.7 was âsneaking MobileMe onto Windowsâ after discovering optional new sync options in the latest version of iTunes . Â
During the iTunes install , Apple includes a MobileMe Control Panel that behaves identically with its Mac OS X counterpart , although on Windows there is no support for syncing anything apart from calendar , contacts , and bookmarks with the MobileMe cloud ( below ) .
Â Again , on Windows , there is currently no support for Back to My Mac or push updates , only sync .
Desktop Data Sync on Windows
MobileMe mail works with any standard POP or IMAP email program , but things are a bit more complicated in the realm of contacts and calendars , where there is currently not yet any widely accepted industry standards for exchanging data with client software .
This may change as CalDAV calendaring and CardDAV contacts catch on , and Apple is currently pioneering support for both in its server products , with iCal Server and the upcoming Address Book Server in Mac OS X Snow Leopard Server .
Google , IBM , Mozilla , Microsoft , Sun , Yahoo , and series of other industry heavyweights are also promoting the new standards .
Both CalDAV and CardDAV are based on the WebDAV standard Apple uses to power its iDisk and web hosting services in MobileMe .
Until those standards become fully supported in Windows apps , Apple is left to support whatever it can using the existing , proprietary APIs for PIM ( âpersonal information mangerâ ) data sync . Â
Apple syncs contacts to Microsoft Outlook , Vista 's Windows Contacts , Google 's Gmail Contacts , or the Yahoo Mail Address Book .
Because Outlook can have any number of local or network contacts services installed , iTunes syncs with Outlook 's primary contacts folder , which is by default the one set up in Personal Folders . Â
For calendar events , iTunes only syncs with Outlook .
Users of Vista 's Windows Calendar are out of luck until Microsoft finishes its sync strategy for Vista and opens its APIs to allow third parties to sync with the new application .
A variety of other programs and services on Windows can also sync with Outlook , and therefore can keep their data up to date with the MobileMe cloud as well .
However , the more independent devices and conduits that are linked together in syncing data , the more opportunity there is to introduce problems .
That 's why Apple developed a single Sync Services architecture in Mac OS X with a central truth database for auditing and vetting updates authoritatively .
Unfortunately , there 's nothing identical to it on Windows . Â
ActiveSync and Vista's Windows Mobile Device Center are really only designed to sync with Windows Mobile / WinCE devices , and as one Windows user noted , â Windows Mobileâs ActiveSync / WMDC sync process often ruins a good WiMo experience .â 
Additionally , WMDC can not even sync Windows Mobile devices with Vista 's own Windows Calendar , nor can the new app sync its calendar data with Outlook .
So it should come as no surprise that iTunes does not sync with Windows Calendar either . Â
For web bookmarks , Apple supports syncing with either Safari or Internet Explorer on Windows , but curiously not Firefox , which Apple recommends over Internet Explorer 7 for browsing the MobileMe web apps .
There are a number of Windows utilities for syncing bookmarks between Internet Explorer and Firefox however .
Cloud sync , push sync , and mobile push
On both the Mac and PC , POP or IMAP email is still retrieved from MobileMe on a schedule rather than being pushed as it is on the iPhone .
However , Mac OS X Mail , Mozilla Thunderbird , Outlook 2007 , and a variety of other desktop email applications can enable IMAP IDLE to allow the server to push new email to the client as soon as they are received for nearly Â instantaneousÂ messaging . Â
Contacts and calender items are kept in sync with the cloud at automatic fifteen minute intervals on Mac OS X Leopard , Windows XP , or Vista .
Using Mac OS X Tiger , synchronization only occurs hourly .
The frequency of sync can be dialed back to hourly , daily , weekly , or just set to manual for users who do n't want sync kicking in every few minutes .
A full sync session with MobileMe can be a processor and disk intensive operation , so you would n't want it happening continuously .
However , on Leopard a targeted sync will trigger every time the cloud has an update , if BTMM is configured .
That means if you make a change to your mobile or web calendar , Leopard will get a push update that will trigger a quick calendar - only sync session between the cloud and Sync Services that will result in an update in iCal . Â
On the iPhone and iPod touch , Apple has integrated full push messaging support for email , contacts , and calendar events into the new iPhone 2.0 software .
The point of push messaging is to conserve the battery life of mobile devices while providing rapid messaging updates .
It essentially turns email into something closer to instant messaging or SMS .
Rather than having the email program constantly polling for new messages , which would consume a lot of power , a specialized messaging server fires new messages to the device as they appear on the server .
Updates made to server side contacts and calendar events are delivered in the same way .
Some ambulance - chasing critics following the clumsy MobileMe launch decided that they found the service particularly disappointing because there was no bidirectional support for push updates on desktop client computers .
However , nobody provides full push messaging updates to desktop clients over the Internet , and particularly not to consumers , as we point out in the following segment comparing MobileMe to other consumer and corporate push messaging alternatives .
Push messaging is a service designed for mobiles .
At the same time however , iPhone users are unlikely to see an advantage in battery life after turning on push messaging because MobileMe enables more updates than were available previously .
Push messaging is easier on the battery than checking for email every few seconds , but the iPhone 's original software only allowed for automatic email updates every fifteen minutes .
With the speed and regularity of new updates comes additional battery consumption .
Users can enable push support for Mail , Contacts , Calendar , and Bookmarks individually ( below , under account settings on the iPhone ) .
How much overhead is added by push messaging will relate to how often updates are made on the server and therefore how frequently those updates need to be communicated to the iPhone .
Most users have seen a significant impact on battery life of around 20 % after turning on push messaging , although the recent 2.0.1 update seems to have helped a lot in this regard .

This week , the potential of the Internet to expose and disgrace when marriages fall apart came into stark relief as Tricia Walsh Smith , who is being divorced by Philip Smith , a theater executive , put a video on YouTube announcing that they never had sex , and yet she found him hoarding Viagra , pornography and condoms .
Not surprisingly , Mr. Smith ’s lawyer , David Aronson , called the video “ appalling ” and said : “ Mr. Smith is a very private person .
This is obviously embarrassing . ”
But in an era when more than one in 10 adult Internet users in the United States have blogs , according to the Pew Internet and American Life Project , many people are using the Web to tell their side of a marital saga .
Despite the legal end of a marriage , the confessions can stretch toward eternity in a steady stream of enraged or despondent postings .
In separation , of course , one person ’s truth can be another ’s lie .
Often the postings are furtive .
But even when the ex-spouse is well aware that he or she is starring in a blog and sues to stop it , recent rulings in New York and Vermont have showed the courts reluctant to intervene .
AT THE end of the Cold War the United States was supreme and unchallenged , Russia was in decay , poor , disorganised , with ill - equipped military forces .
At that time , many people believed the 21st century might have been the time for the human race to advance issues of decency , to establish a more permanent , international peace and really to see that relations between states would be governed by law and not by power .
Instead , we have a period of tragic and serious mistakes , a period of prejudice and of refusal to learn from history .
America 's leadership was critical to the establishment of the United Nations and to the establishment of a rules - based international system that would outlaw war unless necessary for self defence or sanctioned by the Security Council .
After the end of the Cold War , America could have done so much to continue the advance to an even more effective , rules - based system where law governed relations between states .
Instead , today 's America has pushed these high aspirations and noble principles aside and led us , step by step , to a point of crisis .
What went wrong ?
After the Cold War , the neo-conservatives sought to cement American supremacy .
Their underlying philosophy was to enshrine American power throughout this century and beyond , to recast the rest of the world in America 's image , if necessary by force of arms .
The neo - conservatives did not want the restraint of international agreements , of law or of organisation .
To them , September 11 , 2001 , was an opportunity to free America from those restraints .
Asus is set to launch another 10.2 in model in its line - up of Eee PC mini laptops .
The Asus Eee S101 will go onsale in September with a price tag of $ 900 ( £ 450 ) , making it the most expensive Eee PC to date .
The Eee PC range was originally conceived as a line of very low cost laptops with limited specifications but long battery life .
You may not know it yet , but you 'll almost certainly have a hybrid in your driveway before long .
With gas prices hitting new records and everyone in a tizzy about global warming , interest in - and demand for - the thrifty gas -electric vehicles is off the chart .
Sixty - two percent of people in the market for a new car are considering a hybrid , and some experts predict sales could hit 2 million a year by 2013 .
Do n't like the looks of the Toyota Prius and find the Honda Civic Hybrid a bit bland ?
No problem .
You 'll have 88 other models to choose from by then .
J.D. Power & Associates surveyed more than 4,000 new - car buyers for its annual Alternative Powertrain Study and found 62 percent are considering a hybrid .
That 's up from 50 percent last year , and Mike Marshall , director of automotive emerging technologies at J.D. Power , says it 's the biggest increase he 's ever seen .
He attributes it to two things .
" Fuel prices and awareness of the technology are driving the train , " he told Wired.com .
Gas -electric hybrids have entered the mainstream , he says , and people no longer think , " Ooooh .... it 's funky technology .
Let 's let someone else try it . "
The survey found people are less enamored with ethanol , with interest in so - called flex - fuel vehicles falling from 47 percent to 43 percent in the past year .
Marshall says the food - for - fuel debate ( which we 're wo n't wade into here ) has consumers less inclined to consider such cars .
He says 16 percent of those who discounted them entirely specifically cited concerns about using food crops for fuel and the possible impact on food prices .
That 's up from 8 percent in 2007 .
Consumers also are less inclined to consider clean diesels than in the past , in part because the price of diesel is about 72 cents a gallon higher than regular unleaded .
It also does n't help that diesels can be hard to find .
Marshall says most people are considering hybrids and alt - fuel vehicles because they 're sick of paying through the nose for gasoline .
The environmental benefits of such vehicles are n't a big concern , so if the price of gas comes down in any meaningful way , he says , so too will interest in the vehicles .
But if prices climb , so too will interest in hybrids .
Others say interest will only mount .
Newsweek , in a piece that cites unnamed " federal forecasters , " says there could be 89 hybrid models on the market by 2013 and annual sales could reach 2 million .
That kind of volume would account for 11 percent of the domestic vehicle market , a considerable hike from the 2.5 percent share hybrids have today .
These same unnamed feds predict plug - in hybrids could account for half the market by the middle of the century .
A Department and Energy spokeswoman and several plug - in hybrid advocates we contacted had no idea where Newsweek got that data .
If anyone knows , please let us know because we 'd like to see it .

Official Response to the September 11th AttackOfficials ' handling of the evidence of the September 11th attack has followed a clear pattern .
The physical evidence most important to forensic analysis of the crime was destroyed or removed from the crime scene never to be seen again .
Types of evidence not under the direct control of those officials were suppressed through a variety of means .
These include photographs , video footage , and various once - public documents .
Ireland 's decision to guarantee Irish banks ' deposits and debts for two years to calm investor concern could be followed by other countries .
'' This may be a template for rescues elsewhere if Irish banks can replenish their capital base , '' Harvinder Sian , a fixed - income strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in London said in a note today .
The guarantee of about 400 billion euros will last for two years and covers liabilities at Allied Irish Banks Plc , Bank of Ireland Plc , Anglo Irish Bank Corp. , Irish Life and Permanent Plc , Irish Nationwide Building Society and the Educational Building Society .
The measure came hours after the U.S. House of Representatives rejected a $ 700 billion financial - rescue package to buy troubled assets from financial companies to help ease the credit crunch .
The Irish plan compares with actions in Belgium and the U.K. , where governments have injected capital into individual banks , or seized them .
'' Certainly this will be looked at by governments elsewhere as a model , '' said Paul Niven , head of asset allocation at F&C Investments in London , which oversees $ 200 billion .
'' It 's likely that deposits could be guaranteed , but guaranteeing other parts of the balance sheet in places like the U.S. and the U.K. seems hugely complex . ''
The Irish government measure is '' not good for Irish sovereign risk near term , but we would not overdo the story as Irish debt / GDP is very low , '' Sian wrote .
'' This brings forward the recovery period , though admittedly there will be a lot of economic pain in between . ''
High
The perceived risk of a default by Ireland surged to a record after the government announcement .
Credit - default swaps on Ireland 's government bonds rose 30.6 basis points to an all - time high of 63.5 , according to CMA Datavision prices .
Credit - default swaps , contracts conceived to protect bondholders against default , pay the buyer face value in exchange company fail to adhere to its debt agreements .
Irish financial stocks rose after the announcement , with the country 's benchmark ISEQ index gaining as much 6.5 percent .
Irish Life & Permanent soared 28 percent to 4.57 euros as of 12:08 p.m. , Anglo Irish Bank increased 35 percent and Allied Irish gained 16 percent .
Bank of Ireland increased 16 percent .
'' We have to create confidence , '' Finance Minister Brian Lenihan said on RTE Radio in Dublin .
'' We can't bail out a particular bank .
That would n't be right .
What we have decided to do is give a general guarantee that the banks can lend in security and safety . ''
Bankruptcy
The tighter credit sparked last year by the collapse of the U.S. subprime mortgage market has already forced Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. to file for bankruptcy - court protection and prompted the U.S. government to take over American International Group Inc .
In Europe , Fortis and Dexia SA will both get state - backed rescues , while Bradford & Bingley Plc was seized in Britain .

The term “ Semantic Markup ” is bandied about freely , and with every year that passes , it makes me more and more nervous .
Herewith an exploration of what , if anything , those two terms mean when placed side by side .
( Warning : way too long . )
Visiting Waterloo ·
In late 1986 , I paid a visit to the University of Waterloo for a job interview at the New Oxford English Dictionary Project .
At some point , they sat me in front of a screen and showed me some of the text of the dictionary .
They started to explain what I was seeing , but it did n't really need explanation ; entries were marked with < entry > , etymologies with < etym > , definitions with < def > , and so on , and they all nested neatly within each other .
It immediately occurred to me to wonder why every document in the world was n't marked up like this , and I still wonder that , and observe with pleasure that more and more of them are .
Eventually I co-founded Open Text and did search engines and drifted into the SGML community , and was nervous about the notion of semantics as early as 1992 ; a certain proportion of that community asserted that SGML markup was semantic and that the semantics came from the DTD .
I hear continuing echoes of this when people hold forth on the virtues of using “ semantic ” markup on the Web , that is to say < cite > rather than < i > around the name of a book ( which , if you do a view source , you 'll see is the case with the reference to the dictionary above ) .
Smart people who care a lot , for example Mark Pilgrim , strive mightily to make markup more semantic , then are stricken with anguish and wonder whether it 's all worth it .
So , I wonder :
When is markup semantic ?
Is semantic - ness a binary condition ?
Where do semantics come from ?
Taxonomy of Markup · I use a taxonomy of markup which I 'm pretty sure was first advanced in the seminal November 1987 CACM article Markup systems and the future of scholarly text processing , by Coombs , Renear , and DeRose , which was the first place I ever encountered all the good arguments for what became XML all written down in an orderly way in one place .
But I do n't have a copy handy .
Anyhow , I did n't invent these terms .
Presentational Markup ·
This is what MS Word and other WP systems do ; they embed codes right in the text saying “ this is in bold ” , “ this is right - justified Palatino ” , and so on .
This contains no levels of indirection and is thus inflexible and offers poor longevity and reusability , but can be used to produce nice - looking pages .
Presentational markup is essentially always used with an authoring system that hides it from its user , such systems often making the essentially - false claim that What You See is What You Will Get .
Procedural Markup ·
This approach includes venerable unix tools like troff as well as TeX and PostScript .
The primitives remain presentational , but they are embedded in a procedural framework so you can have macros and subroutines , and the notion of the current graphics state can be made concrete , as anyone who 's gotten comfy with PostScript primitives like gsave and grestore knows .
Procedural markup can be authored directly by humans ; to this day a substantial proportion of Physics and Math research is published in hand - constructed in TeX or LaTeX .
Also , in the hands of a skilled practitioner , these techniques can produce very beautifully - rendered output .
People who use procedural markup have always tended to build up more and more and more elaborate macros / subroutines .
For example , you might take a series of instructions that produce 16 - point bold sans - serif text , and name it title .
Which brings us to ...
Descriptive Markup ·
This is really the right term for what XML ( and its predecessor SGML ) are trying to be .
The idea is that the markup does n't tell you what to do with a piece of text , it tells you what it is ; as the name suggests , describes it .
When I was spending a lot of my time teaching and preaching about XML , the term I finally settled on was “ labeling . ”
All XML does is provide a nice flexible internationalized way to label the elements of a data structure and ship them around with the labels attached .
Descriptive markup was born in the world of publishing technology , and its advantages for serious large - scale publishing are overwhelming , and have been presented more than enough times , so I wo n't go into them here .
With the application of XML to more or less everything in the world , not just publishing , it 's reasonable to ask if the descriptive - markup tag still applies .
The answer is , mostly , yes .
Now , some XML tags do n't really feel very descriptive at all , for example HTML's < b > and < xslt : apply - templates > .
And indeed most serious practitioners are aware of this and feel vaguely guilty in using this kind of thing .
But it turns out ( and this is one of the strategically good things about XML ) that even if the author had no semantic intent , any programmer can decide to use that tag any way they want in processing the text .
The first time I saw this happen was a dozen years ago on the dictionary project , when we started running statistical analysis of the millions of supporting quotations used to illustrate word usages to track temporal patterns in the arrival into and departure from the language of English words .
The dictionary editors were originally horrified ( “ We did n't design the structure of a definition to support that ! ” ) but it worked fine .
The Importance of Labels ·
It 's kind of surprising that XML has more or less taken over as the default method for wrapping up data to ship it from anywhere to anywhere .
Smart people have been working on this problem for years , and probably the most ambitious previous attempt in this direction is something called ASN.1 .
I personally have had nothing but horrible experiences with ASN.1 , but it has been put to use in all sorts of places including important pieces of the Internet infrastructure , and lots of people like it .
When you get an ASN.1 message , you can unpack it and you get the data items and their types .
So you know “ This is a fraction with 2 digits of precision , this is a 17 - character string , this is a non-negative integer ” and so on .
But , you do n't get labels .
XML , on the other hand , tells you “ this is called price , this is called Bill - To , and this is called quantity - shipped ” , but ( by default ) tells you nothing about data types .
To oversimplify , XML is winning and ASN.1 is losing .
There are a variety of reasons for this , but one of them is that it seems to be more important to know what something is called than what data type it is .
This result is not obvious from first principles , and has to count as something of a surprise in the big picture .
Semantics , Say What ?
· Semantics as a word is closely related to “ meaning ” .
For me , there are two scenarios where markup has semantics :
When a human understands it in context and may reasonably consider it as a basis for action .
When there is an expectation that there is software which when applied to the markup will produce a useful result .
Let 's reason by example .
Here is an example of markup that has semantics by both the criteria above :
< a href = " http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/ " >...</a>
Here is an example of markup that probably does n't have any semantics according to either criterion :
< rm rn = " 1 " />
Here 's an example of some markup that has semantics by the first criterion above , but not by the second .
< chunk xmlns= " http://www.tbray.org/ns/22 ">
The essays found on the web at < address >
http://www.tbray.org</address> are < adj> boring </adj > < adj> pedantic</adj > ravings < adverb>clumsily </ adverb > authored by a < adj> self - styled </adj > technologist .</ chunk >
I 'm quite confident that if there is any software out there that will do anything useful with that markup in that namespace , it had n't been written when I wrote this .
But anyone can read it and see what 's up .
For an example of markup that is semantic largely by the second criterion only check out the “ WordML ” produced by the new Microsoft Word .
Where Do Semantics Come From ? ·
The first ( human- oriented ) kind of semantics happen when you apply labels to chunks of text that can reasonably be expected to be meaningful to a person , and when you choose the labels with reasonable care .
That sounds awfully simple , but is not to be sneezed at .
The second kind of semantics is not a binary condition .
The HTML hyperlink uncontrovertibly has it ; the knowledge of HTML markup has penetrated the intellectual aether to the point that it can be assumed to be pretty well everywhere .
It is quite possible to have markup that is not as widely - known as HTML and provide software for it that does something useful with it , thus conferring semantics on that markup .
For example , the XML for ongoing includes a < finished > element which has semantics provided by the code that publishes ongoing , which exists on only two computers ( and is run by only one person ) , in the world .
So while < finished > is semantic , it is n't as semantic as < a href= " " > .
( Oops , used a < b > in that paragraph , because I do n't like the way the semantic alternative renders .
Take me out and shoot me . )
In fact , the XML Namespaces mechanism provides the hope of a future in which you might be able to achieve autodiscovery of software - provided semantics for markup vocabularies , which generally would be a good thing .
Schemas ·
The existence of a schema ( of whatever flavour ) is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for attaching semantics to markup .
Clearly , schemas can be helpful in many different ways at design - time and run-time .
But they 're not where the meaning lives .
In Conclusion ·
Descriptive markup is better than the alternatives .
Descriptive markup is not necessarily semantic .
The phrase “ semantic markup ” constitutes a claim that needs to be demonstrated before being accepted .
Semantics do n't come from schemas .
Perhaps , then , when we 're looking for semantics , we ought to base our search on the old IETF mantra : “ rough consensus and running code . ”
Would Jesus Christ sport a " Yes We Can " Obama '08 button on his tunic ?
Or would the Prince of Peace prefer a " Country First " McCain T - shirt ?
Your pastor might tell you at church today , shortly before he lets you know which political candidates deserve your vote .
Then , if their prayers are answered , the right politicians will be elected and the reverends will get busted by federal agents .
Today , more than 30 ministers from across the country plan to purposefully violate federal law by endorsing political candidates during their church sermons .
Religious people , like the rest of us , can say what they want .
It 's a free country .
But under a federal law that has existed for more than 50 years , religious organizations cannot engage in political speech while they also accept deductible contributions .
If they do , they risk losing their tax - exempt status .
Today 's protest is being organized by the Scottsdale - based Alliance Defense Fund , an advocacy group made up of Christian lawyers .
( Which sounds like an oxymoron on the scale of " business ethics , " " airline food " and " adult male . " )
I spoke last week with Gary McCaleb , an attorney with ADF , about what the group is calling " Pulpit Freedom Sunday . "
" This is an issue that needs to be addressed in federal courts , " McCaleb said .
" Fifty - four years of censorship is enough . "
The pastors plan to send copies of their sermons to the Internal Revenue Service to instigate some type of legal action .
The ADF wo n't announce which pastors would participate until after they preach their sermons .
To McCaleb and the attorneys at the defense fund , forcing a tax - exempt organization to clam up is a violation of First Amendment rights .
" The government has danced around the edges of this issue for a long time , " he said .
" People on both sides of the spectrum like to use it ( the IRS threat ) as a tool to silence pastors .
But the bottom line is that religious speech should be able to take place without the IRS sitting in the pews waiting to hear code words . "
He 's right .
The restrictions are a farce .
Not only because they fly in the face of the Constitution , but also because they do n't work .
Even when forced to parse their words , most pastors make it clear which candidate they support .
Churches have had an impact on American politics from the moment the continent was colonized .
Some good .
Some bad .
Religious leaders were among the first abolitionists .
The civil - rights movement of the 1960s owed much of its success to church support .
The movement 's most famous leader and figurehead was a reverend , after all .
In the 1980s , I attended a federal trial in Tucson in which a group of religious people was being prosecuted for having assisted illegal refugees from Central America .
They called themselves the Sanctuary Movement .
The same type of religious folks work today with programs such as Humane Borders .
And so , at this week 's church service , some pastors in America will preach about what the ADF describes as " the moral qualifications of candidates seeking political office . "
I know , another oxymoron .
But these are people who believe in miracles , which is what it would take to produce a politician who has " moral qualifications . "
I can't imagine how a pastor could adhere to biblical theology and endorse any political candidate , but they should be allowed to try without fear of losing their tax - exempt status .
Besides , I 'd guess that the King of Kings would not be intimidated by the IRS .

John and Sarah take on Katie Couric … together :
( ed.note : David posted this earlier .
I had n’t seen it until now .
My G-d , I almost feel bad for them .
When I heard that Couric was doing another interview with Palin — and even McCain too — I was figuring this was some kind of make - up , ‘ we ’re sorry you did so poorly the first time ’ retake .
But not exactly .
If you watch , Palin starts by not having any answer for why she told a voter something that McCain has attacked Obama for saying .
And as she ’s stumbling McCain jumps in and tries to talk for her , making a bunch of excuses for her that make her sound silly or like someone who ’s too out of it to be held responsible for something she said .
The gist of what he seems to say in her defense is ‘ Hell , look who we ’re talking about .
You ca n’t hold her responsible for her answer to a question like that just out of the blue , c’mon . ’
And then when he ’s done he goes with ‘ But I ’ll let her speak for herself ’ — jmm )
Travel plans for Senator Barack Obama ’s running mate , Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. , have yet to be finalized beyond his arrival this week in Denver for the Democratic National Convention .
But campaign advisers said Sunday that they were certain Mr. Biden would spend considerable time campaigning through Election Day in four swing states : Florida , Michigan , Ohio and Pennsylvania .
Mr. Biden has developed close ties with unions of firefighters and police officers and the Teamsters in his nearly 36 years as a senator from Delaware .
He is well known and liked in Ohio and Pennsylvania .
Roman Catholics and working - class Democrats count him as one of his own .
He has many Republican friends :
He wrote a blurb for a book by Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania , and Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska wore a Biden mask last Halloween .
And Mr. Biden ’s staunch support for Israel , most recently as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , is also expected to help Mr. Obama with Jewish voters in Florida and elsewhere , Obama advisers said .
“ It makes sense that he will campaign in the battlegrounds where people are most familiar with him , ” said David Axelrod , the Obama campaign ’s chief strategist .
“ But he also has broad appeal because of his passion about how badly this country needs change , and that ’s not just a Catholic message or Jewish message or Rust Belt message . ”
Modern processors are equipped with sophisticated branch prediction algorithms ( the Pentium family , for example , can predict a vast array of patterns of jumps taken / not taken ) but if they , for some reason , mispredict the next jump , the performance can take quite a hit .
Branching to an unexpected location means flushing the pipelines , prefetching new instructions , etc , leading to a stall that lasts for many tens of cycles .
In order to avoid such dreadful stalls , one can use a branchless equivalent , that is , a code transformed to remove the if - then - elses and therefore jump prediction uncertainties .
Let us start by a simple function , the integer abs ( ) function .
abs , for absolute value , returns … well , the absolute value of its argument .
A straightforward implementation of abs ( ) in the C programming language could be
inline unsigned int abs ( int x ) { return ( x < 0 ) ? -x : x ; }
Which is simple enough but contains a hidden if - then - else .
As the argument , x , is n’t all that likely to follow a pattern that the branch prediction unit can detect , the simple function becomes potentially costly as the jump will be mispredicted quite often .
How can we remove the if - then - else , then ?
Let us first introduce the sex ( ) helper function — I still use the mnemonic sex to amuse and chock friends and coworkers , but it comes from a Motorola 6809 instruction , s ign ex tend .
The sex function will return an integer where the sign bit of its argument have been copied in all the bits .
For example , sex ( 321) =0 , but sex( - 3)=0xff...ff .
This function is ideal to generate a mask based on the sign of the argument .
Of course , sex must be branchless to be of any use to us .
At the assembly language level the instruction exists on most processors ( it is one of the cbw ( convert byte to word ) , cwd ( convert word to double word ) , etc , instructions on x86 / AMD64 ) , but what can we do at the C language level to force the compiler to use the specialized instruction , or at least an efficient replacement ?
One can use the right shift operator :
inline unsigned int sex ( int x ) { return x >> ( CHAR_BIT*sizeof ( int ) - 1 ) ; }
where the ( compile - time ) safe expression ( CHAR_BIT * sizeof ( int ) - 1 ) evaluates to 15 , 31 , or 63 depending on the size of integers on the target computer ( CHAR_BIT comes from limits.h , and is worth 8 , most of the times ) .
However , this one - liner relies on the underlying processor ’s shift instruction which , in some case , can be dreadfully slow ( a few cycles for each bit shifted in micro- controllers ) or very fast ( one cycle simultaneously executed with other instructions in bigger processors ) .
One can also use an union , which will compile to memory manipulation instructions , completely removing shifts from the function :
inline int sex ( int x ) { union { // let us suppose long is twice as wide as int long w ; // should be hi, lo on a big endian machine struct { int lo , hi ; } } z = { .w=x } ; return z.hi ; }
This will basically force the compiler to use the cbw family of instructions .
Let us rewrite abs using sex :
inline unsigned int abs ( int x ) { return ( x ^ sex ( x ) ) - sex(x ) ; }
Now , how does that work ?
If x is negative , sex (x ) will be 0xff ... ff , what is , filled with ones .
If x is not negative ( zero or positive ) , sex ( x ) will be zero .
So , if the number of negative , it computes its two ’s complement , otherwise leaves it unchanged .
For example , if x is negative , say - 3 ( no point in using large , weird , numbers here ) , sex ( - 3 ) is 0xff ... ff and - 3 ^ 0 xff ... ff is the same as ~ ( - 3 ) , the bitwise negation of - 3 .
Then , we subtract - 1 ( which is the same as adding 1 ) , computing ~ ( - 3 ) +1 which is the correct two ’s complement .
If on the other hand x is positive ( or null ) , sex ( x ) evaluates to zero , and lo !
( x ^ 0 ) - 0 = x , which leaves the value of x unchanged !
Of course , when compiling the above abs function the compiler generates very little code , especially when one uses the union version of sex .
For example , on Intel x86 , it could compile down to
abs : cdq eax xor eax , edx sub eax , edx
assuming the value is already in ( and returned by ) eax .
The cdq instruction sign - extends eax into the edx register : it promotes a 32 bits value to a 64 bits value held in edx:eax .
Now , we can use sex for other if - then - else type function .
Take min and max for example .
The pair is usually implemented as
inline int min( int a , int b ) { return ( a < b ) ? a : b ; } inline int max ( int a , int b ) { return ( a> b ) ? a : b ; }
Using sex , the pair becomes
inline int min( int a , int b ) { return b + ( ( a - b ) & sex ( a - b ) ) ; } inline int max ( int a , int b ) { return a + ( ( b - a ) & ~ sex ( b - a ) ) ; }
which are now thoroughly branchless .
Hurray !
Can you think of other common , simple functions , what would benefit from branch removal ?

During the LinuxWorld expo in San Francisco , I met with Linux Foundation president Jim Zemlin to talk about the future of the open - source Linux operating system and the impact it will have on emerging mobile and embedded technologies .
Zemlin sees significant opportunities for Linux adoption on low - cost subnotebooks and mobile Internet devices .
These products are beginning to transform the personal computing market and could broadly redefine consumer expectations for hardware cost and mobility .
Existing Linux - based subnotebooks , like the Asus Eee PC , have experienced an impressive degree of popularity .
The success of the Eee has compelled other hardware makers to get into the game , spawning a wide variety of competing products .
Linux is an ideal choice in this space because it eliminates software licensing costs and can be pared down to offer faster boot times and consume less storage than Windows .
Linux - based subnotebooks are becoming increasingly like appliances and can take advantage of cloud computing to deliver rich functionality without much resource overhead .
As this trend continues to expand , Zemlin believes that we will see the emergence of innovative new business models that shift the role of the devices away from general - purpose computing and reposition them as vectors for delivery of highly specialized content and services .
This will allow vendors to create new revenue streams that could be used to subsidize the cost of the hardware and the connectivity that ties the hardware into the cloud .
Jim Zemlin
Although this view is radically antithetical to some conventional notions of convergence , there is already some evidence that it works .
The best example , Zemlin says , is Amazon 's Linux - based Kindle e-book reader .
The Kindle uses unique hardware that is highly specialized for its intended purpose , it offers free connectivity that is subsidized by content sales , and the device itself is relatively affordable .
Zemlin thinks that subnotebooks could become like " fashion accessories " as the prices drop and make them into easy impulse buys for consumers .
For instance , he suggests that a major retailer like Target could make a specially branded back - to - school subnotebook aimed at young students .
Another example he suggests is a mobile device for sports enthusiasts that offers tight integration with ( potentially ad - supported ) web services that show instant replays , scores , statistics , and game schedules .
The subnotebook is currently the dominant form factor in low - cost Linux computing products , but the range of possibilities extends far beyond that .
An illustration of this point is Intel 's expansive vision for Moblin , a Linux - based software platform designed for devices that use the company 's Atom processors .
Intel says that Atom and Moblin provide a unified hardware and software platform that can be adopted almost anywhere , including in - vehicle " infotainment " systems , medical instruments , media centers , handheld tablet devices , and all sorts of other products ( for a pretty sexy look at what Intel has in mind , check out the Moblin concept video ) .
Set - top boxes are another area where there is huge potential for Linux - based platforms that leverage the cloud - oriented content and service business model envisioned by Zemlin .
A good example of a compelling Linux - based set - top solution is the Neuros OSD , which uses an open Linux - based media platform for ARM devices that Neuros is developing in collaboration with TI .
Regardless of whether Linux ever gains traction on the desktop , it 's easy to imagine a future where the open source operating system is everywhere else .
It could become the universal platform that runs both the massive underlying infrastructure of the cloud and the myriad smart devices that soak up the cloud 's data and services .
If you 're the type to watch the late stock tickers , you might have noticed that NVIDIA 's stock just took a pretty big hit , down 24 percent to $ 13.56 -- that 's because the company just informed investors that " significant quantities " of previous - generation graphics chips have been failing at " higher than normal rates , " and that it 's lowering its Q2 estimates due to pricing pressure .
NVIDIA will be taking a $ 150 M to $ 250 M charge against earnings next quarter to cover the cost of repairing and replacing the affected chips , but did n't specifically announce what products were defective , just that they include GPUs and " media and communications processors . "
Laptop makers have apparently already been given an updated GPU driver which kicks in fans sooner to reduce " thermal stress " on the GPU , and NVIDIA says it 's talking to its suppliers about being reimbursed for the faulty parts .
That 's great and all , but we 'd really rather know which chips specifically are failing -- if you 're serious about playing in the big leagues , you better come clean , guys .
Dead Army vaccine scientist eyed in anthrax probe Associated Press
Published : Friday August 1 , 2008
Print This Email This Federal prosecutors investigating the 2001 anthrax attacks were planning to indict and seek the death penalty against a top Army microbiologist in connection with anthrax mailings that killed five people .
The scientist , who was developing a vaccine against the deadly toxin , committed suicide this week .
The scientist , Bruce E. Ivins , worked for the past 18 years at the government 's biodefense labs at Fort Detrick , Md . For more than a decade , he worked to develop an anthrax vaccine that was effective even in cases where different strains of anthrax were mixed , which made vaccines ineffective , according to federal documents reviewed by the AP .
U.S. officials , who spoke on condition of anonymity because of ongoing grand jury proceedings , said prosecutors were closing in on Ivins , 62 .
They were planning an indictment that would have sought the death penalty for the attacks , which killed five people , crippled the postal system and traumatized a nation still reeling from the Sept. 11 attacks .
Officials said that Ivins , who shared in the 2003 Decoration for Exceptional Civilian Service , was under investigation to determine whether he released the anthrax as a way to test his vaccine .
The decoration is the highest honor given to civilian Pentagon employees .
The Justice Department has not yet decided whether to close the investigation , officials said , meaning it 's still not certain whether Ivins acted alone or had help .
One official close to the case said that decision was expected within days .
If the case is closed soon , one official said , that will indicate that Ivins was the lone suspect .
Ivins ' attorney said the scientist had cooperated with investigators for more than a year .
" We are saddened by his death , and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law , " attorney Paul F. Kemp said .
" We assert his innocence in these killings , and would have established that at trial . "
Kemp said that Ivins ' death was the result of the government 's " relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo " White House press secretary Dana Perino said President Bush was aware there were " about to be developments " in the case but did not elaborate .
Authorities were investigating whether Ivins released the anthrax as a way to test his vaccine , officials said .
The Justice Department has not yet decided whether to close the investigation , officials said , meaning it 's still not certain whether Ivins acted alone or had help .
One official close to the case said that decision was expected within days .
If the case is closed soon , one official said , that will indicate that Ivins was the lone suspect .
Ivins was " hounded " by aggressive FBI agents who raided his home twice , said Dr. W. Russell Byrne , a colleague who worked in the bacteriology division of the Fort Detrick research facility for 15 years .
Byrne said Ivins was forcefully removed from his job by local police recently because of fears that he had become a danger to himself or others .
The investigation led to Ivins being hospitalized for depression earlier this month , Byrne said .
He said he does not believe Ivins was behind the anthrax attacks .
Ivins died Tuesday at Frederick Memorial Hospital in Maryland .
Tom Ivins , a brother of the scientist , told The Associated Press that his other brother , Charles , had told him that Bruce committed suicide and Tylenol might have been involved .
The Los Angeles Times , which first reported that Ivins was under suspicion , said the scientist had taken a massive dose of a prescription Tylenol mixed with codeine .
The Fort Detrick laboratory and its specialized scientists for years have been at the center of the FBI 's investigation of the anthrax mailings .
In late June , the government exonerated a colleague of Ivins ' , Steven Hatfill .
Hatfill 's name has for years had been associated with the attacks after investigators named him a " person of interest " in 2002 .
Unusual behavior by Ivins was noted at Fort Detrick in the six months following the anthrax mailings , when he conducted unauthorized testing for anthrax spores outside containment areas at the infectious disease research unit where he worked , according to an internal report .
But the focus long stayed on Hatfill .
Ivins was the co-author of numerous anthrax studies , including one on a treatment for inhalation anthrax published in the July 7 issue of the journal Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy .
Henry S. Heine , a scientist who had worked with Ivins on inhalation anthrax research at Fort Detrick , said he and others on their team have testified before a federal grand jury in Washington that has been investigating the anthrax mailings for more than a year .
He declined to comment on Ivins ' death .
FBI vehicles with tinted windows had watched Ivins ' home for a year , neighbor Natalie Duggan , 16 , said .
" They said , ' We 're on official business , ' " she said .
Tom Ivins said Friday that federal officials working on the anthrax case questioned him about his brother a year and a half ago .
" They said they were investigating him , " he said from Ohio , where he lives , in a CNN interview .
Ivins played keyboard and helped clean up after masses at St. John the Evangalist Roman Catholic Church in Frederick , where a dozen parishoners gathered after morning Mass to pray for him Friday .
The Rev. Richard Murphy called Ivins " a quiet man .
He was always very helpful and pleasant . "
The government paid Hatfill $ 5.82 million to settle a lawsuit contending he was falsely accused and had been made a scapegoat for the crimes .
" We are not at this time making any official statements or comments regarding this situation , " said Debbie Weierman , a spokeswoman for the FBI 's Washington field office , which is investigating the anthrax attacks , said Friday .
Five people died and 17 were sickened by anthrax powder in letters that were mailed to lawmakers '
Capitol Hill offices , TV networks in New York , and tabloid newspaper offices in Florida .
Two postal workers in a Washington mail facility , a New York hospital worker , a Florida photo editor and an elderly Connecticut woman were killed .

The lambda calculus is a Turing - complete language , but does n’t handle concurrency very well ; in particular , there ’s no concept of a reference as opposed to a value .
The lambda calculus has three productions :
The first production , , is a variable ; the second is an application of one term to another ; and the third is abstraction .
The beta -reduction rule says
if the variables in are all free in .
The part in brackets reads “ with replacing . ”
There are different evaluation strategies that one can use with the lambda calculus ; one strategy that always reduces the term to its normal form if it has one is called “ lazy evaluation . ”
With this strategy , you only reduce a term if it ’s necessary to do so .
The blue calculus builds this strategy into the language .
Here is an application term in the blue calculus :
Blue calculus splits application into four parts , or “ processes ” :
a “ small ” application in which a term may only be applied to a variable ; a resource assignment in which a variable is associated to a one - time use of the term ; a new variable declaration that introduces a new bound variable into scope ; and a symmetric monoidal product of terms , thought of as “ parallel processes ”
The monoidal unit here is the “ do - nothing ” term .
Blue calculus also splits beta reduction into two parts :
a “ small ” beta reduction if is free in ; and a resource fetching rule that gets the value of a variable only when it ’s needed .
By splitting things up this way , the blue calculus allows patterns like nondeterministic choice .
The blue calculus term
has two valid reductions ,
or
.
It also allows for resource contention ; here , the resource assignment acts as a mutex :
or .
The application term is a linear term .
If the term uses more than once , then only the first usage will be able to fetch the resource : a resource assignment is consumed by the small beta rule .
However , the blue calculus also supports resource replication :
This allows the blue calculus to subsume both the lambda calculus and the pi calculus in a nice way .
Blue terms are formed as follows :
Lambda terms embed like this :
Pi terms embed like this :
There are reduction rules for scope migration , associativity , distributivity , replication , and so forth ; see the paper for more details .
The upshot of all this is that blue calculus variables are really references , and so one can build the whole theory of concurrent objects on top of it .

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) -
The 20 - year - old son of Grammy award - winning rapper and producer Dr. Dre was found dead over the weekend at his home in Woodland Hills , California , according to the Los Angeles County coroner ’s office .
Andre Young Jr. was out with friends Friday night and his mother later found him “ unresponsive in bed ” when she tried to wake him early Saturday morning , coroner ’s spokesman Ed Winter told Reuters .
She immediately called paramedics , who later pronounced Young dead at the scene .
“ Dr. Dre is mourning the loss of his son Andre Young Jr. Please respect his family ’s grief and privacy at this time , ” said a statement released by his spokeswoman .
An autopsy was conducted and the cause of death is still pending toxicology and other tests , which may take six weeks or more , Winter said .
Dr. Dre , whose real name is Andre Young , rose to stardom in the 1980 ’s with rap group N.W.A ’s controversial gangster rap album “ Straight Outta Compton . ”
Dr. Dre later went on to produce and perform solo , winning a Grammy award in 1992 for “ The Chronic ” album ’s single “ Let Me Ride . ”
He founded both Death Row Records and Aftermath Records and is recognized for bringing many rap phenoms into the mainstream , including Eminem , Snoop Dogg and 50 Cent .

Advertisement A French skydiver 's attempt to break the world free fall record failed to get off the ground when his balloon lifted off without him on board .
Michel Fournier , 64 , hoped to break four world records by free falling 40,000 m ( 25 miles ) from a balloon in Saskatchewan , western Canada .
He hoped to bring back data vital for astronauts and those at high altitudes .
But his helium balloon detached from its capsule as it was being inflated , and drifted away into the sky .
It is not the first time Michel Fournier has had to abandon his record attempt Mr Fournier was hoping to break the record for the fastest and longest free fall , the highest parachute jump and the highest balloon flight .
He was planning to jump from a point three times higher than a commercial jetliner flies .
A former paratrooper , he originally planned to make the jump in France , but the government refused him permission , saying it was too dangerous .
The fall was expected to last around 15 minutes , and Mr Fournier planned to deploy his parachute about 6,000 m above ground .
He has made two unsuccessful attempts before , in 2002 and 2003 .
Mr Fournier was to wear a pressurised suit to protect him from the extreme low pressure and temperatures down to - 100C .
Sophisticated camera equipment was supposed to record key moments of the jump , particularly when he broke the sound barrier at 35,000 m .
His parachute was set to open automatically if he lost consciousness during the jump - though there was no facility to eject from the balloon during the ascent .
The current altitude record for a parachute jump is held by Colonel Joe Kittinger of the US Air Force .
In 1960 he jumped from 31,333 metres ( 102,800 feet ) .

Fourth of July is the ultimate all - American holiday .
Part of what makes it so American is the associated schwag .
I ca n’t think of a single 4th I ’ve celebrated without beer and BBQs , flags and fireworks , corn on the cob , and hot dogs .
Here ’s a list of the eight major Independence Day accessories–and the companies behind them :
Beer : Anheuser - Busch , King of Production
( Image : longtail.com )
Anheuser - Busch is the biggest brewing company in the United States , with a 48.8 % share of national beer sales .
By revenue , it ’s the world ’s fourth - largest brewing company ( InBev , which tried to purchase Anheuser - Busch , is the second - largest brewing company in the world ) .
Lesser - known facts : 14 of A - B ’s 15 breweries abroad are located in China .
One is in the UK .
Eight countries outside the US brew Budweiser locally : Canada , Argentina , Ireland , Japan , Italy , South Korea , Spain , and Russia .
A flavor named Budweiser NA Green Apple is sold to tantalize Saudi Arabian palates .
Surprising A - B strategic equity investments include : Negro Modelo , Tsingtao , Redhook , and Widmer Brothers .
BBQs : Weber Made the Grill
( Image : crossthebreeze.wordpress.com )
In 1958 , George Stephen invented a new kind of grill .
Stephen , a Weber Brothers Metal Works employee , created a dome shaped grill with a rounded lid — the first prototype of the classic Weber kettle grill .
Today , upwards of 85 million American households own a grill .
The Weber kettle grill started it all , even the gas grill , which the company introduced in 1985 .
Lesser - known fact : Weber conducts an annual survey of people and their grills .
Their conclusion for this year ?
People like their grills colorful .
And people with grills entertain at home more often than people without them .
I guess personality just is n’t enough to draw people over to your house .
American Flags : It ’s All About Annin
( Image : visi.com )
Annin & Co. , arguably America ’s first flag company , made some old and important flags .
Like these :
• It was an Annin flag that flew at the inauguration of President Zachery Taylor , starting an inaugural tradition that has continued through the inauguration of President George W. Bush .
• An Annin flag draped the coffin of President Abraham Lincoln on its journey from Washington D.C. to Springfield , Illinois .
• The U.S. Marines raised an Annin flag atop Mount Suribachi on Iwo Jima in 1945
• NASA selected an Annin flag to participate in Apollo 11 ’s mission to the moon in 1969 .
Today , the company claims to be America ’s biggest and oldest flag manufacturer .
Lesser - known fact : Annin certifies its flags are not made in China —err , that all of its American flags are “ made in the USA of materials that are domestic in origin and that all processes in every step of its manufacture were completed in USA facilities with USA labor . ”
Fireworks : Diamond Sparkler is the Little Company That Can
( Image : howstuffworks.com )
We get most of them from China .
But one sparkler company , Diamond Sparkler , has endured the outsourcing binge .
Indeed , it ’s the only remaining sparkler manufacturer in the country .
Retailers have been able to import China - made sparklers at much lower wholesale prices for years .
Compounding the problem has been the illegal dumping of foreign produced sparklers in America .
“ Diamond Sparkler struggles each year to make a profit , ” said Bruce Zoldan , President of Phantom Fireworks .
“ But I just ca n’t envision something as American as sparklers , with its association with the 4th of July , not being made in this country . ”
Lesser - known fact :
There * is* an American fireworks manufacturer !
Hot Dogs : Wienermaker Does Good
( Image : gothamist.com )
Oscar Meyers Wiener is part of Kraft Foods , a company I was surprised to learn two lesser - known facts about .
One , its chair and CEO is a woman : Irene Rosenfeld .
Secondly , Kraft has a recent history of donating aid to disaster - stricken countries .
For example , they made a $ 150,000 donation to the Red Cross after China ’s devastating Sichuan earthquake .
They donated $ 50,000 to Myanmar cyclone victims through the World Food Programme .
$ 20,000 went to the American Red Cross to help victims of the Georgia / Oklahoma / Missouri storms and tornadoes ; $ 50,000 went to Iowa tornado relief through the same organization .
Not bad for a megacorporation that puts krap in most of its food .
Corn : The All - American Inefficiency Crop
( Image : ecotality.com )
According to the National Corn Growers Association :
The United States is the largest corn producer in the world .
In 2003 , corn growers in the United States produced 256.905 million metric tons ( MMT ) of corn , exporting nearly 20 % of the crop ( 51.0 MMT ) .
The top five destinations for U.S. corn are : Japan , Mexico , Taiwan , Canada and Egypt .
Lesser - known fact :
This year , we produced too much corn .
The problem with corn is that it ’s a ) heavily subsidized by the government , and b ) uses more energy to produce than calories it provides .
As a result , the nation is wasting energy on growing much more corn than it needs to .
Case in point : is high fructose corn syrup really the highest - quality , best - tasting , and healthiest sweetener out there ?
No .
Then why does it find its way into almost every piece of food we buy ?
Baseball Caps : Head to China New Era Heads the Pack
( Image : made - in - china.com )
UPDATE : New Era , a Buffalo - based company , is the “ largest sports - licensed headwear company in the world . ”
Deals with MLB , the NHL , the NCAA , and the NBA ensure that business stays lucrative for this domestic company .
Readers , thanks for pointing out that all baseball caps do not come from China–a fact that makes me very happy .
The Peoples ’ Republic of China was proud to produce your Starter cap .
I could n’t find a single baseball cap manufacturer in the United States .
Companies like Xing Chung , on the other hand , boast total annual sales of nearly $ 30 million .
They export to Asia , Western Europe , Eastern Europe , Australia , Central / South America , and , of course , North America .
Their major customers include McDonald ’s , KFC , BMW , Coca - Cola , Nokia , Siemens , Philips , Samsung , and a variety of other known corporations .
Lesser - known fact :
That ’s about as much as MySpace.com made per month last year .
Pool Toys : From China to Suburbia
( Inage : toys53.com )
They almost invariably come from China .
Sometimes they impale children .
Pool toys , it turns out , have a dark side .
But they ’re too much fun to dismiss .
Lesser - known fact :
This year , somebody designed an amphibious PC workstation so that users can float in a pool while they work .
Count me in .
I ’m signing off for the week .
Happy 4th of July , everyone !
Our gaze might be on the markets melting down , but the upheaval we are experiencing is more than a financial crisis , however large .
Here is a historic geopolitical shift , in which the balance of power in the world is being altered irrevocably .
The era of American global leadership , reaching back to the Second World War , is over .
You can see it in the way America 's dominion has slipped away in its own backyard , with Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez taunting and ridiculing the superpower with impunity .
Yet the setback of America 's standing at the global level is even more striking .
With the nationalisation of crucial parts of the financial system , the American free - market creed has self - destructed while countries that retained overall control of markets have been vindicated .
In a change as far - reaching in its implications as the fall of the Soviet Union , an entire model of government and the economy has collapsed .
Ever since the end of the Cold War , successive American administrations have lectured other countries on the necessity of sound finance .
Indonesia , Thailand , Argentina and several African states endured severe cuts in spending and deep recessions as the price of aid from the International Monetary Fund , which enforced the American orthodoxy .
China in particular was hectored relentlessly on the weakness of its banking system .
But China 's success has been based on its consistent contempt for Western advice and it is not Chinese banks that are currently going bust .
How symbolic yesterday that Chinese astronauts take a spacewalk while the US Treasury Secretary is on his knees .
Despite incessantly urging other countries to adopt its way of doing business , America has always had one economic policy for itself and another for the rest of the world .
Throughout the years in which the US was punishing countries that departed from fiscal prudence , it was borrowing on a colossal scale to finance tax cuts and fund its over - stretched military commitments .
Now , with federal finances critically dependent on continuing large inflows of foreign capital , it will be the countries that spurned the American model of capitalism that will shape America 's economic future .
Which version of the bail out of American financial institutions cobbled up by Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson and Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke is finally adopted is less important than what the bail out means for America 's position in the world .
The populist rant about greedy banks that is being loudly ventilated in Congress is a distraction from the true causes of the crisis .
The dire condition of America 's financial markets is the result of American banks operating in a free - for - all environment that these same American legislators created .
It is America 's political class that , by embracing the dangerously simplistic ideology of deregulation , has responsibility for the present mess .
In present circumstances , an unprecedented expansion of government is the only means of averting a market catastrophe .
The consequence , however , will be that America will be even more starkly dependent on the world 's new rising powers .
The federal government is racking up even larger borrowings , which its creditors may rightly fear will never be repaid .
It may well be tempted to inflate these debts away in a surge of inflation that would leave foreign investors with hefty losses .
In these circumstances , will the governments of countries that buy large quantities of American bonds , China , the Gulf States and Russia , for example , be ready to continue supporting the dollar 's role as the world 's reserve currency ?
Or will these countries see this as an opportunity to tilt the balance of economic power further in their favour ?
Either way , the control of events is no longer in American hands .
The fate of empires is very often sealed by the interaction of war and debt .
That was true of the British Empire , whose finances deteriorated from the First World War onwards , and of the Soviet Union .
Defeat in Afghanistan and the economic burden of trying to respond to Reagan 's technically flawed but politically extremely effective Star Wars programme were vital factors in triggering the Soviet collapse .
Despite its insistent exceptionalism , America is no different .
The Iraq War and the credit bubble have fatally undermined America 's economic primacy .
The US will continue to be the world 's largest economy for a while longer , but it will be the new rising powers that , once the crisis is over , buy up what remains intact in the wreckage of America 's financial system .
There has been a good deal of talk in recent weeks about imminent economic armageddon .
In fact , this is far from being the end of capitalism .
The frantic scrambling that is going on in Washington marks the passing of only one type of capitalism - the peculiar and highly unstable variety that has existed in America over the last 20 years .
This experiment in financial laissez - faire has imploded .
While the impact of the collapse will be felt everywhere , the market economies that resisted American - style deregulation will best weather the storm .
Britain , which has turned itself into a gigantic hedge fund , but of a kind that lacks the ability to profit from a downturn , is likely to be especially badly hit .
The irony of the post - Cold War period is that the fall of communism was followed by the rise of another utopian ideology .
In American and Britain , and to a lesser extent other Western countries , a type of market fundamentalism became the guiding philosophy .
The collapse of American power that is underway is the predictable upshot .
Like the Soviet collapse , it will have large geopolitical repercussions .
An enfeebled economy cannot support America 's over - extended military commitments for much longer .
Retrenchment is inevitable and it is unlikely to be gradual or well planned .
Meltdowns on the scale we are seeing are not slow - motion events .
They are swift and chaotic , with rapidly spreading side - effects .
Consider Iraq .
The success of the surge , which has been achieved by bribing the Sunnis , while acquiescing in ongoing ethnic cleansing , has produced a condition of relative peace in parts of the country .
How long will this last , given that America 's current level of expenditure on the war can no longer be sustained ?
An American retreat from Iraq will leave Iran the regional victor .
How will Saudi Arabia respond ?
Will military action to forestall Iran acquiring nuclear weapons be less or more likely ?
China 's rulers have so far been silent during the unfolding crisis .
Will America 's weakness embolden them to assert China 's power or will China continue its cautious policy of ' peaceful rise ' ?
At present , none of these questions can be answered with any confidence .
What is evident is that power is leaking from the US at an accelerating rate .
Georgia showed Russia redrawing the geopolitical map , with America an impotent spectator .
Outside the US , most people have long accepted that the development of new economies that goes with globalisation will undermine America 's central position in the world .
They imagined that this would be a change in America 's comparative standing , taking place incrementally over several decades or generations .
Today , that looks an increasingly unrealistic assumption .
Having created the conditions that produced history 's biggest bubble , America 's political leaders appear unable to grasp the magnitude of the dangers the country now faces .
Mired in their rancorous culture wars and squabbling among themselves , they seem oblivious to the fact that American global leadership is fast ebbing away .
A new world is coming into being almost unnoticed , where America is only one of several great powers , facing an uncertain future it can no longer shape .
• John Gray is the author of Black Mass : Apocalyptic Religion and the Death of Utopia ( Allen Lane )
The BBC scenes from Georgia on Friday , August 22 , 2008 clearly showed columns of Russian armor leaving Georgia .
Sort of .
Those Russian units are now going to occupy South Ossetia ... and the new protective perimeter that Russia has cleared out and will now enforce with whatever lethal force is necessary .
Russian General Nogovitsyn was on BBC clearly stating : " Russia will continue to enforce the peace in this area .
Our troops are withdrawing ; no one will be allowed to put armor or heavy artillery in this area EVER AGAIN .
As the map clearly shows , WE ( Russia ) are in total control . "
He added : " Russia is pulling out on its terms and at its pace . "
BBC then switched to a Zionist West British talking - head ( Michael Wooldridge ) grumbling that the Russians were not following the script from the Georgia - US screenplay .
NATO warships are having an ' exercise ' in the Black Sea .
Meanwhile , the Russian fleet has made it clear it is not going to allow any re-arming of Georgia .
If that happens , Georgia will be toast .
What was comical was that right behind those Russian armored units were OSCE Jeep Cherokee Police vehicles but were apparently not allowed to come any further than the edge of this new Russian Peacekeeping Zone to protect Abkhazia and South Ossetia .
( OSCE - Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe ) Even though OSCE voted on Tuesday to not provide ' peacekeepers ' in the New South Ossetia , they have flooded Georgia with new Jeep Cherokee police units .
Read on and you will understand why OSCE is NOT WELCOME inside the New South Ossetia unless they are there to clearly document the war crimes that were just inflicted on South Ossetia .
OSCE just proved to Russia that it is not to be trusted .
For those who have been reading these essays , and can remember what I have disclosed , I ask that you take the time to read this one very slowly and think .
Use the brain you were born with to think and see clearly what is really going on .
I have never in my life feared there would be a nuclear war between the US and Russia ... until just recently .
The US and their EU allies have now reached the point of failure and desperation .
They will tell any lie , they will commit any unspeakable crime .
They have committed war crimes in Kosovo , Afghanistan , Iraq and just this month in South Ossetia .
Russia just drew the line in the sand ... it stops or the biggest shit - storm ever on this planet is what is coming next .
Russia has just made it abundantly clear that Russians are not going to be subjected to war crimes and genocide by these Zionist New World Order thugs any longer .
Russia has just made it abundantly clear that the territorial integrity of Russia and those wishing to live as friends and citizens of Russia WILL BE ABSOLUTELY RESPECTED BY THE ZIONIST WEST and WILL BE DEFENDED - ABSOLUTELY - BY RUSSIA .
This is the New Russia ... not the Cold War USSR .
Most people above room temperature are now beginning to see quite clearly that the United States and some of its allies are , in fact , war criminals .
It recently came out that France was behind the genocide in Rwanda ... while the French UN ambassador was pontificating about the horrors of that very genocide .
These people lie as easily as they blink their eyes .
They are sub - human in their regard for their fellow man .
They are war criminals in suits , fancy offices with fancy sounding titles .
I am getting many emails from people who are just now , almost 10 years after the crime , seeing clearly that the US and certain EU buddies committed genocide on the Slavic Serbian Christians of Kosovo .
I have known for many years that the last thing the Russians want is another calamitous war .
Between Bolshevik Zionist Communism they lost 30 - 40 million people who would not kneel down to the Zionist god of communism .
Due to World War II , they lost another 20 million after Zionists helped to create Nazism .
I am now convinced that if the Zionist New World Order does not get its way ... and they are failing miserably to get their way ... they will take the entire world down with them rather than fail .
We are now facing the most dangerous mindset of the Zionists : " If we ( the Zionists ) cannot have it all no one will have it . "
They are like a bunch of punk juvenile delinquents who refuse to let anyone on this planet freely choose how they want to live .
Now , for the first time ... EVER ... Russia is in position to build a nation with a lifestyle similar to that of the US and EU ... in some ways even BETTER because they are refusing to let Zionism in the door .
The Zionist West assumes that only it has a right to such a comfortable lifestyle .
Watch closely and you will see such a mindset when they mumble or boast or brag ... their arrogance is palpable .
The Zionist West essentially feels Russia must OBEY it ... and that Russia needs a ' regime change . '
Read the Zbigniew Brzezinski TIME article again ... and pay attention to his arrogant air of ' superiority ' over the Slavic Russians .
Of course , it is the Zionist West which is clearly and blatantly the aggressor ... but Zionists use their mass media monopoly and huge influence over governments to point the finger of blame at Russia - because it will NOT roll over and obey .
The Grand Chessboard is lost .
Russia won .
Zbigniew can pontificate and use all the big fancy words he wishes but that will never change the fact that his idiotic plan was DOA .
It was stillborn in his delusional mind .
That DC used such a doomed scheme for a strategic plan is to its everlasting shame and proves DC is unfit to lead the world .
The fraud Global War on Terror and the mass genocidal wars for oil are lost .
The result ?
About 5.5 billion people are turning their backs on the US , Canada , UK , EU ( mainly France and Germany ) and Zionist Israel .
This lunacy of backing Israel blindly for 60 years to the severe and brutal detriment of many Islamic nations in the Middle East ( and now the Islamic peoples of the Caspian Basin , Iran and Pakistan ) has proven to be a colossal mistake and monumental failure of US foreign policy .
There is only so much belittling , demeaning , humiliating , abusing , maiming and killing any peoples of any land will tolerate .
The US is no longer welcome in much of this world .
The US is not hated for its freedoms .
It is hated for its policies and what these butchers think they alone have the right to do to other nations , other human beings .
I was living in the Washington DC area when Desert Storm happened .
I knew it was not adding up , something was amiss and lies where being piled upon lies to sell that story to America .
It took years for the truth to come out .
I was in direct contact with the White House almost every day during 1991 - 1992 and the bits and pieces I was getting did not add up to the truth .
Since I knew about Bridas Corporation and their business dealings long before 9 - 11 , I knew when Bush pointed the finger at Afghanistan that what the US ( and their allies in Europe ) wanted were those vast amounts of oil and natural gas in the Caspian Basin .
They had to have that pipeline .
That is why NATO is now in Afghanistan and Barky ( Brzezinski ) was in Europe telling them that they had to contribute more to this bogus Global War on Terror .
It is their ' duty ' as citizens of the Zionist New World Order .
That pipeline deal is 7 years behind schedule and the Taliban control more of Afghanistan each day .
Every move to corner or provoke Iran has failed .
I have known about Operation Gladio for many years .
NATO 's Secret Armies were conducting terrorism by NATO , the US and UK against innocent civilian populations ( in West Europe ) and then they pointed the finger of blame at Russia ... when Russia had nothing to do with it .
If you want to become ILL at the deceit of the US , UK and NATO , get a copy of ' NATO 's Secret Armies ' by Dr. Daniele Ganser , PhD .
The man did his homework and what is in the book is from investigative reporters , court cases and government documents .
It happened , the US and UK as terrorists against innocent people in Europe .
I have talked to Dr. Ganser and he has been on my email update list since I returned to the EU .
Maybe Jeff Rense can air him sometime because the information is crucial for people to see the TRUTH .
That is why Kosovo did not surprise me .
Here was practically all of Europe chiming in to go kill Serbian Christians and then to invade to pretend to get rid of those ' Christian - hating Muslims . '
Just two years later , 9 - 11 and the ill - conceived Global War on Terror were launched .
It was another Operation Gladio , but was really Operation Kill Christians under the code name of Operation Kosovo UNMIK and NATO .
In their evil minds they were not killing Christians , they were killing Slavic people .
The elitist snobs of the Zionist - controlled EU think they are much better than Slavic people , and the Russians are Slavic and so are the Serbs .
Remember back ­ even in the Clinton Administration ­ the 1993 bombing of WTC , ' terror ' , ' terrorists ' , ' ethnic cleansing of Christians ' , etc .
We have to intervene in Bosnia to defend the Christians .
What a mockery !
That sleazy bastard Clinton had the CIA and Zalmay Khalilzad arming the Muslims to go kill the Christians that sleazy bastard Clinton said he was going to save .
I have been wondering why OSCE was the first one to intervene in this Georgia fiasco .
That was an odd emissary to send for such a serious matter , the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe .
It is merely another NGO and front company for the Zionist New World Order .
Most do not know that Russia is a member of that group .
You see , that way the EU can claim they have influence ' all the way to the Pacific Ocean ' since the Russia land mass ends at the Pacific Ocean .

The US and EU have been warned many times , no NATO on Russian borders , period .
There was a live press conference from Moscow on BBC [ 4 am to 4:33 am New York time Tuesday ] .
It included the Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov and OCSE head Alexander Stubb .
That acronym stands for The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and Russia is a member .
In fact , Russia is the most powerful member of that organization .
Finland 's new Foreign Minister and OSCE Chairman - in - Office , Alexander Stubb , speaks at a press conference following his appointment , Helsinki , 4 April 2008 .
( Finnish MFA / Raino Heinonen ) < end insert >
Alexander Stubb was the first EU representative to arrive in Tbilisi and Moscow to try to resolve this matter , or so I thought .
Evidently , he was trying to do damage control .
Read on .
Scant information has surfaced about a Georgia gunboat attacked a Russian naval vessel sometime on the date of August 7 , 2008 .
The world was told this matter started on August 8 while Bush was at the Beijing Olympics .
That was considerably before the Western Zionist media reported this ' territorial dispute ' and started to paint the picture that it was " Russia aggression " rather that what it is ­ US , Zionist Israel , Ukraine , NATO , EU genocide and aggression against Russian citizens in South Ossetia .
I watched Putin during the Olympics ceremonies and he was looking in Bush 's direction like he was viewing someone who deserves no respect .
Putin was looking at Bush , who was sitting lower than him , like he was looking at a big dog turd that had plopped down in the dignitaries section of the Beijing Olympic Stadium .
I think Putin already knew that a Russian ship had been attacked on August 7 , unprovoked .
And then , on August 8 , Georgia attacked a Russian freighter and the response was from a Russian frigate that turned the Georgian gunboat into an instant oil slick .
That was while Georgia was shelling South Ossetia and its mercenaries were storming the nation and killing many .
Then Russia responded with armored units , tanks , and its air force .
The Russian Navy scrambled out of Sevastopol , Ukraine and blockaded Georgia .
While the Russian army blew Georgia out of South Ossetia , their jets continued to pound targets inside of Georgia .
Yes , there is a cease fire but Russia is putting a protective zone around Abkhazia and South Ossetia .
There is a new " peacekeeping border " and will be permanently manned by the Russian military , not OSCE .
This news story came out of Moscow .
Folks , this is major , so pay attention and connect the dots .
http://www.russiatoday.com/news/news/29324
Deputy Chief of Russia 's General Staff , Colonel - General Anatoly Nogovitsyn August 21 , 2008 , 14:54 OSCE observers knew about Georgia 's attack - Moscow Russian troops are leaving Georgia and will arrive in the peacekeepers ' zone of responsibility by tomorrow evening .
The statement came during a regular briefing from Defence Ministry in Moscow .
According to the Ministry , the situation in the Georgian conflict zone remains tense .
The Defence Ministry claims that OSCE observers knew of the date of Georgia 's attack , but did not report it to Russian peacekeepers .
The spokesman added that after violating the peacekeeping agreement , Georgian forces will no longer be allowed in the conflict zone .
" Russia believes that from now on only Russian armed forces have the right to perform the peacekeeping duties in the conflict zone .
They have consistently and accurately complied with the 1992 bilateral agreement .
By violating its mandate , Georgia no longer has the right to participate in the peacekeeping mission , " says the Deputy Chief of Russia 's General Staff , Colonel - General Anatoly Nogovitsyn .
Most do not know that OSCE was involved in South Ossetia as part of the peacekeeping force .
That is an internationally recognized peacekeeping operation .
There were some Russians , some OSCE and Georgians and God knows who else .
I have information out of Moscow that some of the ' peacekeepers ' were from Azerbaijan and Tajikistan .
The EU has pushed membership to the borders of Russia .
The US , UK and EU have now pushed NATO to the borders of Russia - even when Russia kept warning them to back up and stop the provocations .
Bush has placed US military bases in the former CIS nations to protect the oil and natural gas they are trying to steal from those countries .
< start insert >
http://www.cdi.org/russia/200-12.cfm
" US and NATO military installations on the territory of former Soviet Central Asian republics are instrumental in providing logistics support for multi-national forces and their operations .
As is known , the United States and NATO have reliably asserted themselves at Uzbek , Kirghiz and Tajik bases , i.e. Manas ( Bishkek ) , Karshi , Kulyab , Kokaidy and Termez .
All these airfields were to have been used for re-supply missions , for transporting humanitarian relief aid and for deploying search - and - rescue units .
However , the first few French Mirage - 2000 fighters have landed in Manas not so long ago .
Until then , reconnaissance aircraft , including Predator drones , used to operate rather actively from all bases in the interests of the US - NATO air - force formation being used against Al - Qaeda units .
Moreover , ranger units , AWACS - type aircraft , psychological - warfare and reconnaissance planes were deployed there . " < end insert >
The entire NATO - EU - US agenda is trying to be crammed down Russia 's throat and they are failing , and failing , and failing .
There were two , stupid simultaneous moves .
First , the bogus Bush Missile Shield ; and secondly , the attack on South Ossetia .
We just witnessed 17 years of progress on improving relations between Russia and Europe go up in smoke due to the idiot George W Bush and his idiot buddies in the EU and NATO .
Dos Morons , the Zwei Twits Bush and Rice , have been trying to tell Russia who they can and cannot do business with .
Sheer madness .
When OSCE voted ' no ' Tuesday I misread what the vote meant .
I thought OSCE was honestly trying to resolve this matter but that is not the case at all .
They were part of just stabbing Russia in the back in South Ossetia .
They KNEW Georgia was going to attack , aided and abetted by the US , Ukraine and Israel , and DID NOT TELL RUSSIA .
Folks , any nation would consider that a MAJOR BREACH OF TRUST .
I can now imagine exactly what Putin and Medvedev had to say to Merkel - Ferkel and why she was about to crap her britches .
I am sure NATO got the same basic message from Moscow and explains why , even in an unanimous vote , Scheffer of NATO was as nervous as a cat in a dog kennel .
I can also well imagine what the Russian leaders had to say to Alexander Stubb of OSCE .
" Otebis ot menya ! "
It is blunt and vulgar , look it up if you wish .
Due to what was just done to South Ossetia , it would be an appropriate thing to say to these murderous bastards of the Zionist New World Order .
The psychopaths in the US , UK and NATO are now trying to tell Russia what areas of ' their territory ' will and will not remain Russian .
What areas holding Russian passports ' will and will not ' remain part of Russia , aligned with Russia .
If these idiots in the US , UK , EU and NATO deem an area as theirs as a ' geostrategic imperative ' , Russia has to heel and OBEY according to these idiots .
Folks , that 's the equivalent of Russia informing the US that TEXAS and FLORIDA are no longer part of the US and are now part of Russia .
Note that such arrogance is never seen from Russia ... only from these arrogant twits of the Zionist New World Order have such delusional visions of grandeur , control and masters of this world .
These idiots are literally out of their damned minds !
This goes way past Georgia not respecting the territorial decisions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia .
This is now the US , EU and NATO trying to dictate to Russia what parts of Russia belong to it ... and what part belongs to the Zionist New World Order .
It is a big fancy - word lunatic idea ...' geostrategic imperative '... and Russia is being ordered to OBEY .
They are DEMANDING Russia honor all territorial wishes in Georgia while , on the other hand , they are not respecting the ' territorial integrity ' of Russia .
That is what is going on here and the Russian response is a DNA - level " NYET !
Otebis ot menya ! "
Russia offered passports to Ukraine citizens who do not want to be part of NATO and this Zionist New World Order .
The Yuschenko response was to put Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko under investigation .
The Ukrainian Prime Minister is many times more popular in Ukraine ( and better looking ) than the Zionist - puppet Yuschenko .
High - Level Political Dissension Ukraine ?
That was predictable for two reasons .
Ukrainians are lining up for Russian passports in the Crimea area , that part closest to GEORGIA .
The Crimea area is the eastern part of Ukraine and is already heavily populated with RUSSIANS who have no desire to live under the New Pathetic Zionist Ukraine .
Soros , Big Oil and this Zionist NWO agenda are being trumped by Russia both in Georgia and Ukraine and the Soros - sponsored White Stream 1 and White Stream 2 pipelines from Georgia to the Crimea area of Ukraine are probably now DEAD .
Former UNMIK in Kosovo , Bernard Kouchner , ( mentioned in my last article on Rense ) was recently on a BBC photo op mumbling that Russia now threatens all of the democracies in the CIS regions , all formerly part of the USSR .
It is those CIS regions which are sitting on a mother lode of oil and natural gas .
That is what The Grand Chessboard , Global War on Terror , colossal oil and gas grab are all about .
The recent TIME article by Zbigniew Brzezinski mirrored that same comment .
Kouchner and Sarkozy are also trying to push through the Lisbon Treaty in Ireland WITHOUT A VOTE on the referendum and the Irish are not budging .
THE IRISH DEMOCRATIC VOTE WILL STAND .
These people do not respect the democratic process ; they only respect their ability to manipulate it at will for the glory of the Zionist New World Order and those democratic processes that serve their agenda .
If they can not get their way ( like Sarkozy , Bush , Rice , et al ) they turn on the media machines and start lying out their pathetic asses .
Of course , while Kouchner was vacillating between mumbling and pontificating , he failed to mention that France is now positioning Mirage 2000 fighter jets at US BASES IN THE CASPIAN .
If you missed that above , go back and read it again .
The US and its allies are provoking Russia on all fronts and at every border they can get at , and it is ALL ABOUT OIL , NATURAL GAS and PIPELINES and ZIONIST NEW WORLD ORDER HEGEMONY .
That is where most are missing the point .
The US is merely the military might of the Zionist New World Order .
Nothing more .
These parasites are buried like ticks everywhere in the EU , NATO , UK , OSCE , UN , etc .
At first , I looked at it as US hegemony but no , this is Zionist New World Order hegemony , and Russia has to obey ... but , thank God , will not .
A Russian naval task force is due in Syrian waters and may be there right now .
Both Syria and Jordan recently met with the Russian leaders .
I think Russian nuclear arms and heavy armor , artillery , etc , will soon be parked in Syria and Jordan .
There has also been news regarding ' Russian nukes in the Mediterranean . '
I think the next Russian move will be to put Russian nukes in Egypt and surround the deadly nuclear beast , Israel , which thinks it is above all laws and answerable to no one .
It still will not ratify the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and probably never will .
Signing could negate the ability of Israel to use nuclear terrorism on its neighbors , the EU and the US .
Due to the EU rolling over for BushCo stupidity and City of London pressure , Russian missiles will now be poised along its border aimed right down the throats of the Poles and the rest of the EU .
The EU , especially those European nations that were part of the USSR and border with Russia , can now count on the fact that Russian armored divisions , fully equipped with artillery , surface - to- surface missile systems ( conventional and nuclear ) , will be right across the border from them and could be on their butts within an hour or two .
The Russian Bear has taken the gloves off and those massive claws are ready to shred anyone who commits the slightest hostile act towards Russia along that border .
Most in the EU is not happy about this intentional provocation of Russia , and the stirring up of hostilities by the US and it war - on - Russia Zionist buddies in Western Europe .
The EU opinion of the US is dropping faster than the US dollar .
I am absolutely certain that the Global War on Terror started in Kosovo .
It did not start on September 11 , 2001 .
That was just the trigger event to attack Afghanistan to take over that pipeline project .
Think about the recent news .
Russia signs major defense , aluminum and oil deals with Indonesia .
Russian signs major oil and gas deal with Venezuela .
The Saudis want to buy Russian arms because the US arms sales to Israel and Saudis always gives the upper hand to Israel .
What is fundamentally wrong within a nation and mindset that contracts and pens have to be responded to with military force and genocide ?
The US and EU tried to knuckle Iran under by freezing their accounts in EU and Iran withdrew $ 75 billion and signed a major transport deal with Russia for its oil and gas .
China and India have signed huge oil and natural gas deals with Iran .
Turkmenistan recently signed a major deal with Russia and another one with China .
Kazakhstan is now realizing that its best business decision is to sell its energy to Russia and China .
Watch these Zionist New World
Order thugs become even more shrill because not only Russia will NOT obey , the CIS nations will not obey , either .
After almost THREE DECADES of deceit regarding the Caspian Basin , the natural gas is now going to primarily go to Russia , India and China .
The US is losing its ass in the Caspian Basin due to lousy leadership and a dog - turd of a strategic plan .
Both Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan are now moving on without the US and Zionist New World Order .
This US loss means its EU Zionist allies are losing , too .
News broke yesterday that India is buying $ 2 billion in missiles from Russia .
India Places $ 2B Order For Russian Missiles Venezuela is also buying a large amount of Russian arms , as has Indonesia .
All of those actions are ' against the wishes ' of the US and the Zionist New World Order .
The EU and US did not get those cushy new arms contracts .
The Zionist Israel thugs did not get any shekels , either .
The MSM is putting up a barrage of talking heads on TV spouting off the standard line that Russia has to ' obey ' or it will be excluded from ' the clubs . '
They are actually using that phrase ( ' the clubs ' ) to describe G8 membership , relations with NATO , US , the 2014 Olympics in Sochi , Russia , etc. Russia just told NATO there will be no more relations between Russia and NATO .
The Russian response has been emphatic and swift ... and appropriately stern .
It is apparent that the US and NATO have provoked Russia repeatedly , and NATO has maneuvered itself right to the border of Russia .
The US has put military bases in the CIS regions where the oil and gas are , and France has recently joined them .
That is why the Zionist New World Order wanted Sarkozy to win the last election .
Now France is back into the NATO fold after years of not being in NATO .
France pulled out of NATO many years ago due to the NATO 's Secret Armies , and the acts of BLATANT TERRORISM by the US , UK and NATO against French citizens .
Now they have Zionist OP MAN SARKO in office and France is back in as a member of terrorist NATO .
It is now apparent that Russia is going to encircle Zionist Israel .
That will make it much harder for that little ' democracy ' to employ nuclear extortion and force its will on others .
Americans should throw a big party ... but most wo n't figure it out until the thermonuclear bombs begin to blossom over America .
Most will yawn and keep right on watching teevee , shopping and supporting stupid American Zionist policies regarding Israel and the Middle East .
As I 've said , it 's apparent the US , EU and NATO think they have the right to dictate to Russia on matters regarding its territorial sovereignty .
The messages from Russia are very clear and no one has to learn Russian to understand them .
NO Russian citizen will be subjected to Zionist Western genocide .
Period .
And the territorial integrity of Russia WILL BE RESPECTED ... or heads will roll and asses will be shredded .
What we are witnessing are shrewd and powerful Russian moves to break the back of the Zionist New World Order .
Go Russia !
The entire world has had more than enough .

The discovery was made by a boy walking his dog on the bank of a river in the Wairarapa region of the North Island , an area settled by Europeans only after the establishment of a colony by the New Zealand Company in 1840 .
Misinterpreted fragments of leg bones , teeth and brow ridges found in Palau appear to be an archaeologist 's undoing , according to researchers at three institutions .
They say that the so - called dwarfs of these Micronesian islands actually were modern , normal - sized hunters and gatherers .
Scientists from the University of Oregon , North Carolina State University and the Australian National University have refuted the conclusion of Lee R. Berger and colleagues that Hobbit - like little people once lived there .
" Our evidence indicates the earliest inhabitants of Palau were of normal stature , and it counters the evidence that Berger , et al , presented in their paper indicating there was a reduced stature population in early Palau , " said University of Oregon anthropologist Greg C. Nelson .
" Our research from whole bones and whole skeletons indicates that the earliest individuals in Palau were of normal stature but gracile .
In other words , they were thin . "
Berger , an American - raised paleoanthropologist at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg , South Africa , stunned archaeologists in March with his claim -- based on skeletal fragments collected from two caves exposed to tidal activity -- that small - bodied humans may have lived in isolation and suffered from insular dwarfism on the islands 1,000 to 3,000 years ago .
Berger initially found fragmented human remains while vacationing in Palau , and returned later for excavations under a grant from the National Geographic Society .
Nelson and NCSU anthropologist Scott M. Fitzpatrick , who earned his doctorate at the UO and based his dissertation on Palauan culture , reviewed full skeletal remains and cultural evidence dating back to almost 3,500 years ago .
Their Australian co-author Geoffrey Clark also has studied multiple Palauan cultural sites dating to approximately 3,000 years ago .
They argue that Berger , an expert on much earlier humans dating to the Pleistocene , failed to review existing documentation , much of it published by Nelson or Fitzpatrick .
Much of their rebuttal comes from remains unearthed by Fitzpatrick and Nelson at Chelechol ra Orrak , only miles from Berger 's two sites .
Among these whole remains are bone pieces that match -- some are even smaller that fragments found by Berger -- and come from much larger bodies than those claimed by Berger .
" I think Berger 's primary mistakes were his not understanding the variation in the skeletal population in which he was working , using fragmentary remains again in a situation where he did n't understand variation , and stepping outside his own area of expertise , which , I think all scientists try not to do but sometimes we do , " Nelson said .
In their paper , Nelson , Fitzpatrick and Clark provide detailed information on the island chain 's geography , early migration patterns and cultural history based on a meta - analysis of their own research and studies done by others on the islands .
" Although we have not seen the material that Berger et al base their results on , we can speak to the diversity and normalcy of human skeletal series from throughout the archipelago that have been excavated from several burial caves over the last decade , as well as the an abundance of archaeological , linguistic and historical data indicating a general continuity of cultural traits over a period of three millennia , " they wrote in the paper .
" Archaeological data also do not suggest a separate isolated group evolving differently ( biologically or culturally ) , although there are subtle differences and changes that occur through time . "
Skeletal evidence , Nelson said , reveals three main areas where Berger 's conclusions were flawed :
Berger , as his primary evidence of the existence of small stature humans , pointed to fragments of femoral heads , the round balls atop the body 's longest bone that connects it to the hip .
Nelson concurs that these heads were often small compared to today 's humans but that they connected femurs of modern - sized individuals -- with females averaging about 5 - foot , 1 - inch in height -- who were slightly built and subsisted off available food sources .
At least two femoral heads analyzed by Nelson from full skeletons were smaller than those cited by Berger .
Having an intact femur provides a usually accurate starting point for extrapolating body height .
Berger argued that his fragmentary cranial evidence indicated brow ridges common to very ancient human foreheads ( picture those of Neanderthals ) .
Nelson and colleagues argue that all cranial measurements they analyzed point to modern - sized heads .
They also noted that limestone dissolved in water -- very common to the island chain 's karst environment -- running across bodies buried at or just below the surface will create the easily misinterpreted lumpy appearance on brow ridges .
Berger said teeth and orthodontia fragments suggested megadontism -- abnormally large teeth , a condition common in the pre-modern , small - bodied hominins that he often studies .
Nelson says that large teeth were indeed common in early Palauans but simply reflected a hunter - gatherer society .
Smaller teeth evolved as cultures turned to agriculture , he said .
" Had [ Berger 's team ] compared their scant dental metric data with those of other regions in the Pacific , or elsewhere in the world , they would have seen that large teeth are not uncommon in early peoples of these regions , " Nelson and colleagues wrote .
" One of his biggest mistakes was rushing to publish , " Nelson said of Berger .
" He did not take the time to understand the area in which he was working -- its entire history , not just the skeletal stuff , " he said .
" Any time you work anywhere , you have to understand this history .
You just can't walk in and cowboy it , pull some stuff out and draw conclusions in the absence of understanding the bigger picture . "

Abiogenic petroleum origin is a body of hypotheses which propose that petroleum and natural gas deposits are mostly formed by inorganic means , rather than by the decomposition of organisms .
Thomas Gold 's deep gas hypothesis states that the origin of some natural gas deposits were formed out of hydrocarbons deep in the earth 's mantle .
Theories explaining the origin of petroleum as abiotic , however , are generally not well accepted by the scientific community , and are rejected by most researchers and scientific theories on the subject . [ 1 ]
Earlier studies of mantle - derived rocks from many places have shown that hydrocarbons from the mantle region can be found widely around the globe .
However , the content of such hydrocarbons is in low concentration .
[ 2 ]
While there may be large deposits of abiotic hydrocarbons , globally significant amounts of abiotic hydrocarbons are deemed unlikely . [ 3 ]
Overview hypotheses [ edit ]
Some abiogenic hypotheses have proposed that oil and gas did not originate from fossil deposits , but have instead originated from deep carbon deposits , present since the formation of the Earth . [ 4 ]
Additionally , it has been suggested that hydrocarbons may have arrived on Earth from solid bodies such as comets and asteroids from the late formation of the Solar System , carrying hydrocarbons with them . [ 5 ] [ 6 ]
The abiogenic hypothesis regained some support in 2009 when researchers at the Royal Institute of Technology ( KTH ) in Stockholm reported they believed they had proven that fossils from animals and plants are not necessary for crude oil and natural gas to be generated . [ 7 ] [ 8 ]
In his 2014 publication Chemistry of the Climate System , [ 9 ] German chemist Detlev Moller documents sufficient reliable evidence to show that both processes can be shown to co-exist : that they 're not mutually exclusive .
History [ edit ]
An abiogenic hypothesis was first proposed by Georgius Agricola in the 16th century and various additional abiogenic hypotheses were proposed in the 19th century , most notably by Prussian geographer Alexander von Humboldt , [ when ? ] the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev ( 1877 ) [ 10 ] and the French chemist Marcellin Berthelot . [ when ? ]
Abiogenic hypotheses were revived in the last half of the 20th century by Soviet scientists who had little influence outside the Soviet Union because most of their research was published in Russian .
The hypothesis was re-defined and made popular in the West by Thomas Gold who developed his theories from 1979 to 1998 , and published his research in English .
Abraham Gottlob Werner and the proponents of neptunism in the 18th century regarded basaltic sills as solidified oils or bitumen .
While these notions proved unfounded , the basic idea of an association between petroleum and magmatism persisted .
Alexander von Humboldt proposed an inorganic abiogenic hypothesis for petroleum formation after he observed petroleum springs in the Bay of Cumaux ( Cumaná ) on the northeast coast of Venezuela . [ 11 ]
He is quoted as saying in 1804 , " the petroleum is the product of a distillation from great depth and issues from the primitive rocks beneath which the forces of all volcanic action lie " .[ citation needed ]
Other early prominent proponents of what would become the generalized abiogenic hypothesis included Dmitri Mendeleev [ 12 ] and Berthelot .
In 1951 , the Soviet geologist Nikolai Alexandrovitch Kudryavtsev proposed the modern abiotic hypothesis of petroleum . [ 13 ] [ 14 ]
On the basis of his analysis of the Athabasca Oil Sands in Alberta , Canada , he concluded that no " source rocks " could form the enormous volume of hydrocarbons , and therefore offered abiotic deep petroleum as the most plausible explanation .
( Humic coals have since been proposed for the source rocks . [ 15 ] ) Others who continued Kudryavtsev 's work included Petr N. Kropotkin , Vladimir B. Porfir 'ev , Emmanuil B. Chekaliuk , Vladilen A. Krayushkin , Georgi E. Boyko , Georgi I. Voitov , Grygori N. Dolenko , Iona V. Greenberg , Nikolai S. Beskrovny , and Victor F. Linetsky .
Astronomer Thomas Gold was a prominent proponent of the abiogenic hypothesis in the West until his death in 2004 .
More recently , Jack Kenney of Gas Resources Corporation has come to prominence , [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] supported by studies by researchers at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm . [ 7 ]
Foundations of abiogenic hypotheses [ edit ]
Within the mantle , carbon may exist as hydrocarbons — chiefly methane — and as elemental carbon , carbon dioxide , and carbonates . [ 18 ]
The abiotic hypothesis is that the full suite of hydrocarbons found in petroleum can either be generated in the mantle by abiogenic processes , [ 18 ] or by biological processing of those abiogenic hydrocarbons , and that the source - hydrocarbons of abiogenic origin can migrate out of the mantle into the crust until they escape to the surface or are trapped by impermeable strata , forming petroleum reservoirs .
Abiogenic hypotheses generally reject the supposition that certain molecules found within petroleum , known as biomarkers , are indicative of the biological origin of petroleum .
They contend that these molecules mostly come from microbes feeding on petroleum in its upward migration through the crust , that some of them are found in meteorites , which have presumably never contacted living material , and that some can be generated abiogenically by plausible reactions in petroleum . [ 17 ]
Some of the evidence used to support abiogenic theories includes :
Recent investigation of abiogenic hypotheses [ edit ]
As of 2009 , little research is directed towards establishing abiogenic petroleum or methane , although the Carnegie Institution for Science has reported that ethane and heavier hydrocarbons can be synthesized under conditions of the upper mantle . [ 23 ]
Research mostly related to astrobiology and the deep microbial biosphere and serpentinite reactions , however , continue to provide insight into the contribution of abiogenic hydrocarbons into petroleum accumulations .

Primordial hydrocarbons in meteorites , comets , asteroids and the solid bodies of the Solar System [ citation needed ]
Primordial or ancient sources of hydrocarbons or carbon in Earth [ 5 ] [ 6 ]
Primordial hydrocarbons formed from hydrolysis of metal carbides of the iron peak of cosmic elemental abundance ( chromium , iron , nickel , vanadium , manganese , cobalt ) [ 26 ]
isotopic studies of groundwater reservoirs , sedimentary cements , formation gases and the composition of the noble gases and nitrogen in many oil fields
the geochemistry of petroleum and the presence of trace metals related to Earth 's mantle ( nickel , vanadium , cadmium , arsenic , lead , zinc , mercury and others )
Most serious researchers view the theory as easily debunkable with basic scientific knowledge , often placing it in the realm of pseudoscience or conspiracy theories .
Some common criticisms include :
If oil was created in the mantle , it would be expected that oil would be most commonly found in fault zones , as that would provide the greatest opportunity for oil to migrate into the crust from the mantle .
Additionally , the mantle near subduction zones tends to be more oxidizing than the rest .
However , the locations of oil deposits have not been found to be correlated with fault zones .
If oil were naturally generated in the earth , it would follow that depleted oil reserves would refill themselves over time .
Proponents of the abiogenic theory often claim that the supply of oil from the earth is effectively limitless .
However , it is possible ( and easy ) to deplete oil deposits , and once depleted , they do not refill .
Proposed mechanisms of abiogenic petroleum [ edit ]
Primordial deposits [ edit ]
Thomas Gold 's work was focused on hydrocarbon deposits of primordial origin .
Meteorites are believed to represent the major composition of material from which the Earth was formed .
Some meteorites , such as carbonaceous chondrites , contain carbonaceous material .
If a large amount of this material is still within the Earth , it could have been leaking upward for billions of years .
The thermodynamic conditions within the mantle would allow many hydrocarbon molecules to be at equilibrium under high pressure and high temperature .
Although molecules in these conditions may disassociate , resulting fragments would be reformed due to the pressure .
An average equilibrium of various molecules would exist depending upon conditions and the carbon - hydrogen ratio of the material . [ 27 ]
Creation within the mantle [ edit ]
Russian researchers concluded that hydrocarbon mixes would be created within the mantle .
Experiments under high temperatures and pressures produced many hydrocarbons — including n-alkanes through C 10 H 22 — from iron oxide , calcium carbonate , and water . [ 18 ]
Because such materials are in the mantle and in subducted crust , there is no requirement that all hydrocarbons be produced from primordial deposits .
Hydrogen generation [ edit ]
Hydrogen gas and water have been found more than 6,000 metres ( 20,000 ft ) deep in the upper crust in the Siljan Ring boreholes and the Kola Superdeep Borehole .
Data from the western United States suggests that aquifers from near the surface may extend to depths of 10,000 metres ( 33,000 ft ) to 20,000 metres ( 66,000 ft ) .
Hydrogen gas can be created by water reacting with silicates , quartz , and feldspar at temperatures in the range of 25 °C ( 77 °F ) to 270 °C ( 518 °F ) .
These minerals are common in crustal rocks such as granite .
Hydrogen may react with dissolved carbon compounds in water to form methane and higher carbon compounds . [ 28 ]
One reaction not involving silicates which can create hydrogen is :
Ferrous oxide + water → magnetite + hydrogen 3FeO + H 2 O → Fe 3 O 4 + H 2 [ 5 ] [ dubious discuss ]
The above reaction operates best at low pressures .
At pressures greater than 5 gigapascals ( 49,000 atm ) almost no hydrogen is created . [ 5 ]
Thomas Gold reported that hydrocarbons were found in the Siljan Ring borehole and in general increased with depth , although the venture was not a commercial success . [ 29 ]
However , several geologists analysed the results and said that no hydrocarbon was found .
[ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ 33 ] [ 34 ]
Serpentinite mechanism [ edit ]
In 1967 , the Ukrainian scientist Emmanuil B. Chekaliuk proposed that petroleum could be formed at high temperatures and pressures from inorganic carbon in the form of carbon dioxide , hydrogen and / or methane .
This mechanism is supported by several lines of evidence which are accepted by modern scientific literature .
This involves synthesis of oil within the crust via catalysis by chemically reductive rocks .
A proposed mechanism for the formation of inorganic hydrocarbons [ 35 ] is via natural analogs of the Fischer - Tropsch process known as the serpentinite mechanism or the serpentinite process . [ 22 ] [ 36 ]
C H 4 + 1 2 O 2 → 2 H 2 + C O {\displaystyle \mathrm { CH_{4}+{\begin{matrix}{\frac {1}{2}}\end{matrix}}O_{2}\rightarrow 2H_{2}+CO} } ( 2 n + 1 ) H 2 + n C O → C n H 2 n + 2 + n H 2 O {\displaystyle \mathrm {( 2n+1 ) H_{2}+nCO\rightarrow C_{n}H_{2n+2}+nH_{2}O} }
Serpentinites are ideal rocks to host this process as they are formed from peridotites and dunites , rocks which contain greater than 80 % olivine and usually a percentage of Fe - Ti spinel minerals .
Most olivines also contain high nickel concentrations ( up to several percent ) and may also contain chromite or chromium as a contaminant in olivine , providing the needed transition metals .
However , serpentinite synthesis and spinel cracking reactions require hydrothermal alteration of pristine peridotite - dunite , which is a finite process intrinsically related to metamorphism , and further , requires significant addition of water .
Serpentinite is unstable at mantle temperatures and is readily dehydrated to granulite , amphibolite , talc–schist and even eclogite .
This suggests that methanogenesis in the presence of serpentinites is restricted in space and time to mid-ocean ridges and upper levels of subduction zones .
However , water has been found as deep as 12,000 metres ( 39,000 ft ) , [ 37 ] so water - based reactions are dependent upon the local conditions .
Oil being created by this process in intracratonic regions is limited by the materials and temperature .
Serpentinite synthesis [ edit ]
A chemical basis for the abiotic petroleum process is the serpentinization of peridotite , beginning with methanogenesis via hydrolysis of olivine into serpentine in the presence of carbon dioxide . [ 36 ]
Olivine , composed of Forsterite and Fayalite metamorphoses into serpentine , magnetite and silica by the following reactions , with silica from fayalite decomposition ( reaction 1a ) feeding into the forsterite reaction ( 1 b ) .
Reaction 1a :
Fayalite + water → magnetite + aqueous silica + hydrogen
3 F e 2 S i O 4 + 2 H 2 O → 2 F e 3 O 4 + 3 S i O 2 + 2 H 2 {\displaystyle \mathrm { 3Fe_{2}SiO_{4}+2H_{2}O\rightarrow 2Fe_{3}O_{4}+3SiO_{2}+2H_{2}} }
Reaction 1b :
Forsterite + aqueous silica → serpentinite
3 M g 2 S i O 4 + S i O 2 + 4 H 2 O → 2 M g 3 S i 2 O 5 ( O H ) 4 {\displaystyle \mathrm { 3Mg_{2}SiO_{4}+SiO_{2}+4H_{2}O\rightarrow 2Mg_{3}Si_{2}O_{5}(OH ) _{4}} }
When this reaction occurs in the presence of dissolved carbon dioxide ( carbonic acid ) at temperatures above 500 °C ( 932 °F ) Reaction 2a takes place .
Reaction 2a :
Olivine + water + carbonic acid → serpentine + magnetite + methane
( F e , M g ) 2 S i O 4 + n H 2 O + C O 2 → M g 3 S i 2 O 5 ( O H ) 4 + F e 3 O 4 + C H 4 {\displaystyle \mathrm {( Fe , Mg) _{2}SiO_{4}+nH_{2}O+CO_{2}\rightarrow Mg_{3}Si_{2}O_{5}(OH)_{4}+Fe_{3}O_{4}+CH_{4}} }
or , in balanced form : 18 M g 2 S i O 4 + 6 F e 2 S i O 4 + 26 H 2 O + C O 2 {\displaystyle \mathrm { 18Mg_{2}SiO_{4}+6Fe_{2}SiO_{4}+26H_{2}O+CO_{2}} } → 12 M g 3 S i 2 O 5 ( O H ) 4 + 4 F e 3 O 4 + C H 4 {\displaystyle \mathrm { 12Mg_{3}Si_{2}O_{5}(OH)_{4}+4Fe_{3}O_{4}+CH_{4}} }
However , reaction 2 ( b ) is just as likely , and supported by the presence of abundant talc - carbonate schists and magnesite stringer veins in many serpentinised peridotites ;
Reaction 2 b :
Olivine + water + carbonic acid → serpentine + magnetite + magnesite + silica
( F e , M g ) 2 S i O 4 + n H 2 O + C O 2 → M g 3 S i 2 O 5 ( O H ) 4 + F e 3 O 4 + M g C O 3 + S i O 2 {\displaystyle \mathrm {( Fe , Mg) _{2}SiO_{4}+nH_{2}O+CO_{2}\rightarrow Mg_{3}Si_{2}O_{5}(OH)_{4}+Fe_{3}O_{4}+MgCO_{3}+SiO_{2}} }
The upgrading of methane to higher n- alkane hydrocarbons is via dehydrogenation of methane in the presence of catalyst transition metals ( e.g. Fe , Ni ) .
This can be termed spinel hydrolysis .
Spinel polymerization mechanism [ edit ]
Magnetite , chromite and ilmenite are Fe - spinel group minerals found in many rocks but rarely as a major component in non-ultramafic rocks .
In these rocks , high concentrations of magmatic magnetite , chromite and ilmenite provide a reduced matrix which may allow abiotic cracking of methane to higher hydrocarbons during hydrothermal events .
Chemically reduced rocks are required to drive this reaction and high temperatures are required to allow methane to be polymerized to ethane .
Note that reaction 1a , above , also creates magnetite .
Reaction 3 :
Methane + magnetite → ethane + hematite
n C H 4 + n F e 3 O 4 + n H 2 O → C 2 H 6 + F e 2 O 3 + H C O 3 + H + {\displaystyle \mathrm {nCH_{4}+nFe_{3}O_{4}+nH_{2}O\rightarrow C_{2}H_{6}+Fe_{2}O_{3}+HCO_{3}+H^{+}} }
Reaction 3 results in n-alkane hydrocarbons , including linear saturated hydrocarbons , alcohols , aldehydes , ketones , aromatics , and cyclic compounds . [ 36 ]
Carbonate decomposition [ edit ]
Calcium carbonate may decompose at around 500 °C ( 932 °F ) through the following reaction : [ 5 ]
Reaction 5 :
Hydrogen + calcium carbonate → methane + calcium oxide + water
4 H 2 + C a C O 3 → C H 4 + C a O + 2 H 2 O {\displaystyle \mathrm { 4H_{2}+CaCO_{3}\rightarrow CH_{4}+CaO+2H_{2}O} }
Note that CaO ( lime ) is not a mineral species found within natural rocks .
Whilst this reaction is possible , it is not plausible .
Evidence of abiogenic mechanisms [ edit ]
Theoretical calculations by J.F. Kenney using scaled particle theory ( a statistical mechanical model ) for a simplified perturbed hard - chain predict that methane compressed to 30,000 bars ( 3.0 GPa ) or 40,000 bars ( 4.0 GPa ) kbar at 1,000 °C ( 1,830 °F ) ( conditions in the mantle ) is relatively unstable in relation to higher hydrocarbons .
However , these calculations do not include methane pyrolysis yielding amorphous carbon and hydrogen , which is recognized as the prevalent reaction at high temperatures . [ 17 ] [ 18 ]
Experiments in diamond anvil high pressure cells have resulted in partial conversion of methane and inorganic carbonates into light hydrocarbons . , [ 38 ] [ 8 ]
Biotic ( microbial ) hydrocarbons [ edit ]
The " deep biotic petroleum hypothesis " , similar to the abiogenic petroleum origin hypothesis , holds that not all petroleum deposits within the Earth 's rocks can be explained purely according to the orthodox view of petroleum geology .
Thomas
Gold used the term the deep hot biosphere to describe the microbes which live underground . [ 4] [ 39 ]
This hypothesis is different from biogenic oil in that the role of deep - dwelling microbes is a biological source for oil which is not of a sedimentary origin and is not sourced from surface carbon .
Deep microbial life is only a contaminant of primordial hydrocarbons .
Parts of microbes yield molecules as biomarkers .
Deep biotic oil is considered to be formed as a byproduct of the life cycle of deep microbes .
Shallow biotic oil is considered to be formed as a byproduct of the life cycles of shallow microbes .
Microbial biomarkers [ edit ]
Thomas Gold , in a 1999 book , cited the discovery of thermophile bacteria in the Earth 's crust as new support for the postulate that these bacteria could explain the existence of certain biomarkers in extracted petroleum . [ 4 ]
A rebuttal of biogenic origins based on biomarkers has been offered by Kenney , et al. ( 2001 ) . [ 17 ]
Isotopic evidence [ edit ]
Methane is ubiquitous in crustal fluid and gas . [ 40 ]
Research continues to attempt to characterise crustal sources of methane as biogenic or abiogenic using carbon isotope fractionation of observed gases ( Lollar & Sherwood 2006 ) .
There are few clear examples of abiogenic methane - ethane - butane , as the same processes favor enrichment of light isotopes in all chemical reactions , whether organic or inorganic .
δ 13C of methane overlaps that of inorganic carbonate and graphite in the crust , which are heavily depleted in 12C , and attain this by isotopic fractionation during metamorphic reactions .
One argument for abiogenic oil cites the high carbon depletion of methane as stemming from the observed carbon isotope depletion with depth in the crust .
However , diamonds , which are definitively of mantle origin , are not as depleted as methane , which implies that methane carbon isotope fractionation is not controlled by mantle values . [ 30 ]
Commercially extractable concentrations of helium ( greater than 0.3 % ) are present in natural gas from the Panhandle - Hugoton fields in the US , as well as from some Algerian and Russian gas fields . [ 41 ] [ 42 ]
Helium trapped within most petroleum occurrences , such as the occurrence in Texas , is of a distinctly crustal character with an Ra ratio of less than 0.0001 that of the atmosphere . [ 43 ] [ 44 ]
The Chimaera gas seep , near Antalya ( SW Turkey ) , new and thorough molecular and isotopic analyses including methane ( ~87 % v/v ; D13C1 from - 7.9 to - 12.3 ‰ ; D13D1 from - 119 to - 124 ‰ ) , light alkanes ( C2+C3 +C4+C5 = 0.5 % ; C6+ : 0.07 % ; D13C2 from - 24.2 to - 26.5 ‰ ; D13C3 from - 25.5 to - 27 ‰ ) , hydrogen ( 7.5 to 11 % ) , carbon dioxide ( 0.01- 0.07 % ; D13CCO2 : - 15 ‰ ) , helium ( ~80 ppmv ; R/ Ra : 0.41 ) and nitrogen ( 2-4.9 % ; D15N from - 2 to - 2.8 ‰ ) converge to indicate that the seep releases a mixture of organic thermogenic gas , related to mature Type III kerogen occurring in Paleozoic and Mesozoic organic rich sedimentary rocks , and abiogenic gas produced by low temperature serpentinization in the Tekirova ophiolitic unit . [ 45 ]
Biomarker chemicals [ edit ]
Certain chemicals found in naturally occurring petroleum contain chemical and structural similarities to compounds found within many living organisms .
These include terpenoids , terpenes , pristane , phytane , cholestane , chlorins and porphyrins , which are large , chelating molecules in the same family as heme and chlorophyll .
Materials which suggest certain biological processes include tetracyclic diterpane and oleanane .[ citation needed ]
The presence of these chemicals in crude oil is a result of the inclusion of biological material in the oil ; these chemicals are released by kerogen during the production of hydrocarbon oils , as these are chemicals highly resistant to degradation and plausible chemical paths have been studied .
Abiotic defenders state that biomarkers get into oil during its way up as it gets in touch with ancient fossils .
However a more plausible explanation is that biomarkers are traces of biological molecules from bacteria ( archaea ) that feed on primordial hydrocarbons and die in that environment .
For example , hopanoids are just parts of the bacterial cell wall present in oil as contaminant . [ 4 ]
Trace metals [ edit ]
Nickel ( Ni ) , vanadium ( V ) , lead ( Pb ) , arsenic ( As ) , cadmium ( Cd ) , mercury ( Hg ) and others metals frequently occur in oils .
Some heavy crude oils , such as Venezuelan heavy crude have up to 45 % vanadium pentoxide content in their ash , high enough that it is a commercial source for vanadium .
Abiotic supporters argue that these metals are common in Earth 's mantle , but relatively high contents of nickel , vanadium , lead and arsenic can be usually found in almost all marine sediments .
Analysis of 22 trace elements in oils correlate significantly better with chondrite , serpentinized fertile mantle peridotite , and the primitive mantle than with oceanic or continental crust , and shows no correlation with seawater . [ 22 ]
Reduced carbon [ edit ]
Sir Robert Robinson studied the chemical makeup of natural petroleum oils in great detail , and concluded that they were mostly far too hydrogen - rich to be a likely product of the decay of plant debris , assuming a dual origin for Earth hydrocarbons . [ 27 ]
However , several processes which generate hydrogen could supply kerogen hydrogenation which is compatible with the conventional explanation . [ 46 ]
Olefins , the unsaturated hydrocarbons , would have been expected to predominate by far in any material that was derived in that way .
He also wrote : " Petroleum ... [ seems to be ] a primordial hydrocarbon mixture into which bio-products have been added . "
This has however been demonstrated later to be a misunderstanding by Robinson , related to the fact that only short duration experiments were available to him .
Olefins are thermally very unstable ( that is why natural petroleum normally does not contain such compounds ) and in laboratory experiments that last more than a few hours , the olefins are no longer present .[ citation needed ]
The presence of low - oxygen and hydroxyl - poor hydrocarbons in natural living media is supported by the presence of natural waxes ( n=30 + ) , oils ( n=20 + ) and lipids in both plant matter and animal matter , for instance fats in phytoplankton , zooplankton and so on .
These oils and waxes , however , occur in quantities too small to significantly affect the overall hydrogen / carbon ratio of biological materials .
However , after the discovery of highly aliphatic biopolymers in algae , and that oil generating kerogen essentially represent concentrates of such materials , no theoretical problem exists anymore .[ citation needed ]
Also , the millions of source rock samples that have been analyzed for petroleum yield by the petroleum industry have confirmed the large quantities of petroleum found in sedimentary basins .
Empirical evidence [ edit ]
Occurrences of abiotic petroleum in commercial amounts in the oil wells in offshore Vietnam are sometimes cited , as well as in the Eugene Island block 330 oil field , and the Dnieper - Donets Basin .
However , the origins of all these wells can also be explained with the biotic theory . [ 25 ]
Modern geologists think that commercially profitable deposits of abiotic petroleum could be found , but no current deposit has convincing evidence that it originated from abiotic sources . [ 25 ]
The Soviet school saw evidence of their [ clarification needed ] hypothesis in the fact that some oil reservoirs exist in non-sedimentary rocks such as granite , metamorphic or porous volcanic rocks .
However , opponents noted that non-sedimentary rocks served as reservoirs for biologically originated oil expelled from nearby sedimentary source rock through common migration or re-migration mechanisms . [ 25 ]
The following observations have been commonly used to argue for the abiogenic hypothesis , however each observation of actual petroleum can also be fully explained by biotic origin : [ 25 ]
Lost City hydrothermal vent field [ edit ]
The Lost City hydrothermal field was determined to have abiogenic hydrocarbon production .
Proskurowski et al. wrote , " Radiocarbon evidence rules out seawater bicarbonate as the carbon source for FTT reactions , suggesting that a mantle - derived inorganic carbon source is leached from the host rocks .
Our findings illustrate that the abiotic synthesis of hydrocarbons in nature may occur in the presence of ultramafic rocks , water , and moderate amounts of heat . " [ 47 ]
Siljan Ring crater [ edit ]
The Siljan Ring meteorite crater , Sweden , was proposed by Thomas Gold as the most likely place to test the hypothesis because it was one of the few places in the world where the granite basement was cracked sufficiently ( by meteorite impact ) to allow oil to seep up from the mantle ; furthermore it is infilled with a relatively thin veneer of sediment , which was sufficient to trap any abiogenic oil , but was modelled as not having been subjected to the heat and pressure conditions ( known as the " oil window " ) normally required to create biogenic oil .
However , some geochemists concluded by geochemical analysis that the oil in the seeps came from the organic - rich Ordovician Tretaspis shale , where it was heated by the meteorite impact . [ 48 ]
In 1986 –1990 The Gravberg - 1 borehole was drilled through the deepest rock in the Siljan Ring in which proponents had hoped to find hydrocarbon reservoirs .
It stopped at the depth of 6,800 metres ( 22,300 ft ) due to drilling problems , after private investors spent $ 40 million . [ 31 ]
Some eighty barrels of magnetite paste and hydrocarbon - bearing sludge were recovered from the well ;
Gold maintained that the hydrocarbons were chemically different from , and not derived from , those added to the borehole , but analyses showed that the hydrocarbons were derived from the diesel fuel - based drilling fluid used in the drilling .
[ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ 33 ] [ 34 ]
This well also sampled over 13,000 feet ( 4,000 m ) of methane - bearing inclusions . [ 49 ]
In 1991 –1992 , a second borehole , Stenberg - 1 , was drilled a few miles away to a depth of 6,500 metres ( 21,300 ft ) , finding similar results .
Bacterial mats [ edit ]
Direct observation of bacterial mats and fracture - fill carbonate and humin of bacterial origin in deep boreholes in Australia are also taken as evidence for the abiogenic origin of petroleum . [ 50 ]
Example proposed abiogenic methane deposits [ edit ]
Panhandle - Hugoton field ( Anadarko Basin ) in the south - central United States is the most important gas field with commercial helium content .
Some abiogenic proponents interpret this as evidence that both the helium and the natural gas came from the mantle . [ 43 ] [ 44 ] [ 51 ] [ 52 ]
The Bạch Hổ oil field in Vietnam has been proposed as an example of abiogenic oil because it is 4,000 m of fractured basement granite , at a depth of 5,000 m. [ 53 ]
However , others argue that it contains biogenic oil which leaked into the basement horst from conventional source rocks within the Cuu Long basin . [ 21 ] [ 54 ]
A major component of mantle - derived carbon is indicated in commercial gas reservoirs in the Pannonian and Vienna basins of Hungary and Austria . [ 55 ]
Natural gas pools interpreted as being mantle - derived are the Shengli Field [ 56 ] and Songliao Basin , northeastern China . [ 57 ] [ 58 ]
The Chimaera gas seep , near Çıralı , Antalya ( southwest Turkey ) , has been continuously active for millennia and it is known to be the source of the first Olympic fire in the Hellenistic period .
On the basis of chemical composition and isotopic analysis , the Chimaera gas is said to be about half biogenic and half abiogenic gas , the largest emission of biogenic methane discovered ; deep and pressurized gas accumulations necessary to sustain the gas flow for millennia , posited to be from an inorganic source , may be present . [ 45 ]

Geological arguments [ edit ]
Incidental arguments for abiogenic oil [ edit ]
Given the known occurrence of methane and the probable catalysis of methane into higher atomic weight hydrocarbon molecules , various abiogenic theories consider the following to be key observations in support of abiogenic hypotheses :
the serpentinite synthesis , graphite synthesis and spinel catalysation models prove the process is viable [ 22 ] [ 36 ]
the likelihood that abiogenic oil seeping up from the mantle is trapped beneath sediments which effectively seal mantle - tapping faults [ 35 ]
outdated [ citation needed ] mass - balance calculations [ when ? ] for supergiant oilfields which argued that the calculated source rock could not have supplied the reservoir with the known accumulation of oil , implying deep recharge . [ 13 ] [ 14 ]
mass - balance calculations for supergiant oilfields which argued that the calculated source rock could not have supplied the reservoir with the known accumulation of oil , implying deep recharge .
the presence of hydrocarbons encapsulated in diamonds [ 59 ]
The proponents of abiogenic oil also use several arguments which draw on a variety of natural phenomena in order to support the hypothesis :
the modeling of some researchers shows the Earth was accreted at relatively low temperature , thereby perhaps preserving primordial carbon deposits within the mantle , to drive abiogenic hydrocarbon production [ citation needed ]
the presence of methane within the gases and fluids of mid-ocean ridge spreading centre hydrothermal fields . [ 35 ] [ 8 ]
the presence of diamond within kimberlites and lamproites which sample the mantle depths proposed as being the source region of mantle methane ( by Gold et al . ) . [ 27 ]
Incidental arguments against abiogenic oil [ edit ]
Oil deposits are not directly associated with tectonic structures .
Arguments against chemical reactions , such as the serpentinite mechanism , being a source of hydrocarbon deposits within the crust include :
the lack of available pore space within rocks as depth increases .
[ citation needed ] this is contradicted by numerous studies which have documented the existence of hydrologic systems operating over a range of scales and at all depths in the continental crust . [ 60 ]
the lack of any hydrocarbon within the crystalline shield [ clarification needed ] areas of the major cratons , especially around key deep - seated structures which are predicted to host oil by the abiogenic hypothesis . [ 30 ]

helium in the Siljan Gravberg - 1 well was depleted in 3 He and not consistent with a mantle origin [ 61 ]
The Gravberg - 1 well only produced 84 barrels ( 13.4 m 3 ) of oil , which later was shown to derive from organic additives , lubricants and mud used in the drilling process . [ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ 33 ]
He and not consistent with a mantle origin Kudryavtsev 's Rule has been explained for oil and gas ( not coal ) — gas deposits which are below oil deposits can be created from that oil or its source rocks .
Because natural gas is less dense than oil , as kerogen and hydrocarbons are generating gas the gas fills the top of the available space .
Oil is forced down , and can reach the spill point where oil leaks around the edge(s ) of the formation and flows upward .
If the original formation becomes completely filled with gas then all the oil will have leaked above the original location . [ 62 ]

Field test evidence [ edit ]
Prognostic map of Andes of South America published in 1986 .
Red and green circles - sites predicted as future discoveries of giant oil / gas fields .
Red circles - where giants were really discovered .
Green ones are still underdeveloped .
What unites both theories of oil origin is the low success rate in predicting the locations of giant oil / gas fields : according to the statistics discovering a giant demands drilling 500 + exploration wells .
A team of American - Russian scientists ( mathematicians , geologists , geophysicists , and computer scientists ) developed an Artificial Intelligence software and the appropriate technology for geological applications , and used it for predicting places of giant oil / gas deposits . [ 63 ] [ 64 ] [ 65 ] [ 66 ]
In 1986 the team published a prognostic map for discovering giant oil and gas fields at the Ands in South America [ 67 ] based on abiogenic petroleum origin theory .
The model proposed by Prof. Yury Pikovsky ( Moscow State University ) assumes that petroleum moves from the mantel to the surface through permeable channels created at the intersection of deep faults . [ 68 ]
The technology uses 1 ) maps of morphostructural zoning , which outlines the morphostructural nodes ( intersections of faults ) , and 2 ) pattern recognition program that identify nodes containing giant oil / gas fields .
It was forecasted that eleven nodes , which had not been developed at that time , contain giant oil or gas fields .
These 11 sites covered only 8 % of the total area of all the Andes basins .
30 years later ( in 2018 ) was published the result of comparing the prognosis and the reality . [ 69 ]
Since publication of the prognostic map in 1986 only six giant oil / gas fields were discovered in the Andes region : Cano - Limon , Cusiana , Capiagua , and Volcanera ( Llanos basin , Colombia ) , Camisea ( Ukayali basin , Peru ) , and Incahuasi ( Chaco basin , Bolivia ) .
All discoveries were made in places shown on the 1986 prognostic map as promising areas .
The result is convincingly positive , and this is a strong contribution in support of abiogenic theory of oil origin .
Extraterrestrial argument [ edit ]
The presence of methane on Saturn 's moon Titan and in the atmospheres of Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus and Neptune is cited as evidence of the formation of hydrocarbons without biological intermediate forms , [ 25 ] for example by Thomas Gold . [ 4 ]
( Terrestrial natural gas is composed primarily of methane ) .
Some comets contain massive amounts of organic compounds , the equivalent of cubic kilometers of such mixed with other material ; [ 70 ] for instance , corresponding hydrocarbons were detected during a probe flyby through the tail of Comet Halley in 1986 . [ 71 ]
Drill samples from the surface of Mars taken in 2015 by the Curiosity Rover 's Mars Science Laboratory have found organic molecules of benzene and propane in 3 billion year old rock samples in Gale Crater . [ 72 ]

Is this something that users actually want ?
How would this actually work ?
Personally I find that if I 'm looking at a site with music tracks , say Amazon 's MP3 store , I do n't have any difficulty working out what the tracks are or interacting with the page .
Why would I want to ask the computer to do something with the tracks ?
It would be helpful if you could walk me through some examples of what UI you are envisaging in terms of " helping the user find more information " .
Why is Safari's " select text and then right click to search on Google " not good enough ?
Have any usability studies been made to test these ideas ?
( For example , paper prototype usability studies ? )

This I can speak to directly , since I work for a search engine and have learnt quite a bit about how it works .
I do n't think more metadata is going to improve search engines .
In practice , metadata is so highly gamed that it can not be relied upon .
In fact , search engines probably already " understand " pages with far more accuracy than most authors will ever be able to express .
You started by saying : >
Web browsers currently do not understand the meaning behind human > statements or concepts on a web page .
This is true , and I even agree that fixing this problem , letting browsers understand the meaning behind human statements and concepts , would open up a giant number of potentially killer applications .
I do n't think " automating the browser experience " is necessarily that killer app , but let 's assume that it is for the sake of argument .
You continue : >
If we are to automate the browsing experience and deliver a more usable > web experience , we must provide a mechanism for describing , detecting > and processing semantics .
This statement seems obvious , but actually I disagree with it .
It is not the case the providing a mechanism for describing , detecting , and processing semantics is the only way to let browsers understand the meaning behind human statements or concepts on a web page .
In fact , I would argue it 's not even the the most plausible solution .
A mechanism for describing , detecting , and processing semantics ; that is , new syntax , new vocabularies , new authoring requirements , fundamentally relies on authors actually writing the information using this new syntax .
If there 's anything we can learn from the Web today , however , it is that authors will reliably output garbage at the syntactic level .
They misuse HTML semantics and syntax uniformly ( to the point where 90 % + of pages are invalid in some way ) .
Use of metadata mechanisms is at a pitifully low level , and when used is inaccurate ( Content - Type headers for non-HTML data and character encoding declarations for all text types are both widely wrong , to the point where browsers have increasingly complex heuristics to work around the errors ) .
Even " successful " formats for metadata publishing like hCard have woefully low penetration .
Yet , for us to automate the browsing experience by having computers understand the Web , for us to have search engines be significantly more accurate by understanding pages , the metadata has to be widespread , detailed , and reliable .
So to get this data into Web pages , we have to get past the laziness and incompetence of authors .
Furthermore , even if we could get authors to reliably put out this data widely , we would have to then find a way to deal with spammers and black hat SEOs , who would simply put inaccurate data into their pages in an attempt to game search engines and browsers .
So to get this data into Web pages , we have to get past the inherent greed and evilness of hostile authors .
As I mentioned earlier , there is another solution , one that does n't rely on either getting authors to be any more accurate or precise than they are now , one that does n't require any effort on the part of authors , and one that can be used in conjunction with today 's anti-spam tools to avoid being gamed by them and potentially to in fact dramatically improve them : have the computers learn the human languages themselves .
Instead of making all the humans of the world learn a computer language , or tools for writing that computer language , have the computers learn the human language .
Not only does this not require us to solve a fundamentally unsolvable pair of problems ( making humans not be lazy and making humans not be evil ) , but it also means that the computers would also gain an understanding of all the legacy content that would otherwise never be seen by computers .
This kind of thing is already being done , for example with automated language translation where the software learns for itself how to translate text , or in search engines that extract information like byline dates and author credits , without the need for pages to have special markup , or in data clustering , where tools can examine large sets of data and sort the content into buckets based on topics without any special markup or user intervention .
Similarly developments in image processing are making huge steps , with tools that can derive depth mapping data from moving video , or that can convert a set of static 2D images to a 3D point field .
It 's clear that over the coming years , this will only get better and better .
However , let 's pretend for now that we can find a way to solve laziness and evilness and continue with your e-mail : >

This is definitely not better .

How is not reusing HTML semantics better than using them ?
With the exception of the now - resolve < time > issue , it seems like Microformats has the better accessibility story .
> unified processing rules , etc ) Microformats could certainly benefit from a more consistent parsing model , but that can be obtained without going to RDFa . > [...] this issue really boils down to one of centralized innovation vs. > distributed innovation .
I do n't see what the syntax has anything to do with whether the formats are developed centrally or not .
Nothing is stopping anyone from creating another Microformats - like organisation that does the same thing without going through the Microformats.org process .
There could be millions of them , in fact .
So long as they pick names that are suitably unique ( e.g. URIs , or Java - like identifiers ) , or so long as they do n't promote the use of their formats outside of their own site , I do n't see a problem .
In fact , this is happening every day , with each author making up his own class values for use on this own site .
>
The Microformats community , and all communities like it , require a group > of people to come together , collaborate and create a standard vocabulary > to express ALL semantics .
Well , for any one person to do anything useful with the data on the Web , they have to have a core vocabulary ( or set of vocabularies ) that they understand .
So a set of standard vocabularies to express all the semantics that that one person is interested in is needed , yes .
It does n't have to be _all_ semantics , however .
I might want to have a format for annotating Stargate analysis Web pages that me and my friends write , but so long as me and my friends agree on it it does n't have to involve anyone else .

That 's pretty much exactly what Unicode did .
Or what we 're doing with HTML .
That does n't seem untennable , it seems quite reasonable .
However , I 'm not suggesting that it should be necessary .

I 'm not convinced the problem you describe can be solved in the manner you describe .
It seems to rely on getting authors to do something that they have shown themselves incapable of doing over and over since the Web started .
It seems like a much better solution would be to get computers to understand what humans are doing already .
Even if we ignore that , it does n't seem like the above discussion would lead one to a set of requirements that would lead one to design a language like RDFa .
Thanks for the explanation , by the way .
This is by far the most useful explanation of RDFa that I have ever seen .

The Animations Page
Here are links to a number of animations prepared by the maintainer of this website .
They are not intended as rigorous depictions of the past and future motions of the objects concerned ( although at the scales of these diagrams , any difference would probably not be noticeable in most cases ) , rather they are intended to assist in understanding the state of knowledge about the contents of the solar system ( " A picture is worth a thousand words " ) .
Unless otherwise stated , the animations are drawn as seen from the north ecliptic pole with the vernal equinox off to the right .
The animations are currently available as animated GIFs ( in two different sizes ) , other formats may be added in the future .
Any use of these animations for anything other than your own personal enjoyment is not permitted without our express permission .
The Inner Solar System
This animation shows the motion of objects in the inner region of the solar system over a two - year period at 10 - day intervals .
The sun is the yellow symbol at the center of each frame .
The orbits of the planets Mercury , Venus , Earth and Mars are shown in light blue , with the current locations of each planet being shown by large crossed circles .
Main - belt minor planets are shown as green circles , Near - Earth asteroids as red circles .
Comets are shown as blue squares ( filled for numbered periodic comets , outline for other comets ) .
This animation ( prepared 2002 July 31 ) is available as :

The Middle Solar System
This animation shows the motion of objects in the inner- to mid-region of the solar system over a two - year period .
The animation shows objects out to the orbit of Jupiter and a little beyond .
The meaning of the symbols is as for the Inner Solar System animation : additionally , Jupiter and its orbit are now shown and the Jupiter Trojans , which orbit in the same orbit as Jupiter but roughly 60 degrees ahead or behind the planet , are colored blue .
This animation shows the vast bulk of the objects tracked by the MPC .
The total number of objects shown is more than 100000 .

The Outer Solar System
This animation shows the motions of objects in the outer solar system , beyond the orbit of Jupiter , over a 100 - year period at 200 - day intervals .
The orbits and current locations of the Jovian planets ( Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus and Neptune ) are shown .
The current location of Pluto is indicated by the large white crossed circle .
High - eccentricity objects are shown with cyan triangles , Centaurs as orange triangles , Plutinos as white circles , " Classical " TNOs as red circles and Scattered - Disk Objects as magenta circles .
NOTE : The strange behavior exhibited by the comets ( a general heading inwards prior to the mid 1990s and a general heading outwards post 2000 ) is a consequence of plotting only those comets currently observable ( as of mid 2002 ) .
Around this date , all of the long - period comets would have been at or near perihelion .
Fifty years either side of this date they are all far from the sun .
If the full cometary catalogue had been plotted , this effect would not be so noticeable as there would be inbound and outbound comets visible on each pre-2002 frame .

Suskind releasing transcript of ' forgery ' source David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday August 8 , 2008
Print This Email This Author Ron Suskind , whose new book charges that the Bush administration ordered the CIA to forge a letter from the head of Iraqi intelligence linking Iraq to al Qaeda , will now be releasing a transcript of the interview with one of his primary sources to defend himself against charges of inaccuracy .
Suskind told MSNBC's Joe Scarborough on Friday , " I 've never done this in 25 years as a journalist , but I 'm posting transcripts of my conversations with Rob Richer . "
Suskin 's decision to release the transcripts was first reported by Congressional Quarterly 's Jeff Stein .
Suskind further explained , " Rob can only say from first - hand knowledge that it's from the White House .
That means either the vice president 's office , the president 's office , or the NSC .
... [ CIA chief ]
George [ Tenet ] came back from the White House one day with , essentially , the memo sheet .. with the mission to create this fabricated letter . "
Suskind downplayed Tenet 's denials of the story , noting that Tenet has failed in the past to remember things he did not do personally and saying , " What I did on this book , having worked with George on the last book , is I said , ' I need to go to people who have first - hand , active knowledge from their own actions of things that they did . ' "
Suskind was extremely appreciative of his two sources for the story , Rob Richer and John Maguire , telling Scarborough , " I said , ' Look , you guys are walking into the hottest fire you can imagine . '
They both said ... ' I 'm up to it . ' "
He added , " The government has come down on them .
You can just imagine what they 're going through .
I 'm trying to support them .
We 're sending emails back and forth saying , ' Hey , stick it out . ' "
However , Suskind seemed tired of discussing the letter and told Scarborough " I could hug you " for saying there 's been too much focus on it .
" The book is really about America finding its moral compass , " Suskind explained .
" Much of it 's about the conflict between power and truth .
...
It 's really , oddly , about the American character at this moment .
...
We bled away some of this precious matter , the moral authority that really underlies power in the world .
And how do you get that back ?
... I kind of wept as I wrote part of it . "
" We are in a global hearts and minds struggle , " Suskind continued .
" What you find is ... public rhetoric that 's often lofty , while its private practices are often low and ugly .
They two things ultimately become clear at some point .
... Americans are feeling a crazy disconnect . "

In March 2007 , the eighth - grade class at Dyker Heights school in Brooklyn , New York , got a substitute teacher .
Predictably , the kids got rambunctious .
Thirteen - year - old Chelsea Fraser steered clear of the rowdier action , including the boys plastering the walls with post - office stickers .
Instead she doodled on a desk with a marker , penning in block letters : “ okay . ”
Two days later , Chelsea called her mom , Diana Silva , from school .
She was panicked .
“ Mom , ” she said , “ I think I ’m gonna get arrested . ”
“ For writing on a desk ? ” Silva laughed , suspecting teenage drama .
“ Did you write a bad word ? ”
“ No , ” said Chelsea , a cheerful girl with a flip of black hair over one eye .
“ I wrote ‘ okay . ' ”
“ Baby , tell them what you did , ” counseled Silva , a freelance graphic artist .
“ You ’ll probably go to the principal .
They might suspend you , and they will probably make you scrub the desk . ”
Silva doubted it would even go that far : Chelsea had been president of her class and captain of the volleyball team , and had never even been to the principal ’s office .
Ten minutes later , the phone rang again .
This time it was a school dean saying Silva had better come in .
“ The children are being arrested , ” said the dean , explaining that the boys who had been stickering the walls were also headed to the police station .
Silva raced to school , and four police officers soon arrived .
They handcuffed Chelsea and the boys and marched them out to a police van .
As she walked , Chelsea looked up to see her classmates pressed against the windows .
Her teacher was crying .
Silva tried to reason with the officers , who told her that writing on furniture was a crime .
“ Is it a crime to be a kid ? ” she shot back .
At the precinct , Chelsea was handcuffed to a pole over her head for three hours — while she was interrogated , her mother had to wait in another room .
“ I was scared , I was sad , and I was embarrassed , ” Chelsea told me .
“ I just wanted it to be over . ”

Chelsea Fraser ’s case is extreme , but in schools across the nation , disciplinary infractions are increasingly being turned over to police and prosecutors .
The Denver public schools , for example , saw a 71 percent rise in the number of students referred to law enforcement between 2000 and 2004 , most for behavior such as bullying and using obscenities .
In Florida during the 2005 - 06 school year , more than one - quarter of some 25,000 school - related referrals to the Department of Juvenile Justice were for disorderly conduct and trespassing .
In the Chicago public schools , more than 8,000 students were arrested in 2003 , almost half for simple assaults or batteries that involved no serious injuries or weapons .
A full 77 percent of the arrests were of black students , although they make up just half of Chicago ’s student body .
School violence is a real concern , but in many places , this fear has motivated rigid “ zero tolerance ” policies that target minor infractions as gateway offenses — and that often disproportionately affect students of color :
Black students are three times more likely to be suspended or expelled than their white peers .
In 2006 , Shaquanda Cotton , a 14 - year - old African American girl from Paris , Texas , was sentenced to seven years in prison for shoving a teacher ’s aide .
The aide , who was not hurt , was preventing Cotton from entering the building before the beginning of the school day .
Cotton had no criminal record ; she ended up serving a full year .
Critics noted that the judge who sentenced her had previously let a 14 - year - old white girl , charged with setting fire to her parents ’ house , go with probation only .
One reason why students are increasingly ending up in jail is that police now patrol the halls in many schools .
In New York , the police department took control of school safety in 1998 under the Giuliani administration ; by the 2005 - 06 school year , according to the New York Civil Liberties Union , the city employed 4,625 school safety agents and at least 200 armed officers , making the nypd School Safety Division the 10th - biggest police force in the country — larger than those of Washington , DC , Detroit , Boston , or Las Vegas .
“ We are treating the kids like potential criminals , ” says Donna Lieberman of the nyclu .
In January , a five - year - old named Denis Rivera was handcuffed behind his back by an nypd school safety officer for throwing a tantrum in his kindergarten class in Queens .
Chelsea Fraser , for her part , missed three school days going to court , served another two days of in - school suspension , and had to pay $ 45 in restitution for the desk .
She agreed to talk because “ I want to help everybody else who is getting in trouble . ”

Despite Dahl 's reputation as " one of the biggest cocksmen in America " , as described by previous biography , he was said to have passed on several useful pieces of intelligence , including his belief that President Franklin D Rooseveldt was having an affair with Crown Princess Martha of Norway , who had been granted asylum by the US .
This is a pretty lighthearted list of tips for making a clean and safe getaway from police pursuits , learnt from years of watching police chases on TV .
Even if you do n’t usually root for the fleeing vehicle when you ’re watching a police chase video , you might sometimes think , “ Why did the guy do that ? ” or “ I would ’ve done this instead , it ’s so obvious ! ”
Well , this is a general collection of those tips you would want the guys in the videos to know .
The site , of course , does not condone any criminal acts .
This list is only for fun .
Attempting speeding anywhere is extremely dangerous for you and others .
If you ’re dumb enough to take this list seriously , then you ’re not smart enough to outrun the cops .
If you do decide to follow the advice here , you might also want to take a look at Top 10 Prison Survival Tips .
11 Pick your ride carefully
Assuming you have a choice , this tip is obvious but not at all straightforward .
You have to choose a car that suits your circumstances .
You may want to choose a fast , fancy sports car ; but it may draw too much attention , or run out of fuel fast , or become uncontrollable from the slightest brush with a pursuing car .
You may then go for a heavy , sturdy vehicle ; so that it handles well , can endure rugged terrain , and it withstands enough damage to still make it .
But one of these may be too slow , or too big for you to maneuver through traffic , and it may even flip over too easily .
So , it ’s not a simple decision at all ; get what you think is better for your driving style and your plan .
Inconspicuous cars are a good choice in general .
10 Mind the gas
First and most evidently , fill her up !
Several chases end a few minutes after they ’ve started just because the speedsters forgot to fill the tank before going for it .
Second , be aware of how much mileage your car can get from a full tank ; this may also influence your choice in cars , depending on how far you need to go .
Remember that you ’ll be going fast , so you ’ll be spending more fuel .
If you ’re serious , you might even want to find a way to get more fuel tank space or extra mileage performance for the vehicle of your choice ( requiring some ‘ pimping up ’ as the teens call it these days ) .
9 Have a police scanner
This one is fairly obvious if you want to dramatically increase your chances for escape .
Having a police scanner while you ’re driving means that you pretty much know what they ’re planning to do to stop you , like laying spike strips and the like .
It also gives you the advantage of knowing what they think you ’re up to .
For instance , if they lose track of you , or think they know where you ’ll be going , you ’ll know right away and you ’ll be able to trick them by going where they do n’t expect you to , leaving their cruisers in the dust .
If you ’re really sly , you ’d get a TV installed too .
You could check out the news channel to see what the news copter is broadcasting , and get even more info from the reporters on what the police are planning ( which would give you an immense advantage ) .
8 Do n’t get out
This is an obvious one too , but many ‘ fugitives ’ have been shown to get desperate when their car crashes , so they get out of the car and start running scared .
When this happens , you know that they ’re done for .
Unless you severely hindered your ride , do n’t get out .
Police officers will be chasing you from all around , their aggressive dogs taking point , and the news helicopter will keep its camera sights on you .
You simply wo n’t be able to escape on foot .
There is a video of a guy who got out , then got into a house , and changed clothes , coming out calmly as if he were someone else .
He almost made it , except the news helicopter crew got suspicious of a guy wearing the same shoes as the fugitive , and cried foul to the cops .
Try at your own risk .
7 Do n’t park it
There might be situations where you might need to slow down in order to maneuver or dodge obstacles .
But whatever you do , do n’t make a full stop .
The police will obviously catch up , and box you in against the obstacle you were trying to avoid .
By extension , do n’t shift to reverse unless you absolutely need to .
You will need to make a full stop for starters , and obviously driving in reverse is harder .
Plus , you will need to stop yet again to shift back to normal , and by that time there will be police cruisers all around you .
Also , if you stop , citizens may attack you .
( Especially if you ’ve given them reasons to be angry at you , judging from the news broadcast . )
6 Stay on course
This is several tips in one , really .
First , plan your route .
Notice danger points , and alternate routes you can take .
That way you wo n’t be running in circles until you run out of gas .
You ’ll know where to go , and where to detour if things get hairy .
Second , whatever you do , do n’t go off - road !
Even if you have a vehicle suited for off - road , it ’s risky .
You may end up sunken in hidden curbs , or simply stuck in mud .
Even if you ’re lucky to find a clear off - road area , you ’ll inevitably slow down , and the cops will catch up eventually .
Also , you need to get familiarized with the turns you ’ll be making and how your ride handles them .
It sounds pretty dumb , but many car chases have ended from the driver overshooting the turn and running into a light pole he could ’ve easily avoided otherwise .
Finally , please do n’t go back to your neighborhood .
You may think this is a good idea because you ’re familiar with the area , but it ’s not .
If it ’s a small neighborhood , you ’ll need to slow down to take turns , and there will be bigger chances for the police to seal off the area , leaving you without escape .
5 Slow down at intersections
This one sounds pretty contradictory , to say the least .
Why would I want to slow down if I ’m being chased , for crying out loud !
Actually , it ’s very recommendable to slow down and look out when you ’re crossing intersections , whether they have stoplights or not .
The most horrible endings to police chases happen at intersections .
Your car gets smashed by an 18 - wheeler running across , or you hit a jeep making a turn , and you careen out of control into a row of cars stopped at a red light .
Very gruesome , and you and many innocents can get hurt ; and you do n’t want that .
So , slow down , look both ways , and plan your moves accordingly .
If you get a red light , you have to be extra careful .
This also applies to railroad crossings ; those freight trains will literally annihilate you if you do n’t pay attention .
4 Change cars
This is usually risky but effective .
It ’s certainly more effective than changing clothes or staying on a damaged or useless car .
It ’s much more preferable to do it indoors at a public place , such as a parking building .
Quickly get out of your car and choose a car of a different color , even if it ’s a similar model to yours .
It ’s actually better if you choose a car that ’s similar to yours , because you ’re already used to how your own vehicle handles , and you do n’t want to lose control of your ride just because you ’re not used to how it handles .
Then , take your chosen vehicle out inconspicuously , and hopefully you ’ve bedazzled the cops and the helicopters with the switch , at least for a while .
3 Take cover ( from helicopters )
This tip is critical if you want to lose the cops completely .
The helicopters over your head , be it the police chopper or a local news copter , will be aiming their cameras at you all the time .
This means that even if you ’ve lost the police cruisers behind , they still know where you are thanks to the helicopters , and will eventually catch up to you again .
Unless , of course , you ’re able to stay out of their sights .
Try going under a roof , a parking building for example , and get out through the least obvious path .
The idea is to take cover , then take unusual roads so the helicopter cams wo n’t know where to look when they expect you back in the clear .
If you ’re at an area full of trees , you might get a chance to lose them , too .
But losing the helicopters does n’t mean you ’ve won .
You ’ll need to be conspicuous while driving and pray that they wo n’t find you again .
2 Beware the PIT Maneuver
This is a procedure that the police is very proud of , and get extensive training on .
The PIT ( usually meaning Pursuit Intervention Technique ) Maneuver consists of a police cruiser approaching the fleeing car by one side , until the cruiser ’s front wheels are roughly aligned with the speeding vehicle ’s back wheels .
Then , the police car steers sharply , hitting the trunk of the criminal ’s car ; and making it spin out , usually to 90 degrees from the road , and straight into a ditch or a wall .
It ’s very effective and very common .
So , if you see one of the pursuing police cars approaching you to one side , either fully accelerate your car ( if you ’re not already ) in order to dodge the hit .
Or , slow down all of a sudden , so that you hit the front of the police car first , or the cruiser only hits you innocently on the side .
1 Get to an airport
This is the ultimate getaway tactic , depending on the circumstances .
You do n’t even need to buy a ticket !
( Or hijack a plane either . )
What you need to do is get to the airport quickly .
Once near , the helicopters wo n’t be able to chase you anymore because it ’s restricted airspace for them !
That ’s really good for starters .
Then , you need to go into the airport parking area .
This is the key moment : you may want to get into the airport , buy a ticket , and fly off into the sunset .
But , this may be hard because the police may have warned the airport and they would be looking for you all over .
Instead , you could change your car for one of the cars in the parking area , and drive out inconspicuously , leaving the police desperately looking for you at the airport !
A clean and successful escape .
+ At day , or at night ?
This is a difficult choice to make , because both times have pros and cons .
If you make your getaway during the day , the road you ’re on will be clearly visible , as well as any obstacle on the way , so it ’ll be easier to maneuver through .
But , you ’ll be clearly visible to the cops too , so they will be harder to lose .
If you make a run for it during the night , the cops and helicopters might have a harder time keeping an eye on you .
But , it will be harder to notice obstacles and the like , so it ’s riskier .
Plus the floodlight that the police chopper puts on you lets them see you clearly while probably hindering your vision ( plus it seems to be very annoying for you ) .

The Ethics Investigation into what has become known as Troopergate lives to fight another day .
After waiting 35 minutes for Todd Palin and two state administrative employees to appear under subpoena before the state Senate Judiciary Committee , Sen .
Hollis French condemned their refusal to testify and the attorney general ’s broken promise that seven other witnesses would testify who were not subpoenaed .
French said the retired prosecutor hired by the Alaska Legislature to investigate Palin , Stephen Branchflower , will conclude his investigation by Oct. 10 .
Still , that report will not include testimony from the Republican vice - presidential nominee , her husband or most of the top aides Branchflower hoped to interview .
Sarah Palin ’s allies hoped the investigation would be delayed past the election to spare her any troublesome revelations – or at least the distraction – before voters have made their choice .
Palin ’s reputation as clean - government advocate who takes on entrenched interests is central to her appeal as Republican John McCain ’s running mate , and possibly at risk in the probe .
Palin initially promised to cooperate in the investigation , telling the Legislature to “ hold me accountable . ”
Lawmakers were investigating accusations she dismissed the state ’s public safety commissioner because he refused to fire her ex-brother - in - law , a state trooper .
She now opposes the investigation .
Palin spokesman Bill McAllister declined to comment Friday .
The McCain campaign said there are concerns about the effect of political influence on the Legislature ’s inquiry and Palin will provide any information needed to a separate investigation by the Alaska State Personnel Board .
The committee subpoenaed six people to appear Friday to testify or meet for private interviews with Branchflower .
French said three of those six had complied .
Todd Palin , special assistant Ivy Frye and Randy Ruaro , who is the governor ’s deputy chief of staff , did not .
Todd Palin ’s attorney sent French a letter Thursday listing Palin ’s objections to the Legislature ’s investigation of his wife .
Among them , the attorney said , were jurisdiction questions , separation of power issues and an inconvenient travel schedule .
Subpoenas were approved on seven other government employees but not served because the state attorney general ’s office had agreed to cooperate , French said .
But Attorney General Talis Colberg earlier this week reversed himself , saying the governor declined to participate and that Palin administration employees would not appear .
French said subpoenas will be issued for those seven people , ordering them to testify on Sept. 26 .
In an interview today on KUDO , Alaska Democratic Representative Harry Crawford said ,
This is a perfectly good reason for not having an appointed Attorney General .
Alaska is one of only five states to have an Attorney General who is appointed by the governor , rather than chosen by the people .
Colberg ’s reaction upon learning of McCain ’s pick of Palin as his running mate was “ a mixed set of emotions , kind of an odd sense of Alaska nationalism or pride . ”
“ It was an emotional thing to see the governor walk out with her family , and I say , ‘ Wow , I work for her . ’ “
Crawford rightly noted that “ He ’s suposed to be the state ’s top law official .
He ’s supposed to be working for the people , and he thinks he ’s there working for Sarah Palin , and that ’s not right ” .
When asked what can and should be done about the current situation , Crawford suggested :
1. Change the Alaska constitution to make the Attorney General an elected independent position .
2. Pursue some sort of recall against Talis Colberg .
I ’ts obvious that Talis Colberg is working for the governor , and that the McCain camp has taken over the state .
It ’s not right that the Attorney General is urging people to ignore or break the law .
They [ the McCain campaign ] are in complete charge of what ’s goin on in the state right now .
They are trying to spin , or shut down anything that looks negative for the McCain Palin ticket .
Crawford does his best to separate his personal feelings , and his feelings about Palin as governor , from his feelings about her as a VP candidate .
I like Sarah Palin , I like Todd Palin .
I think she did an amazing job on oil tax reform and the Alaska Gasline Inducement Act , but as far as Troopergate , she ’s said all along she ’s going to be open and transparent , and since the McCain people have come into this they have shut it down … put up a wall .
It ’s obvious when we ’re listening to what comes from Talis Colberg , or any other administration people , they are parroting what [ McCain lawyer ] Edward O’Callaghan has had to say .
We ’re not givng you any more information , we ’re just going to stonewall .
On Walt Monegan and the reason for his firing ?
Crawford ’s understanding is that
“ She fired him because they had a disagreement on funding , and what I ’ve been told was that she wanted to cut $ 2 million from the public safety budget .
He said he cound’t keep running the department on the current amount , much less $ 2 million less .
There was a disagreement on what the safety of Alaskans required .
That ’s a bigger story ” .
And about the evisceration of former Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan by the McCain campaign :
You ’re not going to find anyone in law enforcement more honorable than Walt Monegan .
He ’s done a fine job since the time he was patrolman to the time he was Commissioner of Public Safety .
I have compelte respect for him .
This put me in mind of something Walt Monegan said last week .
“ I would gladly die for the governor , but I will not lie for her . ”
So .
The troopergate investigation lives to see another day .
So go get your big red Sharpie and circle October 10th on your calendar .
That ’s when Stephen Branchflower will wrap up the investigation , and we ’ll be ready for the next chapter in the saga .
The investigation will conclude before the election , with or without the cooperation of the governor , her husband , and the state employees who defied subpoenas .
I ’ll bet when Branchflower agreed to come back to the state and out of retirement to do this investigation , he never dreamed how things would turn out .
None of us did .

Are you tired of the boring day to day aspects of life ?
Do you want something new and exciting ?
Then these are the ten places you want to live .
They are all places that have come from fiction and each one has a special something to make life interesting and enjoyable .
This list is in no particular order .
10 Camelot
Reason for living here : King Arthur lives here and you can joust all day long !
Camelot comes from legendary British tales of King Arthur – who may , or may not , have been real .
In Camelot we find Arthur ’s famous round table where his knights get to sit around like equals and have a few beers while they discuss their latest knightly conquests .
Camelot is surrounded by forests and rivers , so you can get in a spot of fishing and hunting if it floats your boat .
Justice and peace reign in Camelot .
Oh – and the ultra - hot ( in a medieval way ) Guinevere lives there too !
9 Garden of Eden
Reason for living here :
No need to work , food a plenty , and everyone is naked !
Many believe Eden was a real place , and just as many do n’t .
But the fact is , if it were real , this would be the spot to settle down !
The Garden of Eden is full of trees bent over with fruit and all the animals are friendly .
Not only do you get to eat until you can eat no more , but you can ride lions and tigers all afternoon !
Seriously – it does n’t get more awesome than that .
Just watch out for the snake !
8 El Dorado
Reason for living here :
It is a City of Gold !
El Dorado is a legendary city of gold .
It is seen as a type of “ Holy Grail ” for each man – the thing you most seek in life is found here .
Basically , whatever your fetish , you will not leave unsatisfied from this place .
Better yet , it is somewhere in South America , so it should n’t cost you much to get there !
7 Cockaigne
Reason for living here :
It rains cheese !
Cockaigne is a land of contraries , where all the restrictions of society are defied ( abbots beaten by their monks ) , sexual liberty is open ( nuns flipped over to show their bottoms ) , and food is plentiful ( skies that rain cheeses ) .
This is a place where idleness and gluttony are the principal occupations – who does n’t want that ?
6 Beimeni
Reason for living here :
You never grow old
Beimeni is a legendary city – said to be home to the fountain of youth !
It is also a land of great wealth – an earthly paradise .
Legend has it that Juan Ponce de León discovered Florida while he was looking for Beimeni and the fountain of youth .
Kind of ironic I guess .
5 Valhalla
Reason for living here : Battle and feast daily
Valhalla , the “ afterworld ” of the Vikings is a place where all the dead warriors and gods live .
Now – you have to be dead to go there , but it is worth it !
Every day you get to fight against giants !
But wait – it gets better .
At the end of every battle you get to feast on the cosmic boar and drink beer all night long !
When you finish eating the boar ( Sæhrímnir ) he is brought back to life so you can start eating him all over again !
Oh – and the Valkyries ( hot goddesses ) live here too – so you are not likely to get bored .
4 Avalon
Reason for living here :
If it ’s good enough for Jesus , it ’s good enough for us !
Avalon is the place that King Arthur ended up before he died .
It is also the place where King Arthur ’s sword ( Excalibur ) was made .
In Avalon you can get the best apples in the world – and presumably pretty damned good cider too .
When Jesus came back to life , he is said to have visited Avalon with Joseph of Arimathea ( the guy who gave Jesus his tomb ) .
I told you the apples were good .
3 Shangri-La
Reason for living here :
It ’s a utopia
Shangri-La is a mystical valley in the Himalayas .
It is a permanently happy land , isolated from the outside world .
The people who live at Shangri - La are almost immortal , living years beyond the normal lifespan .
The place is so popular that the Nazis sent an expedition out to find it in 1938 .
Fortunately they did n’t find it !
2 City of the Caesars
Reason for living here : Lots of gold and diamonds – and it ’s magic !
Most of the descriptions of the City of the Caesars talks about the city as a prosperous and rich city full of gold , silver and diamonds .
It is described as an enchanted city that appears in certain moments .
At least one description says it located in between two mountains one of gold and another of diamonds .
1 Ys
Reason for living here : Orgies
Ys is a mythical city that was built on the coast of Brittany and later swallowed by the ocean .
Ys was built below sea level by Gradlon , King of Cornouaille , upon the request of his daughter Dahut , who loved the sea .
It was the most beautiful and impressive city in the world .
Unfortunately for the King ( but fortunately for those who live there ) , Dahut was a bad girl and she started throwing wild parties and orgies .
Where do you get in line for a bailout ?
I hope I do n’t need one of those , but just in case things get worse I ’d like to know what the criteria are for the government to make my mistakes go away and my economic aches and pains get better .
All this time I thought the capitalistic system of risk and reward was the rule in the United States and those who took the risks — invested capital in a good idea — would be rewarded .
Conversely , those who took risks and failed would , well , fail .
I even joined a political party when I was old enough to vote that preached those tenets .
Today , however , the Republican Party , which was my home for close to 40 years , has finally become not only the party of intrusive government but also the party of big and expensive government .
What happened ?
It has barely been eight years since President Clinton left office , leaving our country free of deficits and well on its way to paying down or off our national debt .
Today , we face trillions of dollars of new debt and who knows when that number will stop growing , with the next bailout just around the corner .
And that could be another trillion dollars or so .
Pretty soon that can add up to a lot of money .
I do not dispute the need for the government to jump into the middle of an economic crash - and - burn scenario .
I accept the fact that if something was n’t done to stave off bankruptcy for the companies that financed half the country ’s mortgages , worse news would be coming .
What I dispute is the need for any of this to have had to happen .
And I dispute the nuts on cable and other news programs who are placing blame everywhere but where it belongs .
We live in a global society and take part in a global economy .
That is clear .
What happens here affects people over there and vice versa .
I get that .
What I do n’t get is why when the worst happens , when the inevitable results in the kind of pain we are just starting to experience , and when what has been clear to all who have watched actually comes true , why is it that the people in this country are so willing to forgive and forget ?
What I mean is , why are we so willing to forgive our leaders for letting us get into this mess and so eager to forget that we are the people who put them there ?
Why are we so eager to forgive those who make mistakes with our hard - earned money and then forget that they lost our 401 ( k ) s , our American dreams and our confidence that made America so different from most other places ?
And why are we so willing to forgive those who told us all was well when it was n’t and forget that we are the people who forced them to lie to us lest we fail to return them to office ?
The fact is that the voters in this country are almost as culpable as the elected leaders who led us down the primrose path full of economic thorns .
We claim to revere the capitalistic system , but we are quick to cry out when the inevitable excesses that result from a failure of government oversight lead to the kind of collapses we are experiencing .
We vote time and again for an ideology that says whatever the market wants , the market gets and then , when the market fails us because we failed to watch those people in charge of our money , we think about doing the same thing again !
This is not a political column .
I still do n’t know for whom I will vote this fall .
But , what I do know is that people who tell me the marketplace will take care of itself and then ca n’t wait to use government to bail out the risk takers — the ones who lost my money and yours — with my tax dollars , are people who should not be in charge of anything .
If we are a capitalistic system that believes the marketplace cures all , then keep our government ’s hands off our money and let those who took the risk and failed do just that .
If , however , you believe that capitalism is good but that greedy capitalists are bad and should be watched , then we must elect people who do n’t turn their backs on the kind of oversight rules and regulations that were designed to protect us from exactly what is happening .
Instead , we elect people with an attitude that ignores the inevitability of greed - led destruction , and now we are shocked when we fall victim to that excess .
How stupid can we get ?
So here ’s the next test .
I , like millions of other Americans , am not immune to the destructive nature of what is happening right now .
I could be looking for a job unless the American people throw all the bums out , get some new bums with brains instead of ideology , and start us down a path to economic fiscal sanity .
But , just in case , I have found my dream job .
Now that the government effectively owns AIG — with our 85 billion dollars and counting — and now that the government has decided to go into competition with private enterprise — now there is a Republican anathema — I am sure there will be a top job available .
It will pay far more than a GS - 15 or whatever the top federal job classification is — probably dozens of millions of dollars more — and it will come with the government ’s vaunted retirement plan and health care program .
The best part is the working hours .
Nine to five Monday through Friday , weekends off and more holidays and vacations than you can possibly imagine .
If I do n’t get a bailout like the big guys , I will settle for that job .
Of course , I ca n’t guarantee I wo n’t lose any money .
Only the taxpayers can do that .
Ain’t that the truth .
Brian Greenspun is editor of the Las Vegas Sun .
Last week , there was still a Wall Street .
This week , there are a bunch of holding companies .
From the Wall Street Journal :
The Federal Reserve , in an attempt to prevent the crisis on Wall Street from infecting its two premier institutions , took the extraordinary measure on Sunday night of agreeing to convert investment banks Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. into traditional bank holding companies .
In return for access to the Fed ’s emergency lending facilities , the firms would need to subject themselves to more oversight .
The step could have far reaching effects on their profitability and their business models .
With the move , Wall Street as it has long been known — a coterie of independent brokerage firms that buy and sell securities , advise clients and are less regulated than old - fashioned banks — will cease to exist .
Unless you ’re a finance professional , this bank holding company business does n’t make immediate sense .
A bank holding company , by definition , is a corporation in control of two or more banks .
But that ’s not what matters in this case .
Wikipedia elaborates :
Becoming a bank holding company makes it easier for the firm to raise capital than if it remained a traditional bank .
It can assume debt of shareholders on a tax free basis , borrow money , acquire other banks and non -bank entities more easily , and issue stock with greater ease .
It also has a greater legal authority to repurchase its own stock once issued .
In return , bank holding companies agree to increased regulation and examination by not only the SEC , but several other branches of the government .
Their ability to take risks will be vastly diminished , and they ’ll be required to hold more capital on reserve .
As holding companies , Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs will increase their retail units in order to make money off customer deposits .
CNN says that “ the companies … hope the shift will end investors ’ fears that the investment banks are not solid enough to survive . ”
Ahem .
Note to companies :
You ’re not investment banks anymore .
Note to government : Bank customers are also taxpayers .
With $ 700 billion to cover in upcoming years , customers wo n’t have much to deposit .
Ouch .
Making Money on a New Cold War The Russia - Georgia clash has generated heated anti-Moscow rhetoric from John McCain and U.S. neoconservatives about a new Cold War , a prospect that most people might see in a negative light but which many military contractors surely view as a financial plus .

One unstated reality about revived tensions between Washington and Moscow is that it will mean a bonanza in military spending – billions of additional dollars for anti-missile weapons systems , larger armies , construction of new bases in Eastern Europe , etc .
Indeed , the spending on Cold War II could dwarf what military contractors are now making on the “ war on terror ” – and the prospect of spending on both conflicts simultaneously should make arms industry executives drool .
Others who stand to profit grandly from a new East - West showdown include tough - talking politicians and their friends in Washington think tanks – like Heritage , AEI and CSIS – that have long fattened up on contributions from the defense industry and related corporations .
There would be losers , too , like taxpayers who would see more of their dollars go to “ national security ” and less to domestic needs , from repairs to the crumbling infrastructure to the costs of health care , education , the environment and Social Security .
But , in many ways , the exploitation of Cold War fears – to divert money away from domestic needs to the coffers of what Dwight Eisenhower dubbed “ the military - industrial complex ” – is nothing new .
Arguably , the original Cold War ended under Eisenhower ’s former Vice President , Richard Nixon , who as President returned from Moscow in 1972 carrying a strategic agreement that he had reached with what was already a rapidly decaying Soviet Union .
“ In Moscow , we witnessed the beginning of the end of that era which began in 1945 , ” Nixon said .
“ With this step , we have enhanced the security of both nations .
We have begun to reduce the level of fear , by reducing the causes of fear , our two peoples , and for all the peoples of the world . ”
Nixon unveiled a new era of realpolitik cooperation between Washington and Moscow that he called “ détente . ”
However , while reducing fears and lowering tensions might be good news for many people , it was n’t welcomed by the corporations that profited from the fears and the tensions , nor by the intellectual hired guns who had built lucrative careers in politics , media and academia by exaggerating those fears and exacerbating those tensions .
Sabotaging Détente So , Nixon ’s era of “ détente ” was short - lived .
After his ouster over the Watergate scandal in 1974 , a new batch of Cold Warriors – some operating from conviction and others from expediency – returned to the old patterns of hyping threats and stoking paranoia .
In 1975 , with President Gerald Ford confronting an internal Republican challenge from Ronald Reagan on the Right , many key figures associated with “ détente ” were purged , while hard - liners were given key jobs .
The so - called Halloween Massacre saw Henry Kissinger , the chief architect of détente , stripped of his post as national security adviser to be replaced by Gen.
Brent Scowcroft ; James Schlesinger was out as Defense Secretary while Donald Rumsfeld was in ; CIA Director William Colby lost his job to George H.W. Bush ; and Dick Cheney was promoted to Ford ’s White House chief of staff .
Soon , alarming rumors began spreading around Washington about a new Soviet secret weapon , a nuclear - armed submarine that was undetectable to American technology .
These Soviet subs could be lurking off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts ready to launch a nuclear attack without warning , a frightened public was told .
So , as Ford struggled in Republican primaries against Reagan , the word “ détente ” was banished from the administration ’s lexicon .
Then , to appease the Right further , CIA Director Bush let a right - wing panel of outsiders critique the work of CIA analysts who had been detecting a declining Soviet threat .
The outsiders , known as “ Team B ” and including a young neocon named Paul Wolfowitz , tore into the CIA professionals and insisted that the Soviet Union was rapidly outstripping the United States as a strategic power .
“ Team B ” concluded that the Soviets were building a new generation of terrifying weapons , including those undetectable subs .
Years later , after the Soviet Union collapsed , it would become clear that “ Team B ” had been living in a fantasy world .
Not only did the Soviets lack the new weapons systems , but they were falling rapidly behind the United States in technology and thus the development of sophisticated weapons .
But the “ Team B ” report served its purpose .
Its dramatic findings shaped an alarmist CIA intelligence estimate that CIA Director Bush left behind to limit the arms - control initiatives of Jimmy Carter ’s incoming administration .
[ For details , see Robert Parry ’s Secrecy & Privilege . ]
During the late 1970s , the hysteria on the Right about mythical Soviet weapons continued to grow , pushed along by an arch - conservative group called the Committee on the Present Danger , which warned of a “ window of vulnerability . ”
The fear about secret Soviet capabilities seeped into mainstream news coverage critical of Carter ’s proposed arms deals with Moscow .
‘ Winning ’ the Cold War By 1980 and the election of Ronald Reagan , the old Cold Warriors and their younger neoconservative allies had gained the upper hand .
Assuming power under Reagan , they immediately sought to bury any remnants of the Nixon - Kissinger détente .
At the CIA , hard - line Director William Casey and his deputy , Robert Gates , purged CIA analysts who still insisted on seeing a Soviet decline .
The only acceptable analysis was to agree that the Soviets were on the march and set on world domination .
In reaction to this perceived Soviet threat , there was a massive expansion in U.S. military spending , combined with aggressive covert operations in dirty wars from Central America to Afghanistan .
There , the Reagan administration sent sophisticated weapons to rebel forces that included Islamic fundamentalists , such as Osama bin Laden .
Ironically , when the Soviet Union finally collapsed in 1991 , the CIA analytical division was mocked for having “ missed ” this momentous event .
Meanwhile , the U.S. news media credited Reagan ’s vast military spending , especially his “ Star Wars ” missile defense program and the Afghan war , with “ winning ” the Cold War .
The counter - analysis – that the Soviet Union was in a death spiral by the early 1970s and that Reagan ’s aggressive strategies may have , if anything , prolonged the Cold War by strengthening the hands of Moscow ’s hardliners – was ignored or dismissed .
Reagan ’s legacy had another consequence .
The triumphant neocons insisted on dispatching to Moscow free - market “ shock therapists ” who aided and abetted a new class of rapacious “ robber barons ” as they stripped the country of its assets and stuck the nation ’s capital in offshore accounts .
U.S. policy also supported the dismemberment of the old Soviet empire and humiliated Moscow by expanding NATO deep into its traditional sphere of influence .
In 1999 , Russia faced a new disgrace when the Clinton administration spearheaded a NATO war against Moscow ’s longtime allies in Serbia , over the breakaway province of Kosovo .
When George W. Bush became President in 2001 , his administration welcomed back many of the key neocons and hardliners who had served in previous Republican administrations .
Cheney was Vice President ; Rumsfeld was Defense Secretary ; Wolfowitz was Rumsfeld ’s deputy .
On the other hand , Bush claimed to have forged a bond of personal trust with Vladimir Putin by looking into the Russian president ’s eyes .
“ I was able to get a sense of his soul , a man deeply committed to his country and the best interests of his country , ” Bush said on June 16 , 2001 .
Neocon Strategy
Though many U.S. observers mocked Bush ’s comment and cited Putin ’s history as a KGB agent , the underlying reality was that Bush never treated Putin as a trustworthy partner .
The kind words represented a façade for a continued U.S. campaign to box in and undermine Russia .
In June 2002 , for instance , Bush withdrew the United States from Nixon ’s 1972 Ballistic Missile Treaty to clear the way for deployment of a missile defense system that Moscow saw as a strategic threat given its deteriorating nuclear - missile arsenal .
As Russia ’s leaders fumed about the abrogated ABM Treaty , Bush spoke cavalierly .
“ The treaty is now behind us , ” he said , while reaffirming his commitment to deploy a missile defense system “ as soon as possible . ”
The Bush administration and its oil - industry allies also supported the construction of the Baku - Tblisi - Ceyhan pipeline , which was designed to deliver Caspian oil to the West and to Israel while avoiding Russian territory .
The pipeline ’s primary contractor was Bechtel , a company with long - standing ties to powerful Republicans .
The pipeline also enhanced the need to make sure that the former Soviet republic of Georgia was under the control of a reliably pro-Western leader .
So , U.S. - financed political organizations , such as the National Endowment for Democracy , poured in money to help an anti-Russian political movement called the Rose Revolution , as well as to groom pro-Washington politicians like Mikheil Saakashvili .
In 2003 , the bloodless Rose Revolution brought Saakashvili to power and , in his gratitude , the new president named a major boulevard in the capital of Tiblisi after George W. Bush .
Saakashvili also committed Georgian soldiers to Bush ’s “ coalition of the willing ” in Iraq , and brought in U.S. and Israeli military trainers to advise the Georgian army .
Meanwhile , the Bush administration kept up the pressure on Moscow by adding more of the former Warsaw Pact nations to NATO , pushing the Western military alliance right up to Russia ’s borders .
In 2007 , Bush announced plans to deploy interceptor missiles to Poland with supporting radar tracking stations in the Czech Republic .
Though Bush insisted the missile defense was intended to counter potential threats from rogue states , like Iran , the Russians saw the move as threatening to them .
Arms Export magazine editor Mikhail Barabanov , writing in the Moscow newspaper Kommersant , said the real U.S. motivation for placing interceptor missiles in Poland was to expand U.S. military and strategic capacities and constrict those of other nuclear states , such as Russia and China .
Russia Strikes Back
In effect , Russian leaders became convinced that Bush ’s words about partnership were just sweet talk disguising the neocon agenda , as described by the Project for the New American Century , of crippling potential challengers to American global dominance .
Yet , under Putin ’s firm grip , Russian authorities were steadily regaining control of the nation ’s political destiny .
“ Robber barons ” were exiled or jailed , their media outlets throttled , their businesses brought under the Kremlin ’s thumb .
The rise in commodities prices for Russian oil , natural gas and metals also put money into the national treasury and helped Putin rebuild his military might .
That was the backdrop to the crisis in Georgia .
President Saakashvili , trusting in the support of his neocon American allies , decided the time was ripe to crush pro-Russian separatists in South Ossetia , an attack he launched on Aug. 7 , the eve of the Olympics .
If Saakashvili thought his offensive would go answered – that the Russians again would retreat rather than risk offending the West – he thought wrong .
The Russians counterattacked , expelled Georgia forces from both South Ossetia and another breakaway province Abkhazia , and took up strategic positions inside Georgia .
The American political elite , led by Sen. McCain and President Bush , and neocon editorialists , including at the Washington Post , raged against the Russian military thrust , but the Russians were not deterred .
They agreed to a ceasefire largely on their terms and left Saakashvili to fume about his betrayal by Western powers .
Bush , however , did back up his angry words with some action .
On Aug. 15 , the United States and Poland finalized an agreement to deploy American missile defenses onto Polish territory .
Patriot anti-missile missiles , now in Germany , were to be moved to Poland along with support crews .
The next day , the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs ratcheted up the tensions by defining the American move as a provocative threat to Russian security and warning of possible military action against Poland .
“ The Russian side in such a situation will take adequate measures to compensate for potential threats to its national security , ” the Ministry said , referring not to diplomatic but to “ military - technological methods . ”
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev added , “ Placing elements of a global anti-missile system by the U.S. in Eastern Europe only deepens the situation , and we will be forced to react to this adequately . ”
Some observers suggested that the Russians were now facing a situation similar to what President John Kennedy confronted in 1962 when the Soviets installed missiles in Cuba , a crisis that pushed the world to the brink of a nuclear confrontation before Moscow relented and removed the missiles .
Still , despite the risks to humanity , the rewards of a revived Cold War – with fatter defense budgets and greater demand for anti-Russian propaganda – will benefit military contractors , neocon theorists and politicians who again can exploit the fears of the American people .

NASHVILLE , Tenn .-- Calculators are useful tools in elementary mathematics classes , if students already have some basic skills , new research has found .
The findings shed light on the debate about whether and when calculators should be used in the classroom .
" These findings suggest that it is important children first learn how to calculate answers on their own , but after that initial phase , using calculators is a fine thing to do , even for basic multiplication facts , " Bethany Rittle - Johnson , assistant professor of psychology in Vanderbilt 's Peabody College of education and human development and co-author of the study , said .
The research is currently in press at the Journal of Experimental Child Psychology and is available on the journal 's Web site : http://tinyurl .
com / 5f8tgd .
Rittle - Johnson and co-author Alexander Kmicikewycz , who completed the work as his undergraduate honors thesis at Peabody , found that the level of a student 's knowledge of mathematics facts was the determining factor in whether a calculator hindered his or her learning .
" The study indicates technology such as calculators can help kids who already have a strong foundation in basic skills , " Kmicikewycz , now a teacher in New York City public schools , said .
" For students who did not know many multiplication facts , generating the answers on their own , without a calculator , was important and helped their performance on subsequent tests , " Rittle - Johnson added .
" But for students who already knew some multiplication facts , it did n't matter -- using a calculator to practice neither helped nor harmed them . "
The researchers compared third graders ' performance on multiplication problems after they had spent a class period working on other multiplication problems .
Some of the students spent that class period generating answers on their own , while others simply read the answers from a calculator .
All students used a calculator to check their answers .
The researchers found that the calculator 's effect on subsequent performance depended on how much the students knew to begin with .
For those students who already had some multiplication skills , using the calculator before taking the test had no impact .
But for those who were not good at multiplying , use of the calculator had a negative impact on their performance .
The researchers also found that the students using calculators were able to practice more problems and had fewer errors .
" Teachers struggle with how to give kids immediate feedback , which we know speeds the learning process .
So , another use for calculators is allowing students to use them to check the answers they have come up with by themselves , giving them immediate feedback and more time for practice , " Rittle - Johnson said .
And , for many of the students , using calculators was simply fun .
" Kids enjoyed them .
It 's one way to make memorizing your multiplication facts a more interesting thing to do , " Rittle - Johnson said .
" So much of how you teach depends on how you market the material -- presentation is very important to kids , " Kmicikewycz added .
" Many of these students had never used a calculator before , so it added a fun aspect to math class for them . "
" It 's a good tool that some teachers shy away from , because they are worried it 's going to have negative consequences , " Rittle - Johnson said .
" I think that the evidence suggests there are good uses of calculators , even in elementary school . "

In the early days of August , a suspected drug- running boat zoomed through the Straits of Florida , trying to outrun her American pursuers .
The drug boat zigged and zagged near reefs and sandbars at 42 knots , and skimmed over water as little as five feet deep .
Ordinarily , that would have been enough shake off any Coast Guard cutter or Navy frigate chasing her – those vessels can't be in such shallow water .
But this pursuer kept coming , and coming .
Finally , after two hours , the drug boat ran out of gas .
During their interrogations , the drug - running suspects said it was like being chased by a UFO .
The ship was n't alien , however .
It was an 80 - foot , 60 - ton , $ 6 million experimental vessel , built for the Defense Department , called the Stiletto .
A Batman - esque , double - M- shaped hull allows Stiletto to operate in extremely shallow waters .
A carbon fiber body let 's the thing cruise at up to 60 knots .
And a series of gigbit ethernet connections allows radars to drone - controllers to infrared sensors to be positioned anywhere throughout the ship .
Originally developed by the Pentagon 's now - defunct Office of Force Transformation as a kind of floating lab , the Stiletto's eye - popping design has won praise from all corners of the Defense Department .
But since its sponsoring office went dark , the Stiletto has been a bit of an orphan in the Pentagon 's bureaucracy .
Finally , it was sent to the coasts of Colombia for drug- interdiction duty .
U.S. Southern Command announced the Stiletto's presence to the local press , saying it would patrol the reefs and sandbars that ordinary served as drug- running sanctuaries .
The cocaine ships stop going there .
" In football terms , it was like having a shut - down corner .
People do n't throw to that side of the field , " Captain James Hruska , the Defense Department 's Stiletto program manager , tells DANGER ROOM .
But on the way home from Colombia , Stiletto saw action in the Straits of Florida .
And got confused for a UFO .

' Eye stabs ' was our team name .
Pyweek , finished recently , and was a real blast ... as usual .
Congrats to everyone who took part , pyweek was really fun !
I look forward to playing everyones games ( I 've only got through around ten so far ) .
We did n't post a final entry .
Our game is n't really at the stage where we 'd like it to be ...
There 's still a number of core features required before it's a ' game ' .
At the moment , it 's kind of a fun intro , and a demo of what the game could be .
For me , recently these competitions have been about experimenting , rather than finishing a game .
Getting a buzz off everyone else 's energy as they create something in a small amount of time .
These competitions are also really good for ' finishing ' a game ... since they have a finish built in .
When the week has ended it 's finished .
So we 'll make a release some time in the next few weeks .
Because we want to show everyone ... but not before the basic elements are in place .

In the dirty underground music scene often referred to as ' eye stabs ' , there are lethal gigs in select nightclubs around the world .
Musicians play for eyes .
A tune is played to the musician , and they must figure out the notes played .
Fuck up the tune , and you are stabbed in the eye !
Get the tune right , fortune and respect are yours !
Better than the riches and the adoration though -- rich club owners can give you spare eyes ... and provide doctors that can give you back eyes you have had stabbed out .
So are you prepared to put your eyes on the line ?
Can you play well enough to avoid a stab in the eye ?
Do you trust the sleazy club owners doctors to fix your eye if it does get stabbed ? " " "

Screen shot of which
notes you need to play
and which notes you played .
It 's a musical ear trainer .
kick arse intro ( goes for 60 seconds or so ) .
I would be happy playing it at party .
played around with portaudio .
Which seems like the best solution for portable audio .
I think we might use it in pygame ( with likely something like swmixer )
learned to use ocempgui ( finally ) .
got pitch recognition working for guitar fairly well .
Learned about how the algorithm works , and the various limitations .
with a little more work , the game could teach people about music .
We hoped to make it a useful program , as well as fun .
Nicholas has already taken the pitch recognition parts to allow it to talk to other ear training programs .
pygame.threads.tmap combined with pygame .
fastevents turned out to be a really nice way to do multithreading .
authors of libraries we used were very helpful .
Especially Nathan ( swmixer ) , and Marcus ( ocempgui ) .
cool samples , and music .
moxi made some cool music and samples .
We only managed to use some of them because of the rush .
However we are going to use more later .
found 4 new pygame bugs , and about 8 bugs in other python libraries .
Even though they wasted time , it was good to find them .
Screen shot of intro .
thinking pyweek ended on sunday 5 pm , when it ended sunday 10 am .
dissapearing gfx team member , so I had to work on gfx elements at the last moments , when we realised he was n't going to contribute .
spent most of the time on the intro .
Including spending six hours failing to get the video playing with pygame .
movie , and instead writing a multithreaded motion jpeg video player .
game elements left to the end .
We should have polished those parts first .
( But had lots of fun with other stuff :)
python bloat , and py2exe .
Python really has put on the megabytes since python2.3 .
Took a while getting the size down from an initial 26 MB to 6MB .
This was important ' cause some of our team were on dialup modems .
had technical issues getting the pitch recognition stuff working .
That took a while .
Was kind of pythons fault really .
Including issues with the GIL ( pyaudio does n't release the GIL ) .
Also the non deterministic way in which python does stuff ( dicts , garbage collection , finalisers ) .
Calling processes in python is also hard to do multiplatform nicely ( even , and especially between different versions of windows ) .
issues with pygame sound loops , and Sound object loading .
This wasted a lot of time .
You can't win or lose the game .
We should have added game elements nearer the start of the week .
In the doctors surgery ...
trying to repair your stabbed eyes .
Think a guitar hero type game , with an insane premise , and instead using a real guitar for playing the notes ( instead of a toy guitar ) .
There are also ' sim musician ' elements .
You need to select which gigs to do , and collect myspace fans .
Well that was the idea anyway .
Whoever thinks Paulson will fairly negotiate a deal with his old pals on Wall Street – fair for the American public , that is – I have some toxic debt to sell you for a great deal .
We need to go way back to the start and look at what is fair for the taxpayer , not for Wall Street .
And again , if we ’re going to have control of their sorry businesses , we need much more control of this situation .
Remember , the American taxpayer did not ask for this , but were forced into this dreadful situation due to the failures of Wall Street .
We should not help Wall Street continue their lifestyle , especially if it ’s only a very short term boost , as many are suggesting .
The panicked intervention will not stop this economy from unraveling and may only delay the inevitable .
More from Krugman :
I hate to say this , but looking at the plan as leaked , I have to say no deal .
Not unless Treasury explains , very clearly , why this is supposed to work , other than through having taxpayers pay premium prices for lousy assets .
As I posted earlier today , it seems all too likely that a “ fair price ” for mortgage - related assets will still leave much of the financial sector in trouble .
And there ’s nothing at all in the draft that says what happens next ; although I do notice that there ’s nothing in the plan requiring Treasury to pay a fair market price .
So is the plan to pay premium prices to the most troubled institutions ?
Or is the hope that restoring liquidity will magically make the problem go away ?
Looking forward , when every other industry comes to Washington for their latest installment of corporate welfare ( such as Detroit and the airline industry ) we also need to seriously review executive compensation .
If the taxpayers are going to be on the hook for bailing them out , it is only fair that the Mr. $ 21 million in four weeks at Ford either refuses compensation for this period or is paid a very low salary .
The Detroit CEOs and senior executives have all blown it , so come back to planet earth instead of living the high life .
Live on the salary of a line worker without all of the side benefits and then talk to us about a bailout .
Rather than building stronger ocean - based structures to withstand tsunamis , it might be easier to simply make the structures disappear .
A collaboration of physicists from the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique ( CNRS ) and Aix - Marseille Universite in France and the University of Liverpool in England have conducted laboratory experiments showing that it 's possible to make type of dike that acts as an invisibility cloak that hides off - shore platforms from water waves .
The principle is analogous to the optical invisibility cloaks that are currently a hot area of physics research .
Tsunami invisibility cloaks would n't make structures disappear from sight , but they could manipulate ocean waves in ways that makes off - shore platforms , and possibly even coastlines and small islands , effectively invisible to tsunamis .
If the scheme works as well in the real world as the lab - scale experiments suggest , a tsunami should be able to pass right by with little or no effect on anything hidden behind the cloak .
Yay !
We get nervous and saddened when the SFist Flickr pool is n't brimming pics .
But today ?
It is !

Faith - Cases Rejected
" A Christian counselor who was fired after refusing to help a lesbian client has lost her fight .
The U.S. Supreme Court on 10/19/2001 refused to hear an appeal by Sandra Bruff from Tupelo , Miss .
A family and marriage counselor at North Mississippi Medical Center , Bruff had been awarded $ 2 million in 1998 after a district court agreed she had been the victim of religious discrimination when let go for refusing to counsel someone against her beliefs .
But the award was later cut to $ 300,000 , and the decision subsequently overturned by an appeals court , The Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal reported .
The justices also declined to hear the appeal of a Texas police officer fired for wearing a crucifix pin on his uniform .
George Daniels lost his job in 1998 after twice refusing to take off the pin .
The 14 - year decorated sergeant had started wearing it when he became a plainclothes officer , said the Associated Press . "

The Pledge Banned
" The Madison ( Wisconsin ) school Board is taking heavy criticism for a decision effectively barring children from saying the Pledge of Allegiance in class .
Saying The Pledge is a daily part of class for Mrs. Weiss ' second - graders at Rawson Elementary in South Milwaukee .
But , it 's the ' one nation under God ' line that the Madison School Board found offensive .
' What I wanted to do was eliminate that which would be repugnant to those who believe very strongly and would have their personal and political beliefs violated by group coercion , ' Madison School District board member Bill Keys said .
J. J. Sprague of South Milwaukee said , ' It 's poor timing , very poor timing .
This is a time when the entire country is uniting and we are all praying for the survivors and the victims of the recent national disaster . '
On 10/9/2001 , The Madison School Board announced that it will reconsider its decision after the school district received 426 e-mails and phone calls with only five supporting their decision . "

National Day of Prayer
" The American Center for Law and Justice ( ACLJ ) , a conservative , Christian civil rights group , said today it is encouraged that the U.S. Supreme Court has ordered a federal appeals court to reconsider its ruling that the City of Tucson acted properly when it discriminated against a couple , Patricia and Robert Gentala , who organized a public event celebrating the A National Day of Prayer in 1997 .
Under the city 's Civic Event Policy , nonprofit groups are eligible for a waiver of charges for various services - such as lighting and trash collection - in connection with events held in city parks .
Pursuant to the policy , Tucson has provided free city services for such events as an Earthday Festival , A Hispanic Cultural Arts Event , and a Gay Pride Picnic .
However , the city refused to provide free services for the Gentalas and their National Day of Prayer event , citing ' separation of church and state . ' "

10/10/2001 . ) Voluntary School Prayer
" Barry Lynn , who head the Washington - based Americans United for Separation of Church and State , says his group has fielded various complaints that schools are n't enforcing rules on religious expression since Sept. 11 .
' We do n't thin you can suspend the religious liberty rules for the country because of a national tragedy , ' Rev. Lynn said .
' I think people should understand that we do n't change the rules about fundamental constitutional rights . '
Former California Rep. William F. Dannemeyer , who leads Americans for Voluntary School Prayer , strongly disagrees .
The heightened spiritual awareness fuels his call for a constitutional amendment to restore prayer in schools .
' This issue is n't just school prayer , but it is broader than that : whether we as a people believe that God exists , ' said Dannemeyer . "

About 250 people , many clad in red , white and blue , gathered to support the message , which was placed on a marquee in front of the school after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the United States .
The American Civil Liberties Union contends that the words ' God Bless America ' broadcast ' a hurtful , divisive message . '

Offensive Misconduct ?
" The Supreme Court on 10/1/2001 let stand a ruling that overturned the death sentence for a murderer from California because the prosecutor told jurors that God sanctioned the death penalty for evil people .
The justices declined to review a U.S. appeals court ruling that Alfred Sandoval 's right to a fair trial at sentencing had been violated by the prosecutor 's closing argument that cited religious authority as support for the death penalty .
The prosecutor said that by sentencing Sandoval to death , the jury would be ' doing what Gos says . '
The prosecutor said God sanctioned the death penalty for people like Sandoval who were evil and have defied the authority of the state .
Sandoval was convicted of four murders and one attempted murder in Los Angeles in 1984 .
The Supreme Court , without any comment or dissent , rejected an appeal by California Attorney General Bill Lockyer .
He said the prosecutor 's comments , while offensive , do not ' run afoul of the court 's teachings . '
Lockyer said the appeals court could not marshal any direct authority from the Supreme Court to support its finding that the prosecutor 's misconduct amounted to constitutional error . "

" A California judge recently threw out a case by a former student who sued his high school because he was barred from making references to God in his graduation speech .
In 1999 , Nicholas Lassonde filed a suit against Pleasanton Unified School District officials after he was ordered to remove the phrase ' to seek the Lord and let Him guide you ' from his speech , The Oakland Tribune reported .
Co-salutatorian of the graduation ceremony , Lassonde claimed the officials ' decision to censor the speech violated his state and constitutional freedoms of speech and religion .
But during his ruling , U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson concluded that permitting the religious statements would have violated the constitutional requirement of separation of church and state , the Tribune stated .
Lassonde - now attending a Christian college in Southern California - agreed to edit the speech for the ceremony , but he told the audience his talk had been censored . "

Blurring Church and State ?
" Since the terrorist attacks , school districts and local governments seem to be blurring - some say crossing - the line between church and state .
Lawmakers have urged Americans to pray , and some students are doing so openly in class .
' I think you 're going to see more Americans not putting up with those secularists trying to make the public square a religion - free zone , ' said Richard D. Land , president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission , the public policy arm of the Southern Baptist Convention .
Some groups say such displays violate the Constitution 's First Amendment prohibition against government establishment of religion .
' The constitutional rights of the religious minority cannot be shoved aside in a time of national crisis , ' said Barry Lynn , executive director of Americans United for the Separation of Church and State .
' I hope these efforts to cross constitutional boundaries stop , ' he said . "

No Holiday Trees ?
" Ornaments with a religious theme might be allowed on the state Capitol holiday tree for the first time in more than a decade , a top state official said .
The tree in the Capitol rotunda is sponsored each year by a different organization , which typically asks the public to help decorate the tree by submitting handmade ornaments .
But the state guidelines that groups can not have ornaments of a religious nature .
Those guidelines were based on an informal policy that has been in place since at least the mid-1980s , after a lawsuit was filed to stop the display of the tree on the grounds that it violated the separation of church and state .
That lawsuit was unsuccessful , but the state has had an unwritten policy banning religious ornaments on the tree .
State officials and workers also have been careful to call the tree a ' holiday tree , ' not a ' Christian tree . '
The Madison - based Freedom from Religion Foundation , has protested the tree for years and says it is strongly opposed to a change in the unwritten policy . "

" Reports indicate that in the wake of the terrorist attacks in new York and Washington D.C. , many school officials are suddenly putting aside their fears of the American Civil Liberties Union and allowing students to turn to God .
While there have been isolated incidents of schools continui9ng to take a hard line against expressions of Christian faith , others realize that with the President calling for a nation to pray , students should not be denied an opportunity to abide by his wishes .
As an example , the Atlanta Journal - Constitution recently reported that when students at Stockbridge High School expressed a desire to pray in the wake of the terrorist attacks , assistant principal Ingrid Forbes did not hesitate to grant their wish for a room to have a service .

Evicting Churches Stopped
" A federal judge has dealt a blow to the ACLU by rejecting the organization 's attempt to evict churches from rented school property .
In February 1999 , the American Civil Liberties Union filed suit against the Manatee County School Board , claiming that the Florida school district violated the Constitution by allowing churches to rent school facilities after school hours in order to conduct meetings .
Mat Staver of the Florida - based Liberty Counsel , which represented 15 churches that rent school facilities during non-school time , says the federal court 's ruling is a victory for the First Amendment .
' To evict the churches and to discriminate solely against religion would in fact violate the First Amendment , ' Staver says , ' so this is a great victory for churches around the country because oftentimes new churches use public school facilities in their start - up phase . '
The attorney says the ruling proves that churches and other Christina organizations cannot be singled out for discrimination .
' The churches have a constitutional right to rent the facilities from the school board , ' Staver says .
' The ACLU 's version of the Constitution would create hostility toward religion and treat religious speech like second - class speech .
The churches have just as much right to rent the facilities as the secular organizations . ' "

Prayer Meeting Ban Lifted
 A federal judges order lifting a towns ban on family prayer meetings at home has plunged New Milford , Conn. , officials into secret strategy sessions to find a way to restore the restrictions .
In a decision issued earlier in July , U.S. magistrate Judge Holly B. Fitzsimmons wrote that the towns restrictions were illegal under a 2000 federal law , the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized persons Act ( RLUIPA ) , which forbids zoning or other restrictions that place a substantial burden on religion .
 People who previously attended the prayer group meetings were no longer participating because the towns actions made them afraid they would be arrested ,  Judge Fitzsimmons said in barring enforcement of the towns cease - and - desist order against the prayer meetings .
The decision has energized religious - interest groups seeking a replacement for the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 , which the Supreme Court in 1997 declared unconstitutional in a 6 - 3 ruling that federal law may not prohibit local zoning restrictions that bar expansion of a church .

Supporting his claims , the founder of a Christian legal defense organization said there is a growing hostility  against churches that try to expand their ministry stakes .
 The pastors weve spoken with have been unanimous in saying that the No. 1 hindrance to preventing church growth is not lack of funds or committed membership ,  Brad Dacus , president of the Sacramento , Calif . - based Pacific Justice Institute , said .
 It is intolerance from government that s standing in the way .

 We discovered almost every church had a story to tell of how they ran into trouble and were not treated with respect by the city ,  he said .
One pastor said ,  We thought you were civil servants , instead you act like civil lords . 

The issue got so heated that schools Superintendent Barbara Grohe placed a moratorium on the guidelines and a committee was charged with defining new ones .

Political Psychobabble
 To protect lesbian and gay students from discrimination , the American Psychological Association ( APA ) may soon erase an exemption in its accreditation policy that allows religious - affiliated colleges and universities to weigh religion in admissions and hiring decisions .
APA members are concerned schools could use the exemption , known as footnote four ,  to discriminate against lesbian and gay students .
The APA is the only group approved by the U.S. Department of Education to accredit graduate programs in psychology .
To be accredited , the APA requires that schools practice non-discriminatory policies and actively promote cultural and individual diversity when recruiting faculty and students .
Footnote four allows programs with a religious affiliation to adopt admission policies that directly relate to the religion , but the schools still must follow diversity guidelines .
So while religious schools can give preference to applicants on the basis of religion , they may not discriminate on the basis of cultural or individual characteristics .
The proposed change in policy could be important because many states require psychologists to graduate from an APA - accredited school in order to practice clinical psychology .

6/26/2001 . ) Recent Church - State Cases
 The U.S. Supreme Court announced its responses to three church - state cases June 18 and in the process provided a mixture of results on religion and public schools .
The high court of our land :
¨ Allowed to stand a federal appeals court ruling that permits student - initiated , student - led prayer at such school functions as football games and graduations in Alabama .
¨ Rejected and returned to a federal appeals court for further consideration a decision barring the Louisiana Christian Coalition from using school facilities
¨ Declined to review a lower - court decision that allowed a school to bar a first - grader from reading a story out of the Beginners Bible .
The prayer decision enables a 1993 Alabama law permitting student - led religious expression at school events to be in effect .
A federal judge issued a permanent injunction in 1997 against such religious activities , but the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the decision .
The appeals court reconsidered the case in light of last years Supreme Court opinion striking down student - led prayer at high school football games in Texas , but it affirmed its earlier ruling despite the high courts decision .
In the case involving the Christian Coalition , the high court vacated a Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals decision against the organization and told the court to review its ruling in light of the Supreme Courts recent opinion on a religious organizations use of a school building .
In that June 11 decision , Good News Club v. Milford Central School , the high court ruled a school rule prohibiting a Christian group from meeting on campus after hours when other organizations were allowed to was unconstitutional .
In the Bible reading case , the justices refused to grant a review , thereby allowing a lower - court ruling in favor of a New Jersey school to stand .
A teacher and principal in Medford , N.J. , prevented first - grader Zachary Hood from reading from his Bible to his classmates though other students were permitted to read stories from other sources .

Wheres the Outrage ?
 If you re not outraged , you re not paying attention .
Consider the following :
In certain areas of the Pacific Northwest , churches cannot construct new buildings or even expand their facilities .
An Orange County , Fla. , ordinance does not allow for a religious gathering of any kind in a residential area .
Thus a small prayer meeting cannot be held in a private living room .
Recently , a Vermont couple was denied their request for vanity license plates .
The reason , their choice of ROMANS5 and ROMANS8 might be offensive to others .
These are but three examples  the tip of the proverbial iceberg  of religious intolerance currently faced by religious conservatives in America .
If a religion possesses exclusive truth and moral absolutes , it is view by many with disdain .
Conservative Christians are especially looked upon with contempt .
Many who are potential targets of the religious bigotry creeping across America yawn at its reality .
Granted , the intolerance is only a mild irritant when compared to the true persecution occurring in other areas of the world .
However , left unchallenged this bias could well become government censure of certain politically incorrect religions .

Christianity 's True Freedom
" The worst kind of religion is no religion at all - and those living in ease , luxury and indifference to religion may be thankful they live in lands where the gospel has tamed the beastliness and ferocity of men , who , but for Christianity might long ago have eaten their carcasses like the South Sea islanders or cut off their heads and tanned their hides like the monsters of the French Revolution .
When skeptics can find a place ten miles square on this globe where society is decent , safe , comfortable and progressive without Christianity , let them then move there and ventilate their infidel views .
But so long as they are dependent upon the religion they condemn for the privileges they enjoy , they may well hesitate before they rob Christians of their hope and humanity of its faith in Christ , Who alone has given the world that hope which makes life tolerable . "

I hesitate to proclaim the death of feminism , since it seems to be alive in the public square .
Men are still being persecuted on trumped up rape charges .
Fathers are still being kept out of their children 's lives .
The abortion lobby is still whining about crisis pregnancy centers .
But judging from my recent debate at the University of Virginia , I 'd have to say there ain't much intellectual life left in the old feminist corpse .
( You can read the text of my prepared remarks here . )
At the debate , sponsored by the Intercollegiate Studies Institute , and the Network of Enlightened Women , I made the argument that the taxpayers of Virginia should not be asked to pay for the support of an ideological department that supports the political interests and activities of left - wing women .
The taxpayers should equally fund a Men's Studies department , or a Life Studies Department , to provide gender and ideological balance to Women 's Studies .
My opponent , Amy Richards , co-founder of the Third Wave Foundation , did not dispute the claim that Women 's Studies departments are ideological .
Instead , she offered two defenses of Women 's Studies .
First , students who do n't agree with the ideology can learn critical thinking by having their preconceived ideas challenged .
Second , students who do agree with the ideology can feel good about themselves .
You do n't need Women 's Studies for the former objective : old - fashioned liberal arts distribution requirements served exactly that purpose .
Students learn logical and critical thinking through philosophy , math and economics classes .
And the second objective is not a legitimate aim of an academic department .
Students should n't be going to classes to feel good about themselves .
The defender of Women 's Studies made a couple of serious admissions .
When a student asked why a particular class at the University of Virginia on gender differences was no longer cross listed in Women 's Studies , the speaker demurred , saying she needed to know all the details .
So I asked her directly : if a proposed class included Harvey Mansfield 's Book , Manliness and Steven Rhoads ' book , Taking Sex Differences Seriously in the curriculum , would you support its inclusion in the Women 's Studies program ?
She said yes .
I imagine this will be news to Professors Mansfield and Rhoads .
She argued that marriage was nothing more than a civil contract .
I think she thought this was a devastating point in favor of an invent - your - own approach to marriage .
So I asked her : should we enforce marriage like a real contract , and abolish no - fault divorce , which imposes no costs on spouses who renege on the most basic marriage responsibility of fidelity ?
She said she favored ending no - fault divorce .
I told her I was glad to hear it .
Despite the lack of intellectual heft displayed at this debate in defense of Women 's Studies , there are over 750 such programs around the country .
Their left - wing graduates join the ranks of opinion - making and policy - making professions , including the media , academia , government , women 's magazines , private foundations , the judiciary , and human resources departments .
Wherever gender issues are discussed and decided , women 's studies graduates play a dominant role , subsidized unwittingly by the tax dollars of janitors and cooks and cabdrivers and garbage collectors .
It is time to end the One Party System of Gender Politics .
It is time that conservative women as well as men of all political persuasions had a seat at that table .
Or , just shut down the Women 's Studies Departments .
Former chief economist for the world bank says “ you have to be in fantasy land to say that everything is fine ”

Wednesday , Sept 17 , 2008
Two time Nobel - prize winner and former chief economist of the World Bank , Joseph Stiglitz has warned that the current financial crisis will continue for at least another eighteen months and in many ways represents a worse situation than the one faced by Americans during the great depression of the 1930s .
“ You can paper things over for a while but eventually you have to face reality . ”
Stiglitz told the nationally syndicated Alex Jones show yesterday .
“ This is clearly the most serious problem since the great depression and in some ways worse in terms of the financial institutions . ”
Stiglitz commented , referring to the fact that lenders are unwilling to take risks to finance each other because they no longer have complete access to their own undertakings let alone those of other institutions .
“ The reason , in part , is that while some of the same problems that occurred during the great depression and have occurred since , such as excessive leverage , pyramid schemes , bubbles , have happened before , the so called innovation of Wall Street , the financial innovations , that were supposed to manage risk , created a kind of non transparency that is now so great that no one knows exactly the magnitude of the risk they face . ”
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
“ It is particularly bad because our financial institutions are based on trust , you put the money in the bank and you trust that you can get your money out , so trust is absolutely essential for the functioning of our financial markets and the functioning of our economy . ” he continued .
“ The problem is that much of the news on what is going on in the financial markets comes from those who are making money out of the financial markets .
So if you were one of the people involved with Lehman Brothers or AIG , you ’re going to be talking up the economy .
The head of Lehman Brothers was quoted last April as saying we have turned the corner , the economy is on the uptick .
And the same thing goes for the president and the secretary of treasury . ”
“ The fact is that they are involved in salesmanship . ”
Describing the current situation as a “ top down crisis ” , Stiglitz also cited the $ 3 trillion cost of the Iraq war as a key factor in the economic downturn , saying it has increased the budget deficit and consumed resources that would otherwise promote growth .
“ This is the first war in American history that has been totally financed on the credit card …
For the last five years as the war has gone on we have been a debt economy .
It is the first war since the revolutionary war that we have had to turn to foreigners to finance , 40 % of our national debt is now being financed by foreigners …
Even as we went into the war we had a big deficit , and yet the president called for tax cuts for upper middle class Americans . ” he said .
“ And there is another level of trust , those in other countries have to have trust that the American economy is working well , they have to trust that when the president says everything is going well , it is .
This administration has really burned that trust , the president said there is no problem , there ’s just a few too many houses been built .
Well if that is the level of analysis the Untied States is giving about the nature of its economic problems , no wonder everybody around the world is losing confidence . “
Stiglitz is no stranger to positioning himself in opposition to the establishment on the economic front .
In October 2001 he caused controversy when he exposed rampant corruption within the IMF and blew the whistle on their nefarious methods of inducing countries to fall under their debt before stripping them of sovereignty and hollowing out their economies .
“ It is clear that the Bush administration is not responding to these problems , partly because the problems are of their own making . ” Stiglitz asserted .
Over the next twelve months , Stiglitz predicts that house prices will continue to fall , more mortgages will go into foreclosure and more financial firms will be put into crisis .
“ I am particularly worried about what I call the ‘ real economy ’ .
Basically when the financial system starts getting weak , it is not in a position to provide credit , to provide loans , to provide mortgages and that means in turn that housing prices are going to fall further , businesses are going to contract , unemployment is going to grow and it is a downward vicious cycle …
I do n’t want to be obsessively pessimistic but you have to be in fantasy land to say that everything is fine , and even to say that we have turned the corner .
We ’re still in the downward phase of this economic cycle .
We should not anticipate emerging from this for a year and a half or longer . ”
In a long term prediction 22 months ago , Stiglitz told listeners of the Alex Jones show that he believed a global economic crash would occur within 2 years .
With major financial institutions now folding every week , others touting mergers just to stay afloat and stocks continually plummeting on a daily basis it seems that prediction is coming to pass .
Stiglitz stressed that in order to emerge from the crisis , the economy needs a stimulus , that really works , consisting of increased aid for local government , stronger unemployment insurance and more investment in infrastructure .
“ I would take advantage of this particular time in order to stimulate our economy in ways that provide the basis of our longer term economic growth .
If our economy is growing then we will be better able to manage some of this financial turmoil . ” he concluded .

Comment on this article
This is probably obvious for the people that uses Repoze or Pylons , or early adopters in the Plone world , but from a Plone or a Zope developer perspective , you could live without it until now .
Now WSGI is everywhere .
I remember when Martijn Faassen brought the idea in 2006 , of hooking Grok and Zope 3 into the WSGI .
Maybe someone else talked about it before but that was the first time I could picture what WSGI could bring .
Now with the work done by people like :
The repoze team , that made it easier to run a Plone - based application in WSGI
The Paste Script / Paste Deploy team , that provided a simple way to describe a WSGI chain
And major WSGI middlewares like :
repoze .
who which allows you to deal with authentication separately
Deliverance , which let you theme any application and let this application focus on delivering a content
Things like Beaker , which let you use memcached for instance , to store session data and cache arbitrary things
From a CTO point of view , a WSGI environment brings me the ability to think about a web application and build it without having to stick into one framework and try to bend all technologies inside it .
For instance :
I can write a Plone application and use Beaker to deal with sessions , without having to wrap Memcached into a custom plone package .
I can ask a graphic designer to work on a CSS and a layout without having to do it into Plone .
It ’s not that Plone design tools are bad , but the learning curve of writing a rule file in Deliverance and apply it to any piece of application makes the designer more productive than becoming a specialist of one skinning tool .
If my customer use moinmoin as a Wiki , I can put it into my Plone site transparently by defining a composite section in my Paste configuraton file .
…
You could do all the mentioned thing without WSGI , just by importing the packages and / or dealing with proxies at Apache level .
But that is not the point .
The point is that WSGI brought the idea of making all web frameworks and libraries interact together to build one web application .
It is not the silver bullet of course , but my gut feeling is that this will create some kind of reunification in Python Web development communities : people are starting to look at a wider range of package , beyond the framework they use everyday .
Most churches participate in some kind of food closet , which is primarily a way to supply emergency food to those who need it .
But , what if everyone needed food ?
What if the global food supply system collapses or goes into deep distress ?
How do churches help then ?
Chatham House , a UK - based thinktank , researches a wide - ranging variety of global issues .
One of the critical issues facing the world community is the food supply .
We are already seeing food delivery disruptions both in the US and in the developing world .
Rising energy costs have added to the cost of food here in the US , and a Chatham House report sees four possible global food supply scenarios :
Just a Blip : what if the present high price of food proves to be a brief spike with a return to cheap food at some point soon ?
Food Inflation : what if food prices remain high for a decade or more ?
Into a New Era : what if today ’s food system has reached its limits and must change ?
Food in Crisis : what if a major world food crisis develops ?
What does this have to do with small churches , you ask .
First , food is pretty important and rising prices and declining availability will impact your members and your community .
Second , food supply issues are complex and involve the convergence of energy , environment , and economics .
Finally , churches can prepare for the worst - case of a global food supply disruption or the best - case temporary spike in prices by …
‘ casa tóló ’ is the creation of portuguese architect álvaro leite siza vieira , son of the 1992 pritzker prize winner álvaro siza vieira .
located on a steep hill in northern portugual , siza was confronted with a difficult building site .
instead of fighting the natural environment , the architect embraced it using the slope as the home ’s main characteristic .
the home begins at the top of the hill and slowly reveals itself as you descend down the outdoor staircase .
the home was designed as a vacation home for the architect ’s cousin , wife and children .
despite the familiar connection the home was built on a tight budget of 150,000 usd .
the various rooms are divided among the levels , each one even has its own patio space .
despite the frontal exposure to the hot sun , the residence is cooled by the earth which surrounds it on three sides .

Dear Cecil : I 've just begun reading your latest book , The Straight Dope Tells All .
On page 2 , while ruminating on the subject of " questions … that give you pause , " you write , " The other day someone writes in and says , ' If making a robot limb is so hard but other types of machines are easy , how come no animal species has ever evolved wheels ? '
Had to think about that for a while . "
You then go on to answer a completely unrelated question .
Could I trouble you to answer the question you were asked ?
Marie Hansen , Saint Augustine , Florida
Cecil replies :
At first I did n’t answer this question because I thought it was too , you know , out there .
Then I thought , 25 years I ’ve been doing this , and I ’m worrying about being out there now ?
For starters let ’s concede the original writer ’s premise .
Robot limbs that faithfully duplicate animal motion are a design nightmare .
Coordinating multiple limbs , maintaining balance — if you think that ’s easy , try it after you ’ve had a few brewskis .
Remember the walking war machines in the Star Wars movies ?
One reason they were so striking is that they had no real - world counterpart .
( That is , we do n’t have real walking machines .
I know some of the Star Wars machines were based on real animals . )
We use wheels for our vehicles because rolling is so simple .
Why does n’t nature ?
You might say : Because it ’s impossible .
How would such a wheel evolve ?
Many intermediate steps would be required , but until the proto - wheel became functional ( semi - techie talk coming up here ) , it would be useless baggage offering no selective advantage .
Just one problem .
Some critters already have evolved wheels , sort of .
Take the mother - of - pearl moth , Pleurotya ruralis .
While in the larval stage , this bug is generally content to amble along in the we ’ll - get - there - when - we - get - there manner of all caterpillars .
However , when sufficiently startled , P. ruralis hoists itself into a wheel shape and rolls out of harm ’s way — up to five full revolutions at 40 times its normal walking speed .
( OK , so I previously denied there were hoop snakes .
Who said anything about hoop caterpillars ? )
You ’re not impressed .
“ Armadillos , tumbleweeds , freaking rocks roll , ” you say .
“ What I want to see is a creature with a wheel and axle . ”
Coming right up .
The bacterium Escherichia coli , among others , moves by spinning whiplike filaments called flagella like tiny propellers .
The typical flagellum is rotated up to several hundred times per second by what is basically an organic electric motor .
We know it spins ( rather than , say , twisting back and forth like a washing machine agitator ) because researchers glued down an E. coli flagellum and the critter ’s body spun around like an eggbeater .
If this thing is n’t a wheel , it ’s pretty darn close .
For an illustration , see here .
( This phenomenon is often used to make an argument about intelligent design to which Cecil does n’t subscribe , but our interest here is in the illustration , not the argument . )
You object : “ Who cares about a germ ?
A more complex creature could n’t evolve the wheel .
Every time the thing turned , the nerves and blood vessels serving it would get hopelessly twisted . ”
Evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould makes essentially this argument in his book Hen ’s Teeth and Horse ’s Toes .
But this may not be an insurmountable obstacle .
A flesh - and - blood wheel might use the umbilical hookup found on some merry - go - rounds .
Tape one end of a piece of ribbon to a tabletop and the other to the bottom of a compact disc .
Turn the CD over so that the ribbon drapes over the side .
Now move the CD so that it “ orbits ” the ribbon clockwise , at the same time rotating the disc clockwise , two rotations per orbit .
( Not the easiest thing to explain without diagrams , but think of it as an IQ test . )
The wheel turns , but the ribbon does n’t twist .
Would it be easy for a living wheel to evolve something along these lines ?
Maybe not , but who ’s to say it ’s impossible ?
“ I give up , ” you say .
“ Why did n’t animals evolve wheels ? ”
Best guess : no interstates .
Wheels are fine if you ’ve got roads but next to useless on rough terrain .
For quick starts , stops , turns , climbing , etc. , legs are hard to beat .
( For more , see McGeer , “ Principles of Walking and Running , ” in Advances in Comparative and Environmental Physiology , volume 11 , 1992 . )
We ’ve got plenty of roads now , though , and natural selection presumably continues apace , for us as well as our forest friends .
Aeons hence , who knows ?
There may be a whole new meaning for the expression , “ Hey , nice wheels . ”

ST . PAUL , Minnesota ( CNN ) --
Police raided a rental hall used by a group organizing protests at the Republican National Convention in St. Paul , Minnesota , on Friday .
Police on Friday raid the hall rented by a group planning to protest the Republican National Convention .
The RNC Welcoming Committee , which describes itself as " anarchist/anti-authoritarian , " accused St. Paul police of trying to disrupt their protest planned for Monday , the day the GOP convention is set to begin .
Although no one was arrested , the group said police temporarily detained and photographed at least 50 people who were inside the building .
St. Paul Police spokesman Tom Walsh said they were executing a search warrant .
" The cause for the search warrant is not public at this time , " Walsh said .
As many as 30 police officers entered with guns drawn , according to witnesses in the building .
Watch members of the group at the scene of the raid »
" The convergence center is simply a gathering place and is not used for illegal actions -- it is a place for workshops and trainings , " a statement from the protest group said .
" Tonight , we were watching films and sharing food .
" We are now accused of a simple fire code violation , " the statement said .
Oddie Miller , a 19 - year - old from Fort Collins , Colorado , said it was " just a space to get food , free Internet , community organization . "
" There were no bombs or anything in there , " Miller said .
All About Republican National Convention
American ingenuity has found one solution to the energy crisis : food you never need to cook .
There 's no need for fuel when everything you eat --- from salad to , well , more salad — is served up at piping room temperature .
I 'm speaking of the raw food diet , for those who find the vegan lifestyle of no animal food products far too opulent .
This is particularly popular in , where else , California , yet it 's making its way across the country .
On one level , the raw diet has much going for it .
Hardly anyone on this diet is overweight .
With mostly fresh vegetables , fruits , nuts , seeds and sprouted beans , the diet is low in fat and high in nutrients .
Some followers believe the raw lifestyle can prevent or cure cancer ; and it has high - profile adherents , such as Apple CEO Steve Jobs , who was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer a few years ago .
One another level , this is just whacked .
Natural : A dangerous word
Like many alternative diets , the raw food diet is grounded on a few solid principles .
Americans eat too much processed food ; and fresh , minimally prepared food is more nutritious .
Blackened food , that delicious charbroiled taste , can cause cancer in the long run .
But on closer examination , the raw diet makes little sense biologically .
A primary claim among raw food advocates is that the raw diet is a natural diet .
After all , no other animal cooks its food , and humans only started cooking after the domestication of fire .
But " natural " is always a dangerous word .
Humans have evolved to eat and survive on a wide range of diets .
The Inuit have survived thousands of years almost entirely on a diet of raw fish and meat .
Some cultures , conveniently in regions of prolonged growing seasons , shun all meat as unnatural .
That said , humans have always eaten some cooked food .
So , too , do many land animals ; and so did our human ancestors .
How ?
Largely in the form of roasted grasshoppers or other small critters caught in forest fires and brushfires .
Fire foraging was quite natural and helped secure our survival .
This is how we developed the taste for cooked food .
Cooking up claims
Another main claim by raw food advocates is that heat ( from cooking ) destroys enzymes in the food .
Enzymes are proteins that serve as catalysts for specific biochemical reactions in the body .
There are indeed many forms of enzymes .
There are plant enzymes , digestive enzymes and metabolic enzymes , for example .
And , yes , heat can destroy enzymes .
But plant enzymes , which raw dieters wish to preserve , are largely mashed up with other proteins and rendered useless by acids in the stomach .
Not cooking them does n't save them from this fate .
Anyway , the plant enzymes were for the plants .
They helped with the plants ' growth , and they are responsible for the wilting and decomposition of plants after they are harvested .
They are not needed for human digestion .
Human digestive enzymes are used for human digestion .
Raw foods certainly are n't safer than cooked food , as some claim .
Most commercial chicken and a good deal of beef and pork , sadly , are loaded with bacteria and parasites .
Cooking kills this , unless the meat is rancid .
Major and surprising sources of food - borne illness , however , are raw sprouts , green onions and lettuce .
These must be washed thoroughly before consumption .
Raw ( unpasteurized ) milk is dangerous and mostly illegal to buy ; trust your source .
Raw ( sprouted ) kidney beans and rhubarb are poisonous .
Despite major flaws in the raw diet philosophy , one needs to question why a so - called natural diet leaves the dieter dependent on pills for B12 ( impossible to get without animal products , such as meat or eggs ) or zinc ( very hard to get on a raw diet ) .
A healthier idea
Amusingly , the raw diet pits one questionable food philosophy against another , the macrobiotic diet .
The macrobiotic diet emphasizes locally grown whole grains , vegetables , seaweeds and soy products .
Cooking , based on seasons , is essential to bring out the energy in the food .
Like the raw food diet , adherents believe a macrobiotic lifestyle can prevent and even cure cancer , and this was promoted in the United States by Aveline Kushi , who died of cancer .
The macrobiotic people got it right , though .
While cooking can destroy vitamin C , it helps with the absorption of carotenoids such as beta - carotene and other nutrients .
This is why the macrobiotic diet and most nutritionists recommend a mix of some raw products with cooked food .
The macrobiotic diet is one of the healthiest around , actually , despite the strange philosophical baggage that accompanies it .
And Americans would be a far healthier lot if we subscribed to it to some degree .
Similarly , we should welcome the take - home message of the raw food diet : Eating fresh vegetables , sprouts , nuts and seeds is good for you .
But lighten up and light up the stove .

Mr Bashir is accused of genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity The Sudanese government has responded angrily after an international prosecutor accused President Omar al - Bashir of genocide in Darfur .
Sudan's UN envoy said the International Criminal Court had no jurisdiction in Sudan and that it would not co-operate .
Vice - President Ali Osman
Taha said the evidence was false and indicated Sudan could try to halt the court 's work .
A pro-government rally is due to take place in Khartoum soon and the UN is to begin removing some staff from Darfur .
The United Nations said the decision to pull back some non-essential staff came after recent violence and as a precaution after the genocide accusation .

Q&A : Darfur conflict Mr Bashir , who says the accusations are lies , is accused of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes in Darfur .
Judges at the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) , an independent body , are yet to decide if there are reasonable grounds to issue an arrest warrant against Mr Bashir .
' No jurisdiction '
The president 's most senior adviser , Dr Ghazi Salaheddin , told the BBC that his country did not recognise the jurisdiction of the court and would rally support among allies in an attempt to block proceedings .
Efforts to indict a sitting head of state would set a dangerous precedent , he said .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Allegations of genocide by the prosecutor were designed to generate hostility between tribal groups in Darfur , Mr Salaheddin said , adding that an international commission recognised by the UN had already dismissed such claims .
Mr Salaheddin denied that the government of Sudan was blackmailing the international community by failing to provide security guarantees for peacekeepers and humanitarian staff .
However , he also said that if the ICC pursued the case it could jeopardise relations between Sudan and the UN .
The UN - which has no influence in the region - runs large - scale humanitarian operations in the region and has thousands of peacekeepers in Darfur as part of a joint mission with the African Union .
African Union dilemma Elsewhere , China said it was concerned about the ICC 's decision to seek the arrest of Omar al - Bashir .
ACCUSATIONS AGAINST BASHIR Genocide : Killing members of the Fur , Masalit and Zaghawa ethnic groups Causing these groups serious bodily or mental harm Inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about these groups ' physical destruction Crimes against humanity : Murder Extermination Forcible transfer Rape Torture War crimes : Attacks on civilians in Darfur Pillaging towns and villages
Bashir move bold but problematic
Noose tightens around Bashir China 's secret war in Sudan A foreign ministry spokesman said China would continue to consult with other members of the UN Security Council about whether to block the ICC but would not speculate on possible results of talks .
The US , which is not part of the ICC , offered some praise on Monday for prosecutor Luis Moreno - Ocampo 's charge .
" In our view , recognition of the humanitarian disaster and the atrocities that have gone on there is a positive thing , " state department spokesman Sean McCormack said .
But the African Union ( AU ) , which has troops on the ground in Darfur , urged caution .
Speaking on behalf of the AU chairman , Tanzanian Foreign Minister Bernard Membe said the ICC should suspend its decision on whether to seek Mr Bashir 's arrest until problems in Darfur were resolved .
The Peace and Security Commissioner for the African Union , Ramtane Lamamra , has flown to Sudan for a meeting with Mr Bashir and other members of the government .
Difficult position
The AU Commission expressed concern that " hard - won gains made in the search for peace and reconciliation in the Sudan " could be jeopardised .
HAVE YOUR SAY
I strongly support the ICC 's move , I do not want to see people dying anymore Job , Sudan Foreign ministers of the 15 countries currently serving on the AU 's Peace and Security Council are expected to meet in Addis Ababa , the Ethiopian capital where the AU is based , some time next week .
The charges against President Bashir put African countries in an acutely difficult position , says the BBC's Liz Blunt in Addis Ababa .
They supply almost all the troops for the joint AU / UN peacekeeping force in Darfur , and are also the countries most likely to be called upon to carry out any arrest warrant .
Sudan 's government is expected to meet friends from the Arab League on Saturday , reports the BBC's Karen Allen in Khartoum , to chart the way forward .
It will also seek to defend itself against what many consider to be an assault not only on the country 's sovereignty , but also an attack on Islam , our correspondent says .
It has already refused to hand over two suspects whom Mr Moreno - Ocampo charged last year , Humanitarian Affairs Minister Ahmad Harun and militia leader Ali Kushayb .
UN relocation
The joint UN - African Union Darfur mission , Unamid , currently plans to relocate approximately 200 people .

On 8 July , seven Unamid peacekeepers of the joint UN - African Union Darfur mission were killed and 22 injured after they were attacked by heavily armed militia in northern Darfur .
As of May this year , Unamid included nearly 9,600 uniformed personnel and about 1,300 civilian staff , both international and local .
Some 300,000 people have died as a result of the conflict in Darfur since 2003 while more than two million people have fled their homes , the UN estimates .

Eight years ago today , George W. Bush uttered the now broken promise that has come to define his failed presidency .
Accepting his party 's nomination , Governor Bush promised to restore " honor and dignity " to the White House .
But as events continue to show , a more accurate - and ironic - mantra for the lawless Bush White House would be " no controlling legal authority . "
At the time it was delivered , Bush 's acceptance speech at the 2000 Republican National Convention in Philadelphia was an arrogant , deceitful broadside against the Clinton / Gore years .
But the very words Bush used to tar Al Gore with the blight of the Lewinsky scandal may now constitute the epitaph for the Bush presidency :
" So when I put my hand on the Bible , I will swear to not only uphold the laws of our land , I will swear to uphold the honor and dignity of the office to which I have been elected , so help me God . "
That hateful address ( video excerpts here ) , of course , was filled with exactly the kind of lies and taunts - the smallness - that came to define George W. Bush .
His false charges about American military readiness ( " Not ready for duty , sir ! " ) , his long since abandoned philosophy when it comes to using American force ( " the cause must be just , the goal must be clear , and the victory must be overwhelming " ) , his smearing of Al Gore that foreshadowed his own legacy ( " he now leads the party of Franklin Delano Roosevelt , but the only thing he has to offer is fear itself " ) and his obscene claim to be a " uniter " ( " I will not attack a part of this country because I want to lead the whole of it " ) , all were in keeping with the dark Bush character .
Bush broke all of these promises .
But his original sin , from which all other of his crimes and errors flow , is his pledge to usher in new period of higher ethical standards as part of a " responsibility era . "
Bush , who previously sneered at Gore 's " no controlling legal authority " defense of his 1990's Buddhist temple fundraising efforts , raised the ethical bar further that October :
" In my administration , we will ask not only what is legal but what is right .
Not just what the lawyers allow , but what the public deserves .
In my administration , we 'll make it clear there is a controlling legal authority of conscience . "
Eights years later and Bush 's 2000 standard of " not only what is legal but what is right " is in tatters .
Just this week , Bush 's own Justice Department issued a report which concluded that Monica Goodling , the former White House liaison for Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , violated federal law and DOJ policy by discriminating against job applicants who were n't faithful Republicans or conservative activists .
And that 's just the beginning .
Plamegate , the Libby pardon , the Abramoff affair , doctoring scientific reports , the end of habeas corpus , detainee torture , the politically - motivated firings of U.S. attorneys , illegal domestic surveillance , the theory of the unitary executive and the unprecedented assertion of executive privilege all show a President committed to doing neither what is legal nor right .
And then , of course , there 's Iraq .
How fitting then that Bush 's would - be Republican successor John McCain , the man who promised to run a " respectful " campaign , chose this week to launch a wave of attack ads and character assassination against his Democratic rival .
Americans can't erase the Bush presidency , but they are n’t condemned to repeat it .
So with the imminent arrival of the GOP and Democratic national conventions , remember that it was eight years ago that Republican George W. Bush promised us he would " uphold the honor and dignity " of his office .
Happy anniversary , America .
Our mouths are awash with bacteria A brand new species of bacteria has been found by scientists among the hundreds which thrive in our mouths .
The bug , named " Prevotella histicola " by its discoverers at King 's College London , is thought to contribute to gum disease and tooth decay .
Every millilitre of saliva is a cocktail of millions of bacteria , half of them unknown .
The finding may help scientists understand the changes in bacterial activity that lead to mouth problems .
The healthy human mouth is home to a tremendous variety of microbes including viruses , fungi , protozoa and bacteria
Professor William Wade
King 's College London Dental Institute Professor William Wade , from the Dental Institute at King 's College London , found three strains of the new organism lurking within the flesh lining the mouth , and the name " histicola " reflects this , meaning " inhabitant of tissues " in Latin .
" The healthy human mouth is home to a tremendous variety of microbes including viruses , fungi , protozoa and bacteria , " he said .
" The bacteria are the most numerous - there are 100 million in every millilitre of saliva and more than 600 different species in the mouth . "
The Prevotella " family " of bacterial species have been linked to various oral diseases , as well as infections in other parts of the body .
Professor
Wade said that he had managed to find the new species in both normal healthy tissue and living inside oral cancer cells .
" It confirms that oral bacteria can invade both tissues and individual cells . "
Tooth decay ( caries ) and gum disease are the most common bacterial diseases in humans , and other research has linked them to changes in the microbial " flora " found in the mouth .
Gut mystery Professor Hugh Pennington , an Emeritus Professor of Microbiology at Aberdeen University , said it was important to carry on investigating the many unrecognised species of bacteria , especially those which might have the capacity to cause disease .
" Many of these bacteria have not been described because they are quite hard to grow in the lab , and when you go further down into the digestive system , it gets even harder to do this .
" These bacteria are thought to have an involvement in dental caries and other mouth problems , so describing them gives you a broader picture of the causation of these . "
He said that the constant evolution of bacteria meant a potentially never - ending supply of new strains and species .
The finding was reported in the International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Biology .

For indispensable reporting on the coronavirus crisis , the election , and more , subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter .
That the Bush presidency has placed an enormous strain on the nation ’s armed forces is hardly news .
( The “ active army is about broken , ” Colin Powell told cbs ‘s Face the Nation as far back as 2006 . )
Less frequently noted are the long - term consequences of Iraq and Afghanistan for the military — consequences that could last , many experts now say , for a generation or more .
Five signs of a military in trouble :
operation overload
“ We ’ve got too much war and too few warriors , ” says Andrew Bacevich , a West Point graduate and Vietnam vet who is now a professor of international relations at Boston University .
“ The contingencies in Iraq and Afghanistan are consuming the Army and Marine Corps . ”
Indeed ,
Army combat units now spend 15 months in theater for every 12 months at home , while the Marines , a far smaller force , deploy at the brisker pace of seven months in , seven months out .
( Soldiers would ideally spend a minimum of two months at home for every one in the field , according to Pentagon planners . )
And the same personnel are deployed over and over again to Iraq and Afghanistan — sometimes against their will , thanks to “ stop loss ” orders that extend their tours .
Or , says T.X. Hammes , a retired Marine colonel and Iraq War veteran , “ A guy can deploy with a brigade , spend 15 months in Iraq , then come home and 6 months later be transferred to another unit that is deploying to Iraq for 12 to 15 months . ”
About 80 percent of National Guard and Reserve troops have been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan at least once ; Lt. General Steven Blum , chief of the National Guard , has said his force is “ in an even more dire situation than the active military . ”
The Army has even sought “ sandbox sailors ” from the Navy , one of whom told a reporter , “ I was trained for 22 years to go to war on a ship .
But they gave me a rifle and a pair of boots and said , ‘ Go to the sand . ' ”
spare a tank , brother ?
The approximately 30,000 combat vehicles and 500 helicopters the Army and Marine Corps have deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan are operating at between three and six times their peacetime tempo , reports the Congressional Budget Office , and the harsh desert heat and blown sand further increase the wear and tear .
Stateside units , meanwhile , are scrambling for vital gear — a particular problem for National Guard and Reserve forces .
Kansas governor Kathleen Sebelius cited shortages of Humvees and trucks as an impediment to the recovery effort after a tornado leveled the town of Greensburg in May 2007 .
“ We ’re missing all kinds of equipment that could help us respond to this kind of emergency . ”
The Congressional Research Service has noted that the shortage also forces soldiers to train with different gear than they use in the field .
“ If somebody says , ‘ Why do n’t you guys drive around on trucks and pretend they ’re tanks ? ’ one could still gain some value from using substitute equipment , ” says Bacevich .
“ But you lose something if you ’re not on the real stuff , doing the real deal . ”
o captain !
To meet current operational demands , the Army intends to expand by 65,000 troops in the next several years — growth that will require commissioning new junior officers , whose retention serves as a barometer of the overall health of the military .
“ We are very concerned about one subset of the population , and that is the young captains , of whom we ’ve asked a great deal , ” General David Petraeus acknowledged to a congressional panel in April .
Among junior officers , the attrition rate stood at just 5.7 percent in 2003 .
By 2005 , it reached a high of 8.5 percent before trailing off slightly , thanks in part to new cash and educational incentives .
Still , Pentagon planners say , the Army has roughly half the number of senior captains it requires , and at current levels of recruitment and retention , expects to be short about 3,000 captains and majors until at least 2013 .
To fill the void , it has accelerated the rate at which lieutenants can make captain , and competition for senior officer posts has slackened .
Today , almost all captains are promoted to major as soon as they become eligible .
As one disgruntled officer told the Washington Monthly , “ If you breathe , you make lieutenant colonel these days . ”
a few mediocre men
As the military has lowered its promotion standards , it has taken a similar approach toward recruiting .
Desperate for manpower , the services have increasingly accepted recruits with criminal records .
Since 2004 , the number of “ moral waivers ” granted to enlistees — excusing a range of criminal misconduct , from breaking and entering to aggravated assault — has more than doubled .
Recruiters are even “ knowingly allowing neo -Nazis and white supremacists to join the armed forces , ” a Pentagon investigator told the Southern Poverty Law Center in 2006 .
The Army has also lowered its academic standards : According to a 2008 study by the National Priorities Project , a nonprofit , nonpartisan research group that tracks federal spending , the percentage of recruits with high school diplomas has fallen for three consecutive years , and the number of recruits scoring in the upper half of the Armed Forces Qualification Test , those described by the Pentagon as “ high quality , ” has dropped nearly 25 percent since 2004 .
head wounds
By last spring , post - traumatic stress disorder had become so prevalent among troops who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan that Defense Secretary Robert Gates said the Pentagon was considering listing it as a “ qualifying wound ” for the Purple Heart .
One in five returning soldiers has reported ptsd symptoms , according to a recent study by the Rand Corporation , but fewer than half of them received treatment .
( See “ Kill and Tell “ ) Long term , caring for Iraq and Afghanistan vets ( including disability payments ) will cost nearly $ 400 billion , Joseph Stiglitz and Linda Bilmes predict in their recent book , The Three Trillion Dollar War .
Suddenly , prayer rooms are “ essential ” at work
After hundreds of years without them , prayer rooms are suddenly regarded as an essential requirement for the workplace .
A guide produced by St Ethelburga ’s Centre for Reconciliation and Peace , in the City of London , says that employers should to take into account the “ needs ” of their religious employees .
It says that that “ the business case for providing prayer rooms and best practice on creating and managing effective space ” makes good business sense by “ helping to attract , motivate and retain staff , and building a reputation for diversity . ”
The guide is sponsored by Barclays and The Mercer ’s Company , and was created in collaboration with the Employers Forum on Belief , Quiet Room Designs and a number of other organisations – many of which have a vested interest .
The guide has the backing — inevitably — of the Department for Communities and Local Government and contains a preface by The Rt Hon Hazel Blears MP who writes : " No matter who we are , I believe we can all benefit from finding a little time to reflect and rise above the daily routine .
I hope this guide will inspire many more businesses , large and small , to help people find their own moments of refuge in a busy day . ”
Terry Sanderson , president of the National Secular Society , said : “ Let ’s cut through the gobbledygook and double talk that surrounds religion in the work place and look at the reality .
‘ Quiet rooms ’ , ' meditation areas ’ and ‘ multi - faith prayer rooms ’ are all euphemisms for Muslim prayer rooms .
There has been no call for such spaces before Muslim activists started the clamour .
Now all religions have to have one .
The staff room or the canteen used to be the place to go and have a coffee and unwind , now we have to have a prayer room . ”
Mr Sanderson said that however inclusive such spaces were intended to be , they were invariably taken over by Muslims who then started excluding other people .
He pointed out the case of the Royal Mail and the hospital in Glasgow where conflict over the use of prayer rooms has led to court cases and extreme unpleasantness .
“ This sudden push for prayer rooms has been created by Islamic activists and taken up opportunistically by Christians .
It wo n’t be long now before prayer rooms are mandatory and employers become further beholden to the never - ending demands of religionists . ”

McCain advisers said they were only somewhat concerned about Ms. Palin ’s debating skills compared with those of Mr. Biden , who has served six terms in the Senate , or about Mr. Biden ’s chances of tripping up Ms. Palin .
Instead , they say , they wanted Ms. Palin to have opportunities to present Mr. McCain ’s positions , rather than spending time talking about her own experience or playing defense .
So the McCain campaign does n't want voters to judge Gov. Palin for herself , even though she'd be one step from the Presidency if McCain is elected .
They do n't want her to talk about her experience only McCain 's positions .
I 've said before I think Palin canceled so many campaign appearances this week to be able to spend more time at debate camp .
It now looks like on debate night , all we 'll learn is how quick a study she is , not what she believes or whether she 's qualified or prepared to lead the nation either as Vice President , or if events so dictate , as President .

The time has come for the Democrats to correct course and stop government funding of ineffective abstinence - only programs .
How can congressional leaders continue to ignore the public health consensus about science - based programs ?
Last Wednesday , Congressman Henry Waxman ( D - CA ) , Chair of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , conducted the first - ever hearing on the effectiveness of abstinence - only - until - marriage programs .
It took 12 years of conservative congressional leadership and $ 1.5 billion before we finally achieved some public accountability for these failed programs .
Congressman Waxman deserves a great deal of credit , and our thanks , for focusing congressional attention on the biggest ideological boondoggle of the last 50 years .
His committee reports have been pivotal in focusing the public 's attention on the problems inherent in these programs .
The spotlight , and pressure , now clearly shifts to the House Democratic leadership to act .
After the overwhelming evidence highlighting the ineffectiveness of abstinence - only programs presented at last week 's hearing , Congress cannot replay last year 's debacle when Chairman David Obey pushed to increase funding for these failed programs by $ 28 million .
The hearing produced a litany of rejection of abstinence - only programs from mainstream , science - based public health organizations .
The American Academy of Pediatrics testified that the abstinence - only approach was not only ineffective , but could cause real harm to young people .
The Institute of Medicine stated that continued support for these programs does not " comport with the evidence " and no reason existed to hamstring federal interventions by placing them in the abstinence - only straight - jacket .
The American Public Health Association also rejected abstinence - only programs and cited the significance of 17 states rejecting abstinence - only dollars in the face of the enormous need for public health resources at the state level .

Supporters of abstinence - only programs tried to muddy the waters by constantly referring to a discredited Heritage Foundation report claiming that abstinence - only programs work and that the federal government spends more money on comprehensive sex education programs than on abstinence - only programs .
They also turned to one of their favorite researchers , Stan Weed , whose study of a Virginia abstinence - only program raised more concerns than it addressed .
Weed 's support staff at the hearing included Valerie Huber , the chief lobbyist for the National Abstinence Education Association , an organization known for its misleading and inaccurate information about sex education .
Fortunately , Dr. John Santelli from Columbia University 's Mailman School of Public Health ( and a former high - ranking CDC official in the field of teen pregnancy prevention ) summed it all up by explaining that abstinence has a legitimate role within comprehensive sex education which also includes birth control and condoms .
However , abstinence - only programs that exclude information about birth control and condoms , have no place at the center of federal sex education policy .
So where do we go from here ?
The time has come for the Democrats to correct course and stop government funding of ineffective abstinence - only programs .
With the teen birth rate on the rise , with one in four teen girls contracting an STD , with 55 young people getting HIV every single day , how can congressional leaders continue to ignore the public health consensus about science - based programs ?
If we listen to the experts from last week , the path for Democratic leaders is clear — it 's time to support what works .
All the data , the studies , and the logic , point to one conclusion — a comprehensive approach to sex education that includes birth control and condoms , as well as abstinence , works .
So , no more excuses .
It 's time to protect the health and lives of America 's youth in the era of AIDS .
The Pandora .
Overview
The Pandora is a unique combination of gaming console and pocket computer .
From classic gaming , listening to music , watching movies , viewing pictures , program development or surfing the web to just reading or writing texts , the Pandora has a lot to offer
The Pandora project has been a group effort from the beginning .
The hardware development team designed Pandora based on specifications requested by its future users .
The main physical features - qwerty keyboard , dual analog nubs , clamshell design , pocketable size - were most prominently voiced by the community .
The physical appearance of Pandora is an utilitarian result of getting all the necessary hardware into a pocket sized device .
Form follows function , and ergonomic is one of the tall orders made .
Before the final design came to be , the testing and funding was also done in a community manner .
There is no other device that has dedicated gaming controls , two analog nubs and a QWERTY keyboard .
It was developed as a gaming device not just to run games made just for it but also to emulate older systems and everyday computing .
The Pandora can do all of this because it is a tiny computer running a custom distribution of Linux based on The Ångström Distribution .
Because it runs Linux|GNU , the Pandora is n't just a console but a complete desktop computer with access to tens of thousands of Linux programs .
Visit the Pandora website for ordering information .
There are three versions , CC , GC and 1GHZ .
Base specs are the same , with the GC having more memory and a newer revision of the PowerVR SGX530 graphics chip .

I do n't think anyone expects Microsoft 's long - promised feedback to be any more detailed than anyone else 's feedback .
Sunava said last November that this feedback would be sent as soon as possible .
As far as I know , nobody else spent six months writing up their feedback . >

This is FUD -- there is nothing difficult to deploy about this , since cross - site XHR has never been available before .
Not only that , but the only headers that are blocked by XHR2 / AC and are not blocked by regular XHR today are the Cookie and Cookie2 headers , and that is actually the subject of outstanding feedback on the same - domain XHR spec rather than anything particularly specific to cross -domain XHR . > and [ it is ] challenging to imagine that there are no other headers in > use by servers anywhere around the world that might not be good to > access .
Actually the great thing about the way the AC spec is designed is that we do n't have to imagine this -- we can guarantee it .
No headers under author control are ever sent to a server until the server opts in to this cross - domain mechanism explicitly .

This is all FUD -- the Flash issue is irrelevant here as we are by design avoding the policy file problem altogether ( so we could n't even have the old Flash 9 vulnerabilities if we tried ) , and the e-mail you cite above is just an e-mail from your team with vague unspecified security concerns , not a citation of vague requirements in the spec .
( For example , Sunava in that e-mail suggests that same - site and cross - site XHR having different behaviour is bad design , despite the fact that the solution you are advocating does n't only have different behaviours but has an entirely different API , and then goes on to incorrect interpret suggestions in the AC spec as being requirements on XHR2 implementations , possibly misunderstanding that XHR2 itself clearly specifies all the requiremenets unambiguously for the cross - domain case and the same - domain case . ) >
Even if current vulnerabilities like exposure to Time of Check , Time of >
Use , DNS Rebinding attacks , and URL path canonicalization issues can be > patched ( rather than ignored )
This is again FUD .
Your team has been vaguely saying that these threats exist in the XHR2 / AC proposal since last year , and yet nobody from Microsoft has ever actually shown a clear vulnerability .
Reciting a litany of threat model terms without showing actual attack scenarios is not any kind of reasonable argument . >
We want to be extremely clear that XDR is most definitely NOT , in our > opinion , a “ slightly different API that solves nearly the same > problem ” – neither is it “ different for no extra benefit . ” [ 3 ] > [ 3 ]
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapi/2008Mar/0205.html
It is clearly not radically different .
It has almost the same method names , for instance .
It is indeed different for no extra benefit .
It is in fact a subset of the behaviour possible with XHR2 .
( It 's also worth reiterating the point made in the e-mail you cite above , namely that XDR has a slew of security problems itself , unlike the XHR2 + AC proposal , despite your implication that XDR is " secure by design " and that XHR2 + AC is " dangerous " . ) >
Nor is it an “ incompatible proposal , ” [ 4 ] since it ’s not intended > to be merged with XHR or Access Control ; it can happily coexist . > [ 4 ]
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapi/2008May/0028.html
It is incompatible because it has slightly different semantics , meaning that an implementation of one would not trivially be portable to an implementation of the other .
It is also incompatible from an author mindshare point of view .
( For other parties who have n't realised what 's going on here : the idea is that by introducing new and subtly different APIs in the Web platform , in the guise of providing " next enabling needs " functionality , authors will find the Web platform to be more confusing and thus less attractive than , say , Silverlight .
It 's an obvious " poison pill " play . ) >

" Eric , who is one of our networking experts , and I have reviewed the draft and we think it looks good " is pretty unambiguous .

I think it is pretty poor form to imply that Microsoft , who have only just returned to the browser space , somehow has experience that outweighs the experience of the three other browser vendors who are involved in the development of this specification , especially since those vendors have been active for far longer , and have a far better track record of security with their browsers .

It 's hard for us to know whether they could or not since you and your team has continually failed to actually precisely specify what the security concerns _are_ , despite promising them for six months ! >

This is further FUD .
As Jonas pointed out in his reply to your e-mail , the attack you describe does n't actually have anything to do with XHR2 [ 9a ] , and as he further describes in a later e-mail , the feature you incorrectly say is vulnerable is in fact a security feature that is protecting against attacks that XDR in fact has no protection against at all [ 9 b ] .
I notice you did n't reply to either of those e-mails . [ 9a ]

Assuming you mean 0150 , not 050 ( which would never have been a valid thread ) , that e-mail has two replies , neither of which got a further reply from Microsoft .
Similarly , the thread I cite above ( [ 9a ] , [ 9 b ] ) was a reply to your e-mail , but there was no further reply from Microsoft .
If any threads are disappearing , I respectfully suggest the blame lies with your team , not anyone else . >

It is such blatent disregard for the Web standards process that really reinforces for us Microsoft 's deep commitment to interoperability .
Such ultimatums are also not a very good way of obtaining cooperation from the wider Web standards community -- if you wonder why you are often faced with hostility and dismissal , I would suggest this attitude is the cause . >
We desire interoperability ; we cannot enable that at the expense of > security .
Given that XDR has had a number of very serious security vulnerabilities described on this mailing list , you may wish to reconsider deploying XDR if security really is a goal .
At least the following security problems have been detailed so far : * XDR allows POSTs of arbitrary content to intranet servers , without server - side opt - in .
* XDR will foster an environment in which sites request user credentials for third - party sites from users ( since it does n't provide a way to do anything else ) , resulting in an environment where users blithely give their passwords to any sites that ask for them , causing phishing and fraud to skyrocket ( we 're already seeing the lack of a credential - capable cross - site API do this , e.g. see linkedin.com ) .
* XDR forces all content sent in POST entity bodies to be labeled as Content - Type : text / plain , regardless of the type , forcing servers to ignore the Content - Type header and apply sniffing heuristics to detect the actual type of the content sent , potentially leading to privilege escalation attacks ( e.g. if the user thinks he 's uploading a PNG but the server sniffs it as an HTML file and sends it back as such ) .

SOCHI , Russia ( Reuters ) - Russia and France put aside disagreements over the August war in Georgia in a move to promote bi-lateral relations , especially in key energy projects .
Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin speaks with his French counterpart Francois Fillon after a signing ceremony in the Russian Black Sea resort town of Sochi September 20 , 2008 .
REUTERS / RIA Novosti/Pool
“ We will conduct with Russia a direct and tight dialogue of true partners , ” French Prime Minister Francois Fillon said , opening a regular meeting of an inter-government commission in the Black Sea resort of Sochi .
The final document of the meeting said the two countries will focus on developing relations in high tech , energy and space sectors , including cooperation in developing the Shtokman gas field and a joint project to launch Soyuz space crafts from a French launching pad .
“ Differences happen , indeed , but they should be resolved through a dialogue , ” he told the gathering of government officials and businessmen co-chaired by powerful Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin .
Fillon flew to Sochi at a time when the European Union is reviewing ties with Russia .
The EU condemned Moscow ’s intervention in Georgia , launched last month to crush Tbilisi ’s attempt to retake two pro-Moscow regions .
EU members are split over how to handle relations with its biggest energy supplier and a major trading partner .
They stopped short of imposing sanctions against Russia , but suspended talks on a new treaty regulating their relations .
“ We wanted this meeting to take place at the original time because it ’s very important to strengthen the partnership between the European Union and Russia , and France and Russia , ” Fillon told Putin at their first meeting late on Friday .
EU DIFFERENCES
Fillon ’s remarks highlighted the differences within the EU -- some members like France , Germany and Italy , urge caution in handling Russia , while others , mainly former Soviet satellites in Eastern Europe , want tougher action .
Analysts say the new rift with the West over Georgia have scared investors , adding to Moscow ’s financial woes in the face of recent global stock market turmoil .
Putin said relations with France were not affected by the Georgian crisis .
“ I believe the events in the Caucasus did not affect our cooperation in any way , ” he said .
Not a single project has been put off or suspended between France and Russia in the wake of the Georgia conflict .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
French President Nicolas Sarkozy , whose country holds the rotating presidency in the European Union , mediated the deal which ended the war in Georgia .
Under it , Russia agreed to withdraw troops from undisputed Georgian territories in October after 200 EU monitors -- more than 40 of them from France -- arrive in the Caucasus country .
Russia , which has recognized the independence of Georgia ’s breakaway provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia , said it will set up military bases there and told the West to negotiate the presence of international monitors with their leaders .
Fillon told Putin at their meeting on Friday that Sarkozy was satisfied the provisions of the agreement were being carried out .
He said this was a clue to restarting the talks on a new EU - Russia deal .
“ The EU position is clear : we hope the talks will resume as soon as provisions of the Medvedev - Sarkozy plan are carried out , ” he said .
“ There are no reasons not to resume talks early next month . ”
De-blocking talks with EU is important in Russia ’s attempts to resist calls by the United States , Georgia ’s main backer , to form a united front with the EU to put joint pressure on Moscow .
I really , really hate doing header text for reviews , and Eternity 's Child is n't making my job any easier .
Where do you start ?
Talking about the game 's complex history over many potential platforms ?
Talk about the game 's creator , Luc Bernard , whose skill at self - promotion has put his work firmly in the public eye for one reason or another ?
How the game fits in amongst indie gaming in general ?
I suppose by writing out which of those things I could use as an intro , I 've essentially used them all .
Thus , I consider my job done as far as writing pre-jump text goes .

Eternity 's Child ( WiiWare , Steam [ reviewed ] )

Before we begin , I need to make one thing absolutely clear : I do not enjoy bashing games .
I 'm not one of those guys who takes great pleasure in coming up with profane puns to mock the title of a game I hate , and I take no glee in ripping something to shreds -- especially if that game is created by a very small team of people , working for little to no cash .
Even with that in mind , however , I have to say this : Eternity 's Child is the worst game I 've played in several years .
Let 's start with the most superficial , and work upward .
The graphics , one might think , look great : Bernard 's drawings feel sort of like Tim Burton mixed with someone who is n't as breathtakingly pretentious or gloomy as Tim Burton , and , in screenshots , the game looks awfully beautiful .
Unfortunately , the graphics only look good in screenshots .
In motion , the game looks as good as , if not worse than , most flash games you might find on Newgrounds .
The character animations are incredibly stiff : the sprites glide across the screen with the absolute minimum amount of personal animation required to show that they are , in fact , walking and not just magically floating from place to place .
Next , story .
There is one , and I 'm sure it 's interesting , but it 's delivered in the most boring way possible : through a several - minute - long , text - only prologue which explains , in detail , the characters , the world , the villains , and the plot .
It 's a clunky , inefficient , and just plain lazy way of delivering story to the player : why not interweave the story with the gameplay in some way -- in any way ?
Unless you feel like memorizing a bunch of proper nouns and abstract plot points the game throws at you in its first five minutes , then the story of Eternity 's Child will be irrelevant at best , and nonexistent at worst .
But let 's forget the story , and talk about gameplay .
Let 's talk about level design , or the complete lack of it on display in Eternity 's Child .
How the player is given essentially no direction as to where to go , but to move randomly eastward , hoping to bump into something of importance while making blind leaps of faith , praying to land on something to show that they 're on the right track .
Let 's talk about how the jump button only responds to your input about a third of the time , leading you to fall to your doom for no good reason .
Or that the player must kill every single flying enemy they see , because even if they manage to temporarily run away from them -- even if they run all the way to the opposite side of the level -- the enemies will eternally chase them , so that five minutes after escaping a horde of Evil Flying Robotic Heart
Things , you rest for just a moment and , from out of nowhere , the Evil Flying Robotic Heart
Things you 'd forgotten about come from offscreen and kill you .
The only way to survive any encounter with the enemies in the game is to shoot every last goddamn one you come across , unless you feel like being ambushed after you 've assumedly gotten out of harm 's way .
Additionally , the jump button only works a third of the time .
And speaking of combat , the shooting mechanics just do n't feel right .
I find it hard to verbalize , but the projectile combat is just poorly paced all around : since your bullets can collide with the bullets of your enemies , and since your enemies fire a lot of bullets , and since the enemies take a lot of damage to kill , and since you can't dodge these bullets since the jumping mechanics are horrendous , your only recourse is to stand more or less still while firing an unending stream of your own bullets at the enemy , waiting patiently as your bullets slowly knock away each one of the enemy 's dozens of bullets until finally reaching the enemy himself and eventually destroying him after a few shots .
You can't really understand just how underwhelming and slow the combat is until you play the game -- something which I would strongly recommend against doing in the first place .
Roughly 66 % of the times you hit the jump button , your character wo n't do anything .
To summarize : the graphics are bad , the story is irrelevant , the level design is horrendous , the shooting is sloppy and the platforming mechanics are even worse .
Yeah , there 's a level editor , but saying the level editor makes the game better is like giving someone a crudely - drawn picture of a penis along with a pencil , and saying the pencil makes the picture itself better because you could hypothetically improve it .
There is nothing good about this game .
Score : 1.0

We 've observed Eternity 's Child for a long time now and had an intimate connection with it .
Now it 's out and I 'm left scratching my head , wondering what went wrong .
If you 've ever had a family member that 's a few years younger than you , someone you 've watched grow up and care about , only to discover that they 've become utterly insufferable as an adult , you 'll understand where I 'm coming from here .
Luc Bernard 's artwork is beautiful .
The backgrounds alone are breathtaking and I could easily lose myself staring at them .
The characters and enemies are equally attractive .
It all goes wrong once they start to move .
Suddenly , they become paper dolls being danced around a kitchen table by an eight year - old .
Watching these gorgeous , detailed characters flop around in the environment with stale , rigid and lifeless animation pained my heart .
We were warned that the game would be hard and it is .
The problem is that it 's difficult for the wrong reasons , most directly in terms of control .
In general , the controls are more loose than a five dollar hooker the morning after shore leave ends .
Your character defaults to their running speed and you have to use a separate key to slow him down .
If you want to walk to maintain control , you have to keep this key held down , which is really inconvenient when you have to keep one hand on the mouse .
Not that it matters much , since you wo n't be able to clear most of the jumps without going at top speed and you 'll probably just wind up struggling in a stop - start motion to make sure that you do n't overshoot instead of bothering with it .
Shooting works better , if that says anything .
The mouse cursor determines the targeting of your fire while the left and right mouse buttons produce rapid - fire and a charge shot , respectively .
The charged shot is interesting because you can catch it with the cursor and then direct it around the screen to kill enemies .
It 's a cool idea that utterly fails in execution due to how precisely the cursor must be placed .
And , since everything in the environment can collide with your ball and set it off course ( and away from your already tenuous grip ) , trying to use this ability is frustrating at the best of times .
Where stages are concerned , I found them to be surprisingly well - designed .
Big and complicated , there are often multiple paths to be taken and you 'll occasionally be forced to do a little problem solving to get past a seemingly impossible distance or grouping of enemies .
Unfortunately , other design choices ruin what is an otherwise decent effort .
As pretty and detailed as the art elements are , they take up a lot of real estate on the screen .
Consequently , it 's impossible to see far enough to determine where many platforms are and you 'll often blindly jump in the hopes that solid ground may appear beneath your feet .
Other technical issues abound .
The game crashes on menu screens from time to time .
It did not support my joystick ( or those of other people I 've spoken to about it ) despite having the option available .
Sometimes it just does n't want to load the first level .
( NOTE : A patch has been released since the time of writing , which may or may not fix these problems . )
When all is said and done , this is a horrible excuse for a commercial release .
Nothing could possibly redeem the full product , but there is one positive that I can lend to this review : the soundtrack is excellent .
It is too good for this .
The best experience you can possibly have with Eternity 's Child is to look at screenshots and listen to the score .
And , at around nine and a half minutes , this activity would be enjoyable for a longer period of time .
Whatever you do , do n't buy this game .
In fact , do n't even say its name , for that might give its already unholy form power .

Ted Stevens indicted
Sen .
Ted Stevens ( R - Alaska ) , a giant of Senate politics and a legend in Alaska , has been indicted on seven criminal charges .
The Department of Justice has announced a 1:20 p.m. ET press conference to discuss the details .
Stevens ’
Washington office is shut down right now and no one is answering phone calls , and a spokesman in Alaska declined to answer questions .
The Associated Press is reporting that the criminal charges are related to false reporting of hundreds of thousands in renovations to his Alaska resort home .
Sen. Daniel Inouye ( D - Hawaii ) , a longtime Stevens friend , said he was n’t surprised by the news because Stevens has been under investigation for so long .
He said , however , that he believes Stevens is innocent .
The indictment comes almost one year to the day after the FBI raided Stevens ’ home in Girdwood , Alaska , searching for evidence related to the home renovations performed by VECO , an Alaska oil company .
The Stevens indictment is undoubtedly the biggest news to hit Alaskan politics in years .
Stevens ’ son
Ben has also been swept up in a corruption scandal .
Other senators also responded with caution .
“ I need to learn more of the facts before I comment , ” said Sen. John W. Warner ( R - Va . ) .
( Original Article )
“ Mapping Iran ’s Online Public ” is a fascinating ( and very readable ) paper from a study by John Kelly and Bruce Etling at Harvard ’s Berkman Center .
From the abstract :
In contrast to the conventional wisdom that Iranian bloggers are mainly young democrats critical of the regime , we found a wide range of opinions representing religious conservative points of view as well as secular and reform - minded ones , and topics ranging from politics and human rights to poetry , religion , and pop culture .
Our research indicates that the Persian blogosphere is indeed a large discussion space of approximately 60,000 routinely updated blogs featuring a rich and varied mix of bloggers .
In addition to identifying four major poles ( Secular / Reformist , Conservative / Religious , Persian Poetry and Literature , and Mixed Networks . )
A number of surprising findings include details like the nature of discourse ( such as the prominence of the poetry and literature category ) or issues of anonymity :
… a minority of bloggers in the secular / reformist pole appear to blog anonymously , even in the more politically - oriented part of it ; instead , it is more common for bloggers in the religious / conservative pole to blog anonymously .
Blocking of blogs by the government is less pervasive than we had assumed .
They also produced images to represent the nature of the networks , seen in the thumbnail at right .
The visualization is created with a force - directed layout that iteratively groups data points closer based on their content .
It ’s useful for this kind of study , where the intent is to represent or identify larger groups .
In this case , the graphic supports what ’s laid out in the text , but to me the most interesting thing about the study is the human - centered tasks of the project , such as the work done by hand in reviewing and categorizing such a large number of sites .
It ’s this background work that sets it apart from many other images like it which tend to rely too heavily on automation .
( The paper is from April 6 , 2008 and I first heard about after being contacted by John in June .
Around 1999 , our group had hosted students that he was teaching in a summer session for a visit to the Media Lab .
And now a few months later , I ’m digging through my writing todo pile . )
" Prairie farmers earned a record $ 7 billion from grain sold through the Canadian Wheat Board in 2007 - 08 — a 57 per cent increase over the previous year , the agency said Thursday in its annual report . [...]
Western Canadian farmers got better prices than many U.S. farmers who sold their grain before prices spiked earlier this year . "
Harper 's Conservatives are completely driven by free market ideology when it comes to the Canadian Wheat Board .
They have lied , rigged elections and fired senior CWB employees in their mission to kill the Board .
However , from time to time , the real situation gets a bit of media attention and the fact that Canadian farmers are better off WITH the Wheat Board becomes evident .
At the Open Source in Mobile ( OSiM ) conference in Berlin , many of the keynote speakers and technical presenters have cited platform fragmentation as the most significant problem faced by Linux adopters in the mobile industry .
OpenMoko CEO
Sean Moss - Pultz , the lone voice of dissent , challenged the conventional wisdom and argued that the diversity of the Linux ecosystem empowers users and is the key to unlocking the true potential of software freedom on mobile devices .
The growing multitude of disparate Linux - based mobile platforms with competing APIs and different userspace infrastructure make the mobile Linux landscape difficult to navigate .
Fragmentation raises portability challenges and prevents developers from using a consistent set of tools across all platforms .
A lot of code has to be rewritten and tailored to individual devices .
Fragmentation and diversity
Although developers and integrators pay a high price for fragmentation , the diversity it implies offers some unique advantages and some compelling opportunities for innovation .
Reinventing parts of the stack and creating forks allows developers to engage in radical experimentation and try new approaches without having to work within existing constraints .
Diversity also brings freedom of choice to end users and allows them to find solutions that are more narrowly tailored to their needs and requirements .
During his presentation , Moss - Pultz looked back at the successes and challenges encountered by the OpenMoko community in the past year and talked about how the project 's adaptability and commitment to freedom have contributed to its current status .
Although the OpenMoko concept was initially met with enormous skepticism , it has achieved success and is now generating profit .
The company 's first handset , the Neo1973 , was manufactured in limited quantity and sold out completely within the first three days after it launched .
Demand for the product was unexpectedly high , and Moss - Pultz humorously remarked that it probably would have sold out faster if the servers had been able to better withstand the massive traffic .
The latest OpenMoko product , which is called the Freerunner , is selling well and has gained a loyal following among hardcore Linux enthusiasts .
Moss -Pultz acknowledges that OpenMoko 's developer - oriented product targets a niche market , but he does n't see that as a problem .
OpenMoko does n't aspire to dominate the market , but instead hopes to leverage its agility and small size to innovate and take mobile phone technology in a new direction .
Moss -Pultz says that OpenMoko strives to be like an independent film rather than a Hollywood blockbuster .
The project 's ability to generate real profits demonstrates that there is a lot of value in making a product that resonates with a small but devoted audience .
Developer - friendly changes
He also talked about some of the changes that they have made in the stack and some of the areas where experimentation has paid off and illuminated new ways to tackle some of the challenges of mobile development .
One example that I found particularly compelling is OpenMoko 's adoption of the Python programming language .
When the OpenMoko developers hit some roadblocks with their GSM daemon which was written in roughly 6,000 lines of C code , they wrote a replacement from scratch with Python , Moss - Pultz told us .
The new Python version , which is only a few hundred lines of code , is more robust and maintainable than the C version .
Although this is an area where most developers would never even consider using Python , it proved to be a truly excellent solution .
OpenMoko's unique approach to mobile development has fostered innovation in other ways , too .
Following the release of the handset CAD files under an open license , third - party developers made some really inventive remixes and explored other designs .
Inspired by the success of the open design initiative , OpenMoko has recently released the complete schematics of its latest product .
Moss -Pultz says that he has observed a noticeable spike in code contributions after the schematics were made available .
When we took an early look at OpenMoko earlier this year , we examined three of the project 's distinctly different software stacks and argued that the project 's success would be predicated on the capacity of the users and developers to turn diversity into an asset instead of an impediment .
Although the OpenMoko handset has not gained mass - market traction or an ideally smooth user experience , it has succeeded in delivering very real value to end users who appreciate flexibility and the ability to study and repurpose components of the platform .
It has also provided a fertile ground for innovation by lowering the barriers for experimenting with mobile development .
The OpenMoko community has enthusiastically embraced this aspect of the project 's identity .
Instead of trying to force participants to converge on a single stack , the developers have continued to broadly enable experimentation and encourage the development of additional parallel stacks .
" The power of open source is the fragmentation , " Moss - Pultz told the audience .
" It 's really where openness comes through the most . "
Some critics have condemned the OpenMoko FreeRunner because it fails to provide the same kind of user experience as the iPhone .
I think that such criticism reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the OpenMoko project and , more generally , a very narrow view of the highly diverse mobile market .
The OpenMoko developers have courageously defined their own parameters for what makes a phone valuable to users .
While most of the industry is deluding itself with the futile and obsessive struggle to create iPhone clones , OpenMoko has found success and delivered real innovation in its little corner of the open - source software community by putting power and control in the hands of end users .
On Saturday afternoon , September 20 , my daughter , who lives in Nashville , called my wife , who was visiting in Atlanta .
She knew that my wife had planned to return to the Memphis area by way of Nashville .
She told my wife to be sure to fill up her gas tank in Atlanta , because there was a major gasoline shortage in Nashville .
My wife went out to fill her gas tank , and she found that she could not find a gas station with gas for sale .
She called me to warn me .
I immediately went to the local gas station .
They had no premium gas , but they did have unleaded regular .
I filled up my tank .
I came home and did a search on the web , and I found a story about the shortage in Nashville .
The story said that a rumor of an imminent shortage had swept Nashville , and people lined up their cars to fill up their tanks .
My daughter said that she had been in a long line herself .
She was able to fill her gas tank , but shortly thereafter , the gasoline station manager placed “ empty ” signs on the pumps .
Here we have a classic example of rationing by lining up .
A week before , there had been a regional gasoline shortage as a result of fears regarding Hurricane Ike and the possibility that gasoline refineries in Texas would be shut down for months .
Some gas stations raised prices , but others refused .
The ones that refused ran out of gas .
People sat in their cars for half an hour or longer in the hope of getting to a pump , and filled up their tanks .
Before the weekend was over , President Bush went on national television and warned against gasoline stations that gouged consumers .
He said that there would be an investigation regarding accusations of gasoline stations that raised prices on Friday .
The message got through this weekend .
Instead of raising prices , in an attempt to reduce demand for gasoline , thereby allocating gasoline that was in short supply by means of price , station managers simply let people fill up their tanks until the pumps were empty .
Anyone who wanted gasoline after that was out of luck .
This is rationing by lining up .
It is the alternative to rationing by price .
Rationing by lining up creates no financial incentive for suppliers of the item in short supply to allocate new supplies to the region of the country which is experiencing a shortage .
Instead , delivery schedules remain the same as they did prior to the shortage .
This continues the shortage .
Whenever there are complaints about price gouging during a period of a shortage , sellers get the message .
The next time there is a shortage , they hesitate to raise prices .
They shift to the other allocation system : first come , first served .
This subsidizes people who have a low value on their time .
People who place a high value on their time prefer to pay extra money in order to attain their goals .
But this is made illegal by the state .
So , the shortage lasts longer than it would otherwise have lasted .
The official goal of the government is to make certain that everyone has access to the item in short supply .
The government says that raising prices during a shortage is unfair .
So , the result is the opposite of what the government ’s official justification was for holding prices down .
There is an even greater shortage , because people buy more of the item than they need immediately .
They have no incentive to reduce their consumption , thereby making available applies to those who were at the end of the line .
There is no incentive for anyone at the front of the line to refrain from filling his gasoline tank .
So , gasoline runs out before the line runs out .
This happens with regularity .
All it takes is a rumor to create massive demand for the item that is believed to be in short supply .
There is no pricing arrangement that alerts people to the crisis .
Instead , long lines appear in the front of gasoline stations .
As soon as the long lines appear , people panic , and line up to get gasoline even though they do not have empty tanks .
This is exactly what I did as soon as I heard about the shortage .
I had half a tank , but I went to my local gasoline station and filled up .
I found that there was no premium gasoline available .
That was not a problem , since I use unleaded regular .
But I did note that there was a shortage of premium , and this encouraged me to fill up my tank .
The public refuses to learn .
The public is incensed against people who raise prices in a crisis , that is , people who respond to increasing demand by large numbers of buyers .
The critics do not like the principle of the auction : high bid wins .
The critics prefer another principle : first come , first served .
The second principle offers no incentives for suppliers to increase production .
Once again , we learn that the free - market principles of open competition and high bid wins cannot be thwarted without negative repercussions .

Beachfront houses may be barred from repair Even unscathed residences could be condemned by state

Hundreds of people whose beachfront homes were wrecked by Hurricane Ike may be barred from rebuilding under a little - noticed Texas law .
And even those whose houses were spared could end up seeing them condemned by the state .
Now here 's the saltwater in the wound :
It could be a year before the state tells these homeowners what they may or may not do .
Worse , if these homeowners do lose their beachfront property , they may get nothing in compensation from the state .
The reason : A 1959 law known as the Texas Open Beaches Act .
Under the law , the strip of beach between the average high - tide line and the average low - tide line is considered public property , and it is illegal to build anything there .
Over the years , the state repeatedly has invoked the law to seize houses in cases where a storm eroded a beach so badly that a home was suddenly sitting on public property .
The aftermath of Ike could see the biggest such use of the law in Texas history .
" I do n't like it one bit , " said Phillip Curtis , 58 , a Dallas contractor who owns two homes - a $ 350,000 vacation home and a $ 200,000 rental - on Galveston Island 's Jamaica Beach .
" I think the state should allow us to try to save the houses .
I do n't appreciate the state telling people , ' Now it belongs to us . '
It breaks your heart . "
The former state senator who wrote the law had little sympathy .
" We 're talking about damn fools that have built houses on the edge of the sea for as long as man could remember and against every advice anyone has given , " A.R. " Babe " Schwartz said .
Ike 's 110 mph winds and 26 - foot waves obliterated the 4 - to 6 - foot dunes and redrew the tide lines along a broad stretch of the Texas Gulf Coast .
Texas General Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson , a Republican whose office is responsible for policing the beaches , said he saw hundreds of houses in jeopardy of being declared on the beach unlawfully as he flew over the coastline this week .
" And those are the ones still standing , " he said .
Other homes , he said , were reduced to pilings sticking up out of the sand or water .
Patterson said no decision on whether homeowners can continue living there would be made for at least a year , while authorities watch the ever - shifting boundaries of the beach .
" You want to have at least a complete all four seasons and find out what Mother Nature is actually going to do until she finishes what she 's going to do , " Patterson said .
That could put homeowners in a bind .
Many may be afraid to spend money on home repairs if there is a chance the state is just going to condemn the property .
Those whose homes were destroyed can collect insurance .
But it is unclear whether those whose undamaged homes are condemned under the Texas law will get any compensation , from the state or anyone else .
Land Office spokesman Jim Suydam said the agency used to offer people up to $ 50,000 to move , but he did n't know if that fund still exists .
Rebuilding the eaten - away beaches does not appear to be an option .
Schwartz said that the Gulf of Mexico does not deposit sand on Galveston Island and other nearby beaches , and that trucking in huge amounts of sand would not work , because storms would just wash it away within a year or two .
The law was enacted when there were far fewer houses on the Texas coast .
In fact , there are lot more houses on the coast now than there were in 1983 , during Hurricane Alicia , the last time the law was invoked against large numbers of homeowners .
Many of the beach homes on Galveston and other nearby beaches are second homes , many of them rather modest .
California and Oregon have similar laws .
State Rep. Craig Eiland , a Galveston Democrat , said he is not aware of any move in the Legislature to change the Open Beaches Act .
By Rep. Ron Paul - August 25 , 2008
As the Olympics wind down , I am amazed at how things change every four years .
Many Americans were glued to their televisions to watch the excitement from Beijing , and also heard announcers wax nostalgic with memories of times when the Soviet Union was the USA 's biggest competitor for Olympic gold .
There was a time when it was unthinkable that a government as powerful as that of the Soviet Union 's could possibly crumble , yet crumble it did .
The irony is that the strength of the Soviet government was also its weakness , as no country , no economic system can remain strong under the crushing burden that is central planning .
Central Planning is sold to a hopeful people as a way to solve societal problems , to right wrongs , and bring about perfect justice and equality .
Central Planning promises you everything you are entitled to .
As a bonus , goods and services produced by others are added to the list of commodities that everyone has a " right " to .
Suddenly everyone is entitled to healthcare , housing , education , food , et cetera .
It might sound nice that the state will magically provide all these wonderful things , but these rosy promises mask a dehumanizing , ugly reality .
The other side of these entitlements is that now the doctor , the builder , the teacher , the farmer are slaves to the all - powerful state .
No longer do they serve patients , students , or customers .
They work in complete obedience to the state , their only customer .
Central planning will tell you that you are entitled to many things .
Liberty tells you that you are entitled to life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness ; to whatever you earn , and nothing that you do n't .
While it may seem harsh to some , we must look to basic economic truths and to history to see which model is cruel and which model is kind .
The truth is that central planning cannot provide for economic success like freedom can .
Central planning makes promises it cannot possibly keep .
We live in a world of unlimited wants and limited resources .
If you put a massive and powerful government in charge of distributing those resources , it is not a surprise that government and those in bed with government are first in line for those resources .
The poor and the middle class - the most hopeful and trusting - are hurt the most , as the state always underestimates their needs and overestimates their ability to pay taxes and absorb inflation .
The Soviet Union 's collapse is a dramatic example of the failure of central planning .
Americans celebrated this collapse , not only because it meant less competition for Olympic gold , but it provided hope that with the end of the Cold War , our policy makers could drastically reduce overseas commitments and out of control military budgets .
Most especially , we celebrated because with the collapse of Soviet communism it was apparent that liberty , not central planning , is stronger .
Freedom empowers the individual .
Central planning dehumanizes the masses .
There may always be a struggle for power and government , but for this reason , freedom will always win out in the end .
And as we celebrate the accomplishments of our individual athletes in Beijing this year , we must continue to go for the gold here at home , and keep the flames of liberty burning bright .

A comparison of various ways you can create your own online flash music video collection playlist to create your customized music television station .
Recently a new video playlist website came online called mixtube.org , after testing the interface and capabilities , I researched other methods of creating my own customized music video playlist using other video aggregation sites .
As a fan of the 80s , and more specifically the New Wave Genre , I decided to create the ultimate collection of all the best music videos from the birth of alternative emo .
Here is a review of the various websites / programs I tested in creating my own personal playlist :
Mixtube.org
This is the first website I tried creating my playlist .
Mixtube uses the now defunct muxtape.com website technology .
Creating the playlist is very manual , as you need to search for the youtube video first through youtube , grab the URL , then paste it in for each video into mixtube .
Mixtube ’s main feature seems to be its open directory of playlists so you can view user created video playlist based on search keywords .
Outside of that , the interface and management of your playlist is very limited .
Pros :
Simple to Use ,
Accessible anywhere online
Able to Share Playlist
Cons :
Cannot Edit your own Playlist after saving
No Inline Search for videos ,
Limited to Youtube
Limited Features ,
When playing videos the small youtube video is placed hidden at the bottom of the screen , almost defeating the purpose of having a video playlist
Unable to export playlist
Unable to randomize Playlist
My Playlist ( about 70 videos ) :
http://mixtube.org/playlist.php?id=695
Youtube Playlist
Intuitively , one would think using Youtube ’s own playlist generator would be best to create your customized music video playlist , but it does have some shortcomings .
One shortcoming is that its limited to its own library , so you cant search Google ’s Video archive .
Additionally , the video playing screen is crowded with tons of peripheral advertisements and related videos , so the interface is a bit crowded when viewing the video .
Pros :
Native Youtube Playlist
Does not ‘ lock out ’ third party embedding of youtube websites
Able to share playlist
Accessible anywhere online
Cons :
Limited to Youtube
Unable to export Playlist
Unable to randomize Playlist
My Youtube Playlist : ( About 140 artists / videos )
http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=B187A3D3969B9951
You can also view the playlist embedded into this post above .
Youplayer
Youplayer is a firefox plugin that allows you to manage your playlist within your browser .
This can be used if you have no interest in sharing your music list or accessing it online .
Youplayer has a embedded search bar which you can type in a keyword and it will display the youtube search results in your browser .
You can add videos into your playlist by dragging the link of the video into the playlist , or you can add the youtube URL and name of the song manually ( tedious ! )
You can either view the playlist inline , or you can export the playlist and play within your Windows Media or Winamp with the appropriate plugins .
Pros :
Private Playlist for your own use
Cons :
Unable to share your playlist online
Limited to the local computer you have the plug in installed
Songza
Songza had the best interface of all the playlist generators .
Very web 2.0ish , the entire interface was flashbased .
The search was very comprehensive and searched for videos and music alike .
Creating the playlist was a snap , and it pulls from google video and youtube .
The play interface is very clean , and lets you cycle and shuffle through all the videos in your browser .
I created my master list of 270 best New Wave vidoes of the 80s through this website .
Pros :
Very cool intuitive flash interface .
Clean uncluttered interface
Accesses both Google Video and Youtube
Cons :
Unable to export the playlist
Gets ‘ stuck ’ if the video is unavailable .
My Master Playlist :
http://www.songza.com/psurf/
RSS Feed :
http://api.songza.com/1.0/feed/psurf.rss
Overall
Overall , I like Songza ’s interface in creating , managing and playing my ultimate music video playlist .
The interface is very clean , uncluttered and fast .
It has the capability to interface with facebook , and even provide an RSS feed .
As for accessing the playlist , there isnt a built in interface , but through html source backdoor scripting , I was able to get all the urls for the videos .
Coming Soon , how I batch downloaded all 270 videos from Songza locally to your computer and converted for desktop access , ipod , and into 3 gp format for my non-iphone .

Carl Hulsey wanted a watchdog .
But why on earth would you get a watchdog when a watchgoat will serve the same purpose , right ?

Uh , no .
It turns out that is a very bad idea .
Specifically the part where Carl tried beating the goat with a stick every day to make him more aggressive .
Again , he should have seen this coming .
He was trying to make the goat aggressive , but who 's he going to get aggressive towards , Carl ?
You .
The asshole with the stick .
On May 16 , 1991 , Carl Hulsey stepped outside with his beatin ' stick for the last time .
" Snowball , " as the goat was known , rushed his tormentor , ramming him in the stomach , twice knocking him down .
Carl fled , but Snowball was n't going to take any of that shit .
The goat chased his former master up the porch stairs , and , with one swift butt , knocked him over the rail towards the ground five feet below .
In the end , Carl died of a ruptured stomach .

" What ?
You t'ink I 'm funny ?
How am I funny ? "
When the news broke that the goat was going to be put down , the arbiters of his fate were flooded with letters , pleas for amnesty , and even threats of death if Snowball did n't walk .
Some people even offered to adopt the deranged beast .
Snowball had become something of a folk hero to animal - rights activists , a symbol for resistance of oppression everywhere .
One piece of advice for his supporters : at his coming home party , do n't bring a pinata .
One just , like , appeared in our parking garage , and we all have Teslas already , so we figured we ’d give it to one of you guys .

McCain ‘ contradicts precisely what he said earlier ’
When the scandal broke over the Bush administration ’s policy of warrantless searches of Americans ’ phone calls and emails , John McCain took a reasonably sensible position , consistent with a classical conservative , interested in limited government .
Just six short months ago , McCain told the Boston Globe that he , unlike the current occupant of the Oval Office , felt compelled to follow the law when protecting U.S. national security .
Asked specifically if the president has the authority to sidestep the law and conduct surveillance on American soil without a warrant , McCain said , “ There are some areas where the statutes do n’t apply , such as in the surveillance of overseas communications .
Where they do apply , however , I think that presidents have the obligation to obey and enforce laws that are passed by Congress and signed into law by the president , no matter what the situation is . ”
The Globe , seeking clarification , asked whether federal statutes trumped a president ’s war - time authority .
“ I do n’t think the president has the right to disobey any law , ” McCain said .
As has become typical with McCain , the Republican presidential candidate no longer believes what he used to believe .
A top adviser to Senator John McCain says Mr. McCain believes that President Bush ’s program of wiretapping without warrants was lawful , a position that appears to bring him into closer alignment with the sweeping theories of executive authority pushed by the Bush administration legal team .
In a letter posted online by National Review this week , the adviser , Douglas Holtz - Eakin , said Mr. McCain believed that the Constitution gave Mr. Bush the power to authorize the National Security Agency to monitor Americans ’ international phone calls and e-mail without warrants , despite a 1978 federal statute that required court oversight of surveillance .
Mr. McCain believes that “ neither the administration nor the telecoms need apologize for actions that most people , except for the A.C.L.U. and trial lawyers , understand were constitutional and appropriate in the wake of the attacks on Sept. 11 , 2001 , ” Mr. Holtz - Eakin wrote .
And if Mr. McCain is elected president , Mr. Holtz - Eakin added , he would do everything he could to prevent terrorist attacks , “ including asking the telecoms for appropriate assistance to collect intelligence against foreign threats to the United States as authorized by Article II of the Constitution . ”
McCain was , in other words , against presidential authority superseding the law before he was for it .
David Golove , a New York University law professor who specializes in executive power issues , said the statement by Holtz - Eakin “ seems to contradict precisely what he said earlier . ”
In addition to the fairly obvious flip - flop ( what else is new ) , there are a couple of interesting angles to consider here .
First , the reference to Article II is pretty transparent — like Bush ’s lawyers , the McCain campaign is arguing that the president ’s inherent authority as Commander in Chief gives him the right to do literally anything in the interests of protecting national security .
FISA gives the president certain powers , but according to this argument , the president need not feel bound to follow the law because he ’s , you know , the president .
Second , there ’s a political context to consider .
Mark Kleiman argued :
McCain ’s new pro-wiretap position was issued in response to a complaint by a right - wing blogger that his prior new position ( not to be confused with his original position ) was n’t bold enough .
“ Is he saying that in a time of national crisis , the president should not be permitted to ask the telecoms for assistance that is arguably beyond what is prescribed in a statute ? ” huffed Andy McCarthy of National Review Online .
( Translation :
You ’re not suggesting that the President has to obey the law , are you ? ” )
And McCain folded like a cheap card table .
Now that the wingnuts know that they can mau-mau McCain every time he deviates toward sanity , they ’re going to keep pulling his chain .
If he keeps responding this way , it ’s going to be hard for even his acolytes in the media to keep calling him either principled or moderate .
Mark ’s more optimistic about the treatment McCain will receive from a sycophantic media , but it ’s a good point nevertheless .
And third , it ’s probably worth taking a moment to consider the fact that this , once again , brings McCain precisely in line with Bush ’s worldview and disdain for the rule of law .
At the exact moment we might expect McCain to distance himself from Bush ’s radicalism , McCain is doing the exact opposite , giving Bush ’s passive contempt for the law a big bear hug .
There were probably some principled conservatives who saw McCain ’s sensible remarks about the rule of law to the Boston Globe six months ago as encouraging .
But he no longer cares about appearing sensible or concerned with legal norms , McCain has right - wing activists to motivate .
What an embarrassment .
Annie Proulx 's novel " The Shipping News " won the Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award , and her stories include " Brokeback Mountain , " the basis for the Academy Award - winning film .
Her latest story collection , " Fine Just the Way It Is , " is her third set in Wyoming .
In nine pieces , she explores the hard lives of aging cowboys , ranch hands and pioneers , and especially the lot of women .
Ms. Proulx , who does n't have a land line at her house in Wyoming , answered questions by email .
...
Who is Randy Scheunemann ?
He is the principal foreign policy adviser to John McCain and potential successor to Henry Kissinger and Zbigniew Brzezinski as national security adviser to the president of the United States .
But Randy Scheunemann has another identity , another role .
He is a dual loyalist , a foreign agent whose assignment is to get America committed to spilling the blood of her sons for client regimes who have made this moral mercenary a rich man .
From January 2007 to March 2008 , the McCain campaign paid Scheunemann $ 70,000  pocket change compared to the $ 290,000 his Orion Strategies banked in those same 15 months from the Georgian regime of Mikheil Saakashvili .
What were Mikheil ’s marching orders to Tbilisi ’s man in Washington ?
Get Georgia a NATO war guarantee .
Get America committed to fight Russia , if necessary , on behalf of Georgia .
Scheunemann came close to succeeding .
Had he done so , U.S. soldiers and Marines from Idaho and West Virginia would be killing Russians in the Caucasus , and dying to protect Scheunemann ’s client , who launched this idiotic war the night of Aug .
7 . That people like Scheunemann hire themselves out to put American lives on the line for their clients is a classic corruption of American democracy .
U.S. backing for his campaign to retrieve his lost provinces is what Saakashvili paid Scheunemann to produce .
But why should Americans fight Russians to force 70,000 South Ossetians back into the custody of a regime they detest ?
Why not let the South Ossetians decide their own future in free elections ?
Not only is the folly of the Bush interventionist policy on display in the Caucasus , so , too , is its manifest incoherence .
Defense Secretary Robert Gates says we have sought for 45 years to stay out of a shooting war with Russia and we are not going to get into one now .
President Bush assured us there will be no U.S. military response to the Russian move into Georgia .
That is a recognition of , and a bowing to , reality  namely , that Russia ’s control of South Ossetia and Abkhazia and occupation of a strip of Georgia cannot be a casus belli for the United States .
We may deplore it , but it cannot justify war with Russia .
If that be true , and it transparently is , what are McCain , Barack Obama , Bush , and German Chancellor Angela Merkel doing committing the United States and Germany to bringing Georgia into NATO ?
For that would commit us to war for a cause we have already conceded , by our paralysis , does not justify a war .
Not only did Scheunemann ’s two - man lobbying firm receive $ 730,000 since 2001 to get Georgia a NATO war guarantee , he was paid by Romania and Latvia to do the same .
And he succeeded .
Latvia , a tiny Baltic republic annexed by Joseph Stalin in June 1940 during his pact with Adolf Hitler , was set free at the end of the Cold War .
Yet hundreds of thousands of Russians had been moved into Latvia by Stalin , and as Riga served as a base of the Baltic Sea fleet , many Russian naval officers retired there .
The children and grandchildren of these Russians are Latvian citizens .
They are a cause of constant tension with ethnic Letts and of strife with Moscow , which has assumed the role of protector of Russians left behind in the “ near abroad ” when the Soviet Union broke apart .
Thanks to the lobbying of Scheunemann and friends , Latvia has been brought into NATO and given a U.S. war guarantee .
If Russia intervenes to halt some nasty ethnic violence in Riga , the United States is committed to come in and drive the Russians out .
This is the situation in which the interventionists have placed our country : committed to go to war for countries and causes that do not justify war , against a Russia that is re-emerging as a great power only to find NATO squatting on her doorstep .
Scheunemann ’s resume as a War Party apparatchik is lengthy .
He signed the PNAC ( Project for the New American Century ) letter to President Clinton urging war on Iraq , four years before 9/11 .
He signed the PNAC ultimatum to Bush , nine days after 9/11 , threatening him with political reprisal if he did not go to war against Iraq .
He was executive director of the “ Committee for the Liberation of Iraq , ” a propaganda front for Ahmad Chalabi and his pack of liars who deceived us into war .
Now Scheunemann is the neocon agent in place in McCain ’s camp .
The neocons got their war with Iraq .
They are pushing for war on Iran .
And they are now baiting the Russian Bear .
Is this what McCain has on offer ?
Endless war ?
Why would McCain seek foreign policy counsel from the same discredited crowd that has all but destroyed the presidency of George Bush ?
” Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence … a free people ought to be constantly awake , ” Washington warned in his Farewell Address .
Our Founding Father was warning against the Randy Scheunemanns among us , agents hired by foreign powers to deceive Americans into fighting their wars .
And none dare call it treason .

Advertisement The Olympic torch has been carried through the Tibetan provincial capital of Lhasa amid heavy security .
The 11 km ( seven mile ) parade passed off smoothly , with the flame carried past apparently hand - picked spectators .
The BBC's James Reynolds says there is a staggering security presence in the city , three months after violent protests broke out .
Ethnic Tibetans clashed with security forces and Han Chinese in March in the biggest protests for two decades .
Foreign journalists have been barred from Lhasa since the unrest .
But reporters representing about 30 international news organisations have been allowed into the city in a closely monitored group to cover the torch relay - widely considered the most sensitive leg of the flame 's journey around the world and through China .
' Vetting '
Torch bearers in white - and - red track suits carried the Olympic flame through Lhasa 's streets , beginning at Norbulingka , the former summer palace of the Dalai Lama , the Tibetan spiritual leader now living in exile in India .
We saw very clearly several dozen soldiers wearing riot gear - a reminder that Lhasa is not a normal city
James Reynolds
Reynolds ' China : Inside Lhasa
In pictures : Lhasa relay
Our correspondent says he passed through at least six checkpoints as he was driven in an official convoy to the start of the relay .
Each member of the crowd has a badge , suggesting that spectators were specially chosen or vetted for the ceremony , he says .
The Lhasa relay is important for Beijing because it wants to show that Tibet is very much a part of China , he adds .
After being taken through the city 's streets , the flame was brought to a closing ceremony where officials were giving speeches at the iconic hilltop Potala Palace , the traditional seat of Tibetan rulers .
On the eve of the parade , small crowds of people were wandering in the square in front of the palace , as performers practised for the ceremonies , our correspondent says .
But he says he also saw four military trucks near the area - two of which were filled with soldiers in riot gear .
Ahead of the event , Palma Trily , vice - governor of the Beijing - backed Tibetan government , said he was confident the relay would pass through the city without incident .
" We have sufficient confidence and capability to turn tomorrow 's Lhasa torch relay into a big success , " the Associated Press quoted him as saying on Friday .
A planned three - day stay in Tibet has been cut to one day because of schedule adjustments linked to last month 's Sichuan earthquake , officials said .
In a separate development , the state - run Xinhua news agency reported on Friday that more than 1,000 people detained after the protests in Tibet had been freed .
It quoted a senior official as saying 116 people remained in custody awaiting trial over the unrest .

What are these ?
You have probably looked around the web and seen images with fantastic clarity and colour fidelity and thought why do n’t my images have the same vibrancy and colour rendition ?
Well chances are you need to follow a couple of basic steps .
I use the word basic because I am deliberately avoiding recommending spending ( too much ) money on costly colour calibration tools .
Anyone can get their colours in the right general area .
1 ) Calibrate your monitor with the tools you probably did n’t know you had installed .
Windows :
If you own Photoshop 3 or later , you will probably do n’t realise that it comes with a little utility called Adobe Gamma .
Find this by doing a quick search and follow the on screen prompts .
This should get your monitor displaying colours in the right ballpark .
Mac Users : Use the System Preferences– > Display — > Colours — > and Calibrate to fine tune Mac Colours .
2 ) Invest in a cheap ebay white balance lens cap .
These are available on ebay for about £ 1 GBP typically from Hong Kong .
Some professionals will pour scorn over the quality of these but again they will get you in the right area colour wise .
They are dead simple to use .
Before shooting a scene , place over your lens , find your cameras white balance settings and choose custom white balance .
Shoot the image with the lens cap on .
( You might need to leave your lens in Manual focus mode to shoot ) .
Once the white balance is captured successfully , you are good to carry on shooting .
3 ) Shoot Raw .
If your camera has a raw / jpg option , choose raw .
Raw is like a digitial negative and allows you to make far more adjustments than a compressed JPG image .
Professional photographers are shooting raw and with the cheap price of memory today ( Raw files are larger ) , coupled with the speed of most modern computers ( for editing raw files ) , you really have no excuse .
4 ) Make final adjustments in Photoshop / Lightroom / Image Editing
Sometimes , the white balance in a scene might need a little adjusting .
Sometimes to true a white balance is not as aesthetically pleasing as you might want .
Use a photo editor to adjust contrast and saturation .
Hopefully , your shots should be free from colour casts !
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Embryonic stem cells can be used to grow vats of red blood cells , which could lead to the creation of “ farms ” that could provide limitless sources of blood , U.S. researchers reported on Tuesday .

The team at Massachusetts - based Advanced Cell Technology hopes the finding might help save the struggling company , which is desperately seeking investors to keep it afloat .
“ I think it ’s really a big break for us , ” said Dr. Robert Lanza , scientific director of the company , one of a few commercial ventures trying to make a business out of the emerging stem cell field .
Stem cells are the body ’s master cells , replenishing various cells and tissues as they die .
Stem cells taken from days - old embryos are especially powerful , with the ability to produce any cell type .
Doctors hope to some day use them to provide tailor - made transplants for patients , and to study disease .
One problem is that the immune system may reject tissues grown from someone else ’s stem cells .
Red blood cells may be an exception to this , because they do not have a nucleus , Lanza and colleagues at the University of Illinois at Chicago and the Mayo Clinic reported .
“ You do n’t have to worry about the DNA going haywire , ” he said .
What Lanza envisions is growing batches of cells from human embryos possessing all the different blood types : A , B , O and AB , as well as negative and positive Rh versions of each .
O negative , considered “ universal ” because it can be transfused safely into anyone possessing any of the other types , would be the most desirable , Lanza said .
“ The ability to , on - demand , make as much as you want is obviously very , very attractive , ” Lanza said .
The researchers first coaxed embryonic stem cells into differentiating into blood precursor cells , and then found a way to get them to go down the road of becoming erythrocytes -- the red blood cells that carry oxygen through the body .
The cells carried oxygen correctly and appeared capable of delivering it to tissue , they reported .
“ We can currently generate up to a 100 billion red blood cells from a single six - well plate of stem cells , ” Lanza said .
The U.S. federal government strictly limits its funding of embryonic stem cell research because of controversies over the use of human embryos .
Lanza said his team was now trying to make blood cells using induced pluripotent stem cells -- a new source of stem cells made using ordinary skin cells and several genes that re-program them back to an embryonic - like state .
But funding for such research is hard to come by , Lanza said .
“ Right now , it ’s tough , ” said Lanza , whose company is down to 12 employees .
“ For a while we had the phones off .
It ’s tough going but the people who are here , we believe in this and we are riding it out . ”
MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Russia on Sunday accused Western countries and media of a biased pro-Georgian position in the conflict in the breakaway Georgian region of South Ossetia and said this might hamper future relations with Moscow .
“ Western countries behaved strangely in the first hours of aggression towards South Ossetia , they were silent , ” Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin told a news conference .
“ This raises very serious questions about sincerity and their attitude towards our country and will of course be taken into account in the future when we hold talks and talk about global issues , ” Karasin said .
Russia sent troops into South Ossetia on Friday , hours after Tbilisi ’s forces tried to regain control of the separatist province following clashes between separatist and Georgian troops .
Georgia accuses Russia of aggression .
Russia accuses Tbilisi of indiscriminate attacks on civilians causing more than 2,000 casualties , and massive destruction .
The United States warned Russia on Sunday that Russian military escalation in the Georgia conflict could have a “ significant , long - term impact ” on relations between Washington and Moscow .
Karasin said the U.S. criticism irked Moscow .
“ Our position is of course negative .
It will of course be expressed when our minister ( Sergei Lavrov ) speaks on the phone with Secretary ( of State Condoleezza ) Rice , ” he said .
Karasin also accused foreign media of an anti-Russian bias .
“ Western media is a well - organized machine , which is showing only those pictures which fit in well with their thoughts .
We find it very difficult to squeeze our opinion in the pages of their newspapers , ” he said .
“ Just as it was 20 - 30 years ago , it remains the same today ... objectivity is not a typical trait of some Western journalists and television channels , ” said Karasin .
He also said Moscow was unhappy about the role of the United Nations Security Council in the South Ossetia crisis .
“ The objectivity of the latest meetings of the Security Council is not at its best .
But the UN is the only organization of universal scale .
Its role is rising , ” he said .
[ FCC Commissioner Robert McDowell at a Tech Policy Summit .

[ digg - reddit - me ] Yesterday marked the opening of the political battle over net neutrality .
To this date , all the talk of “ serieses of tubes ” and the sporadic and localized attempts to create a tiered internet have been mere skirmishes .
But yesterday , Robert McDowell , an FCC Commissioner , attempted to push net neutrality into the political fray during an election season – and unleashed the first coherent attack on net neutrality .
To date , the arguments of opponents of net neutrality have focused on two fronts : pure incoherence ( see Ted Stevens ) and scapegoating “ pirates . ”
McDowell attempted to attack net neutrality ( which has not been an especially polarizing or partisan issue to date ) in a way that was both clever and dishonest – by linking net neutrality to the Fairness Doctrine reviled by conservatives .
( Because I feel there is a lot to explore with this topic , I ’ve divided it up into three section – a synopsis of the situation / timeline ; a more in - depth explanation ; and an explanation of why it is so dishonest to equate the Fairness Doctrine and Net Neutrality . )
The situation :
The Politics :
Obama is in favor of net neutrality .
McCain thinks it ’s all confusing and claims he does n’t know what his position is ( though he has made definitive statements opposing it . )
The Democrats are generally in favor of net neutrality .
It has not been a big issue for Republicans , but a few have come out against it ( see Ted Stevens . )
The conservative base hates the Fairness Doctrine though with a passion .
Since the idea occured to them :
Big internet companies want to charge more for customers to access certain internet sites , or to allow certain sites to have priority and to slow down others .
October 2007 : The Progress and Freedom Foundation , a think tank funded by companies opposed to net neutrality , publishes a report explaining that a good way to attack net neutrality is to call it “ The Fairness Doctrine for the Internet . ”
Spring 2008 : Internet providers begin experiments with tiered pricing and other anti-net - neutrality practices .
June 2008 : A Republican Congressmen introduces a bill to outlaw the Fairness Doctrine ( which has been illegal since the 1980s ) .
Later in June 2008 : A conservative reporter publishes a story which alleges that Nancy Pelosi is considering reinstating the Fairness Doctrine .
August 12 , 2008 : An FCC Commissioner says that net neutrality could lead to the regulation of political speech on the internet , as if it ’s the Fairness Doctrine for the internet .
The Drudge Report publicizes the speech with the scare headline :
Next : Conservative talk radio hosts begin talking about how net neutrality is the Fairness Doctrine for the internet .
Conservative bloggers agree and publicize this as well .
Then :
These conservatives begin to raise the issue in attacks on Obama , liberals , etcetera .
Progressives and liberals defend net neutrality .
And then : Independent - minded people and journalists who have n’t been paying attention to this issue finally notice now that conflicts are arising .
Journalists cover the issue giving “ both sides ” and independents throw up their hands , unable to pick a side .
And : Conservatives mount a campaign attacking Democrats .
Even those conservatives who support net neutrality are silent because they ’re happy for any issue on which they can hit Democrats and which they can use to fundraise .
Finally , January 2009 : After the election , Democrats attempt to pass net neutrality legislation .
A grass - roots structure has been created to oppose them , and many Republicans have publicly committed to oppose it .
An obvious policy choice becomes a struggle to enact .
This is how public opinion is manipulated .
This is how our political system is corrupted as the obvious and clear policy is shrouded in spin and the consensus is replaced by deliberate polarization .
The backstory
The Fairness Doctrine ( which required companies that licensed public airwaves “ to present controversial issues of public importance in a manner deemed by the FCC to be honest , equitable , and balanced ” ) had been considered a key impediment to a conservative agenda after many conservatives came to believe that that the media played a key role in their eventual defeat as they fought against the Civil Rights Movement in the early 1960s and anti-war movement in the late 1960s .
They believed that the media was essentially liberal and that the battling liberal and conservative opinions that were forced onto the airwaves because of the Fairness Doctrine merely ended up legitimizing the inherent liberal bias of the news itself rather than effectively getting across conservative viewpoints .
After legal challenges beginning in the late 1960s , the Fairness Doctrine was finally abolished in 1984 .
This led directly to the right - wing talk radio boom in the late 1980s – from Rush Limbaugh to Bill O’Reilly to Sean Hannity .
This talk radio boom was an essential part of the creation of the right - wing echo chamber and conservative successes that followed , beginning with the 1994 Gingrich revolution .
Without the end of the Fairness Doctrine and the launch of talk radio , even Newt Gingrich acknowledges that the Contract With America would not have been possible .
This history is not well known among liberals – but it is common knowledge among the millions of right - wing radio listeners .
And there are many such radio listeners .
Rush Limbaugh ’s audience alone is estimated to number over 20 million a week ( and his recent contract extension has him making $ 50 million a year until 2016 ) .
After the 2004 election , many Democrats , trying to re-group and understand the Republican dominance of the ideological debate since the 1980s , saw the attacks on the Fairness Doctrine as an essential part of the Republican strategy take control of the political debate .
( Democrats John Kerry , John Edwards , Dick Durbin , and others have all made positive comments about the Fairness Doctrine , although none has declared explicit support for it ’s return . )
This June , John Gizzi of Human Events magazine ( which has been spouting conservative propaganda since 1944 ) reported that Nancy Pelosi was in favor of reinstating the Fairness Doctrine .
This revelation – though not picked up by the mainstream media – echoed through the conservative blogosphere and talk radio energizing a dispirited conservative movement .
Putting aside policy considerations , the Fairness Doctrine is as anathema to conservatives as the tiered internet is to the web - savvy .
They see it as a threat to their power , to free speech , and as an attempt to marginalize them and their politics .
Which is why McDowell ’s comments today are so savvy .
By equating the Fairness Doctrine with net neutrality , he is attempting to polarize the public away from a consensus in favor of net neutrality into two competing camps .
This is not all McDowell ’s genius idea .
The Progress and Freedom Foundation ( PFF ) published a paper in October 2007 laying out this exact argument titled Net Neutrality : A Fairness Doctrine for the Internet ( PDF ) .
The PFF of course is an “ independent - minded ” organization and think tank bankrolled by Comcast , AT&T , Clear Channel , Time Warner , and Microsoft among other enormous companies that stand to profit from opposing both the Fairness Doctrine and net neutrality .
What struck me when reading McDowell ’s description of net neutrality as a kind of Fairness Doctrine for the internet was how off the comparison was – and I knew immediately that it was either the result of idiocy similar to Ted Stevens ’s tubes or a deliberate attempt to mislead the public about net neutrality .
After finding this white paper above and tracing the history of how the Fairness Doctrine suddenly and conveniently became a political issue in this electoral cycle – it seems clear that this is part of a Republican attempt to energize their base in opposition to net neutrality and find an issue on which to attack the Democrats come November and most important , to boost fund raising among those companies that oppose net neutrality in the meantime .
Which is why I say :
The battle over net neutrality has been joined .
The forces that oppose net neutrality are now attempting to break up the bipartisan coalition that has supported efforts to legislate net neutrality .
They are finally advancing serious ( if dishonest ) arguments against it .
With the Democrats likely to expand their majority in Congress and the frontrunner for the presidency a Democrat who has been a vocal advocate of net neutrality , this is the big corporations ’ only chance to push net neutrality through .
If you ’re wondering about McCain ’s position on net neutrality , he ’s not sure .
He told Brian Lehrer of WNYC that he “ goes back and forth on the issue ” – although conservative sites have reported that he flat - out opposes it .
Of course , McCain still does n’t know how to “ get online by [ himself ] . ”
Given John McCain ’s recent history of giving up principled positions in order to win over the right - wing , I think it ’s a safe bet that a President McCain would finally figure out his position on the issue of net neutrality to the detriment of all internet users .
Why Net Neutrality is Very Different from the Fairness Doctrine
While the Fairness Doctrine forced broadcasters using the public airwaves to include dissenting opinions when discussing controversial issues , net neutrality prohibits internet service providers from discriminating based on content .
It ’s comparing bananas to strawberries .
Both involve government regulation .
Both involve content .
Both involve media .
One forces the media to add content they would not otherwise .
The other prohibits those delivering the content to discriminate and favor some content over others .
This inherent openness is widely described as the core strength of the internet .
It allows dissenting voices to be heard .
It allows a more free market to emerge .
It is one of the essential characteristics of the architecture of the internet .
The Fairness Doctrine , despite a vogue among certain Democrats who have flirted coyly with the idea recently , seems outdated in this world with far greater media options .
It was designed for a world in which the national media was dominated by three television stations and dissenting opinions could be quashed merely by ignoring them .
Lawrence Lessig , a great proponent of net neutrality , has said that in today ’s media environment , he believes that the Fairness Doctrine is unconstitutional .
Barack Obama , another liberal and a strong supporter of net neutrality , has also indicated he is opposed to reinstituting the Fairness Doctrine .
Net neutrality and the Fairness Doctrine are entirely seperate and distinct .
The Republican efforts to confuse the public on this issue have begun .
Stay on the lookout – for you can bet this is n’t the end of this campaign .

New Red Dwarf Specials Confirmed
Announced by Dave , detailed here .
New specials ?
Proper information ?
After all the rumours ?
Oh smeg yes .
reddwarf.co.uk has the facts .
As announced by Robert Llewellyn for Grant Naylor Productions this week at the UKTV seasonal press launch , the project is a short series of brand new specials to celebrate the 21st birthday of Red Dwarf .
Doug Naylor will be masterminding the four half - hour instalments , and the regular cast will all be reprising their iconic roles .
They are being made by GNP for UKTV 's free - to - air channel , Dave - our new best friends !
Red Dwarf repeats on Dave - including an anniversary weekend run - have picked up remarkable numbers since the channel was reborn on Freeview , and it 's becoming clear to all concerned that the show is picking a new , third generation audience .
With the usual involvement from Red Dwarf partners BBC Worldwide , you can also expect international broadcasts to follow ( and , we 'd imagine , a top- quality DVD release in the fullness of time ) .
It 's very new news to me - I really only fully heard the details yesterday , Robert told comedian / host Michael McIntyre .
We 're doing four new shows with the original cast .
Two of them are going to be , like , proper episodes of Red Dwarf .
One of them is so exciting I 've been asked not to say anything about that because other people will steal the idea - and it is a great idea , quite challenging for us as performers .
And the other one is a kind of behind - the - scenes - y ... the truth .
There 's been so many rumours and gossip about Red Dwarf , about whether there 's going to be a movie and whether we all get on , all those things ...
The downside for me , which is just dawning on me now , is I 've got to do the ' rubber ' thing again , which I have n't done for ten years .
For the record , and direct from the makers , the details of the four shows right now - while wholly subject to change - are :
Show One - The Making Of The Specials A highly entertaining look at what goes on behind the scenes on a Red Dwarf production .
Show Two - Red Dwarf Special : Part One
The cast get back into character , and costume , a decade on ...
Show Three - Red Dwarf Special : Part Two
The adventure continues ...
Show Four - A Clip Show With a Serious Difference
The cast do it their way .
Red Dwarf as you have never , ever seen it before !
The shows will broadcast sometime in 2009 and , if successful , could pave the way for further Red Dwarf TV projects .
Thanks to movie and broadcaster wrangles , Grant Naylor have n't been in a position to produce new Red Dwarf since Series VIII went out to audiences of over eight million in 1999 .
This exciting development suggests a new and shiny future for everyone 's favourite sci-fi comedy .

Kaspersky Lab , a developer of Internet threat management solutions , has detected two variants of a new worm , Networm .
Win32.Koobface .a. and Networm .
Win32.Koobface.b , attack MySpace and Facebook , which are popular social networking sites .
Kaspersky Internet Security detected these threats proactively and signatures were added to the database on July 31 .
As per Kaspersky ’s report , these new worms transform victim machines into zombie computers to form botnets as part of their malicious payload .
Botnet is a term referring to the collection of software robots , or bots , that run autonomously and automatically .
The lab also warns users that the worms are designed to upload additional malicious modules with other functionality via the Internet .
Net -Worm.Win32.Koobface.a is that worm that spreads when a user accesses his / her MySpace account .
The worm creates a range of commentaries to friends ' accounts .
Net -Worm.Win32.Koobface.b , which targets Facebook users , creates spam messages and sends them to the infected users ' friends via the Facebook site .
The messages and comments include texts such as " Paris Hilton Tosses Dwarf On The Street ; " " Examiners Caught Downloading Grades From The Internet ; " " Hello ; " " You must see it !!!
LOL .
My friend catched you on hidden cam ; " " Is it really celebrity ?
Funny Moments ; " and many others .
Alexander Gostev , senior virus analyst of Kaspersky Lab says , “ Unfortunately , users are very trusting of messages left by ' friends ' on social networking sites .
So the likelihood of a user clicking on a link like this is very high ”
Kaspersky clarified that messages and comments on MySpace and Facebook include links to Youtube .
Also , users who visit the site via Facebook will have the MySpace worm downloaded to their machines , and vice versa .
Gostev mentioned about the increase in cbyer criminals which are exploiting MySpace , Facebook and other similar sites .
Gostev expressed his confidence that this is simply the first step , and that virus writers will continue to target these resources with increased intensity .
Under the amusingly euphemistic headline " Enthusiasm gap plagues GOP convention , " the DC newspaper the Politico reports that Republicans are n't fired up about their nominating extravaganza scheduled for the first week of September in lovely St Paul , Minnesota .
There 's a lot of expositional excuse - making about St Paul 's lack of proximity to the Beltway and its comparatively sedate reputation .
The last GOP convention was held in New York City , which not only provided loads of wholesome entertainment for the " Family Values " crowd , but also had the added benefit of providing the perfect backdrop for the ritualistic exploitation of the 2001 attack on NYC's World Trade Centre , led by 9/11 überghoul Rudy Giuliani .
St Paul 's got none of that sparkle , so goes the argument .
But it is the unidentified press secretary for an unnamed Republican senator who is , from behind her or his cloak of anonymity , willing to be the most honest about the " enthusiasm gap " plaguing the GOP convention : " Nobody likes a funeral . "
Well , nobody who cared about the deceased , anyway .
But I sincerely doubt I 'm the only person wishing that Bush Brand Conservatism were given a proper burial with an actual grave , just so I could piss on it .
What is , in equal parts , stunning and horrifying and impressive about the spectacular death of Bush Brand Conservatism is that it was mortally wounded not because it was a failure , but because it was an unmitigated success .
Bush was the golden boy of modern American conservatives - a rightwing ideologue with no checks or balances , left to pursue every conservative wet dream with abandon .
Upstairs and downstairs at the same time , he appealed equally to white , working class bigots whose jobs were being shipped offshore and to the barrel - chested tycoons of a new Gilded Age who raucously bellowed about the superfluity of a social safety net and roared that the government " never gave me anything ! " while depositing million - dollar profits from their latest no - bid defence contract and buying themselves new yachts with their fat tax returns .
It was this corporate shill with the affected demeanour of a country bumpkin who was able to hold together the unholy alliance between Big Money and Big Religion , standing at the altar and giving the blessing to the crackpot marriage between the business interests who sought to get rich off the stupid snivelling sods who marched in hypocritical lockstep with the warmongers and the corporate mercenaries , as long as they were promised protection from radical feminists and kissing boys .
Bush spoke the language of robber barons and Nascar dads , of war profiteers and preachers .
He told them they were the patriots , the Real Americans - and they gave him their votes , while the media gave him a free pass .
He thumbed his nose at the law .
And the opposition party , such as it was , took impeachment off the table .
He got ( almost ) everything he wanted , everything Conservatism wanted .
As a result , the hideous underbelly of unfettered authoritarian conservatism was exposed as the grotesque mosaic of avarice , antipathy , incompetence and corruption that it is - hostile not only to the laws and liberties and democratic traditions of this nation , but to its very people .
Who finally , at long last , stopped breathing life into Bush Brand Conservatism .
Now , even as McCain 's campaign fights to keep it on life support , his own party is ready to pull the plug .
There can be no regeneration , no rebirth , no re-emergence , no reclamation of the majority until the beast is good and dead .
Time to let it die .
They know it 's over .
St Paul 's as good a place as any for a funeral .
The beginning of the end game …
Daniel Gros , Stefano Micossi
The radical moves in the US have direct implications for European banks and indirect implications for European governments .
This column discusses the likely channels and notes that several European banks are both too big to fail and may be too big to be saved by their national governments alone .
The US financial system is being nationalised .
The piecemeal approach which culminated with the AIG operation was clearly not working .
The US government had taken control of its biggest insurance company just two weeks after it had to save Fannie and Freddie , by far the world ’s largest mortgage underwriters .
All this was not enough to restore orderly market conditions , hence the US political system is working over time to find a general solution whose outline is already apparent .
The US government is going to buy the so - called " toxic " assets still on the banks ' balances and will then recapitalise the banks to the extent that they make losses .
As a result , it will soon own a large share of its own banking system .
If the details are generous enough , this will finally be enough to restore orderly market conditions .
It is not going to be the end of the story , as it is likely that a number of medium - sized regional banks heavily exposed to the real estate market ( through mortgages , not " toxic assets " ) will soon have to be saved as well .
It is fitting that the first institutions to be formally nationalised in this crisis were not banks in the traditional sense , but institutions ( Fannie and Freddie , AIG ) that were supposed to play only a supporting role in the financial system .
The AIG operation : " Haircut " without the hair
Formally , the AIG operation is composed of two separate elements :
The Federal Reserve of New York has been “ authorised to lend ” AIG up to US$ 85 billion , and
The US Treasury is taking control of AIG , of which it will own 80 % , thereby immediately changing its management .
The Federal Reserve is thus providing financing to the US government .
The punitive terms ( 850 bps above LIBOR ) agreed for the loan to AIG are irrelevant as any interest payments would merely go from the left to the right hand pocket of the government .
Fed independence and the recapitalisation by the Treasury
But at the same time the balance sheet of the Federal Reserve has now been loaded with so many assets of dubious value that the Fed itself may soon no longer be solvent ; hence the Fed ’s request for a recapitalisation by the Treasury .
This means that the US Central Bank has lost its independence , since it now survives on a life - line from the US government .
An independent central bank committed only to the goal of price stability used to be considered an essential cornerstone of a modern macroeconomic stability - oriented policy framework .
In the US , this is giving way to a situation in which the central bank has ended up in the pockets of the finance ministry as a consequence of its frantic efforts to re-establish normal operating conditions in financial markets .
In all likelihood , the large increase in US government debt under way will be matched by increased monetary financing of the deficit .
Will Europe be far behind ?
Links between global financial markets
Global contagion works on the way down and up .
The near miss of AIG , followed closely by the mother of all bailouts now planned in the US , provides a vivid illustration of the nature of the links between global financial markets .
One key link has been risk - sharing .
European ( and other ) financial institutions held a large share of the assets based on US residential mortgages and thus shared in the losses that arose when the US housing market turned sour .
This type of risk - sharing is exactly what financial globalisation should be able to provide .
The US banking system would be in an even worse shape had all the losses from US sub prime - based securities been concentrated in the US .
AIG 's impact on European bank ’s regulatory capital
But the AIG case shows the importance of another link across financial markets , namely massive circumvention of regulatory requirements .
The K - 10 annex of AIG ’s last annual report reveals that AIG had written coverage for over US $ 300 billion of credit insurance for European banks .
The comment by AIG itself on these positions is :
“ …. for the purpose of providing them { European Banks} with regulatory capital relief rather than risk mitigation in exchange for a minimum guaranteed fee ” .
Thus , a formal default of AIG would have exposed European banks ’ large gap of regulatory capital , with possibly devastating effects on their ratings and market confidence .
Which explains why AIG ’s problems had sent shock waves through the share prices of European banks .
Thus , the US Treasury has saved , inter alia , the European banking system .
However , as AIG is to be liquidated , European banks will have to quickly shore up their regulatory capital .
The extent of regulatory arbitrage can also be seen in the very large gap between overall leverage ratios and the official , regulatory ratios .
The dozen largest European banks have now on average an overall leverage ratio ( shareholder equity to total assets ) of 35 , compared to less than 20 for the largest US banks .
But at the same time most large European banks also report regulatory leverage ratios of close to 10 .
Part of the difference is explained by the fact that the massive in - house investment banking operations of European banks are not subject to any regulatory capital requirement .
Another part of the explanation must the regulatory arbitrage , for example though the credit insurance offered for example by AIG .
Positive spillovers for Europe ’s banks
Europe ’s banks will benefit greatly from the wholesale effective nationalisation of the US financial system now being planed because the prices of the so - called " toxic " assets will be stabilised .
But it remains unclear how many of them they hold in their balance sheets and how volatile their liability base will prove if confidence does not return quickly .
And the ECB is already overloaded with assets of dubious quality in gigantic amounts .
Too big to fail and too big to save ?
The key problem on this side of the Atlantic is that the largest European banks have become not only too big to fail but also too big to be saved .
For example , the total liabilities of Deutsche Bank ( leverage ratio over 50 ! ) amount to around 2,000 billion euro , ( more than Fannie Mai ) or over 80 % of the GDP of Germany .
This is simply too much for the Bundesbank or even the German state to contemplate , given that the German budget is bound by the rules of the Stability pact and the German government cannot order ( unlike the US Treasury ) its central bank to issue more currency .
The total liabilities of Barclays of around 1,300 billion pounds ( leverage ratio over 60 ! ) surpasses Britain ’s GDP .
Fortis bank , which has been in the news recently , has a leverage ratio of " only " 33 , but its liabilities are several times larger than the GDP of its home country ( Belgium ) .
Are European regulators living on borrowed time ?
With banks that have outgrown national regulators and the financing capacities of national treasuries , European central banks and regulators are living on borrowed time .
They can not simply develop “ road maps ” but must contemplate a worst case scenario .
The ECB must be in charge ; Britain and Switzerland should pray
Given that solutions for the largest institutions can no lounger be found at the national level , it is apparent that the ECB will need to be put in charge .
It is the only institution in the euro area that can issue unlimited amounts of global reserve currencies .
The authorities in the UK and Switzerland –- who cannot rely on the ECB – can only pray that no accident happens to the giants they have in their own garden .

The cover of the scrapped novel , as seen on amazon.co.uk .
Plans to release a novel about Prophet Muhammad 's child bride A'isha have been scrapped by US publishers Random House over fears it could spark violence .
The Jewel of Medina , the debut novel by journalist Sherry Jones , was due to hit shelves on 12 August .
Random
House said it had been advised the book " might be offensive " to some Muslims , and " could incite acts of violence by a small , radical segment . "
" We decided , after much deliberation , to postpone publication , " it added .
The decision was taken " for the safety of the author , employees of Random House , booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in distribution and sale of the novel , " said the company 's deputy publisher Thomas Perry in a statement .
The novel traces the life of A'isha , who is often referred to as Muhammad 's favourite wife , from her engagement at the age of six , until the prophet 's death .
Jones said that she was shocked to learn in May , that publication would be postponed indefinitely .
' Pornography ' Random
House 's decision only came to light this week after The Wall Street Journal published a column by Muslim writer and scholar Asra Nomani , saying she was " saddened " by the turn of events .
Nomani argued that the publisher was afraid reaction to the novel could equal the furore caused by Sir Salman Rushdie 's Satanic Verses .
The series of events that torpedoed this novel are a window into how quickly fear stunts intelligent discourse about the Muslim world
Asra Nomani , writing in the Wall Street Journal Published in 1988 , the book was condemned by the Islamic world because of its perceived blasphemous depiction of the Prophet Muhammad .
Sir Salman was forced to live in hiding for the next decade after Iran 's then - spiritual leader , Ayatollah Khomeini , issued a fatwa ordering his execution .
In her article , Nomani said university professor Denise Spellberg , who had been sent a review copy of Jewel of Medina , had been instrumental in stirring up opposition to the novel .
Professor Spellberg , from the University of Texas in Austin , was quoted saying the book was " ugly " , " stupid " and " soft core pornography " .
Three days later , Professor Spellberg argued in the same newspaper that she could not have " single - handedly stopped the book 's publication " .
But she conceded : " I felt it was my duty to warn the press of the novel 's potential to provoke anger among some Muslims . "
Jones has never visited the Middle East , but spent several years studying Arab history and said the novel was a synthesis of all she had learned .
" They did have a great love story , " Jones said of Muhammad and A'isha .
The author , who has just completed a sequel examining her heroine 's later life , is free to sell her book to other publishers , Random House said .

What are these ?
I 've seen lots of articles on simulated reality recently .
Supposing for a bit that this is a sensible hypothesis to entertain and not just a science fictional conceit , what might be the consequences of supposing that such a ' reality ' is running on a machine with lazy evaluation
If your task were to simulate a universe well enough for its inhabitants to be convinced it was seamless , then there is an obvious optimisation that could be made .
You could simulate just those parts that could be perceived by the inhabitants .
But the catch is that if an inhabitant were to explore a new region , the simulation would be required to fill in that region .
Just creating a blank new area would n't do , it 's current state would need to be consistent with having had a plausible history and so the simulation would be required to fill in not just its current state , but also its past .
This is precisely what is provided by lazy evaluation - demand driven evaluation that takes place only when results are observed .
It seems natural that such a simulation should make use of laziness .
But such optimisation does n't need to be limited to lazily computing ' new regions ' where by ' region ' we mean a spatially localised volume .
We could also imagine implementing level of detail .
If we do n't look closely at an object in our grasp , there 's no need to compute every single detail of it .
We need only provide detail at the resolution at which it can be perceived .
We 'd like this built into every aspect of the simulation so that anything within it is computed only to a desired accuracy .
I 've spoken a few times about such a data structure in posts like this .
This is precisely what the real numbers give us .
Computationally , a real number is an object which when given a degree of accuracy , returns a rational number ( or some other finitely manipulatable structure ) that represents the real to this accuracy .
The wikipedia article suggests that ' the use of continua in physics constitutes a possible argument against the simulation of a physical universe ' .
This is diametrically opposed to what I might argue : in fact the presence of continua suggests the existence of an efficient demand driven simulation with level of detail .
The problem is that the people who have been thinking about these issues have been thinking in terms of traditional imperative style programming where a real number is typically represented to some fixed finite precision .
But in fact there are infinitely many real numbers that can be represented exactly if we think in terms of lazy data structures .
But this is all idle speculation if we do n't make predictions .
So here is one .
In a computer simulated universe , all physics must obviously be computable .
But all computable functions are continuous .
So in a simulated universe we 'd expect the physical laws involving real numbers to make use of them only in a continuous way .
Sound familiar ?
The next section is an aside and I need to give a spoiler alert as I 'll be mentioning some aspects of Greg Egan 's Permutation City
What exactly what is meant by ' demand driven ' above ?
If we have implemented a simulated universe I expect we would be interested in looking in on it from time to time .
So this is what is usually meant by ' demand ' .
Whenever the program performs I / O to show us what is going on , it would trigger the evaluation of the lazy thunks that had been sitting around .
But consider how the universe might appear to its inhabitants .
Whether or not we look in on it us surely irrelevant to the inhabitants , assuming we just look and do n't try to communicate .
But if I / O is n't performed , functional programmers do n't make much of a distinction between an unevaluated thunk and an evaluated one .
They are observationally equivalent .
So do we in fact need to run the simulation for its inhabitants to consider themselves to exist ?
Anyway , I wo n't say anything more about this because Permutation City deals with this issue at length .
I 'm just rephrasing it as a lazy evaluation issue .
My next post will be on life in a monadic universe .
Update : I 'm going to add some detail to the above .
Suppose we represent real numbers as infinite sequences of digits .
Suppose also that we have some module in a simulation that , let 's say , resolves collisions between particles .
You might ask it " what is the velocity , to 20 digits , of particle A after the collision " .
It must then look at all of the relevant inputs , decide how accurately it needs them , and then propagate new requests .
For example it might work like this " if I need the velocity of A to 20 digits I need the mass of particle B to 25 digits and the velocity of particle C to 26 digits ... " and so on .
The idea of demand driven modules that produce outputs to a given accuracy by making requests of their inputs to a given accuracy exactly parallels the subject of analysis in mathematics .
There you ask questions like " if I need to know f( x , y ) with an error of no more than δ , what ε of error can I tolerate in x and y ? " .
Functions that allow this kind of analysis are precisely the continuous ones .
In other words , a simulated universe that is built from continuous functions lends itself to a demand driven implementation .
One might argue that the whole of the fields of analysis ( and topology ) are the study of functions that can be evaluated in this way .
And of course , in our universe , the functions we study in physics are typically the continuous functions .
So contrary to the claim that the existence of continua argues against the idea that the universe is a simulation , I 'd like to point out that they might actually make it more convenient to simulate our universe .
In fact , we use this fact all the time in ordinary everyday physics simulations because we know we only need to work to a certain level of accuracy to get accurate results .
The claim that this universe can be simulated , and the claim that this universe is a simulation , are philosophical claims that I do n't like to waste time on .
But the claim that the existence of continua blocks the notion that the universe is a simulation is a fairly precise statement of logic , mathematics and physics .
I claim it is wrong , and that 's the only claim I 'm making here .
He said : ' There have been four important studies since 2003 showing that if you treat antibiotics in the right women early in pregnancy you can decrease the incidence of premature birth by 40 to 60 per cent . "

The MPAA is petitioning the FCC to lard cable television with " selectable output control , " a DRM system that allows broadcasters to specify which of your TV devices can decode which shows .
With selectable output control , parts of your home theater would go dark as you flipped up and down the dial : this show wo n't play through your Dolby , that one wo n't go to your PVR , this one wo n't go to your DVD recorder , that one wo n't work with your DTV set .
It 's the digital TV equivalent of one of those absurd Bond - villain world - domination schemes — the idea that every device that can plug into a TV ( including PCs , game consoles , etc ) will be designed to shut itself off in the presence of a flag saying , " This device may not receive that program . "
Previously , the FCC told the MPAA that this was a dumb idea and to get lost , but Hollywood is nothing if not persistent ( as is amply demonstrated by the number of Police Academy sequels produced ) .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation has filed some great comments in the docket :
Right now , your consumer electronics are designed by the consumer electronics industry , which reacts to consumer market demand in choosing how to innovate .
That consumer - focused approach makes sense .
But if the MPAA has its way , however , we 'll be well on the way to a world in which every new feature to every home theater product has to be pre-approved by the content industry .

The high - profile arrest of a Pakistani woman suspected of Al Qaeda links casts a spotlight on an issue her nation ’s fledgling civilian government has been slow to confront : years of official secrecy surrounding the fate of hundreds of people rounded up as terrorism suspects .
Some human rights activists believe that Aafia Siddiqui , a Pakistani - born neuroscientist who appeared Tuesday in federal district court in New York , was originally “ disappeared ” by Pakistani authorities five years ago , possibly at U.S. behest .
American officials said this week that Siddiqui had been arrested in Afghanistan last month and flown to the United States on Monday after recuperating from a gunshot wound that authorities said she suffered in a shootout after her capture .
Siddiqui , who trained at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , initially dropped out of sight in 2003 in the Pakistani port city of Karachi , at a time when U.S. authorities wanted to question her about her suspected ties to Al Qaeda .

Human rights activists were divided over whether the Siddiqui case would ratchet up pressure on the 5 - month - old Pakistani government to account for the whereabouts of hundreds of people who have been reported missing by their families .
Many presumed detainees are believed to be languishing incommunicado , denied access to counsel but not charged with any crime .
“ One hopes that this case is going to bring more attention to the issue of the ‘ disappeared , ’ ” said Ali Dayan Hasan , Pakistan researcher for Human Rights Watch .
His organization and other rights groups had raised suspicion that Siddiqui was secretly held at some point by U.S. or Pakistani authorities , or both .
The Pakistani government has never acknowledged detaining Siddiqui and made no statement Tuesday about her arrest .
However , its diplomats in the United States have sought consular access to her while she remains in U.S. custody , Pakistani officials said .
Siddiqui appeared in court Tuesday to face accusations that she tried to kill U.S. soldiers and FBI personnel during an alleged struggle last month .
Her lawyer , Elizabeth Fink , said Siddiqui had n’t received appropriate medical attention since being shot July 18 , a charge denied by the government ’s lawyer .

Fink also said that the account by U.S. authorities that Siddiqui snatched the M - 4 rifle from a U.S. soldier and tried to kill FBI agents and U.S. soldiers was “ patently absurd . ”
A preliminary hearing was set for Aug. 19 .
Pakistan ’s civilian government , which took office in March after dealing a stunning electoral defeat to the party of President Pervez Musharraf , has said it wants to move ahead with resolving missing - persons cases such as Siddiqui’s .
But the governing coalition , beset by infighting , has had a difficult time establishing any significant authority over Pakistan ’s intelligence establishment .
Most of the missing are thought to be held under the auspices of the military or security agencies such as the powerful Inter - Services Intelligence .

Siddiqui ’s lawyer in Pakistan , Iqbal Jaffry , has been trying to force officials to disclose any information they have about the neuroscientist ’s whereabouts over the last five years .
U.S. military officials denied that she was held at Bagram air base in Afghanistan other than the hospital stay there after her arrest and the alleged gun battle .
The Pakistani Supreme Court agreed earlier to hear Jaffry ’s motion , aimed at compelling the Pakistani government to disclose what it knows about Siddiqui ’s status after her disappearance .
A hearing is set for Sept. 2 .
The politically explosive issue of the “ disappeared ” is entangled with what has become a drawn - out dispute over the restoration of judges fired last year by Musharraf , when he was still the country ’s military ruler .
Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry , who was among those dismissed by Musharraf , had been taking measures to help the missing - persons cases move forward .
The governing coalition has been unable to agree on how and when to reinstate the fired judges , and most observers believe the current high court bench , which remains beholden to Musharraf , is unlikely to take strong steps regarding the “ disappeared . ”

The current judges , said Hasan , the researcher , “ are unlikely to engage in judicial activism that would embarrass the army or intelligence . ”

Want to learn more about this story ?
The Washington Post has an update here .
BERWYN HEIGHTS , Md.  A SWAT team raided the home of a Washington , D.C. - area mayor , killing his two black Labrador retrievers and seizing an unopened package of marijuana delivered there .
Prince George 's County Police said Berwyn Heights Mayor Cheye Calvo brought a 32 - pound package of marijuana into his home that had been delivered by officers posing as delivery men .
The Tuesday evening raid was conducted by county police narcotics officers and a sheriff 's office SWAT Team .
The package was addressed to Calvo 's wife , Trinity Tomsic .
His mother - in - law had asked the supposed delivery men to leave the package outside .
Calvo has not been charged , though police said he , his wife and his mother - in - law are " persons of interest " in an ongoing investigation .
" We never opened the box .
We have nothing to do with this box , " Calvo said .
Sheriff 's office spokesman Sgt. Mario Ellis says deputies " apparently felt threatened " when they shot the dogs .
Calvo said officers entered about 7:30 p.m. , first shooting 7 - year - old Payton .
They then pursued 4 - year - old Chase , who ran away and was shot by police from behind , he said .
Calvo said he does n't have any idea how the package ended up at his house .
He called the raid " the most traumatic experience " of his life .
Calvo , who called his town " Mayberry inside the Capital Beltway , " gets a small stipend as mayor and works at the SEED Foundation , a nonprofit that runs public boarding schools for at - risk students .
His wife works as a state finance officer .
" These were two beautiful black Labradors who were well - known in the community .
We walked them twice a day ; little kids knew their names and would come up to them and pet them , " he said .

New Orleans saw scenes of chaos in the days after Katrina
A US judge has thrown out charges of murder or attempted murder against seven New Orleans policemen involved in a shooting after Hurricane Katrina .
The police officers were accused of firing on unarmed people crossing a bridge during the chaos which followed the flooding of the city .
Two men died and four were wounded in the shooting on the Danziger Bridge .
The judge ruled that prosecutors had violated state law by divulging secret grand jury testimony to a witness .
Survivors of the shooting on 4 September 2005 have said that police officers fired at unarmed people crossing the bridge to get food at a grocery store .
Ronald Madison , a 40 - year - old mentally disabled man , and James Brissette , 19 , were shot and killed , and four other people were wounded .

Introduction : The Many Faces of Chaos
The concept of chaos has emerged as a central topic in science in the last few decades .
It has also emerged as popular topic in the lay press .
Some authors have commented on historical roots to the concept which go back for centuries .
The meaning of the word " chaos " has therefore become many faceted and the scientific use of the word has therefore become enmeshed in a rather complex web .
These problems surrounding the word chaos reflect a wider set of problems that science is facing .
These problems all stem , in one way or another , from the fact that science has evolved in a way which cuts itself off in a very complete way from its philosophical foundations .
Most of the new trends in science use this lack of philosophical grounding rather than try to remedy the problem .
This becomes a more far reaching issue when the practice leads to the misinforming of the public .
Language about " revolution " the inadequacies of " reductionism " and related concepts abound in the new writings , especially those writings aimed directly at the layman .
Meanwhile much of science goes about its business unaware and uninterested in these claims at revolution .
This phenomenon raises the obvious question of whether or not the self proclaimed " revolution " is really a revolution or merely a passing fad .
An alternative possibility is that the revolution is merely old wine in new bottles .
There is , therefore , a real need for a close look at the philosophical aspects of the new writings using chaos as their springboard .
The related issue of " complexity " has been reviewed from this perspective recently [ Mikulecky , 1995 ] .
In that case , as well as in this review , the writings of one person are the only solid foundation available to build such a discussion .
In his work , Robert Rosen has faced the philosophical problems squarely and has presented a thorough , systematic way of examining the way we do science .
His conclusions preceded the more recent declarations that reductionism was inadequate .
He built on that thesis and defined " complexity " , " emergence " , and other now popular terms using the same analysis that ultimately leads to a more rigorous definition of the distinction between machines and organisms .
Central to this analysis of science and how it operates is the use of the modeling relation as a tool for seeing the way we use models , analogs , simulations , and metaphors .
The distinction between these different ways of dealing with our understanding of the natural world is an important component to sorting out the different claims being made and trying to get estimates of their validity .
Chaos as a Mathematical Object
In its most abstract and formal manifestation , chaos is a mathematical object which results from the numerical solution of certain non-linear differential equations or , in one case , a difference equation .
In the language to be developed here , this is chaos as an aspect of a particular formal system , namely non-linear dynamics .
This aspect of a well known formal system needs to be evaluated carefully as a component to a model for the natural world .
The popularity of the concept seems to come more from its value as a metaphor .
There seem to be very few cases in which a modeling relation is even attempted , let alone established ( see discussion of the modeling relation below ) .
This is consistent with the increased reliance on computer simulation as a substitute for theoretical models .
The deficiencies inherent in doing things this way are subtle , if only because we have no established criteria for evaluating our practices , especially since our capacity to simulate or otherwise deal with non-linear mathematical systems in a more or less empirical way using computers has been increasing at an extremely rapid rate .
Attempts to give chaos a rigorous , " scientific " definition have been anything but successful and the word seems doomed to become a poorly defined buzz - word in the same sense as the word " complexity " [ Mikulecky , 1996 ] .
The reason for this apparent loss of a term with great significance has some lessons behind it .
Not the least of which is the fact that chaos , as a concept , has been around for centuries and only recently has become a part of the vocabulary of hard science [ Briggs and Peat , 1985 ; Abraham , 1994 ] .
As a mathematical object it is a bit more definable : " ... aperiodic bounded dynamics in a deterministic system with sensitive dependence on initial conditions . "
[ Kaplan and Glass , 1995 ] .
The question for science is how good a model is such an object for natural systems ?
( See the modeling relation below ) .
In the following brief review , it should become clear that the use of chaos , the mathematical object , as anything but a metaphor is fraught with difficulties which stem from the very nature of the formalism and which have no way of being eliminated .
This leads to the ironic result that the very core of much of hard science is the very agent for making a softer , more qualitative approach inescapable !
Thus , the dilemma that led Poincar to come up with his qualitative approach has been resurrected [ Barrrow - Green , 1997 ; Abraham and Marsden , 1978 ] .
Does Chaos Have an Edge ?
To compound the issue , the notion that things happen " at the edge of chaos " has now become a very fashionable concept .
So much so that one of the originators of that piece of terminology , Stuart Kauffmann , [ Kauffmann , 1993,1995 ] has become
" ... a research scientist who is leading the charge to bring complexity theory to a realm of life not usually touched by theoretical biology . "
says Joseph Marshall in a recent issue of Working Woman magazine [ Marshall , 1997 ] .
The edge of chaos notion will require some examination , but before that , it is interesting to note that the issue of chaos is dealt with in about a paragraph in this article :
" What can complexity theory do for business ?...... It is not to be confused with chaos theory , which was last year 's trend .
Chaos theory concentrated on the pieces - the millions of causes and effects that add up to an elaborate Rube Goldberg device ....... " .
The article goes on to explain how " complexity theory " has something important to say about how systems ( businesses are systems for this discussion ) can become " self - organized " .
" ... For him [ Kauffmann ] , the key idea is a kind of neo - darwinism , by which it is not just the individuals in a system who determine their own fitness .
somewhat miraculously , the system itself is trying to help , much as Adam Smith 's " invisible hand " of capitalism helps distribute the greatest amount of happiness to the greatest number of people . "
Later in the article , the " edge of chaos " gets some definition :
" ... The catch phrase that complexity operates at the edge of chaos is a way of referring to the internal tumult that , almost despite itself , coheres into order . "
Finally , after briefly mentioning others who write about " complexity theory " and it's applications in the business world , the following assessment is offered :
" It is perhaps a natural tendency of all scientific theory to be yanked violently out of context in an attempt to find its human relevance .
Thus , Darwinism led to social Darwinism , and Plato gave us the platonic relationship .
Certainly science can provide provocative new ways to look at the world , but it seems useful to distinguish theory from metaphor .
As a rule of thumb , it may be safest to rely most heavily on the ideas that are hardest to understand .
By that standard , kauffmann 's version of complexity wins hands down ; it is a complexity that is truly complex . "
So we have a winner .
Let us examine Kauffmann 's writings before we proceed to examine the edge of chaos notion further , only to return to it later .
The science of butterfly flight
We need to look into Kauffmann 's version of the new science for some definitions and for a perspective about what is actually new and different about his approach .
The idea of what chaos is relative to complexity ( in Kauffman 's terminology , the edge of chaos ) is brought forth in the discussion of dynamical systems and their description in diagrammatic form in pictures called " phase portraits " .
These diagrams are curves in a space whose coordinates are a characteristic set of dynamic variables which are followed over time to define the evolution of the system .
Kauffmann tells us [ Kauffmann 1993 , pp175 ]
" The most natural language for describing the behavior of an integrated system is dynamical systems theory ....
To be concrete suppose there are three chemicals reacting in a vessel .
The rate of formation and disappearance of chemical depends on the concentrations of ( 1 ) those chemicals either forming it or influencing its formation and ( 2 ) those influencing its conversion to other chemicals .
In addition , each of the three chemicals may be added to or removed from the vessel , or their concentrations may be held constant or caused to change in arbitrary ways by outside forces .
The most natural representation of such a system is a three dimensional state space . "
This would be fine if we did not have the accompanying account of the failure of reductionist thinking in these complex systems and the promise that we are being shown something new .
A state space representation is fine for a dynamical system .
The dynamical system is a formal system , it is well defined and certainly is tightly coupled to the idea of states .
However , it is not only not the best model for a complex system , it is very inadequate , and finally contains a strongly contradictory notion .
Here is where Kauffmann stops using models of natural systems and begins to use metaphors instead .
The problem is that he never seems to notice that he is making the change .
He is heading for an account of 30 years worth of computer simulations of things like Boolean networks so it is understandable that he would not want to move too far away from the reductionist mode , especially with respect to computer simulation .
In dynamic system 's theory , the state of the system at any time is then represented by a point in the state space and as the system evolves this point will move tracing out a curve in the three - dimensional space .
Such a curve is called a trajectory of the system and these trajectories are the solution to a set of differential equations called the system 's equations of motion .
This procedure for representing a system is a direct analogy of the way particle motion is handled in Newtonian dynamics .
Kauffman then cites theorems which assure us that trajectories never merge .
They may , however converge on a single curve or even to a single point called an attractor and all the trajectories which converge on a given attractor sculpt out a kind of landscape feature called a basin of attraction .
Most attractors for simple systems are isolated in their basins and the " landscape " is fairly uncomplicated with simple hills ( seperatrices ) dividing the basins of attraction from each other .
Next the landscape can become more complicated involving toruses or other objects .
Finally : " ...
In addition to these classes of attractors , strange , or " chaotic " , attractors exist .... "
These strange attractors have some special properties :
They can be highly structured and consist of many loops all very near each other .
The result is that two trajectories can start out very close to each other and subsequently diverge to very different regions of the phase space .
This is the property known as " sensitivity to initial conditions " .
The second feature is that they are highly structured and fill only a portion of the state space .
They therefore have a low fractal dimension .
This brings about the notion of an intrinsic " order in chaos .
The sensitivity to initial conditions feature leads Kauffmann among many others to make the following comment :
" ... this sensitivity to initial conditions is amusingly called the butterfly effect .
a butterfly in the Amazon might , in principle , ultimately alter the weather in Kansas . "
This little example is so often repeated as an example of what chaos theory teaches that it seems irreverent to point out how ridiculous an idea it is !
Yet it is precisely this kind of statement that exemplifies the problems that these models present to us .
Some of the problems result from the context in which such discussions are held and others from the very origin of the ideas themselves .
Let us look at some of them .
Chaos as a Model : The Modeling Relation .
The butterfly effect example is amusing to Kauffmann , but it would seem for the wrong reason .
The little example assumes that Lorenz 's model of weather patterns which was one of the first demonstrations of " chaos " in a dynamic system somehow can be extended to deal with global weather patterns and their interconnectedness .
Secondly ... if one butterfly can cause all that trouble , what do we do with the fact that there are millions of them ?
Is this a frivolous criticism ?
I think not .
It is at the heart of the issue if we consider non-linear dynamics as a model for real complex systems [ Rosen , 1993 ] .
To see this better we need to examine what we do when we chose a mathematical formalism as a model of some real world phenomenon .
I find Rosen 's modeling relation the best way of illustrating this [ Rosen 1985 ]
The Modeling Relation :
The modeling relation is a formal description of the way we do science .
It is , among other things , a description of the bringing together experiment and theory [ Rosen , 1985 ] .
It consists of two distinct systems , both which become incorporated into our thought process .
The first , on the left in the diagram , is called the natural system .
The second , on the right in our diagram , is called the formal system .
Although there may be other variations , in general , the natural system enters our mind as a set of sensory inputs , a sort of " raw data " which we will call percepts .
This set of percepts constitutes the " alphabet " for an activity of our mind which is very basic and which is the underlying reason for our belief that the world is something other than a set of events which have no relationship to each other .
Thus at an early stage , our influence on the system we are manipulating in our thought process is inevitable !
We automatically form relationships between the percepts and then see these relationships as data as well , something we observed out there .
These relationships between percepts we will call linkages .
It is the creation of such linkages which leads directly to our sense of causality in the universe .
This is symbolized in the diagram by the arrow labeled 1 .
We have created elaborate methods for systematizing our interactions with our surroundings , the most elaborate of which is what has come to be called " the scientific method " .
One purpose of the scientific method is to create well defined sensory methods through measuring instruments which assign quantitative labels to our percepts and their linkages in order to minimize the effect of our status as observer .
Thus we find it effective to create labels for the percepts which we designate as observables .
A side - effect of this strong emphasis on " objectivity " is that things which are not readily quantified are often relegated to a status of not being " worthy " of becoming objects of scientific study .
This results in notions like the distinction between " hard " and " soft " science .
The formal system , on the other hand , is totally our creation , or , to those who believe that formal systems have independent existence and can be " discovered " like natural systems , they can be at least chosen by us to use in a given modeling relation .
The formal system is therefore the means by which we get to play god .
It has a structure so similar to the way we handle percepts that it is very tempting to assume that we construct formal systems in a manner which mimics our handling of natural systems .
The basic " units " of a formal system also consist of objects in parallel with the percepts in the natural system .
We can see them as mathematical objects such as sets , dynamical systems , etc .
Then as with percepts , there are mappings and relations within and between them .
Also , in the manner of the natural system , we then symbolize these objects with the members of and alphabet and construct the relations and mappings as axioms , production rules , and algorithms or programs .
These latter manipulations allow us to mimic the causality we have associated with the orderliness of " natural law " .
We call these manipulations in the formal system implication represented by arrow 3 in the diagram .
The natural and formal systems are more or less self - contained .
They have no necessary relationship to each other or anything else outside themselves .
More pointedly , they have nothing in themselves to tell us how to relate them to each other .
This is why the making of model can never be a totally " scientific " activity .
It will always contain a strong component of " art " .
It is no accident that the computer has allowed a new dimension into epistemology by extending the realm of science beyond laboratory experimentation to a new kind of experimentation on purely formal systems .
The artistic steps in the modeling relation are symbolized by arrow 2 , the act of associating a particular formal system or subsystem with the natural system which we call encoding .
Then we perform an operation within the formal system designed to mimic a causal event in the natural system and must follow up by interpreting the result , the act of decoding symbolized by arrow 4 .
It is not hard to see that the ability to quantify aspect of both systems makes the encoding and decoding steps much easier .
The criteria for a model to result is that the diagram " commutes " in other words the process of encoding , implication , and decoding " matches " the causal event .
Symbolically ,
( 1 ) = ( 2 ) + ( 3 ) + ( 4 ) .
It should be clear that like the " artistic " nature of the encoding and decoding steps , the overall determination of whether or not the diagram commutes is also something not contained within any of the aspects of the model itself .
This too must be supplied from outside the model itself , and can be the subject of considerable controversy .
Analog models and metaphors :
Once the modeling relation is understood it can easily be extended to help us understand much of epistemological activity and used to clear up some difficult problems in methodology .
One illustration is the ability to encode and decode a number of different natural systems into a single formal system .
This makes any of the natural systems a substitute for the formal system in the modeling relation .
Examples of analog models are the entire subject of Network Thermodynamics [ Mikulecky , 1993 ] and also the field of non-linear dynamics itself .
In a very real any dynamic system can be an analog for any other .
If we see correspondence between a formal system and a natural system in such a way that it becomes possible to make predictions about the natural system without encoding it , we have only the top part to the modeling diagram and the relationship is now a metaphor rather than a model .
The most famous and insidious of these is the " machine metaphor " which was spawned by Descartes , when he likened the living system to a machine .
The problem : Chaos as model or metaphor ?
What then is wrong with non-linear dynamics and the resultant strange attractors , etc. as the formal system to use as models for things like weather and dripping faucets and turbulence in streams etc . ?
The problem has many facets .
The first of which is the very technical point that in order for a model to exist there must be and encoding of a natural system into some formalism .
As we have seen , the formalism which may exhibit chaos as one form of implication is non-linear dynamics .
Systems are not encoded into " chaos " and chaos is not , by itself , a formal system .
The formal system called non-linear dynamics may exhibit chaos under the right circumstances , but this result potentially becomes a prediction of behavior in the natural system , not really a model of it .
The next issue is more troublesome from a philosophical point of view .
The encoding and decoding in a dynamic system model is usually accomplished by the writing and solving of differential equations and the comparison of these solutions with experimental data .
The difficulty with chaos as a " prediction " is the very property that made this particular kind of solution so astounding in the first place .
To see this we must also recognize the third problem , namely that the formal system giving rise to a chaos is a set of differential equations representing a system with no environment !
The butterfly story makes this so clear .
The equations ' solution depends on one environmental interaction , the initial conditions .
Then , as is always the case in dynamic systems theory , time runs along smoothly and all the trajectories are known for all time because the system is isolated from the rest of the world and has no further interactions with it !
How is it possible to miss the significance of this feature of the formalism ?
The answer to this question lies in the history and philosophy of science .
This flaw exists throughout the Newtonian Paradigm and has been with us for a long time .
It is the basis for the reductionist method .
It was never seen as a problem because , in response to it as a problem , systems were broken down into simpler systems until the problem was no longer so severe .
When it came time to look at systems more holistically , the problem became manifest as " emergence " and " complexity " .
This aspect of the failure of dynamics to describe faithfully the interactive nature of a complex system is developed carefully by Rosen in the references cited as well as by Kampis [ Kampis , 1991 ] .
The entire environmental influence is lumped into the " sensitivity to initial conditions . "
The meaning of this still is devastating since the decoding of such an implication into the natural system has no obvious way to be carried out any longer !
The situation makes a fit with data impossible .
What remains is to simply move from model to metaphor and talk about the strong similarity .
An example of a real system will make this clearer .
The double scroll attractor
The point that a test of the fit to data is no longer possible with chaotic systems is made in the description of a chaotic system 's strange attractor in electronics , the " double scroll " attractor and related attractors [ Matsumoto , Chua and Komuro , 1985 ] .
Here the strange attractor can either be produced by computer simulation using a circuit simulation program called SPICE [ Mikulecky , 1993 ] or it can actually be realized by a simple electronic circuit involving a linear resistor , two linear capacitors , a linear inductor , and a nonlinear resistor .
Thus , a simple circuit with only one non-linear element is sufficient to produce a very exotic strange attractor .
What is especially interesting about this paper is the appearance of two notes and the language which leads into these notes :
" ... The usage of the word " chaotic attractor " is of course not rigorous in this paper as well as in others , in the sense that its existence has not been proven mathematically .
3
However , we have succeeded in providing a physical proof by designing and building a physical circuit whose equation of motion is modelled 4 by [ a set of three coupled ordinary differential equations , one of which is non-linear due to the non-linear resistor . ]
Here are the two notes :
3 ) " It has been argued by many researchers that " chaotic attractors " observed by digital simulation are of questionable validity because chaotic systems are by nature extremely sensitive to local truncation and round - off errors . "
4 ) " Of course , due to component tolerances , the physical circuit .... is not exactly modeled by [ the set of differential equations ] with the parameters specified .....
However , the fact that this circuit exhibits a chaotic attractor on an oscilloscope shows that [ the set of differential equations ] is indeed a robust model . "
This is not the first nor will it be the last time hard science has to use such caveats .
The philosophical ramifications are rather interesting if they are viewed using the modeling relation .
We have three objects involved here .
We have the physical circuit , which is merely some hardware wired together ( It is important to note that the " non-linear resistor " is realized by a fairly elaborate subcircuit involving an operational amplifier ) .
Then we have the experiment which can be done on the circuit which involves measuring currents and / or voltages as observables in various parts of the circuit , and finally , we have the mathematical model , which is never directly solved by analytical mathematics but which is rather digitally simulated on a special simulation program .
The first disclaimer the authors make is that the existence of the chaotic attractor has not been proved mathematically .
The fact that an actual circuit can be put together which gives measured values of the simulated parameters which strongly resemble the simulated behavior is found to be highly suggestive of a " physical proof " of the fact that the " equations of motion " of the system do generate the attractor .
This is an interesting dilemma .
Normally , we would check out a mathematical model by trying to adjust simulation parameters and initial conditions to produce as near a super position between the measured values of the system 's observables and the computed values from the equations or a simulation .
In this case we are faced with an impossibility .
The paper is mainly devoted to a detailed analysis of the attractor and it is clear at a glance that this is indeed a complicated geometric entity .
It is described as follows :
" ... Microscopically speaking , the two thin " rings " of the double - scroll attractor are made of infinitely many layers of points compressed into a thin sheet ( think of infinitely many sheets of " lead " being hammered into one conglomerate sheet ) .
Macroscopically , a good way of describing the " anatomy " of the above attractor would be a " double - scroll " structure since the two sheet - like objects are curled up together into spiral forms with infinitely many rotations - while maintaining some space between the two scrolls which gradually decreases , thus causing them to meet eventually at some limit point . "
Harking back to the " butterfly effect " and the synonymous sensitivity to initial conditions mentioned above as one of the two defining characteristics of strange attractors , in this case the words " infinite " as applied to the number of layers of points which are " squeezed into a relatively small structure as well as the existence of " infinitely " many rotations of curling up gives the picture of the dilemma quite well .
Given some data to " fit " to this model how could one ever be sure one had enough data to pick the correct curve among so many so close together ?
And since a wrong choice could easily send the system off on a divergent path on the model relative to the one the measurement should have been assigned to , the situation is definitely hopeless .
But we have been here before in the course of scientific history and we managed to find a way out .
In fact , the way out was furnished by Poincaré when he discovered chaos many years ago .
It is the so - called " neo-qualitative approach " [ Abraham and Marsden , 1978 ] .
This approach is characterized by the adoption of a global geometric point of view .
An advantage of the model so obtained is that the full generality of the theory becomes apparent when " unnecessary " coordinates are suppressed .
A second advantage is the replacement of analytical methods by differential - topological ones in the study of the phase portrait .
A third aspect of this approach is the emergence of a new question - the question of structural stability , the question addressed directly by Rene Thom 's " catastrophe theory " .
Notice that in every aspect of the approach , the detailed relation of parts to whole is being sacrificed to enable something to be salvaged .
In a very real way , the reductionist world - view is hoist in it 's own petard .
Start with deterministic equations , make a model which is so unrealistic as to assume that the world exists in parcels which can be dynamically described by isolating them totally from any environment , and then you are hit with strange attractors , butterfly effects , and are forced to forsake the analytical approach and look at the system more holistically anyway !
What is more the irony of all this seems to be totally missed within the context of the discussions that go on in hard science .
Back to the edge of chaos ?
Let us summarize what we have said up to this point .
Chaos itself is not a formal system which can be used to model natural systems .
It is , at best , a possible metaphor for some of their aspects .
Now where does that leave the notion of another important region at the edge of chaos where everything happens ?
The idea that new laws of the universe can be found based on these ideas needs to be examined very carefully .
The origin of the idea comes from studies of cellular automata by Wolfram and their further interpretation by Kauffmann and others .
The crux of these studies involves a massive amount of computer simulation , usually in the form of cellular automata , but also in Boolean networks and other systems .
The issue of simulation
Simulation is a relation between formal systems .
It might be viewed as the modeling relation with the natural system being replaced by a formal system .
This then requires that the causal events on the left now be reinterpreted as implications in the same manner as those on the right .
Then the goal becomes one of simulating the implication on the left with that on the right .
This can easily be done by numerical methods in the case of dynamic systems , for example .
It is less obvious , but also true , that the use of cellular automata , Boolean networks , Network Thermodynamic simulations using SPICE , and any other computer generated representation of some system of interest is merely the realization of one formal system by another .
This alone never constitutes a model in the sense of the modeling relation .
Furthermore , since the result of a simulation is usually compared with data , there is no decoding into the formalism on the left from the simulation , but this is circumvented and a direct comparison is made with the natural system .
The idea is that if the simulation compares favorably with the data from the natural system , the formalism being simulated is then a good model for the natural system .
The simulator is therefore is common to both the natural system and the formal system being used as a candidate for its model .
Hence , to the extent that the computer simulations now being used to study " complexity " are to be seen as actual models of natural systems and not merely metaphors , they must be carefully translated back into the formal system they represent and that formal system must be shown to encode from and decode into the natural system in question .
To the extent that formal system is dynamics , the simulation has nothing in itself to say about a system 's complexity .
Dynamics is not by itself a way of modeling complexity .
Complex systems are systems which transcend dynamics and require more for their modeling .
Furthermore , much being done in computer simulation is at best the making of metaphors .
In these cases , their value in modeling the natural world is extremely limited .
As long as these minimal requirements for correspondence between the natural world and formal systems are ignored , the confusion will continue to increase .
The apparent advances due to computer simulation will then be seen to be stumbling blocks rather than advances .
It is time for a theory of models to be taken seriously [ Casti , 1994 ] for until then the major source of chaos may indeed be science itself !
Hard and Soft Science and theSokal Affair
At the risk of alienating both sides in this debate , it might be constructive to suggest that everyone read the " Praeludium " to Rosen 's book Life Itself .
As in any controversy of this magnitude , no one has a corner on truth and there is some difficulty with the positions taken by all the participants .
( For anyone who has not yet heard of the Sokal Affair , it is a recent episode in the hard science vs soft science dialectic revolving an article by Physicist Alan Sokal in the Journal Social Text .
The article was revealed by Sokal to be a hoax at the very time it was published .
It is possible to see this affair as being related in some very telling ways to the issues raised in this review .
My comments about the article in Working Woman can easily be interpreted as critical of it's author 's view of the role of chaos and certain versions of " complexity research " .
This is particularly true of the account of Kauffmann 's version of complexity theory being the most acceptable to that author merely on the grounds of its own complexity .
One might see that sentiment paraphrased as saying that we should give more credence to Kauffmann 's version of complexity theory because it is more like hard science .
The hard scientists accuse the soft scientists of being sloppy , anti-intellectual , and other characteristics which all seem to boil down to the notion that methods and practices of hard science , though imperfect , are the best means we have at getting at the truth , all others being clearly inferior if they have any merit at all .
The soft scientists in their criticism of hard science point to the obvious arrogance of that stance and the obvious consequences of blinding one 's self to alternatives in the name of " objectivity " .
Rosen sees this issue as one of " ... simplicity vs complexity . "
He claims that " ... There is , as yet , no comprehensive investigation of the ideas I have sketched .... they are too new .
But it seems that such ideas , or ideas like them , are necessary in many ways . "
Just what are these ideas ?
They revolve around an entire new notion of complexity .
It is unfortunate that this is the very word that is used so much in the new science of chaos and its broader home as defined by Kauffmann and others .
What is the difference ?
It is not in the sentiments expressed by either subgroup among the complexity theorists .
Both groups are clear in their acknowledgement that complexity involves a holistic approach and can't be approximated by traditional reductionist methods .
The differences are more subtle .
Most discussions among readers of rosen's work miss these differences unless they are carried on for some time and are allowed to dig very deep .
Robert Rosen does not skirt the issue of epistemology in his work he confronts it straight on .
For that reason , he moves into areas that hard science has forsaken for a very long time .
The result of his efforts seems to clearly take us where we need to go ( I am tempted to say " want to go " , but after being dragged there kicking and screaming even though I was sympathetic , I know better ) .
And here is the point .
This is what the Sokal affair as well as the new revolution in complexity research have in common .
The systematic division between hard and soft science and between science and philosophy has caused what appears to be a severe form of blindness and lack of understanding among those of us who willingly took the path away from a more global , interdisciplinary notion of what it means to know something .
We are , without struggle and hard work , unable to hear or see any merit in these epistemological tangles .
We are caught up in the very kind of self - referential knot that Rosen and others have warned us about .
We wo n't look into epistemology because our epistemology has no place in it for looking into epistemology !
Rosen allows into his analysis of the issue of what complexity is necessary epistemolgical considerations which in turn direct his scientific pursuit which in turn raises new epistemological questions .
One choice is to ignore such tangled thought processes and accept what the broader community offers as a science of chaos and complexity .
Notice how easily what I am saying here could be confused with the way the evaluation of complexity approaches was carried out in Working Woman .
The difference should be clear , however .
I am recommending Rosen 's approach because I am convinced of its correctness and in spite of its difficulty , not because of it .
In summary , it would seem that the normal outcome of this long standing dialectic ought to be a form of synthesis .
It is hardly likely that one side or the other will win .
It seems like the efforts of Robert Rosen are the first steps along such a synthetic route .
It might be very productive to go further .

SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
More than three - quarters of of oil production in the Gulf of Mexico has been shut - in due to Gustav , the U.S. Minerals Management Service said in its latest update .
Approximately 76.77 % of the oil production in the Gulf had been shut - in , according to operator reports as of 12:30 p.m. Eastern Saturday , the MMS reported .
The Gulf produces about 1.3 million barrels of oil per day , according to the agency .
About 37.16 % of natural - gas production is shut - in , it said .
Another update was expected at 2 p.m. Eastern .
In a move that I can only describe as cowardice , Congress just passed legislation meant to immunize telephone companies for their illegal , disloyal , and irresponsible behavior .
EFF has been fighting against telecom immunity , and we need your help to bring the fight to the next level :
http://secure.eff.org/wiretapping
Two and a half years ago , EFF sued AT&T on behalf of its customers , seeking to hold the telecom giant responsible for its craven complicity in the White House 's illegal warrantless wiretapping program .
Since then , the phone companies and their allies in Washington have spent tens of millions of dollars lobbying Congress to grant them retroactive immunity .
They ran ridiculous fear - mongering attack ads against any politician who dared to oppose them .
President Bush threatened to veto any bill that allowed EFF 's lawsuit to continue .
Yesterday , Congress completely capitulated to the President 's threats and voted to let the telecoms off the hook .
If the telecoms are not held accountable , the administration will remain unchecked in its warrantless wiretapping of innocent Americans .
This must stop !
We need your help to take the fight to the next level .
We 're going to challenge Congress 's unconstitutional grant of immunity in our case against AT&T .
We 're going to fight for a congressional repeal of immunity in the next Congress .
And we 're going to file a new lawsuit against the government , challenging its warrantless surveillance practices , past , present and future .
Now , more than ever , we need your support !
http://secure.eff.org/wiretapping
The fight for civil liberties would never have come this far without your help .
We can't give up now .
Help EFF today !

The consensus on The Oil Drum is that there is no single “ Silver Bullet ” to deal with our related energy , oil and climate change problems , Rather a series of “ Silver BBs ” will be needed .
This essay is about a cost effective , medium term , multi-faceted , synergistic Silver BB arguably our best one .
The USA has almost no Non-Oil Transportation and no real plans to create a parallel alternative to our existing Oil Based Transportation system .
This is a deliberate policy choice because other nations , such as France , are moving aggressively to create a comprehensive Non-Oil Transportation system ( see Appendix One ) .
Electrifying our freight rail system will provide a Non-Oil Transportation alternative in an oil emergency , whether acute or chronic .
Regardless of oil prices or availability , there would be a backbone of essential long distance transportation that requires no oil .
And the USA , with Peak Oil arriving , appears to be moving rapidly towards a chronic oil price and affordability emergency .
This was the aborted response to the last oil crisis :
Properly done , relatively small federal incentives can stimulate a roughly $ 90 billion investment in a short time period with a wide range of benefits , in large part due to the rapidly shifting economics of oil use .
A Major Benefit - Reduced Oil Use
Oil can be saved from the diesel that railroads use today ( 231,000 barrels / day in 2006 ) and from truck freight ( 2,552,000 barrels / day in 2006 ) by switching to electrified rail .
Trucks carry about a quarter fewer ton-miles than rail , but with 11 times the oil .
The USA has 177,000 miles of railroads , with the Department of Defense classifying 32,421 miles as strategic ( STRACNET ) .
These selected rail lines correlate closely , but not exactly , with what are considered “ main line ” railroads .
DoD only selected one rail line when two main lines parallel and a few main lines are not considered strategic .
36,000 miles should cover all of the main lines .
The Pareto Principle ( also known as the 80/20 rule ) suggests that the 36,000 miles of main line railroad should carry 80 % of the railroad ton-miles , and burn 80 % of the fuel ( there being no electrified freight lines in the USA ) , or 185,000 barrels / day .
Electrifying 36,000 miles of US railroads could take as little as six years with “ Maximum Commercial Urgency ” ( see Appendix Two ) .
The Russians electrified the Trans - Siberian Railroad in 2002 and to the Arctic port of Murmansk in 2005 , so there are no technical obstacles to electrifying American railroads .
[ See Appendix Three for an overview of foreign electrified rail lines ] .
However , this calculation of 185,000 barrels of oil / day saved seriously underestimates the fuel saving potential , especially in an oil constrained future , Transferring just 8 % of the truck ton-miles to electrified rail would save another 204,000 barrel / day .
Transferring half would save 1,276,000 barrels / day , plus the 185,000 barrels / day for 1,461,000 barrels / day saved ( roughly equal to ANWR at its peak , but electrified rail does not deplete - which ANWR inevitably will ) .
Transferring 85 % of truck freight to rail , and electrifying half of US railroads , which the author considers to be possible with a large enough investment ( see Appendix Four ) , would save 2.3 to 2.4 million barrels / day .
That is 12 % of USA oil used today for all purposes , not just transportation .
This dwarfs any other “ silver BB ” being actively discussed that can be implemented quickly .
And best yet , no new technology is required .
This analysis shows that the major oil savings are in transferring freight from trucks to electrified rail .
Electrified rail passenger service is an added , but unspecified , bonus .
Electric Grid and Renewable Energy Benefits
Electrification will likely require substations every 20 to 30 miles , depending on the voltage chosen and the traffic density .
In the more remote areas , the railroads will not be able to tap into the local grid and will have to bring their own high voltage lines with them , as Amtrak does on the Northeast Corridor from Washington DC to New Haven Connecticut .
This will require new electrical maintenance work crews at the railroads , with supporting infrastructure , hired and built from scratch .
One innovative alternative is to use the existing railroad ROWs as electrical transmission corridors and have electrical utilities sell “ Power at the Wire ” to the railroads , if the railroads prefer that option .
What would be a headache and a problem to the railroads - providing both high and medium voltage transmission along their ROW - is a scarce and valuable asset to the electric utilities .
The utilities will deal with one landowner instead of 10,000 , two or three years to build instead of twelve years : a new customer immediately underneath their wires and special tax and financing incentives .
The railroads can chose to go into the electrical transmission business if they so wish , or just supply their own needs , or buy “ power at the wire ” and let someone else perform their core competency while the railroads do theirs .
I would suggest both HV AC and HV DC transmission in many corridors , with HV DC being the long haul , high volume ( only 5 % loss per 1,000 miles ) transmission and HV AC being the regional feeder and the feeder to the trolley wire .
A secondary benefit of these new transmission corridors will be to provide new markets for renewable , especially wind generated , electricity .
In particular , HV DC could supply markets that are over 1,000 miles away .
Rail spur lines could also serve as sites for long rows of wind turbines .
Today , the size of wind turbines is often limited by the capacity of local roads and bridges to support the large cranes involved , even though “ larger and taller ” is better in wind turbine economics .
Rail mounted or rail delivered cranes to a series of wind turbines could potentially install 5 MW wind turbines now seen only at sea .
Rail spurs always connect to main line railroads and the HV transmission on these main lines could ship power to markets in distant cities and states .
If we wants significant improvements to our nations electrical grid within a decade , to support a more reliable grid and more renewable generation , electrified rail corridors are the best , and perhaps the only , hope .
More discussion in Appendix Five .
Energy and Environmental Benefits
Transferring freight from truck to electrified rail trades 17 to 21 BTUs of diesel for one BTU of electricity .
Simply electrifying existing rail freight would trade 2,6 to 3 BTUs of diesel for one BTU of electricity .
Transferring 100 % of inter-city truck traffic ( impractical ) to electrified railroads , plus electrifying all ( not 80 % ) of the existing rail traffic , would take about 100 TWh / year or 2.3 % of total US electrical demand .
Electrifying 80 % of railroad ton-miles and transferring half of current truck freight to rail would take about 1 % of US electricity .
1 % is an amount that could be easily conserved , or , with less ease , provided by new renewable generation and / or new nuclear plants .
Such dramatic savings from shifting trucks to electrified rail means that electricity from modern coal plants , the worst environmental option to power electrified railroads , is still a large net environmental positive .
The ability to use non-Greenhouse Gas sources of electricity , renewable and nuclear , creates the very real possibility of both Non-Oil and Non-GHG Transportation systems .
Appendix
Six discusses this in more detail .
Economic Benefits
Electric locomotives can accelerate and brake faster because electric motors can be ( and are ) routinely run above their rated power for up to an hour without damage .
The on - board diesel generator of a diesel - electric locomotive cannot supply this surge of power , but a trolley wire can .
This extra acceleration and braking creates a 15 % increase in track capacity for freight trains , as well as faster transit speeds .
In commuter train service , travel times are typically cut by 15 % with electrification , which reduces labor and rolling stock costs and will increase ridership .
All of these factors will reduce local subsidies for commuter rail , even at increased levels of service .
SBB ( Swiss Rail ) will operate up to 300 trains / day , at mixed speeds of 110 to 240 kph ( 66 to 150 mph ) and with trains up to 1.5 km long , through a 58 km dual bore tunnel .
Such volumes would be impossible without electrification .
Few dual track US rail lines , operating with diesel - electric locomotives , can handle more than 100 trains / day .
Adding capacity for “ rubber tires ” ( trucks , cars and SUVs ) costs more for each additional unit ( in capital or congestion costs ) .
Adding just one lane to a freeway can cost more than the original freeway , even after adjusting for inflation .
The more we use rubber tires , the more the average cost rises - a negative cost elasticity of demand .
On the other hand , rail , both freight and urban , has a positive cost elasticity of demand , Adding additional capacity lowers average costs instead of raising them , since the marginal cost of new capacity is typically lower than the initial cost per unit of capacity .
Electrification by itself increases rail capacity by roughly 15 % due to faster acceleration and braking and costs much less than 15 % of a new rail line .
In simplest form , a double track railroad can carry 3 x to 4 x the freight of a single track railroad , but adding back a track torn up in the 1960s will not double costs .
Some infrastructure , such as ROW and signals , can be used for either one or two tracks .
Improved signals are an even more cost effective means of adding capacity than adding track .
Not only will double tracking dramatically increase capacity , it will also increase speed and reliability since trains will not have to queue for their turn or wait on a passing siding as trains come the opposite direction on a single track .
This lowers labor , rolling stock and customer costs ( the costs of slow transit and uncertainty about delivery dates ) .
Road damage is roughly proportional to the fourth power of the axle load .
A 20,000 lb axle causes 16 times as much damage as a 10,000 axle , and 160,000 times as much damage as a 1,000 lb axle ( wider tires mitigate the effect slightly ) .
The net result is that 99 % of the traffic damage to roads and highways comes from trucks and buses and far exceeds any fuel taxes paid .
Removing as many trucks as possible ( and shifting to Urban Rail with smaller feeder buses ) is the best hope for keeping road maintenance affordable .
A massive capital spending program on long lived infrastructure that eliminates oil use is a nearly ideal economic stimulus .
The majority of spending should be for domestic goods and services .
Rail freight is also significantly safer than heavy truck freight per ton -mile .
Another economic , and human , benefit that could save thousands of lives each year .
Electric rail should generate significantly less pollution , even after accounting for electrical generation .
The cost of electricity BTUs are much lower than the cost of diesel BTUs today , and are likely to stay cheaper and more stable .
The only significant imports of electricity are from Canadian hydroelectric projects , which are superior to Middle Eastern and Venezuelan oil imports in several ways .
National Defense Benefits
Nations can be defeated in two ways : on the battlefield or by collapse of the Home Front .
During World War I , both Russia and Germany were defeated by a collapse of their respective home fronts .
In the author ’s rough judgment , if the USA lost 6 to 7 million barrels / day of oil imports for 24 to 30 months , without any preparation or warning , and with a less than ideal crisis response , not only would the US economy collapse , but food distribution would become erratic as the effects of severe oil shortages cascade over time .
If the USA cannot even feed its citizens , it is effectively defeated .
Military analysts will immediately think of the Islamic Republic of Arabia replacing Saudi Arabia and other Gulf States , or the Straits of Hormuz being blockaded , or submarines around the Straits of Malacca stopping the flow of oil as part of a larger conflict .
These are all credible threats to our national security and survival .
There is a different threat , rarely considered .
If the US dollar collapses , and the USA has to buy oil with its exports , cash instead of credit , oil imports could be reduced by 6 to 7 million barrels / day , depending upon the scenario .
Such an economic scenario has the unpleasant result of the USA being defeated , but surrendering to no one .
A siege without end .
A related threat is posed by the post - Peak Oil world , where world oil exports are collapsing faster than world oil production .
The economies of oil exporters boom , expanding domestic consumption and reducing their exports significantly faster than their production declines .
A half dozen years after world oil and “ all liquids ” production peaks , world oil exports ( not production , but exports ) can be reduced by half , two thirds , or more .
A number of real world examples of this Export Land Model have surfaced in the last few years .
In the author ’s opinion , this is the most likely scenario and a very real threat to national security - even survival .
Creating a Non-Oil Transportation System
Electrified railroads , a massive build–out of Urban Rail , much more bicycling and many more walkable neighborhoods , could insulate the USA from the worst effects of a prolonged oil emergency from any cause .
Switzerland and Sweden used precisely these strategies to survive and function during six year long , 100 % oil embargoes .
The most crucial of these four elements of Non-Oil Transportation is electrified railroads but all four will be needed .
36,000 miles of electrified and expanded rail lines could provide a Non-Oil transportation backbone for this nation for both essential goods and some passengers .
Total volumes would likely decline with the economic stress , so almost all freight ( and many passengers ) could be transported long distances without oil .
Trucks could be used only for local deliveries and sites remote from rail sidings , just as the USA did during World War II .
The Best Policy by Every Metric
An as yet unpublished analysis by the Millennium Institute using their T21 model strongly implies that a combined policy of a maximum push for renewable energy with a maximum push for electrified transportation ( railroads and Urban Rail ) gives the largest GDP , the largest reduction in Greenhouse Gases and the Largest reduction in oil consumption over decade and longer time horizons ,
The best Economic Policy is the best Environmental Policy and the best Energy Policy !
And such a policy combination also has extremely positive National Defense implications .
With some justification it could also be called the best National Defense Policy as well .
Just two major policy initiatives , renewable energy and electrified rail ( Urban & freight ) address every major public policy conundrum .
If pursued with extreme vigor , these two policies , combined , are better than every other examined alternative .
One interesting observation is the positive effects of these two policies were not simply additive but multiplicative .
There is a subtle but strong synergy between these two policies for the economy , energy and the environment .
The limitations of the Millennium Institute project did not allow for modeling increased transportation bicycling , but there is no doubt that any increase in bicycle modal share can only improve the results by every metric .
The First Step ( Small )
Politics is the art of the possible .
If only minimal funding of $ 1 billion / year or so is possible to support electrified rail , despite the enumerated benefits , then leverage is needed .
Most states are served by one or two Class I railroads , making a local monopoly or duopoly .
Regionally , most of the Western USA is served by Union Pacific and / or BN - SF and the Eastern USA by Norfolk Southern and CSX .
Canadian Pacific , Canadian National and Kansas City Southern provide a third Class I alternative in a few states .
This lack of competition stifles innovation .
However , once one member of a duopoly successfully innovates , the other member is compelled to match them .
The issue then is to ignite the spark and get at least two of the Class I railroads ( one each in the East and West ) to make the first move .
Such a “ chain reaction ” will not result in the fastest possible electrification and expansion , but it will eventually get us there .
The incentives given to the first six nuclear power plants are a model for the “ chain reaction ” needed .
Applied to railroads , this would give incentives to the first railroad to electrify ( East & West ) and none for the second or third .
Of course , if two or three railroads electrify at about the same time ( hopefully ) , the incentives would be split .
One way , of many , to ignite this spark would be to grant $ 1 billion / year ( inflation adjusted ) for ten years as a 25 % tax credit for electrification , with no more than 66 % going to either East or West of the Mississippi River .
These benefits would be granted when placed into commercial service , then – and this is a crucial point - put on both a “ first come , first served ” and accrued basis .
To illustrate if $ 3 billion worth of tax credits are issued in 2011 for $ 12 billion of electrification , which would be $ 2 billion in excess of that years tax credit budget , the overage would be issued tax credits good for the 2012 and 2013 tax years .
Any work completed in 2012 would be issued tax credits usable in 2014 and beyond until the tax credits are exhausted .
This accrual of limited tax benefits would place a premium on being first to complete electrification - which serves public policy goals admirably .
And railroads that failed to join the rush to electrify would be forced by competitive pressures to electrify without tax incentives at a later date .
Ten years of $ 1 billion ( 2008 $ ) of 25 % tax credits would support $ 40 billion worth ( 2008 $ ) of electrification .
$ 40 billion of electrification should electrify about 16,000 miles of US rail lines .
The First Step ( Large )
The USA needs to start electrifying our main line railroads .
The railroads can do it , or utilities can do it and sell “ Power at the Wire ” to the railroads , and use the railroad ROWs as transmission corridors , strengthening our electrical grid and providing Non-Oil Transportation .
The United States of America needs electrified rail done as soon as possible , given the growing crisis in energy and climate .
The “ First Step ( Small ) ” is clearly inadequate to the looming crisis .
The preferred alternative is to get everybody to electrify everything as fast as possible .
The author believes that a fixed incentive would create delay and cautious evaluation in the early years , with a mad rush as the incentives expiration nears .
A carefully timed decline in incentives , rewarding first movers the most but still providing reduced incentives for laggards , would have the greatest public policy benefit , i.e. the most electrified miles ASAP .
We also need to increase capacity , speed and reliability of rail shipments to better serve the economy and to attract more shipments from trucks .
Some Possible Incentives
A declining investment tax credit -
An example , a 25 % investment tax credit for electrification , given only when the electrification infrastructure is operational , that is flat at 25 % for the first 30 months and then declines by 1 % a quarter for four years to 9 % and then continues at that level for several years .
The electrification tax credit would be available to either railroads or electric utilities .
Since the major oil savings come from shifting truck freight to rail , increasing capacity by just 15 % from electrification is clearly inadequate .
Perhaps half of this tax credit ( 12.5 % ) could be offered for double tracking , improved signals and other measures that increase rail capacity , speed and improve reliability on electrified rail lines .
No tax credit should be given for improvements to rail lines that are not electrified .
A slightly slower decline in the investment tax credit could be justified for these improvements .
Perhaps 12.5 % for five years , then a half percent / year decline to 9 % ..
Reduced cost of capital - Railroads are a capital intensive business .
To build out electrification and to expand and improve rail service as a viable Non-Oil Transportation alternative for all types of freight will require hundreds of billions of dollars .
Lowering this cost , and making the capital available as needed , is a daunting challenge that needs federal support .
One alternative is Industrial Revenue bonds - a lower cost to the railroads and a higher cost to the US Treasury .
However , a series of delays are endemic in issuing these bonds .
A policy decision is needed to determine whether we should encourage these or not .
Another alternative is an US Treasury guarantees for railroad or electric utility bonds issued to support electrification and improvements to electrified rail lines .
Such guarantees would use the rail lines as collateral .
These bonds could be issued quickly , in volume and at reduced cost to the railroads or utilities .
One needs to remember that the USA is facing a growing and ever more desperate crisis fueled by a lack of oil at affordable prices .
Such a slow motion but extraordinary crisis requires extraordinary measures .
Property Tax Exemptions or Caps –
The traditional reason / excuse given by US railroads for not electrifying is that the electrification infrastructure will be subject to heavy property taxes , and railroad diesel is tax free .
This is an obstacle not faced by other national railroads , most of which have electrified ( See Appendix Three ) .
It appears that both the Interstate Commerce and Common Defense clauses of the US Constitution give the federal government the power to regulate local property taxes on interstate commerce common carriers .
One approach is to give property tax exemptions on new infrastructure for a limited time .
Perhaps a 30 year property tax exemption for electrification and capacity expansion infrastructure completed by 2010 , with that exemption shrinking by three years for each additional calendar year .
One possibility to assist local taxing jurisdictions would be to place a cap on their prospective losses for new infrastructure .
Local taxing jurisdictions that lose more than , say , 0,3 % of their revenues , could have the excess above 0.3 % compensated by the federal government .
Such a cap would dramatically cut the cost to the federal government .
And once the property tax exemption expired , they would have new property to tax .
There are many other possibilities .
Refocus Highway Improvements – Vehicle miles traveled are dropping and with that , the need for additional lane miles .
Refocus highway improvements on railroad grade separation and improving access to inter-modal rail - truck - barge facilities .
State and locally owned railroads ( Alaskan RR , Long Island RR , various port RRs , commuter rail lines and various branch lines ) would receive XX % federal matching funds .
I would suggest the same percentage used to build the Interstate Highway System , 90 % federal matching then , 80 % now .
A never before considered funding source , that follows Senator Russell Long ’s famous dictum “ Do n’t Tax You , Do n’t Tax Me , Let ’s Tax that Fellow behind the Tree ” is discussed at
http://www.theoildrum.com/node/3506
This could finance the massive rush to electrification and quite a bit of Urban Rail as well .
And it reasonable to expect that those taxed would strongly support lower US oil consumption .
The Second Step – Semi-High Speed Rail
CSX has proposed an upgrade for its East Coast Line from Washington DC to Miami that should serve as a model for a national system of 14,000 or so miles .
CSX proposes to grade separate the entire 1,200 miles , and run regular freight trains at 60 to 70 mph on two tracks .
Between Richmond and Miami , there would be one track for passenger service at 110 mph , and two semi-high speed tracks between Washington DC and Richmond .
SBB ( SwissRail ) has firm plans for a new express freight service , with special streamlined cars , at 160 kph ( 100 mph ) .
The CSX and SBB concepts should be merged and both 100 mph express freight and 110 mph passenger service should be run on new tracks built on existing railroad ROWs .
The USA does not have enough rail passenger demand to justify more than isolated sections of high or semi- high speed rail passenger only service .
The author ’s position is that EU and Japanese style High Speed Rail is wasteful of both scarce capital and energy at this time ,
HSR costs much more per mile than semi-HSR and cannot handle medium density freight , only passengers and light parcels .
CSX estimates 1,200 miles of semi-HSR will cost $ 15 to $ 25 billion which is much lower per mile than any of the varying California estimates for High Speed Rail .
Energy consumption increases with the square of the speed , a 190 mph train will use 3 times as much energy as a 110 mph train , a 220 mph train 4 times as much .
The USA is not France : we simply cannot afford the “ best ” service in this generation and we do not have the energy to waste on maximum speed .
However , if express freight demand ( with refrigerated vegetables and fruit being high volume customers ) is combined with passenger demand , a viable national system can be created combining passenger service at 100 to 125 mph with express freight at 90 to 100 mph on existing but upgraded ROWs .
The two concepts would work synergistically , operate on existing railroad ROWs and would economically justify a widespread network .
Reliable 90 to 100 mph freight service should take modal share not only from trucks , but from air freight as well , vastly expending the scope of Non-Oil Transportation .
First Steps - Other Non-Oil Transportation
Vastly expanding Urban Rail , in towns as small as 100,000 ( see Appendix One ) has the potential to mitigate an oil emergency as much as electrifying freight railroads .
An excellent first step would be to build “ on - the - shelf ” projects that could start construction ( and create jobs ) in 12 to 36 months from a national decision .
http://www.lightrailnow.org/features/f_lrt_2007-04a.htm
A jobs program focused on Urban Rail could create oil saving infrastructure that will last over a century ,
Regional passenger rail , serving travel from 100 to 300 or 500 miles , has the potential to expand dramatically with an expanded and electrified rail system , with notable oil savings .
Cross-country Amtrak is unlikely to gain significant market share , except in an extremely oil constrained future .
Generally , in OECD nations , rail modal share drops quickly as trip times exceed three hours .
Additional non-published work is on - going for increased transportation bicycling and encouraging walkable neighborhoods and Transit Orientated development .
Necessary , but not Sufficient
Electrifying America ’s Railroads is not going to be enough to solve our energy and environmental problems without many other Silver BBs .
But it is difficult to model a realistic solution that does not include electrifying our railroads and shifting much of our truck freight to rail .
The question is not “ if ” we will electrify our railroads , but “ when ” and “ how fast . ”

President Chirac made it a national goal to electrify “ every meter ” of the French National railroads ( SNCF ) and “ burn not one drop of oil . ”
This goal was set on January 1st , 2006 with a twenty - year deadline .
France has been building their famous TGV lines for over 30 years , one line at a time .
Now that the original Paris - centric system is 100 km from completion , a new network of additions , bypassing Paris , have been announced and for the first time three different TGV lines are simultaneously under construction .
France has had an aggressive tram ( Light Rail ) building program for over fifteen years , with only five French towns of population 100,000 or more without a tram or plans for one .
Recently , France has stepped up the pace with plans for 1,500 km of new tram lines ( 22 billion euros ) in the next decade .
And then there is vélib ’ , rental bicycles scattered every few hundred meters in almost a dozen French cities , typically with the first half hour free .
A French bicycling initiative has a stated goal of 10 % of urban trips by bicycle in 2010 .
Bicycle lanes and paths have been built , but so far only 3 % of trips are on bicycles .
This statistic is up from slightly more than 1 % , so it is difficult to call the program a true failure .
During a prolonged oil emergency this new bicycling infrastructure , and the vélib ’ , will see good use .
A French Strategic Bicycling Reserve ?
In the USA , only Portland , Oregon and Davis , California ( to the author ’s knowledge ) exceed the French average .
Mulhouse , France ( population 110,900 , metro 271,000 ) illustrates just how comprehensive the French program can be in a best case .
This remote town where France , Germany and Switzerland meet , got its first tram ( Light Rail ) line in 2006 .
By 2012 , they will have 58 km ( 34 miles ) of new tram lines ( they would also have had a tram line to Basel Switzerland if Franco - Swiss co-operation had been better ) .
In 2011 , Mulhouse will be the temporary terminus of a new TGV line and 200 vélib ’ , ( rental bicycles ) have recently been installed .
The end result is that by 2012 a resident of Mulhouse can walk out their door , grab a vélib ’ , drop it off at the tram station or just walk , take the tram to the TGV station and be in Paris in 4 or so hours – or be anywhere in France in a long day , all with a drop or two of lubricating oil and minimal carbon footprint .
In the non-transportation area , France is installing large numbers of solar hot water heaters and geothermal heat pumps .
With significant difficulty and economic loss , France could adapt to a prolonged loss of a large fraction of their imported oil .
Switzerland started building their Non-Oil Transportation system in the 1920 ’s as a national defense policy .
This policy enabled Switzerland to endure a six year 100 % oil embargo during WW II with a functional industrial economy , democratic institutions and a deterrent defense .
Germany , unlike France , kept their urban rail network after WW II and has been steadily enhancing it instead of rebuilding it in a crash program .
They are also building a high speed rail network , but at a slower pace than France and have world class insulation and energy efficiency standards .

How quickly can the USA Electrify our Railroads ?
I contacted the premier US consultant I know of on this issue , John Schumann P.E. of LTK Engineering .
He graciously gave me several hours of his time to work out a schedule for electrifying US railroads .
We assumed Maximum Commercial Urgency , the maximum effort that people driven by the profit motive can sustain on large scale projects .
War time efforts are a step above Maximum Commercial Urgency since national survival is clearly at stake ( the development of tar sands in Alberta Canada is a contemporary example of Maximum Commercial Urgency ) .
We agreed to five groups .
Four would be run by the four major Class I railroads in the USA , Union Pacific , BN - SF , Norfolk Southern and CSX .
Separate efforts by Kansas City Southern , the US divisions of Canadian National and Canadian Pacific , as well as Class II railroads such as Florida East Coast would be the equivalent of a fifth group .
All five groups would make roughly equivalent efforts and try to create new electrification work teams at the rate of about eight teams / year / group , using a combination of in house labor and contracted labor .
This is as fast as possible , within the boundaries of cost control ( they would not be operating at war time urgency ) .
Our conclusion was that the following is an aggressive but possible effort for railroad electrification .
Year 1 – 0 ( Design , Planning , Mobilization , Materials )
Year 2 – 5 x 500 miles = 2,500 miles
Year 3 – 5 x 1,000 miles = 5,000 miles
Year 4 – 5 x 1,500 miles = 7.500 miles
Year 5 – 5 x 2,000 miles = 10,000 miles
Year 6 – 4.5 x 2,500 miles = 11,250 miles
A total of 36,250 miles electrified in six years .
The slight slowdown in the sixth year reflects a saturation of lines worth electrifying at Maximum Commercial Urgency .
The low hanging fruit would have been picked .
Depending upon future oil prices and the efficiency of running an all - electric rather than mixed fuel railroad , the pace of electrification may slow after the main lines are electrified - or a prolonged oil emergency may compel further acceleration .
[ Subsequent to our discussions , I discovered a never implemented 1979 contingency plan for British Rail that envisioned five teams electrifying 250 miles / year as a response to a prolonged oil emergency .
This is 50 miles / year / team and we assumed 62.5 miles / year / team ] .

Appendix Four
How much truck freight can be shifted to rail ?
The correct answer from several public policy perspectives is “ as much as possible , as soon as possible ” .
There are several variables in this calculation :
Cost -
Rail is already cheaper than trucking , but trucks have a larger modal share except for the lowest value cargoes ( coal , gravel , grain ) .
The cost differential is growing rapidly , and there is a shift from truck to rail , but not fast enough for public policy goals .
Electrified rail will be even cheaper than diesel rail .
Speed & Reliability –
It is critical to close the speed and reliability advantage that trucks have over rail .
Electrification , double tracking , track improvements and better signals will all speed up trains and reduce the uncertainty about transit times and delivery dates .
Management Philosophy - Railroads currently want to run their tracks very close to capacity and they avoid “ overbuilding ” at all costs .
A change in business philosophy will be required to capture higher value cargoes - cargoes from shippers willing to pay a premium rate several times coal rates .
For example , Union Pacific stopped carrying UPS shipments because they did not want the operational hassle of running trains on time .
US railroads will need to “ overbuild ” and change operating procedures to get the required capacity , speed and reliability needed to attract a majority of truck freight .
Federal policy can help change this with incentives .
Semi-High Speed Express Freight - Offering express freight service ( with refrigeration as needed ) at 90 to 100 mph will capture large segments of the truck market and part of the air freight market .
Express freight service is the essential economic driver for a 14,000 - mile Semi-High Speed Rail network ( more published at a later date on this ) .
Regional passenger service at 110 mph will likely be a large but secondary benefit .
Time – Time will be required for shippers to adjust to rail .
For example , WalMart has gone almost exclusively to trucking and their many regional distribution centers were built with only trucks in mind .
WalMart , and other like shippers , will have to build new regional distribution centers that can accept container trains from ports and domestic factories , and the railroads will need to improve service enough to attract behemoths such as WalMart .
Under the pressure of ever - higher oil prices , such changes will still likely take a decade to complete ( and the abandoning some not fully depreciated real estate ) .
In some cases , rail will come to the factories and distributors with new spur lines .
In other cases , the factories and distributors will move to rail spurs .
And in many cases , “ the last mile ” will be by truck from a local or regional rail - truck inter-modal facility .
The key to such a large scale migration is improved rail service more than a cost differential .
During WW II , public / military policy was to ship everything by rail and as little as possible by truck in order to save fuel and trucks for overseas operations .
Lieut .
E. L. Tennyson , Office of Chief of Transportation , US Army states that 90 % of ton-miles in the 48 states were by rail during WW II .
Ed Tennyson has made the rough estimation that a $ 250 billion investment in rail infrastructure ( electrification , double tracking , no semi- High Speed Rail ) would result in an eventual transfer of 67 % of truck ton -miles to rail in a high oil price environment .
I believe that , in an environment of very high oil prices , an investment of $ 400 to $ 450 billion ( including semi- High Speed Rail and some new rail lines ) could result in an 85 % shift of existing truck freight ton -miles to rail .
It is difficult to calculate the long term road maintenance savings from such a shift , but that savings alone may justify such massive investments .
The bulk of rail investments have 50 - year useful lives .
A nation - wide improved and electrified rail system would be a very worthwhile inheritance for the next generation facing a post - Peak Oil future .
Appendix Five
Railroad Right - of - Ways as Electrical Transmission Corridors
The railroads will have no choice but to supply their own high voltage to their substations in less populated areas of the USA .
This is a major additional cost but it can also be a major benefit if the larger grid uses these new transmission lines .
Most railroad ROWs are 100 ’ wide , which allows for multiple tracks and high voltage transmission towers .
Rail lines running through densely populated states might have the option to tap into local power lines for each substation ( Amtrak did this from New Haven to Boston ) but there are financial advantages to selecting the lowest cost utility and paying for only one system peak charge instead of a series of local peak charges .
Generally speaking , high voltage transmission is not required for electrified railroads through densely populated states , but they may still be worthwhile .
Almost all electrical transmission in the USA today is HV AC which only requires transforming down to useful voltages .
Many rail lines will have a HV AC line that conforms to regional standard voltages ( 345 kV in Texas for example ) .
Some rail line ROWs may also carry HV DC lines for long distance transmission .
HV DC has much lower transmission losses ( 5%/1000 miles ) but requires expensive power electronics to convert from AC to DC and then back at every node .
“ Northern Lights ” is an ongoing project that illustrates how and where HV DC is economic today .
http://www.transcanada.com/company/northernlights.html
http://commerce.mt.gov/energy/northern.asp
The USA has several out - of - sync grids and only HV DC can transfer power between these grids .
An informal consensus was formed during the plans for electrification of US rail lines in the 1970s that the USA west of the Mississippi and Canada would be electrified at 50 kV AC and east of the Mississippi at 25 kV AC , all at the grid 60 Hz .
Such voltages would require substations every 20 to 30 miles .
One can conceive of an electrified rail line operating at 55 kV AC , with a 345 kV HV AC line , interconnecting to every other HV AC line it crosses and feeding 55 kV substations every 30 miles .
Local wind turbines would feed into the 55 kV line ( with a 55 kV - 345 kV substation conveniently near by ) .
In addition a +500 kV DC and - 500 kV DC line would be strung from the same towers ( an interesting design challenge ) with nodes converting to 345 kV AC every 200 to 500 miles .
Railroads could start a new business , electrical transmission ( the owner of Northern Lights is a Canadian pipeline company , not an electric utility ) , or form joint ventures with regional utilities or just lease space on their ROWs to electric utilities .
Dual use of rail ROWs appears to be the best and fastest way to improve our electrical grid .
There is one caveat .
I have received assurances from experienced power electrical engineers that this is “ doable ” but such assurances are not yet definitive .
Unique tower designs may be required to accommodate HV DC , HV AC and electrified rail lines ..
Appendix Six
Electrical Demand for Electrified Railroads and Environmental Impact
“ [ Electrified ]
Railways handle 32 % of Swiss freight traffic and 16 % of passenger traffic , but they use only 3 % of the total energy required for all transportation . ”
- SBB ( SwissRail ) Environmental Report
Electrified railroads would use 2.37 % of US electrical generation ( about as much as France today ) if all truck freight was shifted to electrified rail , and all rail was electrified .
A more realistic ( very successful ) rail electrification program could use 1 % of US electricity in a decade and more in later years .
In 2006 , the USA generated 4,065 TWh .
Translating 2,552,000 barrels / day for trucks to electricity ( using 18 : 1 ratio ) and 231,000 barrels / day ( 2.6 : 1 ratio ) gives 88.5 and 8 TWh respectively .
This is 2.37 % of US electrical generation if all truck freight was shifted to electrified rail , and all rail was electrified .
Adjust downward from 100 % of truck to rail and 100 % of rail electrified and the USA would be very well served if an additional 1 % of US electrical demand went to electrified rail
Today , 0.19 % of US electricity goes to transportation - enough to run New York City subways , Amtrak ’s Northeast Corridor , Long Island Railroad , subways in Chicago , Washington DC , Philadelphia , Boston and elsewhere , as well all Light Rail and streetcar systems .
Modern main line locomotives are diesel - electric .
A small ( 2 to 5 MW ) diesel generator is coupled with an electric motor for traction power .
Such small diesel generators are only used on small islands and for emergency generators because of their low efficiency and high cost for fuel and maintenance .
The overall efficiency of diesel - electric locomotives ( 99 + % of US locomotives ) is slightly more than 2.6 BTUs of diesel generating 1 BTU of electricity .
Both diesel - electric and all electric locomotives use an electric motor as the final drive .
Modern electric locomotives can regenerate power during braking , feeding electricity back into the grid , an energy savings that diesel electrics put into waste heat .
Gil Carmichael , former head of the Federal Railroad Administration , has stated that unit trains of double stack containers with diesel - electric locomotives are nine times as efficient as trucks in transporting freight .
If one adjusts for less than ideal circumstances ( such as more miles A to B by rail than by truck , some less efficient roll on - roll off trailers , some single stack containers ) then 7:1 or 8:1 is more realistic .
Regenerative braking in hilly terrain and built - up areas increases the diesel to electricity efficiency ratio from 2.6:1 to 3:1 ( an industry rule of thumb ) .
So seven or eight times 2.6 to 3.0 gives about 18 to 21:1 diesel to electricity BTU ratio ( I ’m rounding for national average ) between diesel trucks and electrified rail .
Overall , the USA grid loses about 10 % of the electricity generated to transforming and transmission losses .
Large industrial users , that use higher voltages , have optimized transmission and high efficiency transformers , are closer to 6 % T&T losses .
If railways improve the grid with more transmission lines , they would , in a sense , “ make ” electricity by reducing losses , so I have not allocated anything to T&T losses .
Diesel also incurs energy losses in transportation before final use .
There is no other widespread economic use for falling water , blowing wind , geothermal heat or nuclear heat except to make electricity .
None of these sources release large scale greenhouse gases outside the natural cycle , Therefore , the relative efficiency of each is irrelevant ; only maximizing their generation matters .
Among the fossil fuels , natural gas emits 115 lbs of carbon dioxide for 1 million BTUs , oil ( not diesel per se ) 155 to 164 lbs and coal 205 to 227 lbs ( some variance depending upon type ) .
Locomotive diesels are in the 34 % to 38 % thermodynamic efficiency range .
Modern super critical double reheat coal fired plants are in the 40 % to 43 % range , and combined cycle natural gas plants are 50 % to 59 % efficient .
Combining the thermodynamics and emissions of modern coal plants vs. small diesels , and factoring in regenerative braking , I conclude that coal fired electric trains should emit as much CO2 as diesel - electric trains , unless the diesel comes from Canadian tar sands ( a growing source with high CO2 emissions ) .
All sources of electricity ( except coal ) are clear environmental winners for electrified railroads over diesel - electric trains .
And even coal is better than diesel refined from Albertan tar sands .
The impact of shifting freight from trucks to electrified rail ( as opposed to diesel rail to electrified rail ) is a massive environmental improvement ( 1:8+ improvement ) with very dramatic reductions in greenhouse gases regardless of the source

“ Ruin in community is not caused by witches with broomstick but it ’s something that starts in people ’s heads . ”
– Prof. Preobrazhensky ( Michail Bulgakov ’s “ The heart of a dog ” )
The newborn software system looks beautiful inside after the few weeks of development .
Several talented programmers put their souls together into this amazing software idea .
But week after week the system become older and uglier .
It could still look exciting for users , but the system rots inside .
It is much more difficult to modify , it breaks often , development time and cost soars .
Programmers become scared to work with it .
The system becomes Frankenstein .
Why could it happen ?
Three reasons
There are hundred objective reasons why it could happen – complex technology , changing customer needs , management pressure , time to market and many more .
But some teams still deliver a good system under these conditions .
And some teams cannot deliver even in the most favorable conditions .
Why ?
Degradation of the system starts in the people heads and there are three main reasons :
Incomprehension – developers do n’t understand the purpose , ideas , design or technology behind the system Inarticulateness – developers unable to express ideas through clear and effective architecture , design and code Inconsistency – developers cannot act consistently or do n’t care about the system
Incomprehension – do n’t understand
“ I am so clever that sometimes I do n’t understand a single word of what I am saying . ” – Oscar Wilde
Every person has limits for understanding :
We have limited memory and perception , which are far from perfection and distort reality .
Team members as any individuals have different background , mindset and expertise .
It is not a surprise that they could easily misunderstand each other .
It is even more difficult to understand outsiders as clients coming from completely another world .
Separated teams , make situation more complicated .
Conway ’s Law says Organizations which design systems are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations .
Corollary :
If you have four groups working on a compiler , you ’ll get a 4 - pass compiler .
It is easier to implement this way than to understand what other groups are doing .
It is hard job to reach good understanding .
But if you and your team do n’t understand the purpose , ideas , design and technology behind the system – you cannot effectively build the system .
Inarticulateness – cannot express
“ I did n’t have time to write a short letter , so I wrote a long one instead . ” – Mark Twain
Understanding is not enough .
The crucial step is to actually write a program .
And programming requires special style of thinking : logical , abstract and creative in the same time .
Ability to clearly and effectively express oneself is a precious skill for any speaker and writer .
Programming requires a similar talent multiplied on complexity of technological means for expression – software platforms , languages and tools .
Every programmer is unique – our innate and learned skills determine our potential , our experience shapes our capabilities , and our tools frame our mind .
After all , every mortal programmer has limits for the problem he could solve .
Many programmers could write programs only for straightforward , defined and standard problems ( and some have unique skills to create chaos even with simple programs ) .
Few programmers could tackle complex , wicked and open - ended problems in the elegant , clear and effective way .
The system is doomed if you or your team cannot express ideas through clear and effective code , design and architecture .
Inconsistency – cannot act consistently or do n’t care
“ Of course , if people could just act consistently , they could keep their desks clean , avoid cavities , lose weight , give up smoking , play a musical instrument , and possibly even produce software on a regular and timely basis . ” – Alistair Cockburn
Having full understanding and expertise to create the software system is still not enough .
People are not completely rational beings and there are many difficult to explain factors that affect productivity , quality of work and the level of responsibility :
how happy , motivated and satisfied they are – unmotivated , uncaring or stressed programmers will usually produce bad software .
peer pressure , conformity and groupthink could substantially alter our behavior and thinking .
The group could detach from reality and start believing in wrong ideas .
environment , structure of work and ability to focus are important .
Distractions , inconvenient environment and confusing tasks will have negative influence .
team dynamics , leadership style and established processes affect team efficiency
We cannot simply tell people : “ please , care and be responsible ” and they will immediately become responsible , concerned and motivated to keep the system in the good shape .
It is very difficult and often against our nature .
People should make effort and need right conditions to behave rationally , consistently and meet expectations ( which are imposed by other imperfect people :) ) .
Further complications
Technology Tower of Babel
“ Go to , let us go down , and there confound their language , that they may not understand one another ’s speech . ” – Genesis 11:6-7
Complex technology , levels of abstractions and various components of the system require different perspectives , layers and approaches even for simple applications .
Nonetheless , all these different representations create seams between subsystems and components .
Mess and rot are often starting to appear around these places without proper care and mastery .
Consider , for example , representation levels and languages in the traditional web application :
HTML – markup language for layout of web pages
CSS – stylesheet rule - based language for describing presentation of web pages
JavaScript – dynamically - typed language for web page functionality on browser
ASP .NET / JSP / PHP – server - side declarative languages for web pages generation on the web server
C# , Java – object - oriented languages for domain and middle - tier logic
SQL – declarative query and data manipulation language
Few web developers master all these levels , because of time , experience and volume of knowledge involved .
Web and graphic design , information architecture , usability , database programming , networking , server and infrastructure administration add additional perspectives to the system .
This mixture significantly contribute to the complexity and effort to understand , evolve and maintain the system .
Increase in complexity and entropy
“ The law that entropy always increases – the second law of thermodynamics – holds I think , the supreme position among the laws of Nature . ” – Sir Arthur Stanley Eddington
Entropy affects all the complex systems in the Universe .
Amount of disorder in these systems tends toward maximum .
Any system degrades and collapses unless external or internal forces keep integrity of structure and adapt it to changing conditions .
The development team is this external force that evolves and maintains the software system .
It is tough job , considering limited human ability for mental control over vast and complex information .
In addition , more complex systems are less predictable and more difficult to change .
There is essential complexity related to complexity of the problem and wasteful caused by inability to deeply understand the problem , find optimal solution or over - engineering .
The effective development team should control essential complexity and avoid wasteful .
How to save the software system ?
Any complex problem has the perfect software solution that meets two criteria :
customer is completely satisfied , the system is simple and user friendly
programmers can easily understand , support and modify the system for the future changes
Unfortunately , we do n’t have now any formal methods how to reach such solution .
Software development is empirical process and the best we can do is to assemble good team , equip and prepare ourselves for the journey .
However , if the team rigorously tries to meet these two criteria from the first day of development – the chances are high that the system will be good at the finish .
If the team temporarily abandon these criteria in hope to achieve them on later stages – the chances are high that the system will have serious problems at the finish .
Before start
Find right and diverse people – they are the most important factor of success .
Experience and skills should match the problem , but there is more .
Team should be diverse and members should supplement each other : diverse people will better handle different system representations and knowledge : system architecture , domain expertise , web design , object oriented and database programming .
less risk for conformity , groupthink and distortion of reality by the whole group .
they could select from wider range of strategies for achieving results and be effective in execution of all tasks , from routine to creative .
finally , ideas , brainstorming and solutions will be more balanced , broad and have higher quality Match people , problems and compensation – people will be happy , motivated and dedicated if they have interesting work – not overwhelmingly complex and not too simple .
It will boost growth , motivation and productivity .
Compensation is another important factor – it should be fair and linked to the end results of the whole project .
Give control to the team , define clear goals and set criteria of success – software team members are the best people to make project related decisions .
They will make right decision if they understand project vision and what is important for success .
The empowered team will take full responsibility , self - organize and really care .
After start
Establish excellent information flow – it is the basis of the development team understanding , judgment and decisions .
A team will be the most effective in processing project related information if the team is diverse – people will understand information differently and reconciliation of this knowledge will create much better understanding for the whole team
small – people will avoid communication overhead and high number of interactions
self - organized – people will know what is important and ask what is needed .
They will strive for the better information instead of relying on external help and guidance .
facing customers directly , understand their ideas and feel their pain .
It helps to avoid incorrect information caused by misinterpretation and distortion of information through people chains .
understanding and solving problems in the same time with all necessary information available Fight complexity , which is the main reason for the project degradation .
Too complex solutions cause poor understanding , fear of change and inefficiency in the development .
The software code is the key indicator for the amount of entropy and health of the system .
The best systems have easy to understand , clear and well - structured code even for the complex problems .
Code is good when it is minimal , readable and relevant no duplication and dead code no over - engineering developers understand each other ideas behind the code
achieve optimal representation with constant refactoring to improve design and understanding balance between expansion and consolidation phases , which allow rapid evolution of the system while keeping structural integrity frequent synchronization with design ideas : architecture , design and code evolve and reconcile against reality together .
It is two way – architecture and design provide meaning , direction and high level explanation , while code is ultimate and true description of the system behavior .
Good code will enable , enhance and provide feedback for the future architecture and design ideas .
Bad code will kill even genius ideas .
support abstractions and decoupling between subsystems and layers big picture is easy to keep in mind clear boundaries , isolated behavior and minimal dependencies reduce complexity of each subsystem .
Poor implementation in some places will have minimal impact on other components .
solution overall complexity grows while allowing human brains relatively easy understanding of the individual pieces .
Adopt and learn – every project has unique requirements , people and context .
It is almost impossible to make right decisions from the beginning .
Therefore , the process should have built - in adaptation and correction mechanism as one of the most important components . :
Different opinions and alternatives provide more chances for selecting the best strategy
Short problem solving cycles ( a.k.a iterations ) allow fast sync with reality , reconcile mistakes and boost learning
People are encouraged to learn , listen to others and change
It is a titanic work to keep the system away from Frankenstanization , disorganization and degradation .
But it is possible if we realize – our success depends on struggle with complexity and … ourselves , human programmers .
[ UPDATE :
As few readers correctly pointed out , the post compares software systems to Frankenstein ’s monster .
The confusion with Frankenstein is a common mistake .
Anyway , we are still a bit far from creation of creators of the monsters as Dr. Frankenstein :) . ]

There are a few things you can do , though , to slow down the needless flow of waste into your mailbox .
Catalogue Choice –
You can register with this online service which allows you to opt out of various companies ’ catalogues .
They contact the businesses and manage the opting - out for you .
The downside is that it can take up to 10 weeks for companies to receive your request .
The Direct Marketing Association ’s Mail Preference Service – Here , you can remove your name from organizations ’ mailing lists as well as remove your name from their member prospectus list .
Green Dimes –
This service offers free and premium tiers .
The premium option comes with some additional perks , such as monthly monitoring , but the free version looks pretty comprehensive .
Opt Out Prescreen –
The major credit companies now offer you an opt - out solution .
Register here to stop receiving unsolicited “ pre-approved ” credit card offers .
Apart from online services , there are some steps you can take to keep your junk mail at a minimum .
A lot of the time , a good place to start is the company itself .
Whenever you fill out a warranty card , make a donation , or place an order for goods or services , there is a chance that company will sell your contact information .
You can ask them to mark your account so that your name is not traded or sold to other companies , though it ’s tough to be sure that they will comply .
A friend of mine back in college had a great trick for figuring out who was selling his information .
Any time he subscribed to a magazine or made an online purchase , he used a different middle name or initial .
He could then go back to the company that gave out his information and request that they keep his name and home address private .
Unfortunately , it seems almost impossible to completely stop junk mail from hitting your box .
Better than tossing it in the recycling bin , why not upcycle all of that unwanted paper into art ?
Shredded junk mail is also excellent for padding a box containing a fragile gift .
What else can you do to extend the life of your junk mail ?
( CNN ) -- Sen. Barack Obama on Sunday tried to paint Sen. John McCain as a candidate who is out of touch with the middle class .
Speaking about Friday 's presidential debate , Obama accused McCain of not addressing working families .
" We talked about the economy for 40 minutes , and not once did Sen .
McCain talk about the struggles that middle class families are facing every day , " Obama said at a campaign event in Detroit , Michigan .
The economy took the lead in Friday night 's presidential debate , as both candidates highlighted their plans to bring the United States out of what some are describing as the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression .
McCain on Sunday brushed off Obama 's latest line of attack , saying he has " bigger things to worry about . "
" Who does he think I was talking about when I said ' people on Main Street ' ?
Who did he think I was talking about , about the necessity of helping the American taxpayers and income -- and Americans who are out there working and trying to keep their jobs ? " he said on ABC's " This Week . "
" I 've got bigger things to worry about than that . "
The Republican presidential candidate did address " Main Street " in the debate Friday night , saying that " we 've got to fix the system " because " Main Street is paying a penalty for the excesses and greed in Washington , D.C. , and on Wall Street . "
Still , Obama 's campaign pointed out that McCain did n't specifically say " middle class , " during the debate .
McCain 's campaign said Sunday that during the Michigan event , Obama " ignored his [ Obama 's ] record of opposing middle class tax relief , opposing a competitive tax rate , and opposing a plan to incentivize new battery technology . "
The campaign said Obama 's " talk about the middle class is much different than his record . "
During the debate , McCain repeatedly said Obama " does n't understand " key issues the country is facing , but at campaign events this weekend , Obama blasted McCain as the candidate who " does n't get it . "
Watch the candidates ' plans for the upcoming week »
" The truth is , through 90 minutes of debating , John McCain had a lot to say about me , but he had nothing to say about you .
Not once did he say the words ' middle class . '
Not once did he talk about working families .
I think Sen. McCain just does n't get it , " Obama said Sunday .
The Obama - Biden campaign continues that argument in a new ad that will begin airing nationally on Monday .
The ad says when it comes to the economy , McCain " does n't get it . "
" Number of minutes in debate : 90 , " the announcer says as the words are typed across a blank screen .
" Number of times John McCain mentioned the middle class : Zero . "
The 30 - second spot , " Zero , " includes portions of Friday night 's debate where Obama suggested McCain has followed President Bush on economic policy .
Watch the ad »
A recent CNN / Opinion Research Corporation poll found when it comes to the economy , 47 percent of voters questioned said Republicans are more responsible for the current economic problems , while 24 percent said Democrats are more responsible .
In response to the latest ad , the McCain campaign blasted Obama 's tax policy .
" John McCain repeatedly pointed to Sen .
Obama 's vote in favor of higher taxes on families making just $ 42,000 a year , and his proposal for $ 860 billion in lavish new government spending which is a crushing burden on middle class families and the Main Street economy , " spokesman Tucker Bounds said in a statement Saturday .
" If he was honest , Barack Obama knows he was unable to debate the merits of supporting higher taxes on the middle class , and bloated government spending during a looming economic crisis -- it 's simply indefensible . "
The McCain campaign is referring to a June 5 , 2008 , vote on a resolution ( Senate Concurrent Resolution 70 ) meant to outline the Senate 's budget priorities through 2013 , but the measure had no practical effect .
According to a CNN review of the resolution , it assumes that most of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts pushed by President Bush will expire in that time , which McCain says amounts to a tax increase .
Obama and running mate Sen. Joe Biden voted " yes " on the resolution .
McCain did not vote .
However , the Democrats offered their own cuts in the 48 - page resolution , which called for several tax cuts and breaks , including rolling back the alternative - minimum tax and the so - called " marriage penalty . "
According to an analysis by the independent Tax Policy Center , the tax plan Obama has proposed during the campaign would increase taxes in 2009 on the wealthiest 20 percent of households , while offering tax cuts for the other 80 percent .
CNN 's Kristi Keck and Emily Sherman contributed to this report .

For a while now I ’ve thought that Scala would be a good language to write games in .
Well , I ’m putting those thoughts into practice : I resurrected a couple of old game ideas and am now working on a 2D game or two as hobby projects .
I decided that it would be a good idea to try my hand on simpler games before I embark on a longer project ( which will likely be a platformer ) , so the one I ’m working on now is something of a mix between Breakout and Peggle .
As part of writing those games , I ’m also designing a generic game entity system , which will be integrated with Slick2D ( for graphics , sound , input and other stuff ) and a Scala port of Box2D ( for collision detection and physics ) that I ’m also working on .
So far I am very pleased that I chose Scala for this project — the code is generally more concise than Java ( requiring roughly 2 times less lines ) , but what I like most is that traits , pattern matching plus some other features make Scala a great language for building components .
With the entity system I ’m trying to take full advantage of that , implementing the building blocks for entities as traits that deal with different concerns .
Some of these traits only define an interface for some type of behavior , but some also implement it , reducing the amount of code needed in concrete entities .
Here are some of the most basic traits I ’ve got implemented so far and descriptions of what they do :
Entity – the base trait for all my game entities , which extends Updateable , making it able to act on updates ( or “ ticks ” ) from the game engine during each frame .
PhysicalEntity – can be mixed into an entity class to add a physical body to an Entity , which takes part in the physics simulation and collision detection .
GraphicalEntity – adds a render method , which the entity can implement to render itself .
WithStates – for more complex entities that behave differently depending on their current state .
For example a camera in a sneaking game may have states “ Off ” and “ On ” .
In the Off state , the camera might not do anything , but in the On state it might be listening to some game events to react to seeing the player .
To do this , a specific state ( which are implemented as internal classes of the Entities ) could mix in the Updateable and / or EventListener traits to react to events differently when that state is active .
Additionally , defining state transitions can limit how the entity moves from one state to the other and allows to run some code when the state changes .
EventListener – an entity ( or one of its states ) with this trait will receive notifications of events it is interested in .
This can be used in other objects besides entities and states , but only the latter two are automatically registered as listeners in the event queue .
Environment – this is the container for entities , the physics world and the event queue .
This is not all , but these are the most basic building blocks .
Here is the code for a simple entity that makes use of some of these :
class Paddle extends PhysicalEntity with GraphicalEntity with EventListener with GameStateAware [ InGame ] { // we define the physical body for the PhysicalEntity val body Def = new BodyDef body Def.pos = ( 0,- 10 ) bodyDef.fixedRotation = true bodyDef.allowSleep = false // the radius at which the paddle moves around world center val radius = 10 // keeps track of the number of balls shot from the paddle and currently in play .
var ballsInPlay : Int = 0 def noBallsInPlay = ballsInPlay == 0 // we call a convenience method of the EventListener to listen to some specific kinds of events listenTo { case ce @ ContactResultEventBetween ( body1 , body2 ) => val other = if ( body1 == body ) body 2 else if ( body2 == body ) body 1 else null if ( other != null ) { gameState.scorer.hitPaddle(this , other.userData.asInstanceOf[PlayerBall ] ) PlayerBallSounds.hitPaddle.play } } // we override the function that is called when a PhysicalEntity is inserted into the world override def enterWorld ( w : World ) { super.enterWorld(w ) val shape = PolygonDef.box ( 1 , 0.1f ) shape.density = 0f body.createShape( shape ) } // define the render method to render the paddle ( currently just rendering the physical body as a placeholder ) def render ( g : Graphics ) = { import org.newdawn.slick.Color g.setColor(Color.white ) rendering .RenderUtils.renderBody(g , body ) } }
I am already pleased that I was able to separate the different basic concerns using Scala ’s traits and making them easily composable as seen above , but I hope that the real benefits should become apparent in a larger game with lots of different entities .
Mick
West talks about creating game entities as components in his blog post “ Evolve Your Hierarchy ” – I think he is right and that Scala ’s language support for this ( especially in the form of traits ) is better than in C++ or Java , where you could do something similar with inheritance , interfaces and object composition .
Note : I ’ve never been a professional game developer or even got to the point of releasing a hobby project to the wider audience so I ’m not speaking from reliable personal experience exactly , but I ’ve worked with a few entity systems and this just seems right to me .
I will post more about this in the future , hopefully after having released a simple game :) and I ’m considering releasing the code for the entity system under an open source license .
But the first rule of holes is that when you ’re in one , stop digging .
When you see how much modern infrastructure has been built in China since 2001 , under the banner of the Olympics , and you see how much infrastructure has been postponed in America since 2001 , under the banner of the war on terrorism , it ’s clear that the next seven years need to be devoted to nation - building in America .
We need to finish our business in Iraq and Afghanistan as quickly as possible , which is why it is a travesty that the Iraqi Parliament has gone on vacation while 130,000 U.S. troops are standing guard .
We can no longer afford to postpone our nation - building while Iraqis squabble over whether to do theirs .
A lot of people are now advising Barack Obama to get dirty with John McCain .
Sure , fight fire with fire .
That ’s necessary , but it is not sufficient .
Obama got this far because many voters projected onto him that he could be the leader of an American renewal .
They know we need nation - building at home now  not in Iraq , not in Afghanistan , not in Georgia , but in America .
Obama cannot lose that theme .
He cannot let Republicans make this election about who is tough enough to stand up to Russia or bin Laden .
It has to be about who is strong enough , focused enough , creative enough and unifying enough to get Americans to rebuild America .
The next president can have all the foreign affairs experience in the world , but it will be useless , utterly useless , if we , as a country , are weak .
Obama is more right than he knows when he proclaims that this is “ our ” moment , this is “ our ” time .
But it is our time to get back to work on the only home we have , our time for nation - building in America .
I never want to tell my girls  and I ’m sure Obama feels the same about his  that they have to go to China to see the future .
WASHINGTON 
The conservative group running advertisements that highlight Senator Barack Obama ’s association with the 1960s radical William Ayers is being financed by a Texas billionaire who has raised money for Senator John McCain and who also helped finance the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth campaign against Senator John Kerry in 2004 .
The billionaire , Harold Simmons , donated nearly $ 2.9 million on Aug. 12 to the American Issues Project , the group running the advertisements , papers it has filed with the Federal Election Commission show .
In 2004 , Mr. Simmons donated $ 2 million to the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth , whose advertisements against Mr. Kerry included one that , with allegations since discredited , impugned his military service as a Swift boat captain during the Vietnam War .
Mr. Simmons is also listed as a major fund - raiser for Mr. McCain , who repudiated the Swift boat advertisement questioning Mr. Kerry ’s service .
Efforts to reach Mr. Simmons after office hours Friday evening were unsuccessful .

For every great thing in the world , there are equivalents which are not so pleasant .
For every top - of - the - line cell phone model , there ’s one with the barest of features and will probably cause cancer !
For every wonderful , sparkling , luxurious resort , there ’s a beach near a crime - ridden area , filled with litter and an old house near it to rent .
And for every large airport filled with amenities and safety precautions , there are ones which are essentially an airstrip and a building .
Here are those airports that have earned the title of most dangerous in the world .
1. Lukla Airport , Nepal –
The people who attempt to climb Mount Everest know this place very well .
Renamed in January 2008 as Tenzing - Hillary airport , after the two men who first ascended the highest mountain in the world , this airport is where all Everest climber aspirants land to start their journey .
The runway is around half a kilometer long , 20 m wide , with an incline being a staggering 20 % !
With a 700 - meter drop on one end and a mountain in the other , and the airport being so high up , this is another added risk to adventurers .
There have been five recorded plane accidents .
Nevertheless , the people who do come here consider it as part of the risk they signed up for .
2. Courchevel , France – A ski area in the French Alps , it is the largest linked ski area in the world .
This is the first resort in France to be constructed from scratch , as opposed to the others which were built around an already existing village .
Courchevel ’s airport is infamous for having a short runway of around half a kilometer and a gradient of 18.5 % !
Pilots have to land on the higher incline to slow down enough , and takeoffs must be done towards the decline to pick up speed .
3. Juancho E. Yrausquin Airport , Saba –
The only airport in Saba , in the Caribbean , it is well - known to flyers because of the methods of landing and taking off for the small airport .
There have been no tragedies there , but it is still very dangerous .
One side has high hills while all the others drop into the sea .
The runway length is a bone - chilling 396 m , only allowing small aircraft and helicopters to land !
The tower is an advisory service only and does not provide air traffic control .
You also ca n’t refuel , so tough luck if you run out .
4. Princess Juliana International Airport , Saint Martin – A very busy airport in the Eastern Caribbean , it is a major gateway for other airports nearby .
Its runway of a little above two kilometers means that large jets have to fly low to land , and beachgoers at nearby Maho Beach are often treated to an up close and personal view of a big plane .
Signs are placed nearby so no unfortunate spotter would be blown back by any plane ’s powerful engines .
The ease of air travel allows lots of airports to pop up , including not so safe ones .
Been to any of these airports ?

Vermont Law School pretends to fight for equality
July 1 , 2008 by twitterpaters
by twit
How embarrassing .
For an institution with the motto “ law for the community and the world , ” one has to wonder why they are engaging in self - mutilation that flies in the face of the most deeply held principles of the school .
Vermont Law School has long opposed the “ do n’t ask do n’t tell ” military policy , which is a great thing .
They joined several schools in a lawsuit that went up to the United States Supreme Court , challenging the loss of federal funding that followed the refusal to permit military recruiters on campus .
And they lost in a unanimous decision by the Court .
The response by Vermont Law School is to continue to bar the military recruiters on campus .
Which means , according to the New York Times on June 30 , 2008 , that the school will not receive an estimated $ 300,000 to $ 500,000 in federal dollars each year that the ban continues .
The new dean expresses how proud he is to “ speak truth to power , ” and how great it is to sacrifice such an enormous amount of money for such a tiny school .
I suppose I should send my Vermont Law School diploma back in protest , because I do n’t want to display it anywhere if it means being associated with backward and destructive political action .
If that school taught me anything , it was to speak out against foolish policies that ultimately hinder the fight for equality .
I oppose the “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell ” policy and I think it is one of the most egregious aspects of Bill Clinton ’s legacy .
So I would much rather that Vermont Law School allow the recruiters onto campus , dig the huge rainbow flag out of storage , permit the students to protest like they have in the past and take the government ’s money .
Then use every penny of it funding the fight for equality .
The school could offer scholarships to students interested in the fight for equality and reforming military policy .
A clinic dedicated to fighting discrimination could be funded .
The paltry student loan repayment assistance offered by the school to graduates working in the public interest could be more than doubled , considering the school was only able to come up with $ 158,000 to allocate last year .
Vermont Law School did what it could to fight the issue in the legal arena and it lost .
Instead of creating opportunity for its students and promoting the fight for equality , it now falls on its own sword and cripples itself in that fight .
The short - sighted nature of this attempt to score the hollow political point seems like an incredible failure of leadership , one that is far more concerned with the appearance of taking a stand than actually getting anything done .

Woah !
Is Dick Cheney Satan or Is Seymour Hersh Insane ?
My money is on Dick the Devil .
Seymour Hersh , who I believe was the New Yorker writer who blew open the doors on Abu Ghraib ( right ? ) , has dropped another bombshell , claiming that , in a recent meeting in the Vice President ’s office , the guys tossed around some ideas as to how to provoke a war with Iran .
You know : Kill some Americans , start a war , make some money !
Hersh said :
There was a dozen ideas proffered about how to trigger a war .
The one that interested me the most was why do n’t we build — we in our shipyard — build four or five boats that look like Iranian PT boats .
Put Navy seals on them with a lot of arms .
And next time one of our boats goes to the Straits of Hormuz , start a shoot - up .
Might cost some lives .
And it was rejected because you ca n’t have Americans killing Americans .
That ’s the kind of — that ’s the level of stuff we ’re talking about .
Provocation .
But that was rejected .
That ’s some FDR Pearl Harbor shit there , son .
That ’s wicked evil .
And so not beyond Dick Nutz .

I have a challenge , developers .
I know you ’re reading .
I want a high profile , big budget , mainstream action game in which the player character is invincible .
I believe that the next truly great game will be the one that does this .
Games have come close .
There have obviously been infinite lives for many .
Mario , as he ages , becomes far more generous with his back - up existences – anyone who played Galaxy will know it was hard to have few than a few dozen laying around .
Then of course there ’s Quicksave , which creates an artificial invincibility , so long as you remember to hammer it frequently enough .
And perhaps the closest to the goal would be time travel , with games like Prince of Persia and Braid demonstrating that you can have a great deal more fun if you ’re not constantly condemned to death .
However , they ’re all still a significant distance from my desired goal .
I want a character who can not be harmed .
Impervious to bullets .
Unbothered by spikes .
Swinging blades ?
They bounce off him or her .
Falling from the top of a giant building ?
A nice , safe thud at the bottom .
This person , for whatever narrative reason , simply cannot die .
This of course does n’t mean he or she is otherwise supernatural .
A wall is still a wall , and if it cannot be broken , it can not be broken .
An impassable cliff face cannot be mysteriously ascended .
Swathes of enemies still impede progress , their blasts of laser fire sending you reeling backward .
And , most of all , actions can have consequences .
You may not die , but you can still regret .
I interject here for clarity – I ’m not talking about games where death changes nothing .
A regular MMO will bring you back to life with minimal penalty , your pre-death actions still seeing their results in the world ( well , to a point , clearly – the dragon you killed is probably alive again by now , but that had nothing to do with your demise ) .
But if anything , an MMO kills you far more often , and in far more ways , than most games , lacking the rescuing Quickload .
We ’re talking about a game in which you never , ever die .
This is n’t just some peculiar fantasy of mine .
There ’s a purpose behind this challenge .
Imagine the difference it would make to a game ’s design .
Imagine the old , reliable themes that would no longer be there to keep a weak scene buoyant .
Imagine how inconvenient it would be to the average action game if falling down a hole was n’t a way to kill you .
Of course Prince of Persia deserves another mention here .
When Sands Of Time was first revealed in Montreal in 2003 , I was one of a group of journalists staring slack - jawed at the screen in sheer wonder at the painful obviousness of it .
This did n’t happen when we were first shown it on the big screen .
It looked nice there , but it did n’t yet make sense .
It was when we were sat down to play it for ourselves .
The idea for rewinding time came to producer Yannis Mallat while he was in the shower .
It was an idea so good that when PoP creator Jordan Mechner heard it , he moved himself and his family to Canada , so he could oversee the game .
These are big , important moments .
It ’s time for another .
I was playing Sands of Time that day for quite a while before I used the sand .
PoP ’s excellent acrobatics were instinctive and simple , letting me perform superb moves without much trouble .
But then I messed up a big jump , and watched as I fell to my death .
Years of ingrained training had taught my immediate reaction :
Oh crap , when did I last save ?
How much will I have to do again .
I hate it when … wait a second .
And I jabbed the Rewind button and watched my error so beautifully undo itself before me .
I can’t capture that moment for you , but I can show you this :
That sort of thing .
But then you run out of sand .
The glass goes empty , and some big , stupid baddy twats you with a sword , and you ’re gone .
At that point that Rewind button becomes accursed .
You hit it , despite knowing it wo n’t do anything .
You hammer at it uselessly , watching the stupid , dead Prince slump to the ground .
Think of any first - person shooter .
In fact , do n’t .
Think of Half - Life 2 Episodes .
Valve make their games in a much discussed ( and yet all too often ignored by the developing community against all reason ) way – they playtest the code with outsiders every single week of development , the dev team forced to watch helplessly as Joe Public haplessly fumbles with the current build .
They take notes , noticing when the player gets stuck , when they stare in confusion at a wall for fifteen minutes , when they get lost , and most of all , when it ’s not clear what they should be doing next .
They then go back into their game knowing exactly what needs work .
They reiterate , and refine , and the result is games that glide like a buttery penguin on an ice rink .
Valve take this even further .
After Episode
One was released , their frightening Steam - based spybots noticed that many players were getting horribly stuck in the car tunnels .
People were dying down there an awful lot , and as a result , very many just gave up on the game at that point .
It ’s Valve ’s desire that people see all of the game they made ( despite already having that person ’s money , which is quite nice ) , so they released an update that made the sequence simpler .
People preferred the game , and far more people went on to complete it .
I do n’t say this to celebrate Valve , although certainly I think they deserve it in this instance .
I say it because it so helpfully demonstrates that people do n’t want to die over and over again .
Difficult sections in games are a good thing .
Dying because it ’s difficult is not .
And that ’s my challenge .
I want games to get more difficult because they are more challenging , not because they are more deadly .
In my utopia , cranking the difficulty level at the beginning of a new game would not increase the number of enemies intent on your death , or weaken your defences to their attacks , but rather make the game more challenging .
And I think the best proof of this would be the first developer to create a game in which you simply cannot die .
Let me be clear .
I am in no way talking about simplifying games .
A badly implemented understanding of Valve ’s iteration process could lead to a stupefyingly easy game , which does n’t kill you simply because you ’d have to actively seek out death and jump into it .
My challenge is to make a game that ’s every bit as involved , frightening , imposing and impactful as the best action games out there , but without being able to dangle the scythe of Death over your head .
Imagine what would have to happen .
Removing the overly familiar would force a developer to think in brand new ways .
People would n’t be fooled by a lousy physics puzzle every fifteen steps , they ’d want a lot more .
Think of what new , inspired scenarios we ’d encounter to push us to our gaming limits , without their relying on wearing away at my life bar .
Do n’t ask me what they would be – that ’s not my problem !
There are amazing , imaginative minds in this industry whose job it is to invent such things .
Minds
I argue that are n’t being exercised , because of the gaming default of , “ Oh , just make it hard not to die in this bit . ”
So who ’s going to take me up on this ?
Make a pledge .
Pledge to be the developer who will set out to make this breakthrough .
Bob Chapman | June 25 , 2008
The Conference Board 's consumer confidence index for June came in at an abysmal 50.4 .
This reading is down 13.25 % from May 's 58.1 , is less than half of last June 's 103.9 and is the lowest reading in 16 years .
The " experts " were expecting 56.5 .
And then there is the index of consumers ' expectations for the future , which hit an all - time low , declining 13.31 % to 41.0 in June from 47.3 in May .
Seventy percent of our economy is driven by consumer spending .
This simple set of facts tells the whole story .
It is a certifiable disaster in the making .
Next , let 's not forget the hundreds of billions in yearly home equity extractions that have all but completely dried up .
Add in the next bubble to break , consumer credit , where people with no savings have lived paycheck to stagnant paycheck amid 12.625 % inflation , thereby forcing them to exhaust available lines of credit just to keep from going under , and you move beyond disaster into a nightmarish , catastrophic , systemic breakdown of epic proportions worldwide .
The US supertanker economy has been afloat on a maelstrom of money and credit that has carried it into the rocks of hyper - stagflation , dollar destruction and fiscal profligacy as its occupants listened to the siren song of globalization , free trade , off - shoring , outsourcing and both legal and illegal immigration .
The gaping holes in the hull can not be patched .
The supertanker is taking on water faster than Ben the Buck - Buster Bernanke can bail it out with his 1930 's retro bailouts of banks and non -banks alike .
The Fed and Congress have created a financial monster that threatens to blow oil prices into the ozone , the economy down into the earth 's core and a mountain of derivatives , now closing in on a notional value of a quadrillion dollars , into an inter- dimensional wormhole where no one is quite sure what will happen , but whatever it is will have negative cosmic implications for markets around the globe .
Consider the following when deciding whether the Fed can raise its funds rate :
The FDIC insured banks in 2007 had net income of $ 105.5 billion , a very poor return of .86 % on their collective assets , which are in the $ 12 to $ 13 trillion range .
Most of those assets are in bonds , derivatives and various types of consumer and commercial debt , with a smattering in stocks and customer deposits .
The market values of these assets are interest rate sensitive .
Rising rates reduce bond , derivative and debt principal , cause losses for those on the wrong side of interest rate swaps , bring stock markets down due to economic tightening and raise customer expectations concerning rates of return for money on deposit .
Each .25 % rate hike could potentially impact US banking 's $ 12 to $ 13 trillion asset structure with yearly losses and write - downs of about 30 billion dollars ( .0025 x 12 trillion ) resulting from reduced asset values and increased costs .
In addition , the Fed is floating and rolling over about $ 400 billion a month in money and credit to keep the banking fraudsters from imploding , and that could mean a decrease in profits from reduced spreads on the magnitude of a billion per year for the system as a whole .
Remember , due to fear of default , insolvency and a lack of confidence and transparency , banks are hoarding and investing their money instead of re-lending it , so the fractional reserve multiplier is not working and banks are profiting from spreads between returns on their investments and the cost of money used to make those investments .
This is one of the major reasons that commodities have gone wild .
The commodities markets are the only places left where investors can make a profit with little downside compared to other markets , and this is where big financial institutions are exploiting the Enron loophole to manipulate markets and increase spreads .
The other big driver of prices for commodities is the declining value of the dollar .
So if the Fed hikes its funds rate twice by .25 % , the losses and write - downs for US banking could be over $ 60 billion , which would wipe out about 57 % of last year 's gains .
Note that due to whopping subprime losses , in Q4 for 2007 , banks only netted $ 600 million , while in Q1 for 2008 , they netted only $ 19.3 billion .
This means that $ 60 + billion in losses and write - downs could result in a complete wipe - out of the banking sector .
And never mind the hundreds of billions of losses that have already accrued but have not yet been recognized due to " creative accounting " methods that have been allowed by regulators to buy the fraudsters more time .
And never mind the gargantuan negative impact on real estate markets which might result from higher mortgage rates for purchases and refinances , such as defaults going up , sales going down and real estate prices dropping into the toilet , along with collateral values for assets securing real estate backed bonds and derivatives a /k / a toxic waste .
And never mind the ever - increasing losses from ever - accelerating defaults in consumer credit like credit card balances , car loans and student loans .
And never mind what could happen to those financial institutions on the wrong end of interest rate swaps and credit default swaps if hundreds of banks get vaporized .
This year and next , there might not be any retained earnings of any kind that might otherwise have been available to support deteriorating capital positions .
Note how substantially lower rates have failed to increase banking sector profits due to massive losses in real estate toxic waste derivatives .
And now we hear inane jawboning about rate increases .
You just can't make this stuff up .
Next , Wednesday 's FOMC meeting will produce no change in the funds rate with more jawboning about concern for inflation and the need for a strong dollar policy .
This duplicitous Fed - speak will be blathered into the ears of investors solely to suppress gold and silver prices , with odds increasing for two .25 % rate hikes by year end , rate hikes that will probably never materialize .
How laughable .
Raising the Fed funds rate to support the dollar at this point would be tantamount to committing national economic suicide .
The Fed cut too fast and has now waited far too long to achieve any positive impact by raising rates , especially by such miniscule amounts .
Our inflation is quickly approaching the peaks of 1980 - 1981 of around 14 % to 15 % , with about two percent left to go .
At that time , Paul Volcker raised the Fed funds rate in large leaps to the 17 % to 20 % range during the last quarter of 1980 and the first three quarters of 1981 .
That is the magnitude of rates that would be necessary to control the type of inflation we are currently experiencing , and we hear from the fane - stream media that the Fed is " talking tough " which the markets translate into about two .25 % rate hikes before yearend to a total of 2.5 % .
This transpires as M3 continues to ride high at 17 % .
Excuse us if we seem a bit skeptical that these miniscule rate hikes would do the slightest bit of good to quell inflation and support the dollar .
This is nothing short of surreal .
Of course , the Fed 's and the government 's lies have boxed them in .
How can you raise the Fed funds rate into double digits when you claim that official inflation is a little over 4 % ?
How would that be for racking up losses to your credibility ?
Rate hikes could start off a new round of risk reassessment as inflation puts bonds and treasuries into negative rates of return and as rampant defaults across the board make bond investors gun-shy .
This could trigger a bear market in bonds that could take the whole system down as losses from eroding bond principal would reach levels of magnitude that would be irreparable regardless of what the Fed might do .
Even the Fed cannot resurrect the dead .
Theoretically , the entire banking system could be wiped out without a single bank remaining solvent , not even the Fed .
The entire financial world would become one giant bankruptcy court .
The Illuminists would be at all the auctions picking up all the choicest assets for pennies on the dollar , using the thousands of metric tonnes of gold and silver they have secretly hidden away offshore and in Switzerland to provide the necessary funds in the event the dollar completely collapsed .
Gold and silver would be somewhere in intergalactic space headed for the Einstein DeSitter radius at the outermost bounds of the visible universe .
The value of secret Illuminist gold and silver holdings might be valued in the tens of trillions as gold blew past the five figure boundary .
You have to love watching market activity these days .
Every day we get another Hail Mary pass as the stock markets threaten to collapse .
The NFL should sign the PPT players on as clutch quarterbacks .
Note how on Monday , there was no change in the Dow after it was down most of the day .
Monday 's close and this past Friday 's close were within a fraction of a point from one another .
Then on Tuesday , as soon as the Dow went about 15 points past the previous recent closing low of 11,740.15 set on March 10 , out came the anti-gravity machine to propel the Dow straight up almost 180 points in an hour and a half only to bomb 100 points near the end to close at 11,807.43 .
Yet our Fed Head repeatedly tells us that the weasels who comprise the President 's Working Group on Financial Markets ( a/k / a the PPT ) meet only occasionally for discussion purposes only .
Your nose is growing again , Pinocchio !
With the yen being relatively weak compared to recent highs and precious metals holding strong between 850 and 900 , the cartel is boxed in .
If they strengthen the yen to hit precious metals , the stock markets will breach their recent lows and go down in flames like the Hindenberg into a bottomless pit .
If they weaken the yen even further to support the stock markets , the newly found liquidity will be plowed into precious metals as a hedge , as a safe - haven and as the only profitable market left on the face of the planet along with other industrial and agricultural commodities as hyperinflation destroys everything in its path worldwide , sucking economies around the globe past its event horizon and into its black hole singularity where nothing can escape its crushing gravitational pull .
Only gold and silver can survive the black hole .
The USDX had a similar experience to the Dow , as another miracle propelled the USDX leading contract ( September ) to 73.935 , just short of 74 , before it collapsed again to close at 73.60 .
It has continued its descent in the early going on Wednesday , and is around 73.2 as of early Wednesday ahead of the FOMC meeting .
This is exactly what happened in December open interest on the USDX dropped dramatically and as the dollar started a slow motion collapse to sub - 71 from just under 78 over the course of 3 months .
There is not a single fundamental supporting the dollar unless you want to consider government intervention as a fundamental .
Ted Butler has come to the conclusion that the naked short - selling on the GLD and SLV ETF's is being used by the big COMEX players to support their shorts in gold and silver futures by suppressing precious metals prices without having to run up gold and silver prices by buying physical gold and silver ( or by buying ETF shares the proceeds from which would then be used to purchase physical bullion ) to cover their shorts .
Such nefarious and totally illegal trading activities are the most rampant in the silver ETF due to worldwide silver shortages .
But we believe it goes much further than this .
The tip - off is the outrageously low lease rates , some of which for silver are even negative , meaning that you will be paid by the elitists to lease their silver .
Under IMF rules , which apply to the international banks acting as ETF custodians such as Barclays and HSBC , leased precious metals can still be carried on their books as if they still owned them outright even though such metals have been leased to another institutional investor .
No notation about the lease on its financial statements is required ( there are new rules that would require such a notation , but the new rules are optional and few have opted to follow them ) .
This might hold true whether or not Barclay 's or HSBC 's bullion holdings as custodians are segregated from their regular bullion reserves , and it all boils down to the way they perform their accounting .
In general , no one audits the physical bullion reserves of these elitist banks to see if they are all accounted for or checks to see if reserves have been leased or otherwise encumbered .
They simply check to see if the paperwork inventorying the physical reserves in terms of number of ounces and serial numbers matches up with what is shown on the statements .
This failure to inspect , assay and audit physical reserves or to check for leases or other encumbrances on the bullion occurs either because such information is not required for financial statements or because the auditors look the other way when told to do so by the elitists .
So what could be happening here is that these ETF pools of gold and silver bullion might be leased out for next - to - nothing to the commercial gold and silver shorts on the COMEX to help them cover their shorts .
When gold and silver go on a tear , this leased bullion is then sold in large quantities , just enough to trigger the stops which have been set by the large specs , which the elitist - owned commercials know perfectly having all the inside information they want from our corrupt government which has the best regulators that money can buy .
When these sharp sell - offs occur , the commercials and market - makers often withhold their bids until the stops are triggered in order to minimize the amount of physical bullion that must be sold to trigger the stops .
This is why we keep seeing sharp sell - offs , in our opinion .
After the leased gold and silver has been sold rapidly and publicly , it could then be bought back slowly to keep the price from rising back to previous highs , and would then be returned to the ETF custodian pursuant to the lease and the serial numbers would be updated .
Or to keep the serial numbers the same and prevent a run-up in price , the commercials could publicly sell their leased bullion to a straw elitist buyer , and then buy back the same leased bullion in a private off - the - market sale from that same straw buyer .
Or it may well be that the bullion is still missing from the ETF , but that no one knows because it has not been properly audited .
Do you find these types of illegal dealings hard to believe ?
Do n't .
The players in the cartel are first order reprobates and sociopaths .
They are criminals and they think they are above the law because their Illuminist handlers own the courts .
Do not look at the world of gold , silver and commodities through rose - colored glasses , or you will have your derriere handed to you on a platter .
The banks on Wall Street and their international counterparts are arrogant , and they are liars .
The subprime debacle most certainly should clue you in on that much .
Without having a full , independent , audit and accounting , including the inventory and assaying of physical bullion , ETF investors have no way of knowing what the true ownership status is for the bullion that supposedly secures their ETF shares .
Otherwise , you are just taking the bank 's word for it , and if so , may we suggest that to do so is very dangerous indeed .
Perhaps you 'd prefer to compete with the auction rate bondholders as the dupes of the century ?
They were told that their investment was AAA and as good as cash .
How would you like to be in their shoes ?
Just keep pumping your money into the ETF 's and you may soon join them .
Functional Netlists , Sungwoo Park , Jinha Kim , Hyeonseung Im. ICFP 2008 .
In efforts to overcome the complexity of the syntax and the lack of formal semantics of conventional hardware description languages , a number of functional hardware description languages have been developed .
Like conventional hardware description languages , however , functional hardware description languages eventually convert all source programs into netlists , which describe wire connections in hardware circuits at the lowest level and conceal all high - level descriptions written into source programs .
We develop a variant of the lambda calculus , called l- lambda ( linear lambda ) , which may serve as a high - level substitute for netlists .
In order to support higher - order functions , l- lambda uses a linear type system which enforces the linear use of variables of function type .
The translation of l-lambda into structural descriptions of hardware circuits is sound and complete in the sense that it maps expressions only to realizable hardware circuits and that every realizable hardware circuit has a corresponding expression in l-lambda .
To illustrate the use of l- lambda as a high - level substitute for netlists , we design a simple hardware description language that extends l with polymorphism , and use it to implement a Fast Fourier Transform circuit .
Given the recent discussion about hardware synthesis languages , the appearance of this paper seems timely .
The use of linear types is perhaps unsurprising from a technical point of view , but it 's surprising when you consider how frequently and in how many different contexts they appear .
Also , one thing I do n't understand : there 's apparently a difference between a " hardware description language " and a " hardware synthesis language " .
If anyone could explain what the difference means , I 'd appreciate it . :)

I ’m having a bad day .
A real bad day .
So this is what you get , folks : a list of my top 10 favorite swearing movies .
Be it a memorable scene , or an overall , total badass bout of creative cursing , these 10 films popped in my head tonight as I sit here in a terrible funk .
The best thing about swearing ?
It ’s liberating .
It feels good to get out of your system , and it ’s even better when it ’s loud .
Anyway , if you are easily offended , skip this list .
If you think a list of “ bad ” words ( which ironically are in constant flux , and always will be as culture changes ) will create “ bad ” people , then you need serious help .
I believe there is a time and place for this kind of language , and for me — right here — that time is now .
Enjoy my list of memorable cursing in the movies .
Or fuck off .
10 . E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial ( 1982 )
This movie may have only one memorable swearing scene in it , but for any adolescent growing up in the 80s , the moment where Elliot calls his brother “ penis breath ” at the dinner table was a big freaking deal .
This is a kid-oriented , PG , Steven Spielberg - directed fantasy film , mind you .
That word ( or those two , out together ) was about as shocking as it was confusing .
Why would anyone have penis breath , I thought ?
All good things must come to an end , of course , so in 2002 , when Spielberg Lucas - ized “ E.T ” for another home video release , he released a version without the offending word .
( Also gone ?
His Mom scolds him on Halloween for dressing like a hippie in stead of “ a terrorist , ” FBI agents guns are replaced with less - scary walkie - talkies , and E.T.s lips re matched digitally to his mouth . )
Make sure you know which DVD you ’re getting before you buy this one .
Or just watch it here ( at 6:30 ) .
Michael : Maybe an elf or a leprechaun .
Elliot :
It was nothing like that , penis breath !
9. Glengarry Glen Ross ( 1992 )
This David Mamet - written movie , adapted from his own play , was jokingly referred to by its excellent cast ( Al Pacino , Kevin Spacey , Jack Lemmon , Ed Harris , Alan Arkin , Alec Baldwin , Jonathan Pryce ) as “ Death of a Fucking Salesman . ”
The inner-workings of a sad and desperate real - estate office have never been so electrifying .
Mamet ’s dialogue crackles like the foul - mouthed poetry it is .
This is a movie acted by actors who know how to swear — they know how to get every bit of mileage out of each word .
But it ’s also about the words around it , and how they can cut someone down to size in a second .
Watch it .
Blake :
You got leads .
Mitch & Murray paid good money .
Get their names to sell them .
You ca n’t close the leads you ’re given , you ca n’t close shit , you are shit , hit the bricks pal , and beat it , ’ cause you are going out .
Levene :
The leads are weak .
Blake : “ The leads are weak . ”
The fucking leads are weak ?
You ’re weak .
I ’ve been in this business fifteen years …
Ross :
What ’s your name ?
Blake : Fuck you .
That ’s my name .
You know why , mister ?
‘ Cause you drove a Hyundai to get here tonight , I drove an eighty thousand dollar BMW .
That ’s my name .
8. Reservoir Dogs ( 1992 )
Tarantino ’s first has a “ fucks per minute ” score of 2.69 , which is pretty dam impressive .
But what ’s really impressive is that , like Mamet , he ’s able to take the foul - mouthed lingo of his criminal protagonists and twist it up so that it sounds fresh and new .
Of course , he gave himself one of the most memorable bouts of dialogue in the entire film , which was also shocking for its realistic violence ( especially the part where Michael Madsen slices off a man ’s ear ) .
Here ’s Tarantino finding his writing “ voice ” — pioneering the use of silly pop culture references coming from big tough guys in movies and mixing it up with as many curse words as possible :
Mr. Brown :
Let me tell you what ‘ Like a Virgin ’ is about .
It ’s all about a girl who digs a guy with a big dick .
The entire song .
It ’s a metaphor for big dicks .
Mr. Blonde : No , no .
It ’s about a girl who is very vulnerable .
She ’s been fucked over a few times .
Then she meets some guy who ’s really sensitive …
Mr. Brown : Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa… Time out Green Bay .
Tell that fucking bullshit to the tourists .
Joe : Toby …
Who the fuck is Toby ?
Toby …
Mr. Brown : ‘ Like a Virgin ’ is not about this nice girl who meets a nice fella .
That ’s what “ True Blue ” is about , now , granted , no argument about that .
Mr. Orange :
Which one is ‘ True Blue ’ ?
Nice Guy Eddie : ‘ True Blue ’ was a big ass hit for Madonna .
I do n’t even follow this Tops In Pops shit , and I ’ve at least heard of “ True Blue ” .
Mr. Orange : Look , asshole , I did n’t say I ai n’t heard of it .
All I asked was how does it go ?
Excuse me for not being the world ’s biggest Madonna fan .
Mr. Orange : Personally , I can do without her .
Mr. Blue : I like her early stuff .
You know , ‘ Lucky Star ’ , ‘ Borderline ’ – but once she got into her ‘ Papa Do n’t Preach ’ phase , I do n’t know , I tuned out .
Mr. Brown :
Hey , you guys are making me lose my … train of thought here .
I was saying something , what was it ?
Joe : Oh , Toby was this Chinese girl , what was her last name ?
Mr. White :
What ’s that ?
Joe : I found this old address book in a jacket I ai n’t worn in a coon ’s age .
What was that name ?
Mr. Brown :
What the fuck was I talking about ?
Mr. Pink :
You said ‘ True Blue ’ was about a nice girl , a sensitive girl who meets a nice guy , and that ‘ Like a Virgin ’ was a metaphor for big dicks .
Mr. Brown : Lemme tell you what ‘ Like a Virgin ’ is about .
It ’s all about this cooze who ’s a regular fuck machine , I ’m talking morning , day , night , afternoon , dick , dick , dick , dick , dick , dick , dick , dick , dick .
Mr. Blue :
How many dicks is that ?
Mr. White : A lot .
Mr. Brown :
Then one day she meets this John Holmes motherfucker and it ’s like , whoa baby , I mean this cat is like Charles Bronson in the ‘ Great Escape ’ , he ’s digging tunnels .
Now , she ’s gettin ’ the serious dick action and she ’s feeling something she ain’t felt since forever .
Pain .
Pain .
Joe : Chew ?
Toby Chew ?
Mr. Brown :
It hurts her .
It should n’t hurt her , you know , her pussy should be Bubble Yum by now , but when this cat fucks her it hurts .
It hurts just like it did the first time .
You see the pain is reminding a fuck machine what it once was like to be a virgin .
Hence , ‘ Like a Virgin ’ .
Joe : Wong ?
7. The Big Lebowski ( 1998 )
260 “ fucks ” in less than two hours is n’t a record , but for some reason the cursing in this movie , mostly bellowed at top volume to Donny ( Steve Buscemi ) by John Goodman , has really caught on with audiences .
It ’s no secret that “ The Big Lebowski ” is a modern cult classic ; it ’s just that I personally have never gotten out of it what everybody else does apparently .
Either way , its legacy in swearing is too huge to ignore .
Many will find this way too low on this list , but as one of the Coen brothers ’ weakest efforts ( second maybe only to “ The Ladykillers ” ) , you ’re lucky it ’s on here at all .
It probably would n’t be if it was n’t for this terrific little fan film : Watch “ The Fucking Short Version of The Big Lebowksi , ” a two - minute edited version of the movie ’s highlights .
Walter Sobchak : I told those fucks down at the league office a thousand times that I do n’t roll on Shabbos !
Donny : What ’s Shabbos ?
Walter Sobchak : Saturday , Donny , is Shabbos , the Jewish day of rest .
That means that I do n’t work , I do n’t get in a car , I do n’t fucking ride in a car , I do n’t pick up the phone , I do n’t turn on the oven , and I sure as shit do n’t fucking roll !
Shomer shabbos !
The Dude : Walter …
Walter Sobchak : Shomer fucking shabbos .
The Dude : Oh fuck it .
I ’m out of here .
6. Planes , Trains , and Automobiles ( 1987 )
I think we ’ve all had a moment like this before .
When Steve Martin ’s weary traveler Neal Page is at the end of his rope trying to get home for Thanksgiving , he goes to a car rental agency and is greeted with the sweetest fake smile ever , from none other than the terrific Edie McClurg ( who you ’ve seen a million times before but probably never known her name ) .
I could blabber on about how great this scene is , but I think it speaks for itself .
19 “ fucks ” in just over a minute .
Read below or watch here ( start at 2:24 ) .
Car Rental Agent : [ cheerfully ]
Welcome to Marathon , may I help you ?
Neal : Yes .
Car Rental Agent : How may I help you ?
Neal :
You can start by wiping that fucking dumb-ass smile off your rosey , fucking , cheeks !
Then you can give me a fucking automobile : a fucking Datsun , a fucking Toyota , a fucking Mustang , a fucking Buick !
Four fucking wheels and a seat !
Car Rental Agent : I really do n’t care for the way you ’re speaking to me .
Neal :
And I really do n’t care for the way your company left me in the middle of fucking nowhere with fucking keys to a fucking car that is n’t fucking there .
And I really did n’t care to fucking walk down a fucking highway and across a fucking runway to get back here to have you smile in my fucking face .
I want a fucking car RIGHT FUCKING NOW !
Car Rental Agent : May I see your rental agreement ?
Neal : I threw it away .
Car Rental Agent : Oh boy .
Neal :
Oh boy , what ?
Car Rental Agent :
You ’re fucked .
5. Full Metal Jacket ( 1987 )
This Stanley Kubrick movie would be higher on the list if it were n’t for the fact that R. Lee Ermey ended up making an entire career out of parodying the creatively foul - mouthed drill sergeant that he so perfected here .
The 99 credits on his imdb list are filled with character names like “ Sergeant , ” “ Drill Sergeant , ” “ General Wallace , ” “ General Barnarky , ” “ Colonel O’Malley , ” “ Colonel Ben Wilder , ” and “ Army Sarge ” — even , intriguingly — “ General Puddles . ”
Even still , it ’s hard to shake the fierce performance he gave in “ Full Metal Jacket , ” harassing poor Private Pyle ( Vincent D’Onofrio ) to do something rash but not wholly unexpected .
Ermey took trash - talking to a new level in this one .
Gunnery Sergeant Hartman : Who said that ?
Who the fuck said that ?
Who ’s the slimy little communist shit , twinkle - toed cocksucker down here who just signed his own death warrant ?
Nobody , huh ?
The fairy fucking godmother said it .
Out - fucking - standing .
I will PT you all until you fucking die .
I ’ll PT you until your assholes are sucking buttermilk .
Gunnery Sergeant Hartman :
Are you quitting on me ?
Well , are you ?
Then quit , you slimy fucking walrus - looking piece of shit !
Get the fuck off of my obstacle !
Get the fuck down off of my obstacle !
Now !
Move it !
I ’m going to rip your balls off so you cannot contaminate the rest of the world !
I will motivate you , Private Pyle , IF IT SHORT - DICKS EVERY CANNIBAL ON THE CONGO !
4. Clerks ( 1994 )
Kevin Smith ’s no-budget , black - and - white debut was originally rated NC - 17 for — get this — language .
That ’s it .
No violence , no nudity , just bad words .
Miramax hired civil liberties lawyer Alan Dershowitz to appeal the decision , and the MPAA relented and re-rated the film with an R rating .
Ironically , the MPAA did so without altering a single frame or word of the picture .
What was so groundbreaking about this film is that the characters talked like real people of the time .
Well , OK , admittedly , they said shit out loud that most people were only thinking , but that is what made it so much fun .
The amount of memorable scenes with swearing are too many too mention , but let ’s just say that the number 37 will always have a special place in my heart .
Read below or watch here .
Jay : I feel good today , Silent Bob , we ’re gonna make some money , then you know what we ’re going to do ?
We ’re gonna go to that party , we ’re gonna get some pussy , and I ’m gonna fuck this bitch , I ’ma fuck this bitch , I ’ll fuck ANYTHING THAT MOVES !
Yo , what the fuck you lookin ’ at , I ’ll kick your fuckin’ ass !
Shit yeah .
Does n’t that fucker owe me 10 bucks ?
You know , fuckin ’ tonight , we ’re gonna rip off this fucker ’s head , and take out his fuckin’ soul .
Remind me if he tries to buy something , I ’m gonna shit in the motherfucker ’s bag .
Hey , what ’s up baby ?
What ’s up , sluts ?
3. South Park : Bigger , Longer & Uncut ( 1999 )
Trey Parker and Matt Stone undoubtedly have the most unique combinations of curse words and animal references ever .
The great thing about all the swearing in the “ South Park ” movie is that it exists for parents and censors to be horrified at , while also showing what terrible hypocrites people are who think that mere “ dirty ” words are more damaging than truly dangerous ideas .
Read below or watch here .
Kyle :
You ca n’t say “ fuck ” in school , you fucking fat ass !
Mr. Garrison : Kyle !
Cartman :
Why the fuck not ?
Mr. Garrison : Eric !
Stan : Dude , you just said “ fuck ” again !
Mr. Garrison : Stanley !
Kenny : Fuck !
Mr. Garrison : Kenny !
Cartman :
What ’s the big deal ?
It does n’t hurt anybody .
Fuck - fuckety - fuck - fuck - fuck .
Mr. Garrison :
How would you like to go see the school counselor ?
Cartman :
How would you like to suck my balls ?
Mr. Garrison :
What did you say ?
Cartman : I ’m sorry , I ’m sorry .
Actually , what I said was …
[ picks up a megaphone ]
Cartman : HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO SUCK MY BALLS , MR .
GARRISON ?
Stan :
Holy shit , dude .
2. Goodfellas ( 1990 )
Technically , Martin Scorsese ’s “ Casino ” has 98 more “ f ” words in it , but it ’s way longer and nowhere near as good as this , one of the definitive mob movies of all time .
According to imdb.com , “ fuck ” is used 296 times in “ Goodfellas , ” for an average of 2.04 fucks per minute .
I may be wrong , but if I were a betting man , I ’d bet that most of those came from Best Supporting Actor winner Joe Pesci ( no stranger to Scorsese ’s world , having “ fucked ” up “ Raging Bull ” ) .
Rotten language is used so often in “ Goodfellas ” that , spoken by Pesci and an all - star cast such as Robert Deniro and Ray Liotta , it begins to develop its own cadence .
As it gets repeated , the effect is dulling and it is more than just “ swearing ” — it becomes another essential part of the setting .
Jimmy Conway :
What ’s the fuckin’ matter with you ?
What – what is the fuckin’ matter with you ?
What are you , stupid or what ?
Tommy , Tommy , I ’m kidding with you .
What the fuck are you doin ’ ?
What are you , a fuckin’ sick maniac ?
Tommy DeVito :
How am I meant to know you ’re kidding ?
What you mean , you ’re kidding ?
You breaking my fuckin’ balls ?
Jimmy Conway : I ’m fuckin’ kidding with you !
You fuckin’ shoot the guy ?
Henry Hill :
He ’s dead .
Tommy DeVito : Good shot .
What do you want from me ?
Good shot .
Fuckin’ rat anyway .
His family ’s all rats .
He ’ll grow up to be a rat .
Jimmy Conway :
You stupid bastard , I ca n’t fuckin’ believe you .
Now , you ’re gonna dig the fuckin’ thing now .
You ’re gonna dig the hole .
You ’re gonna do it .
I got no fuckin’ lime .
You ’re gonna do it .
Tommy DeVito :
Who the fuck cares ?
I ’ll dig the fuckin’ hole .
I do n’t give a fuck .
What is it , the first hole I dug ?
Not the first time I dug a hole .
I ’ll fuckin’ dig a hole .
Where are the shovels ?
1. The Exorcist ( 1973 )
From the dulling sensation of “ Goodfellas ” to as shocking as language can get — it ’s “ The Exorcist . ”
What could be more offensive than rampant blasphemy ?
For shocking and really horrifying swearing , nobody beats the shit that came out of little Linda Blair ’s mouth in one of the scariest movies of all time .
First , it was shocking to hear the mouth of a sailor on a 12 - year - old girl .
Secondly , it was shocking because she was possessed by the Devil , who felt very real and very powerful due to a methodical buildup of suspense from director William Friedkin and the growly , backwards - taped Satanic voice that overtook her .
Thirdly , did I mention that her head spun around on her neck like a Sit ‘n Spin ?
She tells the men of the cloth what they can do with their cross , that ’s for sure .
I never thought anyone could talk like that when I saw this movie as a kid and I never wanted to hear it again , frankly .
Father Merrin : I cast you out !
Unclean Spirt !
Regan :
Shove it up your ass , you faggot !
Father Merrin :
In the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ !
It is he who commands you !
It is he who flung you from the gates of Heaven to the depths of Hell !
Regan : Fuck Him !
Father Merrin : Be gone …
Regan : Fuck Him , Karras !
Fuck Him !
Father Merrin : … from this creature of God !
Regan :
Your mother sucks cocks in Hell , Karras , you faithless slime .

Sembra che la task force del Marketing di T - Mobile e Google abbiano elaborato una strategia sopraffina per montare curiosita ' e clamore crescenti .
Beh non li si puo incolpare , devono guadagnarsi la pagnotta ( quando parliamo di pagnotta per il marketing parliamo di sfilatini a 6 cifre .. ) , rendendo un nuovo prodotto attraente e convincere i potenziali acquirenti che le loro vie non hanno significato se perdono l'opportunita ' di comprare il telefonino " definitivo " .
Ma , il T - Mobile G1 Phone e' il telefonino " definitivo " ?
Ho dato un'occhiata alle ( non ancora ? ) specifiche definitive ( non ancora ? ) :
* Dimensioni : 116 x 55 x 16 mm
* Peso : 159 g
* Display : 65 K colori , HVGA ( 480×320 )
* Talk Time : 5 hours
* Standby Time : 130 hours
* Memory :
Up to 8 gig memory
* Bluetooth : No stereo .
* Camera : 3.1 mp
* GPS : Si
* 3G : Si
* WiFi : Si
* Tastiera : QWERTY
Pro : non sembra ingombrante , e ' leggero , la batteria sembra durare per sempre , tastiera usabile ( alcune anteprime confermano ) .
Contro : la copertura 3G e' ancora problematica , non c'e ' il video capture , no stereo Bluetooth , HVGA .
Ma la " ciccia " e' Android , il nuovo sistema operativo di Google per dispositivi mobile .
La maggior parte delle applicazioni Google come Google Search , Google Maps , Gmail , Google Calendar , Google Talk YouTube sono gia ' installate .
Seguendo il trend creato da Apple un web shop , " Android Market " e ' in preparazione , dove saranno disponibili applicazioni per cellulari basati su Android
( non gratis .. ) .
Alcuni entusiasti hanno scritto " G1 e'dove Symbian avrebbe dovuto essere due anni fa ' ed e' il muro su cui si infrangera ' Windows Mobile il prossimo anno " .
G1 ha ricevuto molti elogi specialmente dalla comunita ' geek , poiche le caratteristiche di sviluppo di Android sono alla luce del sole .
Mi sono divertito a leggere dello sviluppo di un applicazione che usando l'accelerometro interno misura " quanto a lungo un cellulare lanciato in aria rimane sospeso " .
Ma non e' la comunita ' dei geek il bersaglio della succitata task force del marketing .
Stanno mirando al branco , un serbatoio piu ' vasto che geeks e nerds .
Quindi le loro pubblicita ' sottolineano quanto il G1 sia facile e divertente da usare , anzi intelligente !
La vera domanda e' : Android e' facile da usare per l'uomo / donna qualunque ?
O e' troppo intelligente ?
Fino ad ora non saprei dire se il G1 sara ' un fiasco o un successo .
Sono comunque rimasto colpito dal seguente commento impostato su un blog famoso : " avvolgi questo cellulare in un guscio fico con le caratteristiche che il non-geek vuole ( jack per la cuffia , fotocamera con flash , ripresa immagini anche bluetooth stereo ) .... altrimenti e' una cosa senza valore per chi non e' un geek .
Il sesso tira .
E il G1 non e' sexy .. "
Se cio ' e' quello che l'uomo comune pensa , il T - Mobile G1 Phone e' condannato ( e la sua task force marketing a ruota .... ) .
When it comes to staying healthy , there are so many different contributing factors .
It ’s not as simple as just changing one or two things .
In fact , if you want to boost your health and immune system , there are quite a few different things you can do to help .
After all , we are not static beings and everything works together to create a larger , healthier system .
Therefore , if you are looking for ways to boost your health during this pandemic , we have 7 awesome ways to help .
And each one of these things wo n’t cost you any more money than you are already spending .
1. Hydrate
Lack of proper hydration is one of the most common afflictions in our day and age .
And it ’s not for lack of available water sources .
It is more prevalent because most of us choose to drink things other than water to quench our thirst .
But by doing so , in most cases , you are actually dehydrating yourself .
And when you dehydrate the body , you directly create oxidative stress in the body .
Since oxidative stress can cause inflammation within the body , and for the immune system to become taxed , it is one of the last things we should be doing during a time like this .
Therefore , if something as simple as increasing our hydration can also boost our health naturally , why would n’t we do it ?
The average amount of water a person should be drinking per day will vary .
There are quite a few factors involved , including :
Activity Level
Age
Gender
Medical Conditions
Weight
But , the general rule of thumb is to take your weight and divide it by 2 .
That is how many ounces you should be aiming for at a minimum per day .
Therefore , if a person weighed 200 lbs , they would need a minimum of 100 ounces of water per day .
I , personally , aim for at least a gallon of water per day , not including coffee or tea .
And , consistently drinking this much water has not only kept my energy level through the roof , but I sleep fantastically well and all of my blood work comes back as excellent for hydration levels .
So , even if you ca n’t do everything on this list to boost your health , this is one thing you should easily be able to incorporate into your daily routine .
2. Sleep
Getting adequate sleep is another thing that is well within our reach , that does n’t cost a penny to implement .
Not only is getting more sleep free , but most of us should be doing it to increase our overall health .
These days , a lot of us are getting well under the recommended 8 hours of sleep per night .
And some studies have shown that those of us who get less than 6 hours of sleep per night are much more susceptible to illnesses .
I can tell you that there was certainly a time in my life where I consistently got less than 6 hours of sleep per night .
Now , I still did n’t get any illnesses , but I had much less energy than I am used to .
I am typically a high energy person , and always have been , so this was an issue for me .
While it might not have had the illness side effect for me , it did directly impact my life .
Although , I knew the lack of adequate sleep was only going to be temporary because of work , graduate school and parenting , I was happy when it finally ended .
Now I am back on a more normal 7 - 8 hour sleep schedule and have all of my regular energy back for living life to the fullest .
So , if you are n’t getting closer to 8 hours of sleep per night regularly , this is an area you can focus on changing .
Even if you only increase your sleep time by 15 minutes or so per night .
3. Reduce Stress
Stress is a huge factor in overall health and your immune system .
In fact , when you are stressed you produce more corticosteroids .
This hormone directly affects the immune system ’s ability to fight off antigens .
The more stressed you are , the more corticosteriods you produce .
By doing so , the more you tax your immune system so that it is not in top fighting shape .
And in today ’s society , most of us are walking around in a stressed - out state the majority of the time .
So , finding ways to naturally reduce your stress level can only help to boost your health and keep your immune system strong .
Some great ways to reduce stress are :
Get off social media
Breathe
Take a walk
Unplug from all devices
Read
Exercise
Play with your pets
Catch up with old friends
Embark on your favorite hobbies
4. Breathe
The majority of us do n’t think about breathing properly when we think about overall health .
But , getting enough regular breath to oxygenate our red blood cells adequately is extremely important .
In fact , if you are n’t getting enough oxygen into your cells , you can be creating a multitude of negative side effects to your overall health .
Some of the most common include :
Sleep Apnea
Lethargy
Dizziness
Irritability
Shortness of Breath
Wheezing
Discolored Skin
I know that I have no desire to inflict any of these potential side effects on myself .
So , some great ways to naturally increase your breathe and oxygenation include :
Adding in more oxygen rich foods
Drink more water ( since it is full of oxygen ! )
Deep breathing
Walk out in nature with older growth trees , when possible
Increasing your breath can create more oxygenation and , as a direct result , boost your health .
So why not stop to smell the roses a bit more often .
Your health will thank you !
5. Exercise
Even if you do n’t embark upon a regular exercise routine , adding in some moderate exercise can help boost your immune system .
Exercising too much can potentially depress your immune system , which is the opposite of what we are going for .
But , if you can add in a few lighter activities and create a more regular exercise schedule , you may be well on your way to boost your health naturally .
Some of the best ways to do this , while costing little to no money , are :
Brisk Walk
Jump Rope
Gardening
Hiking
Biking
Skating
Swimming
No matter which activity you choose to add in , try to aim for about 30 minutes per day .
This can be broken up into different time blocks also , if your schedule just is n’t allowing for a full 30 minutes at a time .
This way you can still achieve your exercise goals and stick within your budget at the same time .
6. Eat More Plants
Eating more plant - based foods is a really easy way to reduce your food costs and help boost your immune system .
This is especially true if you continually diversify your plant - based food choices .
The more diversity you create with your plant - based foods , the more you will be getting of the following :
Antioxidants
Minerals
Nutrients
Vitamins
And by creating a more diverse palate to pull from , you are only increasing the arsenal that your immune system has to pull from .
Aiming for at least 5 - 7 servings per day of varied fruits and vegetables can help boost your health naturally .
Whenever possible , fresh and in season are better than frozen .
And either of those is always better than canned , due to potentially added sugar .
No matter which fruits and vegetables you choose to add , try to keep the color palette varied .
The more colors you get in your diet , the more robust your gut microbiome can be .
7. Less Sugar
Since most foods today in America contain some sort of sugar in them , we actually get more sugar than we think we do .
Even if you are n’t directly adding sweeteners to your food or beverages .
It ’s amazing how many foods have hidden sugars in the ingredient list .
And these can include some foods we would n’t even think of to have sugar in them .
Some of the most common culprits are :
Pasta Sauce
Bread
Nut Butters
And when you are getting too much sugar in your diet , you are directly affecting your immune system ’s ability to function properly .
In fact , too much sugar can affect not only your weight but also your hormone levels .
And since stress can also be directly tied to hormone levels , by increasing the amount of sugar you regularly intake , you are effectively creating a whole system issue .
Which ultimately weakens your immune system and its ability to fight off invaders .
I do n’t know about you , but that does n’t sound like something I care to do in this day and age .
Therefore , one of the best ways to prevent this is to eat more whole foods and read every processed food label with a magnifying glass .
Cut out any excess sugar that you can in order to help boost your health .
Boost Your Health Summary
Overall , there are so many great ways to boost your health naturally .
And most of them you can do completely for free !
Just to recap , some of the best ways to improve your immune system and help prevent future illnesses are :
Increase your hydration
Add in more regular sleep Reduce your stress levels Breathe more Add in regular moderate exercise Eat more plants Reduce your sugar consumption
Even if you ca n’t do all of these at once , just working on one or two categories , to begin with can significantly help you boost your health .
And what ’s not to love about that ?
What are some of the best ways you have found to boost your health and immune system naturally ?
His wife Maria rang him and told him to leave the plane but he is said to have told her " They wo n't let me off " and that cabin crew had made him get back in his seat .

If you are one of the many people who are looking forward to download apps for free other than the Google Play Store , then you have found the right place to serve your needs .
What is Aptoide ?
Aptoide is a place where you can download apps supposedly offered for a price at the Play Store .
This serves as an alternative to apps you would want to acquire for free .
You may be able to download the app from the website https://en.aptoide.com/.
Simply click on the button that says “ Install Aptoide ” and you are done with the first step .
You can also search directly from the search box for apps that you would want to download directly on your computer .
The link where you can download Aptoide is https://en.aptoide.com/installer in which you can click on the button that says “ Install Free Now ” .
Difference of Aptoide and Play Store
Basically , Aptoide is an alternative marketplace for mobile apps that would run on the Android OS .
You can differentiate the Play Store and the Aptoide marketplace with the apps they are both offering .
For one , an app that would usually be offered under a price tag at the Play Store would be available free of charge on the Aptoide market .
It also provides great opportunities for people to manage their own store .
Unlike the Play Store , Aptoide is not a centralized store .
In fact , it has a number of versions of the Aptoide , including those intended for tablets , smartphones , TVs , smart TVs , VR , and Kids .
Aptoide on PC
You can get Aptoide to work on your PC , but it requires an Android emulator to run in the first place .
If you like to try Aptoide on a much bigger screen , then you need not have to go elsewhere because you can do it on your own computer .
I ’ve been out of town , and have not studied all the available details of the Bush administration plan .
But I have a few observations .
1 . I suspect that Hyman Minsky , the economist who wrote that stability can be destabilizing , and whom I was surprised to hear being quoted by a Bush administration official a few months ago , would have forecast such a gigantic bailout long before it happened .
2 . It is unsettling to see Wall Street firms that only a week ago feared for their survival hoping to get rich off this program .
It needs to be carefully monitored to keep it from becoming a scandal of its own .
3 . The Bush administration was a little slow to decide this was a huge crisis , but they reverted to form when they did .
They want Congress to give them a blank check to do whatever they want , whatever the cost , with no one able to watch them closely .
4. Hank Paulson is a lot more competent than some of the people who gave the Bush administration a reputation for incompetence — remember the stories of being unable to account for suitcases full of cash in Iraq ? — but it would be no insult to him to insist on better monitoring .
If nothing else , he will not be Treasury secretary for very long , since the new president will undoubtedly replace him .
Some kind of board should be established , and all the officials on the board should share responsibility for major decisions .
5 . This crisis is not so urgent that a bill really needs to be passed without time for the public to read it and study it .
If Congress has to delay leaving to campaign for a few days , so be it .
6 . This is not similar to the Resolution Trust Corporation .
The assets it liquidated were acquired when failed savings and loans were taken over by the government .
There was no question of purchase price .
Here purchase price is crucial .
What are the safeguards to prevent cronies and contributors from getting favorable deals , either in selling assets or in purchasing them ?
7 . The prices paid for assets should be transparent to the public , and some way should be found to allow others to bid for them , in at least some cases .
That would help to assure that the price being paid was a fair one .
8 . The decisions made by the bailout agency will be critical to communities and to struggling homeowners .
If the board is lenient in restructuring the millions of mortgages it will control , it can reduce foreclosures , at a possible cost to taxpayers .
But the risks that it will be lenient to those with clout are real , and forgiving every loan is not a great idea .
9 . Among the worst mistakes made in the savings and loan crisis was to allow the institutions to devise special accounting rules , to make themselves look better than they were and to keep them going when they should have been closed down .
You would think no one would want to repeat that , but there are rumors that banks are asking that Congress allow them to stop marking assets to market , on the theory that having to tell the truth about their bad decisions , rather than the decisions themselves , caused this problem .
10 .
This might not have been needed , at least not now , if the Fed and Treasury had stuck to their own game plan in Bear Stearns , to bail out creditors but not shareholders .
We need to learn who pressed to force Lehman to fail completely .
That decision led directly to the run on money market funds and to panicked trading conditions for credit default swaps at other brokerage firms .
11 . Investors clearly think the shareholders of brokerage firms and banks are being bailed out — not just that failure is being avoided .
That should not be allowed to happen .
If there is no penalty at all for these disasters , we are more likely to see repeats somewhere down the road .
That is far more important than whether a few executives get undeserved bonuses , but the issue of bonuses is more attractive to politicians and may get more Congressional attention than issues of whether the government overpays for assets .
Breaking into Gov. Sarah Palin 's webmail account was a simple hack -- one that required little to no technical expertise .
There is , of course , an important lesson to be learned here for the vice presidential candidate , and hopefully the rest of us can take something away from this as well .

The attack was perpetrated by 4 Chan 's " random " /b/ board .
The board has long been at the forefront of Internet memeology , helping popularize such favorites as lolcats , Rick - rolling , and the " Anonymous " group , which has been known to launch its share of large - scale anti-Scientology protests .
On Tuesday night , someone from the /b/ board ( " / b/ tards , " as they are colloquially known ) broke into Sarah Palin's Yahoo !
e-mail account .
They read the e-mails and posted the address and password on the board .
Fellow /b/ tards proceeded to wreak general havoc with the account .
The /b/ tard in question used Yahoo !'s password recovery feature , and then proceeded to fill in the answers using Wikipedia .
A message posted to the forum explains the process thusly :
" After the password recovery was reenabled , it took seriously 45 mins on wikipedia and google to find the info , Birthday ?
15 seconds on wikipedia , zip code ?
well she had always been from wasilla , and it only has 2 zip codes ( thanks online postal service ! )
" The second was somewhat harder , the question was " where did you meet your spouse ? " did some research , and apparently she had eloped with mister palin after college , if youll look on some of the screenshits [ sic ] that I took and other fellow anon have so graciously put on photobucket you will see the google search for " palin eloped " or some such in one of the tabs .
" I found out later though more research that they met at high school , so I did variations of that , high , high school , eventually hit on " Wasilla high " I promptly changed the password to popcorn and took a cold shower ...

In a New York Times June 29th op - ed , " Anxious in America , " Thomas Friedman mulled over America 's dilemmas in Iraq , where the war has taken a positive turn for the USA American national economy and debt and who might become the next president .
Either choice scares the daylights out of Americans on both sides .
Neither candidate understands average citizens ' dilemmas in their jobs , communities or schools .
Neither addresses what happens in the trenches of America .
Neither gives a hoot about the recent rapid increase in the U S population , or the unlawful presence of more than 30 million fully employed foreign nationals and their more than ten million kids and grand - kids .
The aliens have displaced lower - middle - class Americans in the job market , decimating those American families .
Gentle - reader , doncha wonder why those stories are not headlines in the liberal media ?
Negativism rules the psyche of America .
Thus , most Americans vote against the other guy instead of ' for ' a presidential candidate .
In the case of McCain , he represents past paradigms , unending support for an endless Iraq War , old thinking and non-action or in -action .
Obama scares most folks as to his lack of experience , his association with the " God D*** America " spewing Pastor Wright , shady - hoodlum Rezko in Chicago and his wife 's racial bias writings at Harvard against white America .
Both Obama and McCain voted to give amnesty to more than 30 million illegal aliens in 2007 - without any understanding of the $ 1 trillion price tag or demographic impact .
Both men did nothing and do nothing to stop illegal alien migration at over many millions annually , to include visa overstay illegals .
In fact , McCain signed the 1986 amnesty giving 4.3 million illegal aliens a free pass , but never followed up on his promise to secure our borders .
Both men voted to double current annual immigration from 1.2 million people to 2.4 million in the amnesty bill in June of 2007 - which would have caused a catastrophic population overload within the USA .
Based on mathematics alone , this kind of short sightedness bodes poorly for a national leader , unless you are a progressive who loves open borders , multiculturalism and unlimited legal and illegal immigration .
Neither man supports any kind of a plan to secure our nation 's borders .
While they talk the good talk both men continued voting for insourcing , outsourcing and offshoring of American manufacturing jobs .
Both have crippled Americans with their votes in the U.S. Senate as to our national debt , $ 700 billion annual trade deficit , and no action on 400,000 ( could be as high as 1,200,000 ) annual anchor babies gaining immediate citizenship and welfare .
Both men continued the taxpayer burden of educating millions of illegal alien children along with billions for health care .
Neither man spoke up for American citizens as to jobs being stolen or wages degraded .
Whether Obama or McCain , both need to choose a financial - wizard Veep " Come August , I predict both men will be looking for a financial wizard as their running mates to help them steer America out of what could become a serious economic tailspin , " Friedman said .
" I do not believe nation - building in Iraq is going to be the issue come November - whether things get better there or worse .
If they get better , we 'll ignore Iraq more ; if they get worse , the next president will be under pressure to get out quicker . "
Nation - Building is mandatory Friedman added , " I think nation - building in America is going to be THE issue . "
If you look around you , most Americans feel a sinister anxiety heretofore unheard of in this country .
Gas prices hogtie , hamstring and paralyze the engines of commerce .
Truckers fail by the thousands .
Car manufacturing jobs vanish overnight !
" Up to now , the economic crisis we 've been in has been largely a credit crisis in the capital markets , while consumer spending has kept reasonably steady , as have manufacturing and exports , " Friedman said .
" But with banks still reluctant to lend even to healthy businesses , fuel and food prices soaring and home prices declining , this is starting to affect consumers , shrinking their wallets and crimping spending . "
For Americans holding the bag with an SUV or other large vehicle , financial bloodletting awaits at every fill - up at the gas station .
That funeral dirge continues at the grocery store where everything costs more money ­ mainly from $ 5.00 a gallon diesel transportation costs .
Recession causes are obvious , and ridiculous Mortgage felony crimes are extensive and numerous : fully half of the problem because our banks and other lenders gave away fraudulent loans to millions of illegal aliens , who are NOT eligible for federally insured loans .
American taxpayers make up the losses .
Remember the S & L scandals ?
Who paid ?
You paid !
" Two weeks ago , Goldman Sachs analysts said that U.S. banks may need another $ 65 billion to cover more write - downs of bad mortgage - related instruments and potential new losses if consumer loans start to buckle , " Friedman said .
" Since President Bush came to office , our national savings have gone from six percent of gross domestic product to one percent , and consumer debt has almost doubled from $ 8 trillion to $ 14 trillion . "
Priorities are out - of - whack Instead of spending $ 83 billion a month to provide social services to illegal aliens and their family members and spending $ 12 billion a month fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan , PLUS $ 10 billion per month rebuilding Iraq and Afghanistan , is n't it time to rebuild America ?
How about our families , our communities , our roads , our infrastructure , our jobs and our citizens ?
Both Obama and McCain do n't hold a clue as to what to do about Iraq or Afghanistan .
Both avoid any withdrawal plan , which means unending years at $ 12 billion a month on a national debt ­ beyond comprehension at $ 9.4 trillion .
What does that mean to anxious Americans ?
Simple answer : our politicians do not work for us , do not serve us , do not represent us and they stand totally out of touch with us .
Our political leaders fail us at every juncture .
They fail to enforce our laws .
They fail to create a strategic energy plan .
They fail to pursue alternative energy .
They fail to enforce our immigration laws .
They fail themselves , our citizens and our civilization .
The next president of the United States may well be the President Hoover of the 21st century .

Final note : I am looking for thinkers , writers and advocates to add to my monthly " Master Mind Think Tank . "
In reality , our politicians foment the problems that they campaign to solve .
They never solve them ; thus we spiral into deeper national chaos .
I need new ideas and new creative thinkers to help me bring our most pressing issues onto the front burner : overpopulation in America caused by ceaseless legal and illegal immigration .
As you know , the recent PEW report shows immigration adding 100 million people to our country in 30 years .
We need to stop it and we need to stop it now .
Join me in saving our civilization .

Before you can begin to think about marketing yourselves online you ’ll first of all need to take care of the music .
If , like me , you ’re making that music at home then you ’ll be aware of the many benefits this arrangement brings - you have the freedom to try whatever you like , you do n’t have one eye on the clock and you never have to get the last bus home .
The flipside is that you are on your own and , to put this gently , there will be no - one there to keep an eye on you .
You are entirely free to lead yourself down any number of blind alleys before you grab the wrong end of the stick and beat yourself up with it .
Recording at home requires patience , discipline and good planning …… and all at the same time … and from musicians .
What could possibly go wrong ?
Since the price of freedom is eternal vigilance , here are the 9 mistakes we made in homemaking our debut record that I ’m keen to avoid as we begin our second .
I ’m fairly certain I ’m not the only person in the world who learned his good habits the hard way so if you think I ’ve missed anything important please feel free to add some tips of your own .
I ’d also very much like to hear your tales of self - inflicted recording calamity !
OK , off we go ..
1 : That Odd Buzzing Noise Will Come Out In The Mix
.. and one day there will be free jetpacks for us all .
No matter how good you think that last take was , if your singer kicked the mikestand halfway through or the small change was rubbing against the keys in your pockets , then you need to think about starting that take again .
2 : If You Are Having Drums , You Might Want To Record Them First
You may think you ’ve nailed that guitar part to that click track but there are two people who wo n’t share your confidence .
The first person is the drummer and he will till you all about this when he comes to play along to the song .
The second is the person who will spend weeks going through the all the component drum audio files , making miniscule adjustments to the placement of a kick beat here and a high hat there .
When I say weeks , I mean WEEKS …easily enough weeks to fill a month or two .
3 : “ Hey , Shall We Tune - up ? ”
This one sounds teeth - grindingly obvious , does n’t it .
Oh yes , so obvious in fact that you ’d never believe anyone could make such a stupid , stupid error .
* cough *
Moving on , then …
4 : Effects Breed Like Rabbits
It might not sound the way you hear it in your head but if you cave in now and add that tiny bit of distortion - just to make yourself feel better about everything - then imagine how great you ’ll be feeling when you come to the mix and you ca n’t get rid of it .
Record EVERYTHING dry .
5 : “ You Sound Like You ’ve Got A Cold … ”
If you did n’t have a cold when you recorded the vocals for the other 9 tracks , why do you want to do record the vocal for this one now ?
6 : Clean Out Yer Ears
If you ’ve listened back to that rough mix more than 10 times today then it ’s probably time to go out , meet your pals and get drunk .
Additionally , when you all come back from the your night out your friends will probably be in the mood for some ELO or possibly some Fu Manchu .
That track without vocals and that piano part littered with cack - handed mistakes will be waiting patiently for you tomorrow - it ai n’t going nowhere .
7 : Less Is More
These days home studios can be augmented with a dazzling array of plugins that enable you to have thousands and thousands of different sounds and instruments at your fingertips .
You are limited only by your imagination , but remember that this cuts both ways .
8 : Organise , Label & File
At some stage , when you ’ve recorded your last vocal or overdub , you ’ll want to think about mixing your album .
When this point comes it is waaay too late and entirely pointless to have the bright idea of giving audio files sensible names and putting them into folders that , say , represent the names of the different songs they come from .
9 : Back - Up
Death , Taxes and At - That - Crucial - Point computer malfunction .
They come to us all in the end .
Back - up your work daily , weekly or even monthly …. but make sure you do it .
Now , go and make a great record !
Vitter loses with FEC on $ 160 K in ' D.C. Madam ' legal bills
Lawyers for the Federal Election Commission do not believe that Sen. David Vitter ( R - La. ) should be allowed to use campaign funds to cover all the legal costs he incurred while trying to avoid testifying in the Deborah Jeane Palfrey prostitution case .
In a draft advisory opinion ( AO ) released by the FEC on Wednesday , the agency concluded that Viitter will have to personally pay more than $ 160,000 in lawyers ' fees stemming from Vitter 's effort to quash suppoenas from Palfrey , dubbed by the media as the " D.C. Madam . "
Another $ 31,000 - plus in legal bills run up during a Senate Ethics Committee probe of Vitter can be covered by the campaign , the FEC staff rules .
An additional $ 15,301 in fees can be partially covered by Vitter 's re-election campaign .
Palfrey was indicted in March 2007 related to a prostitution ring she operated .
Palfrey , who committed suicide in May after being convicted in the case , later revealed a list of phone numbers of her clients .
Vitter 's number was among those alleged clients , and Palfrey attorneys twice subpoenaed him to testify in the case .
In July 2007 , Vitter publicly apologized for a " very serious sin in my past , " but said the calls to Palfrey 's service occurred before his 2004 Senate run .
Vitter hired a lawyer to quash the subpoenas , running up more than $ 200,000 in legal bills to try to stay out of the case .
Vitter is now seeking FEC persmission to use campaign funds to pay off his attorneys , arguing that he was only targeted by Palfrey for subpoenas because of his status as a senator .
But the FEC disafreed with Vitter 's position , According to the draft advisory opinion from FEC staff , " Senator Vitter 's need for legal representation to quash Ms. Palfrey ' ssubpoenas stemmed from his role as a potential witness in Ms. Palfrey 's trial and was not related to information known to or acquired by Senator Vitter during the course of his candidacy or in the performance of his duties as a U.S. Senator .
Moreover , Senator Vitter 's obligation as a witness to comply with a valid subpoena would exist irrespective of Senator Vitter 's campaign or duties as a U.S. Senator . "
A draft AO opinion by FEC staff is not the last word on the matter , since the full FEC board still has to approve it .
Vitter has paid approximately $ 70,000 to his attorneys out of his own pocket , according to his FEC request .
Sporting 10 - gallon hat , Cheney tells Coast Guard grads :
War will not drag on indefinitely RAW STORY

Print This Email This ( Update at bottom : Spokeswoman explains why Cheney wore cowboy hat ) Vice President Dick Cheney told newly minted Coast Guard officers Wednesday that the war on terror would be won on their watch and dismissed fears that fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan would drag on indefinitely .
Cheney , sporting a 10 - gallon hat , said the troop surge in Iraq " has succeeded brilliantly . "
" The war on terror is a lengthy enterprise , but it does not have to go on forever , " he told more than 200 graduating cadets during the 127th commencement at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy .
" The only way to lose this fight is to quit .
That would be irresponsible , " Cheney said .
" More than that , quitting would be an act of betrayal and dishonor .
And it 's not going to happen on our watch . "
The commencement address was Cheney 's second in four years at the academy .
He was joined by Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff .
President Bush addressed graduates last year .
Cheney told graduates that they will lead a branch of service that is more capable and agile than at any time in its 217 - year history .
" From this day forward , you will be America 's lifesavers and guardians of the seas , " Cheney said .
" You 'll be there to provide security and to defend our American sovereignty and to enforce this nation 's laws against drugs and human smuggling . "
He told the cadets they have been given " an immense set of duties " that will cover some 95,000 miles of U.S. coastline .
The vice president 's visit was both cheered and jeered by demonstrators who arrived early outside the main gates .
Ted Bakacs said he drove down from Boston to join about two dozen war supporters , members of a group dubbed Gathering of Eagles .
They waved American flags and toted signs saying " Proud to be an American " and " Support our Troops . "
" We 're proud of our government , " said Bakacs , an Air Force veteran .
" We 're proud to be American . "
Their message was countered by the more than 100 anti-war protesters , who gathered in the center of this waterfront city and marched silently to the sounds of a slow drum beat to the academy gates .
They carried placards that said , " War is Death " and " Dick Cheney : War Criminal . "
Jason Ortiz , a 24 - year - old University of Connecticut student , arrived early dressed as the grim reaper .
" I 'm against people getting slaughtered so other people can make this money off of it , " Ortiz said .
Media :
What 's up with the hat ?
According to a spokesperson , the vice president had a perfectly legitimate reason for wearing a cowboy hat at the graduation ceremony .
Connecticut reporter Ted Mann asked a " very considerate spokeswoman " for Cheney , " What 's up with that hat ? "
" Its to protect his head from the sun , " Megan Mitchell , the spokeswoman explained .
Mann writes , " Well .
There goes our still - developing theory about the airfoil properties of ten - gallon hat brims .
Shoot . "
One media outlet noted that the " weather led to something of a fashion statement by Cheney , who looked every bit the man from Wyoming . "
However one blogger from the left had a different take .
" Judging from the content of his speech , the hat was not only a Texas - style head accessory , but also a vestiary middle finger to the world , " Chris in D.C. writes at Inside - Out the Beltway .
" It put an exclamation point on the now - clear fact that Bush and Cheney intend to swagger past their final days in office with every bit as much empty - headed bluster as the first time they recklessly aimed their silver - plated six - shooters at the country and the global community . " ( with wire reports )
NASA 's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has revealed hundreds of small fractures exposed on the Martian surface that billions of years ago directed flows of water through underground Martian sandstone .
Researchers used images from the spacecraft 's High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment , or HiRISE , camera .
Images of layered rock deposits at equatorial Martian sites show the clusters of fractures to be a type called deformation bands , caused by stresses below the surface in granular or porous bedrock .
" Groundwater often flows along fractures such as these , and knowing that these are deformation bands helps us understand how the underground plumbing may have worked within these layered deposits , " said Chris Okubo of the U.S. Geological Survey in Flagstaff , Ariz .
Visible effects of water on the color and texture of rock along the fractures provide evidence that groundwater flowed extensively along the fractures .
" These structures are important sites for future exploration and investigations into the geological history of water and water - related processes on Mars , " Okubo and co-authors state in a report published online this month in the Geological Society of America Bulletin .
Deformation band clusters in Utah sandstones , as on Mars , are a few meters or yards wide and up to a few kilometers or miles long .
They form from either compression or stretching of underground layers , and can be precursors to faults .
The ones visible at the surface have become exposed as overlying layers erode away .
Deformation bands and faults can strongly influence the movement of groundwater on Earth and appear to have been similarly important on Mars , according to this study .
" This study provides a picture of not just surface water erosion , but true groundwater effects widely distributed over the planet , " said Suzanne Smrekar , deputy project scientist for the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif .
" Groundwater movement has important implications for how the temperature and chemistry of the crust have changed over time , which in turn affects the potential for habitats for past life . "
The recent study focuses on layered deposits in Mars ' Capen crater , approximately 70 kilometers ( 43 miles ) in diameter and 7 degrees north of the equator .
This formerly unnamed crater became notable due to this discovery of deformation bands within it and was recently assigned a formal name .
The crater was named for the late Charles Capen , who studied Mars and other objects as an astronomer at JPL's Table Mountain Observatory in Southern California and at Lowell Observatory , Flagstaff , Ariz .
The HiRISE camera is one of six science instruments on the orbiter .
It can reveal smaller details on the surface than any previous camera to orbit Mars .
The orbiter reached Mars in March 2006 and has returned more data than all other current and past missions to Mars combined .
The mission is managed by JPL for NASA 's Science Mission Directorate .
JPL is managed for NASA by the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena .
Lockheed Martin Space Systems of Denver built the spacecraft .
The University of Arizona operates the HiRISE camera , built by Ball Aerospace and Technology Corp. of Boulder , Colo .
Images of the deformation band clusters and additional information about the mission are on the Internet at : http://www.nasa.gov/mro .
I WISH this were the first time I was hearing this sentiment .
I wish wish wish it were AT LEAST the first time I heard this sentiment from a woman .
It is not .
" Can you imagine a female president WITH HER PERDIOD ?! "
" I do n't want a female president , because I want the world to see a strong leader . "

In the middle of a sensationalist article about risks to children and how giving them cell phones can help , there ’s at least one person who gets it .
Since the 1999 Columbine High School shootings and the 9/11 terrorist attacks , many parents feel better having a way to contact their children .
But hundreds of students on cell phones during an emergency can cause problems for responders .
“ There ’s a huge difference between feeling safer and being safer , ” says Kenneth Trump , president of National School Safety and Security Services .
According to Trump , students ’ cell phone use during emergencies can do three things : increase the spread of rumors about the situation , expedite parental traffic at a scene that needs to be controlled and accelerate the overload of cell - phone systems in the area .
Tom Hautton , an attorney for the National School Board Association , said that cell phones in schools also can lead to classroom distractions , text - message cheating and inappropriate photographs and videos being spread around campus .
A couple of folks were discussing the need for a Lisp equivalent to Ruby 's Ruby Quiz the other day on LispForum .
Ruby Quiz was a great way to learn Ruby .
It presented a series of programming tasks that were somewhere between a simple exercise at the back of a textbook and a full ICFP Programming Contest challenge .
The goal was to give budding Rubyists a meaty problem on which to test their skills , while not serving up something so difficult that it would take weeks to accomplish .
Well , I 'm pleased to say that yesterday we took the plunge with the first quiz .
The challenge is to write a simple algorithm ( AI ? ) for playing Minesweeper .
The game engine is delivered as part of the challenge , so there is no need to actually worry about the mechanics of Minesweeper .
Just focus on creating an algorithm that will work its way through the minefield without choosing a mine .
The 48 - hour No-Spoiler Period expires at ~ 5:00 PM PDT tomorrow .

Firefighters got a surprise when they were called to rescue a sheep from the roof of a house in North Yorkshire .
The sheep got onto the roof after climbing onto a kennel and a shed before getting onto the low roof of an adjoining building .
It then made a short leap on to the roof of a house in the village of Middlesmoor , North Yorkshire .
Fire crews tried to rescue the sheep but it eventually fell from the roof and suffered a broken leg .
The animal was left with a local farmer so it could be treated .
Officers who took part in the rescue attempt were unavailable for comment but their colleague Paul Ferguson , a watch manager at Harrogate Fire Station , said : " It 's the first time I 've heard of having to rescue an animal from a roof !
" It would have been a difficult situation because you can't know how the sheep is going to behave in those circumstances and obviously it took the wrong course of action .
" I would imagine the officer in charge had little hope of getting a safe situation for the sheep because of its nervous behaviour . "
Introduction
It does n't exist a best tecnique or policy about how to backup your data in Linux .
It depends how are your data and if you want backup them locally or in remote .
There are some mature tools for specific tasks and you have to decide with one suits better .
There are some GUIs that simplify the job , but in case of issues , the terminal is the ONLY way to debug what is happening .
Entire partition
You can copy the entire partition in raw mode with dd :
sudo dd if=/ dev/sda1 of=/destination/file.raw
GUI : Partimage
Notes : the output file size will be about the partition size , even if it is almost empty .
Entire system
tar - cvpzf backup.tar.gz -- exclude=/ other - directory /my-directory
GUI : File Roller as root and save with . tar extension
Notes :
You have to keep the permissions if you do n't want problems .
You will not copy the bootloader in this way .
Source code
The best way to backup your code and keep the modification is to use a Distribuited Concurrent version system :
Git ( in italian )
GUI : Giggle or others ( but a full - featured gui is still missing )
Notes :
There are other DVCS , Bazaar that is more integrated with Ubuntu , Mercurial , Darcs , .. but it seems that Git is becaming the standard .
Big binary files
.. like images .iso or other blob data .
diff is for plain text differencies , while xdelta is for binary differencies .
xdelta3 -e -s old_file new_file delta_file
Personal data ( locale )
rsync + local directory
Personal data ( over LAN )
client : rsync + fuse + curlftpfs
server : ftp server
GUI : rsync ( Grsync ) , ftp server ( Gproftpd )
Notes : the best way to do an incremental backup is to start , in the server machine , with a .tar of the directory you want backup .
You can use also rsync over ssh , samba or other network protocol but ftp is the fastest one .
Any software you need is already on the Debian / Ubuntu repository .

Federal authorities today unsealed some of the evidence collected against Bruce E. Ivins , the Fort Detrick , Md. , bioweapons researcher who died in an apparent suicide after being told he was the prime suspect in the 2001 anthrax attacks .
The documents , posted on the Department of Justice 's Web site this afternoon , include a volume of circumstantial and trace evidence .
The file explains how investigators used advanced DNA testing to link Ivins to a particular strain of anthrax ; documented his late - night hours in the lab directly before the letters were mailed ; and found Web postings in which Ivins spouted his distaste for the media and other organizations , The Post 's Carrie Johnson , Marilyn W. Thompson and William Branigin report .
Some of the more unusual revelations revolve around Ivins 's e-mail exchanges with friends , which run the gamut from sincere letters about his struggles with mental illness and psychotropic medications to angry rants about the Sept. 11 attacks , language that investigators claim is close to that used in the anthrax - laden letters mailed across the country from a New Jersey mailbox .
In one e-mail from April 2000 , he told a friend that he occasionally becomes " dizzy and get this unidentifiable ' metallic ' taste in my mouth .
( I 'm not trying to be funny , ( redacted name ) .
It actually scares me a bit . ) "
In another e-mail from June 2000 , Ivins wrote : " Even with the Celexa and the counseling , the depression episodes still come and go .
That 's unpleasant enough .
What is REALLY scary is the paranoia . "
A few months later , Ivins wrote : " It 's hard enough sometimes controlling my behavior .
When I 'm being eaten alive inside , I always try to put on a good front here at work and at home , so I do n't spread the pestilence ... I get incredibly paranoid , delusional thoughts at times , and there 's nothing I can do until they go away . "
In the next few months , leading up to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks , Ivins ' e-mail exchanges include discussions about his work on creating an Anthrax vaccine .
Then , four days after the Sept. 11 attacks , Ivins wrote : " I am incredibly sad and angry at what happened , now that it has sunk in .
Sad for all of the victims , their families , their friends .
And angry .
Very angry .
Angry at those who did this , who support them , who coddle them , and who excuse them . "
In an e-mail on Sept. 26 , 2001 , Ivins wrote : " Osama Bin Laden has just decreed death to all Jews and all Americans " -- language that federal agents pointed out was similar to the text found in the anthrax letters that warns : " DEATH TO AMERICA , " " DEATH TO ISRAEL . "
One of the stranger communiques cited by the investigators is a poem Ivins wrote to a friend in December 2001 :
" I'm a little dream - self , short and stout .
I 'm the other half of bruce -- when he lets me out .
When I get all steamed up , I do n't pout .
I push Bruce aside , them I 'm free to run about !
Hickory dickory Doc -- Doc Bruce ran up the clock .
But something then happened in very strange rhythm .
His other self went and exchanged placed with him .
So now , please guess who
Is conversing with you .
Hickory dickory Doc !
Bruce and this other guy , sitting by some trees ,
Exchanging personalities .
It 's like having two in one .
Actually it 's rather fun ! "

Newswise — University of Utah physicists successfully controlled an electrical current using the " spin " within electrons " a step toward building an organic " spin transistor " : a plastic semiconductor switch for future ultrafast computers and electronics .
The study also suggests it will be more difficult than thought to make highly efficient light - emitting diodes ( LEDs ) using organic materials .
The findings hint such LEDs would convert no more than 25 percent of electricity into light rather than heat , contrary to earlier estimates of up to 63 percent .
Organic semiconductor or " plastic " LEDs are much cheaper and easier to fabricate than existing inorganic LEDs now used in traffic signals , some building lighting and as indicator lights on computers , TVs , cell phones , DVD players , modems , game consoles and other electronics .
The study " published online Sunday , Aug. 17 in the journal Nature Materials " was led by Christoph Boehme and John Lupton , assistant and associate professors of physics , respectively , at the University of Utah .
The promising news about spin transistors and sobering news about organic LEDs ( OLEDs ) both stem from an experiment that merged organic semiconductor electronics and spin electronics , or spintronics , which is part of quantum mechanics " the branch of physics that describes the behavior of molecules , atoms and subatomic particles .
" This is the first time anyone has done really fundamental , hands - on quantum mechanics with an organic LED , " Lupton says .
" This is tough stuff . "
Lupton and Boehme conducted the study with postdoctoral researcher Dane McCamey and four University of Utah physics doctoral students : Heather Seipel , Seo - Young Paik , Manfred Walter and Nick Borys .
The Spin on Spintronics An atom includes a nucleus of protons and neutrons , and a shell of orbiting electrons .
In addition to an electrical charge , some nuclei and all electrons have a property known as " spin , " which is like a particle 's intrinsic angular momentum .
An electron 's spin often is described as a bar magnet that points up or down .
Computers and other electronics work because negatively charged electrons flow as electrical current .
Computerized information is reduced by transistors to a binary code of ones or zeroes represented by the presence or absence of electrons in semiconductors .
Researchers also hope to develop even smaller , faster computers by using electrons ' spin as well as their electrical charge to store and transmit information ; the up and down spins of electrons also can represent ones and zeroes in computing .
Lupton says that physicists already have shown that spins can carry information in nonorganic materials .
In 2004 , other Utah physicists reported building the first organic " spin valve " to control electrical current .
In the new study , the researchers showed that information can be carried by spins in an organic polymer , and that a spin transistor is possible because " we can convert the spin information into a current , and manipulate it and change it , " says Lupton .
" We are manipulating this information and reading it out again .
We are writing it and reading it . "
Boehme says spin transistors and other spin electronics could make possible much smaller computer chips , and computers that are orders of magnitude faster than today's .
" Even the smallest transistor today consists of hundreds of thousands of atoms , " says Boehme .
" The ultimate goal of miniaturization is to implement electronics on the scale of atoms and electrons . "
Shedding Light on Organic LEDs LED semiconductors using compounds of gallium , arsenic , indium and other inorganic materials have made their way into traffic signals , vehicle brake lights and home electronics in recent years .
Some inorganic LEDs can convert 47 percent to 64 percent of incoming electricity into white light rather than waste heat .
But efforts to replace incandescent and even compact fluorescent light bulbs with LEDs have been hindered by costs exceeding $ 100 per LED bulb .
LEDs made of electrically conducting organic materials are cheaper and easier to manufacture , but their efficiency long was thought to have an upper limit of 25 percent .
A 2001 Nature paper by other University of Utah physicists suggested it might be possible to make organic LEDs that converted 41 percent to 63 percent of incoming electricity into light .
But the new study suggests 25 percent efficiency may be correct " at least for the organic polymer studied " pure MEH - PPV " and possibly for others .
" Doping " organic semiconductors with other chemicals someday might lead to organic LED efficiencies above 25 percent , but Boehme says he is skeptical .
Even if organic LEDs are less efficient and have a shorter lifespan than inorganic LEDs , they still may be more economical because their cost is so much less , he adds .
Boehme says organic LEDs ' greatest promise is not in lighting , but to replace the LCD ( liquid crystal display ) technology in modern televisions and computer screens .
Organic LEDs will be much cheaper , can be made on flexible materials , have a wider viewing angle and color range and will be more energy efficient than LCDs , he says .
Flip - Flopping on Flipping and Flopping LEDs produce light when incoming negative and positive electrical charges " electrons and " holes " " combine .
The spins of each electron - hole pair can combine in four quantum states , which in turn can combine in two different ways to form : -- A " singlet , " with a net spin of zero ( up - down minus down - up ) . -- A " triplet , " with net spin one ( up - up , down - down or up - down plus down - up ) .
In some organic materials , singlets emit light when they decay , and triplets do not .
So the efficiency of an organic LED depends on the relative production of singlets and triplets .
The fact that a singlet is only one of four quantum states suggests the maximum efficiency of an organic LED can be 25 percent " something the new study supports .
Lupton , Boehme used a plastic semiconductor LED in the form of a piece of the polymer MEH - PPV measuring about one - twelfth - inch long by one - eighth - inch wide .
It was mounted on a piece of glass about 2 inches long and one - sixth inch wide .
Electrodes were attached , and the apparatus was bombarded by a microwave pulse for a few nanoseconds ( billionths of a second ) to turn and align the spins of electron - hole pairs in the LED .
The electrodes also were used to measure the strength of the electrical current from the device .
" Just like a mass on a spring , the pulse produces an oscillation of the spins [ of singlets and triplets ] in the organic LED , " Lupton says .
" That was unexpected . "
The 2001 study indicated that some triplets randomly , unpredictably " lose their memory , " changing spin orientation or " flipping " to become singlets , boosting possible organic LED efficiencies as high as 63 percent .
The new study , however , found triplets " flip " into singlets too slowly to produce much light , Boehme says .
Instead , the study showed electron spin quantum states can rhythmically and predictably oscillate or " flop " between triplets and singlets and back again for one - half microsecond ( millionths of a second ) when excited by microwaves .
Because the combination of electrons and holes that produces light happens faster than that , " flipping likely is n't involved in producing light " from the LED , and thus it will be difficult to make organic LEDs with efficiencies above 25 percent , Lupton says .

General morale within the services is claimed to be in decline Britain 's armed forces are facing declining morale and could be " paralysed " by mass resignations , a campaign group has warned .
A UK National Defence Association ( UKNDA ) report says the military is under - funded and overstretched .
It is calling for a 40 % rise in the £ 33bn core military budget by 2011 .
The Ministry of Defence said funding was rising at its highest rate in more than 30 years and a welfare support package had recently been announced .
According to the UKNDA , the government has allowed military spending to fall to its lowest level since the 1930s , at 2.3 % of GDP compared with 5 % in the 1980s .
It said the core defence budget has been modestly increased , but the " security landscape has drastically changed for the worse " .
If only 50 % of the half of all servicemen considering resignation were to quit , the armed services would be paralysed
UKNDA report A Ministry of Defence survey which suggested almost half of UK military personnel are ready to leave the forces was cited .
The UKNDA report said : " Seriously inadequate manning levels have caused tours of duty to be long and so frequently repeated that there is insufficient time for recuperation , family life and retraining .
" This has caused a major decline in general , as opposed to battlefield , morale so that pressure to resign in dangerously large numbers has resulted .
" If only 50 % of the half of all servicemen considering resignation were to quit , the armed services would be paralysed .
They could take a decade to recover , leaving Britain 's defences severely weakened . "
Key support
The report , Overcoming the Defence Crisis , urges the government to launch a comprehensive defence review and commit itself in principle to a spending increase .
It says the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats should offer bi-partisan support to such a rise .
Problems with top quality weapons and other operational equipment have now largely been fixed , it said .
But , according to the report , there remains a serious lack of battlefield helicopters , unmanned aerial vehicles , effective operational radios and mine - proof land vehicles .
The Ministry of Defence said it was striving to provide the armed forces " with the rewards and the recognition that they deserve " .
A spokesman added : " We achieve this not in isolation , but using the full range of resources available to us . "
He said the defence budget was experiencing its longest period of sustained real growth for more than 30 years .
There was also additional Treasury funding for " urgent and cutting - edge equipment to theatre " and key welfare support in areas such as education and compensation , and access to healthcare and accommodation was outlined in the Service Personnel Command Paper .

What are these ?
From an AP article about McCain ’s VP possibilities ( since corrected ) :
His top contenders are said to include Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney .
Less traditional choices mentioned include former Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge , an abortion - rights supporter , and Connecticut Sen .
Joe Lieberman , the Democratic vice presidential prick in 2000 who now is an independent .
Ironically , the article in question was written by Nedra Pickler , a reporter who is well known for misquotes and other mistakes .
But this time when she got it wrong , some people are saying she finally got it right !
The FDIC is looking for ways to shore up its depleted deposit fund , including charging higher premiums on riskier brokered deposits , FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair said Friday .
However , that fund is " a myth , " according to longtime banking consultant Bert Ely , and consumers may end up paying the price of what is expected to be a growing wave of bank failures .
NYU Economics Professor Nouriel Roubini predicts that Congress will have to intervene in order to bail out the deposit fund .
" They 're going to run out of money , with certainty , " he predicted .
" Congress is going to have to recapitalize the FDIC , those $ 50 billion plus is not going to be enough , by no means . "
Indeed , on Friday afternoon FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair said in an interview on C - SPAN television that banks holding brokered deposits may be charged higher premiums in order to bring back the reserve to an acceptable size .
" I think that is something we need to factor into our premiums and charge higher premiums to banks that fit that profile , " she said in the interview , noting that the IndyMac failure was a big factor in the need for additional funds in the deposit insurance fund .
This means higher premiums for FDIC insured banks , analyst Ely noted , further complicating an already tenuous situation for the U.S. banking system .
Banks will most likely pass the increased costs onto their customers , he said .
" Banks are going to pass it through to their customers through higher interest rates on loans , lower interest on deposit , " Ely predicted .
The FDIC has around $ 53 billion set aside to back up bank deposits up to $ 100,000 per depositor , one of the ways the organization is designed to ensure confidence in the banking industry .
However , according to Ely , that $ 53 billion is " not really available . "
" The deposit insurance fund is as real as the social security trust fund , " Ely said , noting that only a " small fraction " of the $ 53 billion is actually available and " any losses beyond that will be assessed on the banks . "
The reserve , as of March 31 , was valued at $ 52.843 billion , or 1.19 percent of the total insured deposits of $ 4.431 trillion .
According to the Deposit Insurance Reform Act , the
FDIC must have at minimum 1.15 percent of all insured deposits in the fund , with a target rate of 1.25 percent .
The failure of IndyMac , which is estimated to cost the deposit fund at minimum $ 4 billion , brings the target below 1.15 percent , forcing the FDIC to adopt a restoration plan that will restore the Deposit fund to 1.15 percent within 5 years , according to the Reform Act .
" The $ 4 billion loss would drop the fund down to about 1.10 ratio , " Ely explained .
" The FDIC is going to be obligated of an increase in premiums to pay for that loss , so the only monies that are available $ 2.843 billion in the fund , of that $ 50.966 billion was not available . "
Ely noted that any loss over $ 1.877 billion would have brought the ratio below 1.15 percent , meaning that losses are going to have to be assessed back to the banks .

An Aiken County Sheriff 's Office deputy has been fired and charged with attacking a teenager this weekend and jailing him on trumped - up charges .
Jeffrey S. Nation , 40 is charged with assault and battery and misconduct in office , said Lt. Michael Frank , an Aiken County Sheriff 's Office spokesperson .
On Sunday , the deputy arrested Lorenzo Williams Jr. , 18 , of Richmond Circle in New Ellenton , claiming the 18 - year - old tried to head butt him when he stopped him walking in the area of Green and Jackson streets .
Williams never tried to head butt the deputy , Frank said .
The incident was captured on police video and there was no such attempted attack , he added .
Williams was with a few other teens when the deputy told him to pull up his sagging pants .
Rather than doing that , Williams pulled his shirt down to cover his exposed underwear , Frank said .
" At that point , Nation stopped the car and got out and asked the man for his ID , " he added .
Williams was standing at the hood of the patrol car during the interview on the side of the road when the deputy struck Williams in the throat , Frank said .
It was unprovoked , he added .
Nation then arrested Williams and charged him with assault and disorderly conduct on the trumped - up allegations that the teenager had attempted to attack him .
He took the New Ellenton man to the Aiken County detention center where he was detained .
" When I learned of the deputy 's behavior , I immediately realized the seriousness of the situation and requested SLED conduct a criminal investigation and take appropriate action , " said Sheriff Michael Hunt .
" I apologize to the young man , his family and our community because this kind of behavior is unacceptable by any law enforcement officer .
" Nation apparently brought a copy of the patrol car video to his supervisors for their review , who then handed the tape up the chain of command .
" They recognized there was a problem and they contacted the uniform patrol captain who agreed and brought it to the chief deputy and the sheriff , " Frank said .
The charges against the teen have been dropped .
Nation was fired Tuesday morning .
In 2004 , Nation was suspended from the sheriff 's office for a use - of - force incident , but at press time the particulars of that incident were not available .

Table of contents is often considered to be one of the most unspectacular design elements ever invented .
Because of its simple , usual form , table of contents is often not given the attention it may deserve — after all , it is just a list of the parts of a book or document organized in the order in which the parts appear .
But why not use exactly that and surprise the reader of a booklet , brochure , annual report or a book with some beautiful and original table of contents ?
In fact , many creative approaches are possible .
And this post attempts to prove exactly that .

But why not use exactly that and surprise the reader of a booklet , brochure , annual report or a book with some beautiful and original table of contents ?
In fact , many creative approaches are possible .
And this post attempts to prove exactly that .
This post showcases creative and / or beautiful tables of contents .
We have tried to include creative , visually appealing and interesting design solutions .
Hopefully , everybody will find something interesting and unusual for herself or himself .
Please take a look at the references section at the end of the article — there you may find further examples of interesting and unusual tables of contents .
You may want to take a look at our related posts
Please notice : some photos look not beautiful at all — here the idea matters more than the quality of the screenshot .
The showcased tables of contents are n’t necessarily useful in practice as they may be hard to read ; they should serve as the inspiration for your future works and show you that even in the design of table of contents some unusual approaches are possible .
Creative and beautiful examples
So how beautiful or creative can a table of contents be ?

A new poll released this morning by Quinnipiac University found that Barack Obama leads John McCain in Florida , Ohio , and Pennsylvania , but the race is getting tighter in each state .
In Florida , Obama ’s lead has been cut in half from 47 % - 43 % to 46 % - 44 % .
In Ohio , Obama has lost four points from 48 % - 42 % down to 46 % - 44 % .
Pennsylvania still remains strong for Obama , but his lead dropped from eleven points in June to 49 % - 42 % today .
In Ohio and Florida , voters are split by gender .
Obama leads with women , and McCain leads with men .
In Florida , Obama leads with women 47 % - 42 % and McCain with men 47 % - 45 % .
In Ohio , Obama leads with women , 47 % - 44 % , and men were split , 46 % - 45 % for Obama .
The story is different in Pennsylvania where Obama leads with both men and women .
He leads with men , 48 % - 44 % , and with women , 50 % - 39 % .
In Florida ( 51% - 41 % ) and Ohio ( 48%- 41 % ) McCain leads with voters over 55 , but in Pennsylvania these voters are tied at 45 % .
As expected , Obama dominates with young voters in each state .
He leads McCain by 39 % in Florida , 22 % in Ohio , and 23 % in Pennsylvania with voters 18 - 34 .
It is the middle group , voters age 35 - 54 that is proving critical .
In Florida , McCain leads with this group , 47 % - 45 % .
In Ohio , Obama leads 48 % - 44 % .
In Pennsylvania , Obama leads 49 % - 41 % .

All three states agree that the economy and the war are the two most important issues of the campaign , but energy policy is becoming a big topic as well .
Voters are split on who has the better energy policy .
In Florida , they favor McCain 34 % - 32 % with 34 % undecided .
In Ohio , they favor Obama 34%- 33 % with 33 % undecided , and in Pennsylvania voters favor Obama ’s plan 36% - 30 % with 34 % undecided .
By almost 2 to 1 margins voters in each state support McCain ’s offshore drilling plan , but they believe that alternative energy is the best solution .
As a solution , voters in Florida favored alternative energy to offshore drilling , 51 % - 22 % .
In Ohio , the margin was a little larger , 57 % - 20 % .
In Pennsylvania , the margin was 55 % - 18 % .
Using these numbers it is plain to see why the candidates are splitting the energy vote .
Respondents in these states like McCain ’s plan to drill offshore , but also like Obama ’s push for alternative energy .
The overall message from voters is that we need to be doing anything and everything to bring gas prices down .
Obama ’s foreign trip does n’t seem to have helped him .
It seems that voters are more concerned with the economy and energy issues than they are with world affairs .
Since 1960 , no candidate has won the presidency without carrying two of these three states .
I think Obama will carry Pennsylvania , and McCain will take Florida , so just like in 2004 , Ohio will be the critical state .
It should n’t be any surprise that this race is getting closer .
Obama ’s nomination bounce is over , and we probably wo n’t see movement in the polls until September , when the race really begins .

" This is an untenable position for our clients because the governor has so strongly stated that the subpoenas issued by your committee are of questionable validity , " Colberg wrote .
Palin stonewalls just like Dick Cheney and George Bush .
First she agrees to cooperate , then she tries to delay and derail the investigation by moving it to an agency under executive rather than legislative control .
Losing that battle , she says " Never Mind " and refuses to cooperate .
Now , her employees are doing the same .
We 've had enough of Dick Cheney - style politics .
If Alaska wants to put up with Palin 's antics , that 's its business .
But there 's no reason to inflict her lies and distortions of her record or her lack of preparedness and qualifications to lead on the rest of us .
The bloom will come off the rose , let 's just hope voters get it by November 4 .
I think they will .
A dachshund with " dayblindness " wears specially designed sunglasses A genetic mutation in dachshunds could help uncover the roots of some inherited forms of blindness in humans , say scientists .
Cone - rod dystrophies are caused by progressive cell loss in the retina .
Dachshunds are particularly prone to similar conditions , and US and Norwegian researchers spotted an altered gene which may play a role .
Writing in the journal Genome Research , they said research on the similar gene in humans might lead to new therapies .
The problem is that there is a wide range of underlying defects and we have n't got a magic bullet which can target these all at once
Professor David Hunt
Institute of Ophthalmology Cone - rod dystrophies are relatively rare , and can lead at first to " day - blindness " , in which vision in bright light is affected , then to full loss of vision .
It can start as early as childhood .
Other researchers have already identified genetic variations which seem to contribute to these conditions , but the latest research suggests that its genetic causes could be complex .
Genetic tests Inherited vision disorders are more common in dogs , and Dr Frode Lingaas of the Norwegian School of Veterinary Science isolated a particular part of a canine chromosome , and then a particular gene , called NPHP4 , a portion of which had been deleted in affected dachshunds .
Dr Lingaas said : " This gene has been associated with a combination of kidney and eye disease in human patients .
" Here , we found a mutation which affects only the eyes , suggesting this gene might be a candidate for human patients with eye disease only . "
He said that , even in the dog world , this could be a useful discovery , opening the way to genetic tests to help breed out some disorders .
However , he said the findings could make the development of human treatments easier .
Professor David Hunt , from the Institute of Ophthalmology , said that the finding could help scientists understand cone - rod dystrophies in some people .
Some , he said , were looking for ways to reverse similar conditions using gene therapy .
He said : " It is a wide spectrum of conditions , not just one .
" The problem is that there is a wide range of underlying defects and we have n't got a magic bullet which can target these all at once . "
Sonal Rughani , from the Royal National Institute of Blind People , said : " This research is really exciting as it helps our understanding of the genetic basis of cone - rod dystrophies in humans .
" Following significant further research , this technique could facilitate the development of new treatments in the future . "

What are these ?
Um , does n't it kind of defeat the whole spirit of riffing if the movie is actually good , or at the very least competently made ?
I mean , sure , I can understand making fun of Attack of the Clones , but Alien ?
Shit .
One of the defining traits of the Joel era of MST was that the movies were n't merely obscure or mediocre B - movies ; they were berserkly awful cinematic abortions with no technical or artistic merit whatsoever .
Joe Don Baker as a sex symbol ?
Sidehaxploitation ?
A crummy Japanese ripoff of Planet of the Apes ?
The only rational response was to riff .
That 's what 's great about Cinematic Titanic : so far , the movies have been up to ( or is it beneath ? ) the standards of the old MST .
Take The Oozing Skull , a horror movie from the early ' 70s about a mad scientist who transplants the brain of a Middle Eastern dictator into the body of a hideously deformed backwoods simpleton .
Just summarizing the flick is an insult to rational thought .
It feels like 1991 all over again !

WILMINGTON , Mass . --
Sam Hoger entered the ring to the song “ Welcome to the Jungle ” and weighing 251 pounds .
The smiley “ thief ” of season one of “ The Ultimate Fighter ” then had his first fight in 17 months , and it was over almost instantly .
Even Hoger looked surprised when the referee stepped in just 17 seconds after he had dropped his 289 - pound opponent and landed some additional shots .
It was n’t much , and almost definitely less than Hoger traveled all the way from Houston for .
“ I ’m looking to be better , ” Hoger said .
“ Right now , I ’m just going to wait for the next fight .
I want to fight .
I ’m hungry .
” Hoger defeated a corn-rowed , tattooed 289 - pounder from Maine named Jason “ The Angry Man ” Dolloff , who took the place of Brandon Bice , who took a fight too close to the Hoger bout to pass medical requirements .
Hoger signed Polaroids afterward and hammed it up .
“ Let ’s go eat some junk food ! ”
Hoger told friends at ringside as fans emptied out of the building .
The win capped off the fourth promotional effort by World Championship Fighting , which is quickly becoming the prime proving ground for New England fighters .
The card drew a loud crowd of about 3,000 to the Aleppo Shriners Auditorium in Wilmington , Mass .
The events are promoted by Joe Cavallaro , a longtime friend of UFC President Dana White and manager to several New England - bred fighters , including Kenny Florian and Marcus Davis .
HDNet cameras were on hand to film highlights for “ Inside MMA , ” and ring announcer Chris Collins conducted postfight interviews for the first time .
In the co-main event , Wilmington ’s own Dan Bonnell extended his win streak to four with an emphatic victory over a 10 - 2 Joe Cushman , a strong prospect who was cornered by Joe and Dan Lauzon .
The featherweight fight , which had all the makings of a drawn - out war , ended in a flash as Bonnell clipped Cushman with a right hand early and pounced for the TKO in just 19 seconds .
“ It ’s a huge , huge win for me , ” said Bonnell , who trains out of Renzo Gracie New Hampshire and has fought and won on all four WCF cards .
“ He ’s by far my toughest fight I ever had .
” A dejected Cushman made no excuses .
“ I wanted it to go 15 minutes , you know , ( with ) blood , everything , ” he said .
“ I do n’t know what happened .
” Bobby Dias and Stephen Stengel came out of their corners with kicks that put both on the ground early .
After several scurries on the ground , Dias , who had the first great fight in the WCF against Bobby McMaster in September 2007 , secured the guillotine choke to take the 170 - pound tilt .
At light heavyweight , Philadelphia ’s Lamont Lister took on Scott Rehm , who brought a star - studded corner to the ring .
The Sityodtong fighter was cornered by Mark DellaGrotte and Kenny and Keith Florian , who recently opened their own gym in Brookline , Mass .
The hard - fought bout went into an overtime round , where the Florians screamed pointers to a tiring Rehm .
Sweat flew in the third , and Rehm , though exhausted after taking the fight on short notice , appeared to notch a unanimous decision .
But a ringside scorekeeper made a mistake in naming Rehm ’s corner the winner -- a decision that drew boos from the crowd .
Ring announcer Chris Collins announced the mix - up , and Lister was declared the winner .
“ It felt good hearing my name in the end , ” Rehm said .
“ But if they say he won the fight , he won the fight .
” Local standout John Benoit , a Renzo Gracie New Hampshire product and longtime wrestler , improved to 6 - 0 after weathering an early barrage from Davin Wesinger .
Benoit swiftly secured a rear - naked choke in the first after the lightweight fight had hit the floor , then signaled he was ready for a shot at a title belt , which the WCF has not yet created .
Asked whom he wanted to fight next , Benoit challenged someone from his hometown who he said was in attendance but did n’t step forward .
World Championship Fighting returns Nov. 14 to the Shriners Auditorium , a venue with which the promotion recently signed a two - year agreement .

The 2nd quarter 2008 preliminary GDP numbers are out .
Real gross domestic product -- the output of goods and services produced by labor and property located in the United States -- increased at an annual rate of 3.3 percent in the second quarter of 2008 , ( that is , from the first quarter to the second quarter ) , according to preliminary estimates released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis .
In the first quarter , real GDP increased 0.9 percent .
The increase in real GDP in the second quarter primarily reflected positive contributions from exports , personal consumption expenditures ( PCE ) , federal government spending , nonresidential structures , and state and local government spending that were partly offset by negative contributions from private inventory investment , residential fixed investment , and equipment and software .
Imports , which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP , decreased .
Incomes Lag , Corporate Profits Down
The meager gains in earnings over the last year signal the U.S. economy is in much deeper trouble than the growth estimates indicate , economists said .
Gross domestic income ( GDI ) , or the money earned by the people , businesses and government agencies whose purchases go into calculating gross domestic product , rose 0.3 percent in the 12 months ended in June after adjusting for inflation , according to Bloomberg calculations based on today 's Commerce Department growth report .
GDP expanded 2.2 percent .
" The income side of the economy , with profits down for four straight quarters and employment falling , looks like a recession , " said John Ryding , chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York .
" What you are seeing is more legitimate economic weakness in the income numbers , " said James O'Sullivan , a senior economist at UBS Securities LLC in Stamford , Connecticut .
" The GDI numbers raise the potential that GDP is overstating growth . "
The 1.9 percentage - point difference between the GDI and GDP over the last 12 months is the biggest in the post World War II era .
Corporate profits were down 7 percent in the year to June , the biggest drop since the last economic contraction in 2001 , according to the Commerce Department .
" I 'm looking at the labor market , and the GDP income numbers make more sense , " said Ryding .
" It certainly did not feel like 3.3 percent growth . "
The disparity between income and growth may take a long time to be resolved , if ever .
Once Commerce issues its final estimate for second quarter growth next month , the figures will not be updated again until the annual benchmark revisions are issued in July 2009 .
Last Hurrah ?
" The second quarter GDP numbers will mark the economy 's last hurrah , " said Sal Guatieri , a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto .
" Exports will continue to expand , but at a much slower pace . "
Separately , initial jobless claims will remain near a six - year high , indicating the job market has weakened , economists forecast a Labor Department report at the same time will show .
Applications fell to 425,000 , from 432,000 a week earlier , according to the survey median .
Claims totaled 457,000 in the week ended Aug. 1 , the most since March 2002 .
A weakening labor market is one reason consumer spending is likely to slow after the government sent out about $ 92 billion in tax rebate checks .
The U.S. has lost 463,000 jobs so far this year and wages have n't kept up with inflation , according to Labor Department data .
The longest expansion in consumer spending on record will probably end this year , according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg earlier this month .
Retail sales fell in July for the first time in five months , led by a slump in auto purchases , according to Commerce data .
Government Consumption Expenditures
Real federal government consumption expenditures and gross investment increased 6.8 percent in the second quarter , compared with an increase of 5.8 percent in the first .
National defense increased 7.4 percent , compared with an increase of 7.3 percent .
Nondefense increased 5.5 percent , compared with an increase of 2.9 percent .
Real state and local government consumption expenditures and gross investment increased 2.2 percent , in contrast to a decrease of 0.3 percent .
GDP Deflator Manipulation
Part of the reason the GDP number looked so good was because the GDP price index for the second quarter was marked at just 1.2 .
In other words , BEA subtracted from nominal GDP 1.2 % in order to produce their version of " real " ( inflation - adjusted ) GDP .
[ Mish Note : The CPI is running at 5.6 % .
A reasonable person would have expected the GDP deflator to be somewhere near 5.6 % as opposed to 1.2 % but a reasonable person would have been wrong .
GDP would have been negative if a lager deflator was used . ]
Mike Panzner sends along the chart below , along with these comments :
" Call me a skeptic , but based on the accompanying graph of the GDP inflation figure and headline CPI ( which most people already believe is lower than reality ) , there seems to be something of a disconnect between the two ( which would imply , of course , that U.S. economic growth is a lot lower than reported ) . "

Hedonics And Imputations
The BEA treats homeowners as businesses , which pay rent to themselves .
Therefore , homeowners contribute to the real estate industry 's GSP even if not employed by the industry .
In addition , like businesses , homeowners ' property taxes paid to state and local governments are included as part of real estate TOPI .
Today , I ’m going to provide you with three tips on how to get your ex back .
A lot of people trying to find ways to get that person back they feel they lost and let slip out of their hands , and they want to reconcile things .
I want to give you what you looking for .
I want to help you in achieving that goal of getting your ex back .
Here are three important tips if you want to make this happen .
Tip number one .
Correct the issue that led to the breakup in the first place .
Listen , there ’s no factor in attempting to obtain your ex back if the same concern that broke you 2 up exists .
Whether that exists within you , within them , in the dynamic of the relationship .
One - way or another , you have to correct and resolve that .
Because even if you successfully get them back without fixing those things .
You ’re most likely to be headed for an additional break up .
There ’s no point if you ca n’t get to the root of the issues and correct them so take time .
Again , if it ’s an issue within yourself let ’s say , for example , you have insecurity issues due to past relationships .
We ’ll listen , start to get some healing .
Go see a counselor , go see a coach .
See someone so that you can sit down and unpack these things and work through them so that when you come back , you can come back more confident , more secure within yourself .
Therefore you can increase your chances of getting that person back .
Tip number two
Now , that makes catch you by surprise but let me help you understand what I ’m saying .
I see so many people wallowing in misery , trying to get their ex back .
Essentially trying to pity party their ex into taking them back .
Trying to use sympathy and I can’t live without you and all these things .
Listen , to a certain extent , there ’s nothing wrong with expressing your emotions and expressing your deep love for them , but it makes you look weak , to be honest with you .
It looks bad .
Who wants to be around that negativity
or that misery that you ’re exuding ?
Granted it ’s stemming from the fact that you do n’t have them so you may think that makes them feel better or that would warm their hearts so to speak to you .
To some degree , it can , however , when you exude positivity , confidence , happiness , it draws them to you , and makes them say , “ Damn , maybe I need to have them back in my life . ”
“ Maybe I missed out .
” You have to give them something to desire and so finding your happiness will create or will increase your chances of them wanting to be back with you or willing to be back with you .
Do n’t stay focused on what you do n’t have .
Do n’t stay focused on the fact that they ’re not with you right now .
Obtain focused on what you can do to enhance your life .
The side effect of this is that if by some chance you do n’t get them back –I know your goal is to get them back , but if you do n’t get them back .
Well , at least you would have used your time wisely and set yourself up for great things to come .
Whether that be continuing as a single person or when a new relationship presents itself , so work on you , find your happiness .
Now , before we get to
Tip number three
I got to say something and you ’re not going to like this .
Here is the reality .
You may not need to get back with your ex .
The reality is that you ’ve got to be honest with yourself about
was this person truly the best person for you ?
Was there an authentic connection ?
Before you go diving into trying to find all the ways to get them back make sure you need to get back with them .
You should be with them and they are someone you can move forward within life and create a great , happy relationship .
Again , I know that ’s not what you want to hear .
But it ’s my job to tell you the truth that you need to hear ,
and some of you do n’t need to get that ex back .
But let ’s say they are that person for you .
You can have a happy relationship with them and there is a connection .
Here is tip number three .
You ’ve got to be patient .
Listen , Rome was n’t constructed in a day .
I do n’t know why that came to me just now , but the fact of the matter is you ’ve got to be willing to trust the process
and the timing of things .
You ca n’t force your ex to want you or to be with you when you ’re ready .
You got to understand that they ’ve got to go through some things as well
and it may take time .
Again , refer back to number two on this list .
Find your happiness in the meantime .
Work on you in the meantime but be patient and yes , it can happen

In a statement seeking to silence suspicions surrounding relatives of the slain 6 - year - old , prosecutors said new testing techniques on male DNA found on JonBenet ’s clothes did not match any family members .
“ This new scientific evidence convinces us that it is appropriate ... to state that we do not consider your immediate family , including you , your wife Patsy , and your son Burke , to be under any suspicion in the commission of this crime , ” Boulder County District Attorney Mary Lacy said in a letter to JonBenet ’s father , John Ramsey .
JonBenet Ramsey was found beaten and strangled in the basement of her parents ’ home in Boulder , Colorado , on December 26 , 1996 .
Videos of the tiny blonde competing in child beauty pageants , and the suspicion surrounding her parents , made headlines around the world .
No one has ever been charged .
JonBenet ’s mother , Patsy , died of ovarian cancer in 2006 , still fighting to clear her name .
“ The suspicions about the Ramseys in this case created an ongoing living hell for the Ramsey family and their friends , which added to their suffering from the unexplained and devastating loss of JonBenet , ” Lacy said in a separate statement on Wednesday .
Lacy apologized for the distress caused to the Ramseys and said she wished her office could have cleared them before Patsy Ramsey died .
The new tests were done on DNA samples taken from long johns and underwear worn by JonBenet at the time of her death .
Prosecutors now believe the DNA profile belongs to the unknown perpetrator of the crime , she said .
The DNA profile has been entered into a national crime database but no matches have turned up , Lacy said .
The murder made headlines again two years ago when an American teacher living in Thailand , John Mark Karr , claimed he was involved in JonBenet ’s death .
DNA tests proved he was not at the scene of the crime .
Ever wondered why retailers price goods at $ 4.99 rather than $ 5.00 ?
Here is the best scientific explanation I read :
Why Things Cost $ 19.95 , by Wray Herbert , SciAm Mind Matters : ... [ M]ost of us are motivated by the desire for a fair deal , and we employ some sophisticated cognitive tools to weigh offers , fashion responses , and so forth — all the to - and - fro in getting to an agreement .
But how does life ’s dickering play out in the brain ?
And is it a trustworthy tool for getting what we want ?
Psychologists have been studying cognitive bartering for some time , and several basics are well established .
For example , an opening “ bid ” of any sort is usually perceived as a mental anchor , a starting point for the psychological jockeying to follow .
...
What makes us settle on a response ?
University of Florida marketing professors Chris Janiszewski and Dan
Uy suspected that ... some characteristic of the opening bid itself might influence ... bidding behavior .
In particular , they wanted to see if the degree of precision of the opening bid might be important to how the brain acts at an auction .
Or , to put it in more familiar terms :
Are we really fooled when storekeepers price something at $ 19.95 instead of a round 20 bucks ?
Janiszewski and Uy ran a series of tests to explore this idea .
The experiments used hypothetical scenarios , in which participants were required to make a variety of “ educated guesses . ”
For example , they had subjects think about a scenario in which they were buying a high - definition plasma TV and asked them to guesstimate the wholesale cost .
The participants were told the retail price , plus the fact that the retailer had a reputation for pricing TVs competitively .
There were three scenarios involving different retail prices : one group of buyers was given a price of $ 5,000 , another was given a price of $ 4,988 , and the third was told $ 5,012 .
When all the buyers were asked to estimate the wholesale price , those with the $ 5,000 price tag in their head guessed much lower than those contemplating the more precise retail prices .
That is , they moved farther away from the mental anchor .
What is more , those who started with the round number as their mental anchor were much more likely to guess a wholesale price that was also in round numbers .
The scientists ran this experiment again and again with different scenarios and always got the same result .
Why would this happen ?
As Janiszewski and Uy explain ... , people appear to create mental measuring sticks that run in increments away from any opening bid , and the size of the increments depends on the opening bid .
That is , if we see a $ 20 toaster , we might wonder whether it is worth $ 19 or $ 18 or $ 21 ; we are thinking in round numbers .
But if the starting point is $ 19.95 , the mental measuring stick would look different .
We might still think it is wrongly priced , but in our minds we are thinking about nickels and dimes instead of dollars , so a fair comeback might be $ 19.75 or $ 19.50 .
The psychologists decided to check these lab findings in the real world .
They looked at five years of real estate sales in Alachua County , Florida , comparing list prices and actual sale prices of homes .
They found that sellers who listed their homes more precisely — say $ 494,500 as opposed to $ 500,000 — consistently got closer to their asking price .
...
Furthermore , houses listed in round numbers lost more value if they sat on the market for a couple of months .
So , bottom line : one way to deal with a buyer ’s market may be to pick an exact list price to begin with .

Guess which Republican US Senate candidate said ….
“ … No more passing the buck … the party in power is responsible . ”
As it stands , “ we ’re headed for a dictatorship . ”
On his shocking primary victory a few months ago , the candidate explained “ I wanted to have fun…nobody is responsible , really . ”
When asked about his long - term plans for the country , he stated “ I would keep the president as a figurehead . ”
After hearing news of his unlikely victory he proclaimed , “ Honest to goodness , I see the hand of the Almighty in this . ”
More clues about the mystery man …
He was an inexplicable upset victor in the primary this year , defeating four other candidates …he has monstrously bushy eyebrows …he has run for elected seats in Montana as a Democrat , Green Party candidate and , most recently , a Republican .
If you still do n’t know … .
You should have read my article about Bob Kelleher a month ago !!
Seriously , this guy is a riot and someone to use as torture for your Republican friends during the slow months leading up to the election .
Never mind that his hopes for victory in November are slim .
Never mind that he wants to do away with our government and replace it with a parliamentary system -
The man is 85 and has run for office 16 times in the last 44 years , mostly for the Democrats and the Green Party .
Now , in 2008 he finally managed some electoral success running as a Republican this year – go figure !
And it is n’t just his pro-parliament views that make this man a Republican anomaly .
He has been known to tear up when discussing the problems facing Americans today .
He believes healthcare is a right and should be paid for with tax dollars .
He ’s said that government exists to serve the common good and the US ’ trade and tax policies are to blame for the disparity in wealth between the rich and the poor today .
On the other hand , he is pro-life - but that is about all I have learned about him that fits the profile of a Republican .
There is a new website promoting the wisdom of this mysterious bushy - browed man called Eyebrows over Highbrows and you should check it out .
Montana is turning into a major site of overhaul for both major parties .
The past few years have seen a new generation of Democrats seizing power in the state like Brian Schweitzer and Jon Tester .
And now , on the Republican side , a victory in the June primary for Bob Kelleher , a progressive whose views on government are frankly unclassifiable , but whose message bears almost no resemblance to that of most Republicans I know .
If you have n’t heard of this rogue cowboy senatorial candidate , check out his website and his fan site .
It is at least worth a laugh , but who knows ?
Perhaps it will also open the door to the world of Montana politics and even generate some much - needed debate about what it means to be a Republican today .
( CNN ) --
One person was killed and another injured in a chemical plant explosion late Thursday near Charleston , West Virginia .
Sterling Lewis Jr. , West Virginia 's fire marshal , told reporters Friday morning that a helicopter took the injured person to a burn unit in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania .
Several thousand people were ordered to stay indoors for safety early Friday after the 10:30 p.m. Thursday blast at the Bayer CropScience plant raised fears about air quality .
The plant produces crop-protection chemicals in Institute , an unincorporated community in Kanawha County , West Virginia .
Jeannie Young , 38 , turned off air conditioners , closed vents and taped windows shut at her St. Albans home after the nearby explosion .
" My daughter and I have headaches , " Young said .
She said she smelled something unusual and noticed something odd after taking her three dogs out around 11 p.m. Thursday .
" They acted really funny , " she said .
" They wanted to come right back in the house . "
Watch how the plant blast puts a scare into West Virginians »
Young endured a few hours of anxiety with her 15 - year - old daughter , Brittney , as authorities closed parts of Interstate 64 and fought a blaze at the plant .
" It was , like , really scary at first , " Brittney said .
Emergency officials in Kanawha County ordered people to stay inside in the cities of South Charleston , Cross Lane , Dunbar and St. Albans , where the Youngs live about four miles from the plant .

Authorities lifted the order about 2:15 a.m. after the Bayer CropScience plant told the county that the explosion did not send contaminants into the air , said Carolyn Charnoch , director of the 911 system in Kanawha County .
The blast sent flames leaping into the night sky , casting an orange glow on industrial towers , but firefighters had extinguished the blaze by about 2 a.m. , she said .
A few people complained of a foul odor , she said , but authorities had not heard from anyone complaining of health problems related to air quality , Charnoch said .
Mike Dorsey of the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection sought to reassure people that the air was safe to breath .
The plant contains potentially dangerous chemicals , he said , but the explosion did not release them into the air .
" People should not be concerned about coming outside , " he said .

Governor Palin , the Republican nominee for vice president , was scheduled to speak today at a rally in Dag Hammarskjold Plaza to protest the appearance here of President Ahmadinejad of Iran .
Her appearance was canceled by rally organizers who sought a nonpolitical event .
Following are the remarks Mrs. Palin would have given :
Click Image to Enlarge ROBYN BECK / 2008 AFP
Sarah Palin
***
I am honored to be with you and with leaders from across this great country  leaders from different faiths and political parties united in a single voice of outrage .
Tomorrow , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad will come to New York  to the heart of what he calls the Great Satan  and speak freely in this , a country whose demise he has called for .
Ahmadinejad may choose his words carefully , but underneath all of the rhetoric is an agenda that threatens all who seek a safer and freer world .
We gather here today to highlight the Iranian dictator 's intentions and to call for action to thwart him .
He must be stopped .
The world must awake to the threat this man poses to all of us .
Ahmadinejad denies that the Holocaust ever took place .
He dreams of being an agent in a " Final Solution "  the elimination of the Jewish people .
He has called Israel a " stinking corpse " that is " on its way to annihilation . "
Such talk cannot be dismissed as the ravings of a madman  not when Iran just this summer tested long - range Shahab - 3 missiles capable of striking Tel Aviv , not when the Iranian nuclear program is nearing completion , and not when Iran sponsors terrorists that threaten and kill innocent people around the world .
The Iranian government wants nuclear weapons .
The International Atomic Energy Agency reports that Iran is running at least 3,800 centrifuges and that its uranium enrichment capacity is rapidly improving .
According to news reports , U.S. intelligence agencies believe the Iranians may have enough nuclear material to produce a bomb within a year .
The world has condemned these activities .
The United Nations Security Council has demanded that Iran suspend its illegal nuclear enrichment activities .
It has levied three rounds of sanctions .
How has Ahmadinejad responded ?
With the declaration that the " Iranian nation would not retreat one iota " from its nuclear program .
So , what should we do about this growing threat ?
First , we must succeed in Iraq .
If we fail there , it will jeopardize the democracy the Iraqis have worked so hard to build , and empower the extremists in neighboring Iran .
Iran has armed and trained terrorists who have killed our soldiers in Iraq , and it is Iran that would benefit from an American defeat in Iraq .
If we retreat without leaving a stable Iraq , Iran 's nuclear ambitions will be bolstered .
If Iran acquires nuclear weapons  they could share them tomorrow with the terrorists they finance , arm , and train today .
Iranian nuclear weapons would set off a dangerous regional nuclear arms race that would make all of us less safe .
But Iran is not only a regional threat ; it threatens the entire world .
It is the no. 1 state sponsor of terrorism .
It sponsors the world 's most vicious terrorist groups , Hamas and Hezbollah .
Together , Iran and its terrorists are responsible for the deaths of Americans in Lebanon in the 1980s , in Saudi Arabia in the 1990s , and in Iraq today .
They have murdered Iraqis , Lebanese , Palestinians , and other Muslims who have resisted Iran 's desire to dominate the region .
They have persecuted countless people simply because they are Jewish .
Iran is responsible for attacks not only on Israelis , but on Jews living as far away as Argentina .
Anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial are part of Iran 's official ideology and murder is part of its official policy .
Not even Iranian citizens are safe from their government 's threat to those who want to live , work , and worship in peace .
Politically - motivated abductions , torture , death by stoning , flogging , and amputations are just some of its state - sanctioned punishments .
It is said that the measure of a country is the treatment of its most vulnerable citizens .
By that standard , the Iranian government is both oppressive and barbaric .
Under Ahmadinejad 's rule , Iranian women are some of the most vulnerable citizens .
If an Iranian woman shows too much hair in public , she risks being beaten or killed .
If she walks down a public street in clothing that violates the state dress code , she could be arrested .
But in the face of this harsh regime , the Iranian women have shown courage .
Despite threats to their lives and their families , Iranian women have sought better treatment through the " One Million Signatures Campaign Demanding Changes to Discriminatory Laws . "
The authorities have reacted with predictable barbarism .
Last year , women 's rights activist Delaram Ali was sentenced to 20 lashes and 10 months in prison for committing the crime of " propaganda against the system . "
After international protests , the judiciary reduced her sentence to " only " 10 lashes and 36 months in prison and then temporarily suspended her sentence .
She still faces the threat of imprisonment .
Earlier this year , Senator Clinton said that " Iran is seeking nuclear weapons , and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps is in the forefront of that " effort .
Senator Clinton argued that part of our response must include stronger sanctions , including the designation of the IRGC as a terrorist organization .
John McCain and I could not agree more .
Senator Clinton understands the nature of this threat and what we must do to confront it .
This is an issue that should unite all Americans .
Iran should not be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons .
Period .
And in a single voice , we must be loud enough for the whole world to hear : Stop Iran !
Only by working together , across national , religious , and political differences , can we alter this regime 's dangerous behavior .
Iran has many vulnerabilities , including a regime weakened by sanctions and a population eager to embrace opportunities with the West .
We must increase economic pressure to change Iran 's behavior .
Tomorrow , Ahmadinejad will come to New York .
On our soil , he will exercise the right of freedom of speech  a right he denies his own people .
He will share his hateful agenda with the world .
Our task is to focus the world on what can be done to stop him .
We must rally the world to press for truly tough sanctions at the U.N. or with our allies if Iran 's allies continue to block action in the U.N .
We must start with restrictions on Iran 's refined petroleum imports .
We must reduce our dependency on foreign oil to weaken Iran 's economic influence .
We must target the regime 's assets abroad ; bank accounts , investments , and trading partners .
President Ahmadinejad should be held accountable for inciting genocide , a crime under international law .
We must sanction Iran 's Central Bank and the Revolutionary Guard Corps  which no one should doubt is a terrorist organization .
Together , we can stop Iran 's nuclear program .
Senator McCain has made a solemn commitment that I strongly endorse : Never again will we risk another Holocaust .
And this is not a wish , a request , or a plea to Israel 's enemies .
This is a promise that the United States and Israel will honor , against any enemy who cares to test us .
It is John McCain 's promise and it is my promise .
Thank you .
HONG KONG ( Reuters ) - Mature brains need a continuous supply of new nerve cells to sustain functions like smelling and memory , an experiment with mice in Japan has shown .
While the adult brain can make new nerve cells , experts have never been sure of their roles until now .
These findings may explain why some stroke survivors never recover certain faculties because their brains no longer generate new cells .
In an article published in Nature Neuroscience , the researchers said they found a way to insert a fluorescent protein into adult mice , which helped identify new brain cells .
Over the course of a year , they found that nearly all nerve cells in the olfactory bulb -- responsible for smelling -- had been replaced with new ones .
New nerve cells were also seen in the hippocampus , which is linked to memory .
“ These mice were normal and we could tell which were new nerve cells ... and they should be functional , ” Ryoichiro Kageyama , director and professor at the Institute for Virus Research in Kyoto University told Reuters by telephone .
“ We believe those neurons are very important for olfactory system ( sense of smell ) . ”
In another group of adult mice , the researchers blocked their ability to grow new brain nerve cells .
“ Normal mice quickly learn which hole to get to where it ’s dark and has bedding .
For the mutants , they learn where to hide , but after a week , they totally forget , they completely lose their memory , ” said Kageyama .
However , this group of mice continued to be able to smell four months into the experiment .
The researchers are waiting to see if that faculty might be affected further out .
“ We are waiting a while more to see if there could be loss of the sense of smell , ” Kageyama said .
He added that the findings had implications for people suffering brain damage .
“ In some damaged brains , like after a stroke , there is no neurogenesis ( generation of new brain cells ) .
We are interested in knowing where nerve cells come from , and whether we can stimulate neurogenesis , ” he said .
Israeli troops have shot a 14 - year - old Palestinian dead near Nablus , saying he was holding a petrol bomb in an area of the West Bank where Arabs and Jewish settlers have clashed violently this month .
An army spokeswoman said the soldiers fired in self - defence near the settlement of Yitzhar , whose residents were last week accused by Israel 's Prime Minister of mounting a " pogrom " on a nearby Palestinian village after a Jewish child was stabbed .
Palestinians from Asira al - Kabaliya , where settlers went on a rampage last Saturday , named the dead youth as 14 - year - old Suhaib Saleh .
They said his brother was also shot dead at Yitzhar six years ago after he had wounded two Israeli soldiers .
No witness accounts from Palestinians were available of Saturday 's incident .
The Israeli army spokeswoman , who also gave Saleh 's age as 14 , said soldiers opened fire when he was some 30 metres ( yards ) from them , holding a lighted bottle of fuel .
Military surveillance footage released to Israeli media showed a figure crouching on a hillside .
The image , apparently filmed with a night - vision camera , flares at a point near the figure 's hands .
The figure then rises , takes a few steps and is obscured by a smoky blast .
The footage 's time stamp read 06:14 .
At a Nablus hospital , Palestinian doctor Samir Abu Zarour , as well as a Reuters photographer who viewed the body , said they saw no sign of burns on it .
Abu Zarour said Saleh was killed by two bullets to the chest .
He was also hit once in the leg .
Some half a million Jewish Israelis live in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem alongside about 2.5 million Arabs , a tense relationship marked by sporadic violence .
On September 13 dozens of settlers , some firing guns , assaulted Palestinians and damaged houses in Asira al - Kabaliya after a Palestinian stabbed and wounded a 9 - year - old boy in a Jewish outpost .
Three Palestinians were shot and wounded in the settlers ' attack , medical officials said .
" In the State of Israel , there will be no pogroms against non-Jews , " Mr Olmert told his cabinet the following day , employing a word normally applied to attacks on Jews in tsarist Russia .
Since Israel seized the West Bank in 1967 , a growing number of Jewish settlers , protected by troops and a web of roadblocks and checkpoints , have been accused by Palestinians of stealing their land and other resources and dislocating their society .
Israel complains that Palestinian violence , including attacks on its cities , has thwarted its offers of land for peace -- though successive governments , including Mr Olmert 's , have made clear they want to keep many of the biggest settlements in the West Bank under any deal to establish a Palestinian state .
Israel 's Western allies regard the settlements as illegal under international law and the United States has called them a barrier to peace as it makes another push for a peace deal before President George W Bush leaves office in January .

Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels once looked like a missed opportunity for Democrats .
The first - term Republican whose proposals on privatizing toll roads sent his approval rating plummeting nonetheless was riding high in polls over his Democratic challenger , ex- Rep. Jill Long Thompson .
But a new poll suggests it could be Barack Obama who spells trouble for the Hoosier State GOP .
The poll , conducted by Selzer & Co. for the Indianapolis Star and WTHR - TV , tested 600 likely voters between 9/14 - 16 for a margin of error of +/- 4 % . Daniels and Long Thompson were tested .
General Election Matchup
Daniels ........... 46
Thompson ...... 42
Obama ......... 47
McCain ........ 44
Pollster Ann Selzer told the Star that the tight governor 's race can be directly attributed to the fact that Barack Obama is staying competitive in what is ordinarily a deep red state .
" I would expect there to be some coattails , and the closeness of the race for governor we 're showing probably represents some of that , " Selzer told the Star .
The Selzer poll shows Daniels with a strong 56 % job approval rating , in line with most other surveys that demonstrate the Republican is much better known than his Democratic opponent .
Polls earlier this year have mostly showed Daniels with a big lead .
The last public poll , conducted in late June , showed Daniels leading by fourteen points .

MUCH has been made of the timing of Hillary Clinton ’s speech before the Democratic National Convention tonight , coming as it does on the 88th anniversary of women ’s suffrage .
Convention organizers are taking advantage of this coincidence of the calendar — the 19th Amendment was certified on Aug. 26 , 1920 — to pay homage to the women ’s vote in particular and women ’s progress in general .
By such tributes , they are slathering some sweet icing on a bitter cake .
But many of Mrs. Clinton ’s supporters are unlikely to be partaking .
They regard their candidate ’s cameo as a consolation prize .
And they are not consoled .
“ I see this nation differently than I did 10 months ago , ” reads a typical posting on a Web site devoted to Clintonista discontent .
“ That this travesty was committed by the Democratic Party has forever changed my approach to politics . ”
In scores of Internet forums and the conclaves of protest groups , those sentiments are echoed , as Clinton supporters speak over and over of feeling heartbroken and disillusioned , of being cheated and betrayed .
In one poll , 40 percent of Mrs. Clinton ’s constituency expressed dissatisfaction ; in another , more than a quarter favored the clear insanity of voicing their feminist protest by voting for John McCain .
“ This is not the usual reaction to an election loss , ” said Diane Mantouvalos , the founder of JustSayNoDeal.com , a clearinghouse for the pro-Clinton organizations .
“ I know that is the way it is being spun , but it ’s not prototypical .
Anyone who does n’t take time to analyze it will do so at their own peril . ”
The despondency of Mrs. Clinton ’s supporters — or their “ vitriolic ” and “ rabid ” wrath , as the punditry prefers to put it — has been the subject of perplexed and often irritable news media speculation .
Why do n’t these dead - enders get over it already and exit stage right ?

The George W Bush Presidential Library is now in the planning stages .
The Library will include :
The USS McFaul is the first of three ships to arrive in Georgia A US warship has arrived in the Georgian port of Batumi carrying the first delivery of aid supplies by sea .
Russian forces are still in control of the military port of Poti , to the north of Batumi , after Moscow withdrew most of its combat troops from the country .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy , who brokered the ceasefire , has urged Moscow to pull out those forces too , and called a summit of EU leaders .
Meanwhile , Georgia said a train full of fuel was blown up by a mine near Gori .
A huge plume of black smoke could be seen across the area and witnesses said the force of the blast had forced some of the train 's wagons off the tracks .
See a map of the region Interior ministry spokesman Shota Utiashvili said there had been several explosions near an abandoned Georgian military base where the Russian troops , on leaving Gori , had left a stockpile of munitions taken from the Georgian army .

He suggested the stockpile or the train track could have been mined by the Russian forces .
He said there had been no casualties .
Georgian authorities had been hoping to help thousands of refugees return to Gori on Sunday having carried out a mine - sweeping operation in the town , which lies close to the border with the breakaway province of South Ossetia .
Georgia 's Prime Minister Lado Gurgenidze said it would be important to see the extent of the damage , once the fire had been extinguished .
" The railway is vital , not just for the Georgian economy but for the economies of neighbouring countries , " he said .
The track runs through the capital Tbilisi before splitting and running to the Black Sea ports of Poti and Batumi and south - west towards the Turkish border .
One of the train 's wagons was marked Azpetrol - a company based in Baku , Azerbaijan .
Displaced President Sarkozy called a special summit of EU leaders to discuss the Georgian crisis , to be held in Brussels on 1 September .
His office said the summit , arranged at the request of various European countries , would discuss the future of EU relations with Russia as well as aid for Georgia .
Russia 's four - day war with Georgia erupted after Tbilisi tried to retake South Ossetia - which broke away in 1992 and was supported by Moscow - in a surprise offensive on 7 August .
The offensive followed a series of clashes between Georgian and South Ossetian forces .
PEACE PLAN
No more use of force Stop all military actions for good Free access to humanitarian aid Georgian troops return to their places of permanent deployment Russian troops to return to pre-conflict positions but Russian peacekeepers may take unspecified " additional security measures " International talks about security in South Ossetia and Abkhazia
Crisis day - by - day Eyewitness : Russian withdrawal Russia 's game plan
The conflict left hundreds of people dead and created tens of thousands of refugees .
Many have been returning to their damaged or destroyed homes since the Russian withdrawal .
The UN 's refugee agency UNHCR reported this week that , according to Russian estimates , more than 30,000 people from South Ossetia had fled to North Ossetia .
Another 128,000 were estimated to have been displaced within Georgia .
International aid agencies are working on the ground and the US has already delivered some aid by military cargo plane .
The destroyer USS McFaul is reported to be carrying supplies such as blankets , hygiene kits and baby food .
The supplies will be unloaded by a floating crane as the port is too shallow for the ship to dock .
Two more US ships are due to arrive later this week .
The BBC's Gabriel Gatehouse , aboard the American warship , said that apart from delivering aid , the arrival of US naval personnel is undoubtedly intended to send a signal to the Russians - that America is serious about its support for Georgia .
But , he adds , the prospect of US and Russian armed forces actually meeting on Georgian soil is one that both sides seem keen to avoid .
Batumi is not a natural harbour for a naval vessel the size of the USS McFaul to dock , but Russian forces have been fortifying their positions at the key port of Poti , further up the coast .
On Saturday , Mr Sarkozy welcomed the withdrawal of Russian forces so far , but urged Moscow to pull its troops back from Poti and Senaki , which is the site of Georgia 's main air base .
Russia says it has a duty and a right to keep its forces in a buffer zone around the breakaway territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia - though it acknowledges that Poti falls well outside that zone .

MARSHFIELD , Vt. 
When Diana Levine starts talking about her rock ’n ’ roll days , she plays a little air guitar , mimicking the way she used to handle her electric bass in bands like the Re-Bops and Duke and the Detours .
But Ms. Levine is missing much of her right arm , which was amputated below the elbow after a medical disaster .
She sits at her kitchen table , strumming an imaginary guitar with a phantom hand .
In November , the Supreme Court will hear arguments about whether Ms. Levine may keep more than $ 6 million that a Vermont jury ordered Wyeth , a pharmaceutical company , to pay her for failing to warn her adequately about the risks of one of its drugs .
The case , the latest in a brisk parade of similar ones , will help define the contours of a signature project of the Roberts court .
In legal jargon , the cases concern “ pre-emption , ” a doctrine that can bar injured consumers like Ms. Levine from suing in state court when the products that hurt them had met federal standards .
The issue is less boring and more consequential than it sounds , and Ms. Levine ’s case is shaping up to be the most important business case of the term .
“ Federal pre-emption is the fiercest battle in products liability law today , ” said Catherine M. Sharkey , a law professor at New York University .
“ The court clearly recognizes this , as it has agreed to hear so many cases and seems eager to give clarity to what has been , to date , an undisputably muddled area of law . ”
The League of Conservation Voters ( LCV ) , which works to turn environmental values into national priorities , today added Congressman Sam Graves ( MO - 6 ) and California developer Dean Andal to its 2008 “ Dirty Dozen ” list .
Compiled annually , the Dirty Dozen targets current and former members of Congress – regardless of party affiliation – who consistently vote against the environment and are running in races where LCV has a serious chance of affecting the outcome .
Andal has an abysmal record on energy and environmental issues make him one of the worst candidates for federal office in the nation , according to the LCV .
The LCV refers to Andal as “ the new Pombo , ” in reference to former Chair of the House Natural Resources Committee and foe of the environmental movement , Richard Pombo .
LCV Senior Vice President Tony Massaro said , “ Andal has consistently voted against fuel efficiency programs and measures to slow global warming . ”
During his time as state representative , Andal voted against legislation banning offshore drilling , and against another measure requiring oil companies to find a safe alternative to oil tankers which pose a serious danger to the coast .
Also named to the Dirty Dozen list was Congressman Sam Graves ( MO - 6 ) .
Graves has earned a lifetime LCV score of only 4 % on energy and environmental issues .
In January 2007 , Graves voted no to taking away royalties and tax incentives to big oil and gas companies , ultimately contributing to their record high profits , which this quarter alone reached over $ 11.7 billon .
Since elected , Graves has voted in line with the Bush Administration on every major energy vote , the LCV reports .
Other 2008 members include Senator Mitch McConnell , Senator Mary Landrieu , former Congressman Bob Schaffer , Congressman Steve Pearce , Senator Jim Inhofe , Congressman Sam Graves and Senator Ted Stevens .
The rest of the Dirty Dozen will be announced in the coming weeks .

Federal Court Sides With ACLU , Ruling That Refusing To Hire Transgender People Is Discriminatory
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : ( 212 ) 549-2666 ; media@aclu.org
WASHINGTON - Today a federal judge ruled that the Library of Congress illegally discriminated against a Special Forces veteran when she was denied a job after announcing her intention to transition from male to female .
In a groundbreaking decision , the court ruled that discriminating against someone for changing genders is sex discrimination under federal law .
" It is especially gratifying that the court has ruled that discriminating against someone for transitioning is illegal , " said Diane Schroer , the plaintiff in the case .
" I knew all along that the 25 years of experience I gained defending our country did n't disappear when I transitioned , so it was hard to understand why I was being turned down for a job doing what I do best just because I 'm transgender .
It is tremendously gratifying to have your faith in this country , and what is fundamentally right and fair , be reaffirmed . "
In reaching its decision , the court ruled : " The evidence established that the Library was enthusiastic about hiring David Schroer – until she disclosed her transsexuality .
The Library revoked the offer when it learned that a man named David intended to become , legally , culturally , and physically , a woman named Diane .
This was discrimination ' because of . . . sex . ' "
The court compares the discrimination faced by Schroer to religious - based discrimination , saying , " Imagine that an employee is fired because she converts from Christianity to Judaism .
Imagine too that her employer testified that he harbors no bias toward either Christians or Jews but only ' converts . '
That would be a clear case of discrimination ' because of religion . '
No court would take seriously the notion that ' converts ' are not covered by the statute . "
" The court got it exactly right , sending a loud and clear message to employers everywhere : if you fire or refused to hire someone for transitioning , you are guilty of sex discrimination and may well find yourself liable , " said Sharon McGowan , one of the ACLU LGBT Project staff attorneys who tried the case .
The court also ruled that the Library was guilty of sex stereotyping against Schroer because she failed to live up to traditional notions of what is male or female .
The ACLU filed the lawsuit against the Library of Congress on June 2 , 2005 .
After retiring from the military , Schroer , who had been hand - picked to head up a classified national security operation while serving as a Special Forces officer , applied for a position with the Library of Congress as the senior terrorism research analyst .
Soon thereafter she was offered the job , which she accepted immediately .
Prior to starting work , Schroer took her future boss to lunch to explain that she was in the process of transitioning and thought it would be easier for everyone if she simply started work presenting as female .
The following day , Schroer received a call from her future boss rescinding the offer , telling her that she was n't a " good fit " for the Library of Congress .
The lawsuit charged that the Library of Congress unlawfully refused to hire Schroer in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act , which protects against sex discrimination in the workplace .
The Library of Congress moved to dismiss the case several times , claiming that transgender people are not covered under Title VII of 1964 .
After a trial last month , the court rejected those arguments and ruled that the Library illegally discriminated against Schroer in violation of Title VII .
The court 's decision indicated that the next step in the case will be further proceedings to determine the appropriate remedies for this discrimination .
Those remedies may include ordering the Library of Congress to hire Schroer , award back pay for the wages she lost or provide monetary compensation for the injury caused by discrimination .
" I very much hope that this ruling will help to eliminate the all - too - pervasive discrimination against gender non-conforming people in all areas .
I hope too , that employers , family members , friends and co-workers will begin to understand variations in gender identity from a basis of knowledge and not fear , " added Schroer .
In addition to McGowan , the legal team consisted of Ken Choe , Senior Staff Attorney for the ACLU LGBT Project , James Esseks , Litigation Director for the ACLU LGBT Project and Art Spitzer , Legal Director of the ACLU of the National Capital Area .

Bacon fat is unparalleled as a cooking medium .
“ Bacon grease ( in moderation ) is a culinary weapon of interstellar magnitude , ” extols Hungry Celeste .
“ Save it every time you cook bacon . ”
To strain bacon fat , pour it through a coffee filter set in a funnel .
Store it in the fridge ; it ’ll last a long , long time .
Here are a few of Chowhounds ’ favorite ways to cook with bacon fat :
Put a couple of tablespoons in a cast iron skillet and place in the oven to preheat to make cornbread , then pour the batter into the sizzling fat and bake ; you ’ll have a delicious crunchy crust .
Fry eggs in bacon fat ; use melted bacon fat in place of butter in pancake batter .
Roast or fry cut - up potatoes in bacon fat , or rub a bit on potatoes before baking for delicious , crispy skins .
Sauté vegetables in bacon fat , or add a bit to the water when you blanch vegetables for flavor without added grease .
Use it as the base for your roux when making gumbo or to add a smoky dimension to a cheese sauce ; brown meats or vegetables for soups or stews in it .
Use bacon fat in place of butter or shortening when making pastry for chicken pot pies and other savory pies .
Use it as the fat component in vinaigrettes :
Melt it and mix it hot with vinegar and a bit of sugar or another sweetener if you want a wilted salad , or melt it and let it cool so it ’s liquid but not hot and make a dressing with vinegar , Dijon mustard , shallots , and herbs — or whatever strikes your fancy .

Dementia patient makes ' amazing ' progress after using infra-red helmet
Two months ago Clem Fennell was fading fast .
The victim of an aggressive type of dementia , the 57 - year - old businessmen was unable to answer the phone , order a meal or string more than a couple of words together .
In desperation , his family agreed to try a revolutionary new treatment - a bizarre - looking , experimental helmet devised by a British GP that bathes the brain in infra-red light twice a day .
To their astonishment , Mr Fennel began to make an astonishing recovery in just three weeks .
Dr Gordon Dougal , a GP from County Durham , treated dementia patient Clem Fennell with his infra-red device
" My husband , Clem , was fading away .
It is as if he is back " said his wife Vickey Fennell , 55 .
" His personality has started to show again .
We are absolutely thrilled . "
While the helmet has yet to be proven in clinical trials , the family say the effects of the 10 minute sessions are incredible .
Mr Fennell can now hold conversations and go shopping unaccompanied .
The treatment is the brainchild of Dr Gordon Dougal , a County Durham GP .
He believes the device could eventually help thousands of dementia patients .
" Potentially , this is hugely significant , " said Dr Dougal , who is based in Easington , County Durham and is a director of Virulite , a medical research company .
Developed with Sunderland University , the helmet has 700 LED lights that penetrate the skull .
They are thought to be the right wavelength to stimulate the growth of brain cells , slowing down the decline in memory and brain function and reversing symptoms of dementia .
Clem Fennell - the head of a family engineering firm in Cincinnati , Ohio - travelled to the UK after neurologists told him nothing could stop the decline of his dementia .
The family 's friends had seen a report about the helmet on CBS .
" Honestly I can tell you that within ten days , the deterioration was stopped , then we started to see improvements , " said Mrs Fennell , from North Kentucky .
" He started to respond to people more quickly when they talked to him . "
Three weeks later , the father of two is still making gradual improvements .
His daughter , 22 - year - old Maggie said : " When we go to the restaurant we usually have to order his meals for him , now he can order for himself . "
" Now we are okay about letting him go to the bank or the post office but he would not have been able to do that three weeks ago .
Mr Fennell could hardly string two words together .
But since using the infra-red helmet , he can hold a conversation .
" Dr Dougal has been a godsend to our family .
There was nothing anyone could do to help Clem until now . "
It is too soon to say whether Dr Dougal 's invention could help other sufferers .
The symptoms of Alzheimer 's disease and dementia can vary from day to day - and relapses are not unusual .
And not all patients may benefit from the treatment .
Dr Dougal stressed that a full , clinically controlled trial would be needed before his anti-dementia helmet could be licensed for public use .
A trial of 100 patients is expected to start later this year .
" I made it clear to the Fennells that I did n't know for a fact whether it would work or not , but the results are good , " said Dr Dougal .
" He was monosyllabic when I first saw him , but if I ring up now he will answer the phone .
He did n't have the verbal skills to do that three weeks ago . "
The Fennells have been told they can take the prototype helmet back to the US with them so they can continue the treatment at home .
Commercial versions of the helmet will include 700 LEDs and cost around £ 10,000 .
The Alzheimer ’s Society said : " ’A treatment that reverses the effects of dementia rather than just temporarily halting its symptoms could change the lives of the hundreds of thousands of people who live with this devastating condition .
‘ Non -thermal near infra-red treatment for people with dementia is a potentially interesting technique .
We look forward to further research to determine whether it could help improve cognition in humans .
Only then can we begin to investigate whether near infra-red could benefit people with dementia . ’
One in three people will end their lives with a form of dementia .
Around 700,000 suffer from dementia - with more than half having Alzheimer 's disease .
And this is why Sarah Palin 's dazzling star is finally starting to fade .
Only slightly , but significantly enough to turn down the volume of the Republican cheer squad who have hailed her as the saviour of their political hopes .
She is exciting , and likeable , but at the time of extreme economic uncertainty and an unpopular war , history tells us that American voters should revert to the issues , and seek wisdom over sass .
It 's not Palin 's fault , of course , that Republican men are drooling over her , and that slogan writers think she is more electable as a " hottie " than a governor .
Much of the coverage of her has been offensive , and marked with condescension about her lack of political pedigree , her lack of international travel and the fact she hails from a small town .
It 's just that the explosion of interest and the deafening hype about the gun-totin ' , moose shootin ' , mother of five from Alaska was bound to fade .
It 's the nature of novelty .
Her uniqueness made her irresistible - she so uncannily resembled some kind of kick - ass action figure , a beauty contestant turned political firebrand , that even many liberals confessed they 'd like to spend a night eating mooseburgers with her .
She entered a vacuum of information about who she was and what she stood for and suddenly was seen to embody archetypes such as Frontier Woman , Super Mom and Miss Congeniality on a Mission , before she was subject to any serious scrutiny .
This is how she managed to inject steroids into the flagging Republican campaign , and excite those who either disliked or were unmoved by John McCain .
Polling showed that she almost singlehandedly gave McCain a substantial bounce in approval ratings and that much of this was due to women .
A Newsweek poll in July found McCain led Obama among white women by 44 per cent to 39 per cent .
The most recent poll , taken last week , found his lead is now 53 - 37 .
It has been called the Palin effect - and given that women form 54 per cent of the active voting population in the US , it has made the Obama campaign very nervous .
But there are three reasons why it is likely Americans will start taking a more sober look at the woman dubbed Sarah Barracuda .
The first is she is now being seriously scrutinised , and her record as Governor is coming under criticism : she had great populist appeal but was known for cronyism and is being investigated for firing the Alaskan public safety commissioner after she had placed pressure on him to sack a state trooper who was her sister 's ex-husband .
" Troopergate " may be damaging given she has indicated she may refuse to co-operate .
The McCain campaign has limited her contact with the media and has planned only a couple of interviews with selected anchors .
After an interview with ABC's Charlie Gibson last week , where she appeared awkward and stumbled over the meaning of the Bush doctrine , whether she would approve a pre-emptive strike on Pakistan and how being able to view Russia from Alaska might help her negotiate with Russia , polls showed a quick and dramatic dip .
The second reason is that she lacks experience .
In the Newsweek poll , half said they did not think she was ready .
Even conservative commentators are expressing qualms about her preparedness to lead .
The columnist George Will worried that the oldest man to embark on a first presidential term had chosen a person with " negligible experience " .
David Frum , a former speechwriter for George Bush , pondered how serious McCain could be about national security to place it in the hands of a neophyte ?
The third reason that the Palin effect will likely diminish is that the economy will decide this election .
This is the case for women especially - in a recent Zogby poll 65 per cent of women identified jobs and the economy as their most important issues , compared to 47 per cent of men .
With the news of a deepening crisis this week - the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers , the distressed sale of Merrill Lynch , the multibillion - dollar bail - out of American International - these sentiments will only grow more acute .
The challenge for Obama and McCain is to establish their economic credentials and ensure the American public understands exactly how they might improve their lives .
And knowing that your VP can make mooseburgers from beasts she shot herself may be of little comfort if you do n't have a roof over your head .

NYC Successfully Installs Tidal - Power Turbine in East River
September 20th , 2008 by Alex Felsinger
[ social_buttons ]
The turbine is the first of 300 which the city hopes to install in the waterway .
Unlike the typical river which flows in a constant direction , the East River is a tidal straight with strong , fluctuating currents which allow for more efficient power generation .
Once in place , the system could provide electricity to 10,000 households .
The city is desperate to create viable alternative energy solutions as power consumption continues to climb and transmission lines from power plants upstate struggle to keep up .
The turbines are part of an ambitious plan to generate 80 percent of NYC ’s electricity within city limits , including usage of wind , solar , and tidal energy .
The river power project was initially proposed in 2000 but was rejected by the state senate .
After being accepted years later , the project still faced technology and research hurdles .
The city has spent $ 2 million in the past few years studying the impact the turbines would have on local fish and bird populations , but so far it seems that the animals avoid the blades and escape harm .
However , regulations state that the impact on the waterway ’s animal life must be monitored continuously .
The first two attempts had their blades torn off by the strong currents , which is a testament to how much power stands to be harnessed from the river .
Verdant Power , a small energy company hired for the job , said that this third version was thoroughly tested before being installed ; so far it has worked , and is already powering a nearby supermarket .
If the blades continue to hold together , the city should soon give further production and installation a green light .

NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) - Some older marathon runners may have a greater chance of suffering a heart attack than their risk factors belie , new research suggests .
Participants run during the Riga International Marathon May 18 , 2008 .

In a study of male marathoners age 50 and up , researchers found that , despite their high activity levels , the runners were as likely as other men their age to have calcium buildup in their heart arteries .
And when compared with men who had a similar amount of heart disease risk factors , marathoners actually tended to have more calcium in their arteries .
Calcium is a component of artery - clogging plaques , and a high coronary calcium “ score ” -- as measured by non-invasive CT scans -- predicts an elevated risk of suffering a heart attack .
Since regular exercise is a heart - healthy habit , it ’s not clear why marathoners would have calcium scores similar to those of other men their age .
In general , the runners did have fewer traditional risk factors for heart disease ; on average , they weighed less , had lower “ bad ” LDL cholesterol , higher “ good ” HDL cholesterol and lower blood pressure .
This raises the possibility that marathon running itself contributes to calcium buildup in some people -- but that is an unlikely scenario , according to study leader Dr. Stefan Mohlenkamp , of the West - German Heart Center Essen .
“ Based on published data on the benefits of regular exercise , this possibility seems unlikely , ” he told Reuters Health .
Instead , Mohlenkamp explained , the answer may rest in the formerly less - than - healthy lifestyles of some of the runners in his study .
Many , he noted , had only started serious , competitive running in their 40s , and half were former smokers .
Mohlenkamp also stressed that in general , running is a good thing .
“ You live longer , you live better , ” he said .
“ Our study does not question at all the proven benefits of regular exercise . ”
For the study , which is published in the European Heart Journal , the researchers recruited 108 apparently healthy male marathoners age 50 and older .
They calculated each man ’s Framingham Risk Score -- a standard measure that doctors use to estimate a person ’s risk of having a heart attack in the next 10 years .
It is based on age , sex , blood pressure , cholesterol and smoking habits .
The researchers also used CT scans to calculate each runner ’s coronary calcium score .
They then compared the marathoners with a group of men who had taken part in another study .
Overall , 13 percent of the marathoners had a calcium score above 400 , which indicates a large of amount of plaque in the arteries , while 23 percent had scores indicating moderate plaque buildup .
Those rates were nearly identical to those of the comparison group .
And when the researchers compared the runners with men who had the same Framingham Risk Score as they did , they found that the marathoners had higher rates of plaque buildup .
While regular exercise is heart - healthy , it is known that strenuous exercise can trigger a heart attack or heart - rhythm disturbance in people with pre-existing heart disease .
The implication of the current findings , according to Mohlenkamp , is that conventional risk factor assessment may underestimate the heart risks of some older runners .
He said that when older adults go to their doctors asking whether such high - level exercise is safe for them , it ’s important for the doctor to take a detailed risk factor history -- checking whether the patient has ever had high blood pressure or has ever been overweight , for instance .
In cases where the patient has a history of risk factors , Mohlenkamp said , it may be appropriate to do further , non-invasive testing , such as a CT scan for coronary artery calcium in addition to a stress test , which looks at the heart ’s activity during exercise .
It is not generally recommended that people without heart disease symptoms undergo these cardiac tests .
But Mohlenkamp said that when it comes to judging whether it ’s safe for an older adult to exercise at such levels , it is “ prudent ” to not rely on their current risk factors alone .
