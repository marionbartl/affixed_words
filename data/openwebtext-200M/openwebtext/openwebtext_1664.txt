Washington comes to aid of Israel over Gaza convoy massacre
By Jean Shaoul
2 June 2010
The Obama administration has come to the aid of Israel in its efforts to quell criticism of its murderous act of piracy on the international aid convoy to Gaza and to manage the worsening diplomatic fallout .
The early Monday morning raid has sparked international condemnation , against a background of global protests and calls for Israel to lift its three - year blockade of Gaza .
An Israeli commando force attacked the six ships , which were carrying supplies that included cement , wheelchairs , paper and water purification systems , in international waters , 70 miles off the Gaza coast .
The commandos boarded the Mavi Marmara passenger ferry , one of three ships provided by Insani Yardim Vakfi ( IHH ) , a Turkish aid organisation .
The Mavi Marmara was carrying 600 of the 700 activists , nationals from Turkey , the United States , Britain , Australia , Greece , Canada , Belgium , Ireland , Israel and elsewhere .
Prominent figures included the Swedish author Henning Mankell , two Australian journalists , three German parliamentarians , and Hanan Zu’bi , an Arab Israeli and a member of the Knesset .
The Israeli commando unit killed at least nine people and injured dozens more .
Most of the victims are believed to be Turkish .
The ships were diverted to Ashdod in Israel .
At least 40 passengers are in hospital .
Nine are believed to be in a serious condition .
Six Israeli soldiers are in hospital , with light to serious injuries .
The passengers who refused to sign documents agreeing to deportation — only about 50 agreed — were dispersed to detention centres throughout Israel for questioning .
At least 30 have been arrested for refusing to give their names and detained in prison .
Israel has as yet to give a list of who has been killed , injured , deported or imprisoned .
Two more ships that were organized by the Free Gaza Movement , an international coalition of Palestine solidarity activists , are expected to challenge the Israeli blockade .
Organizers said one , a converted merchant ship christened the Rachel Corrie , for the American activist who was killed by an Israeli bulldozer , is already on its way from Cyprus and is expected to enter Gazan waters Wednesday , June 2 .
Among its passengers are the 1976 Nobel Peace Prize laureate , Mairead Corrigan - Maguire of Northern Ireland , and a Holocaust survivor .
An Israeli navy commander indicated to the Jerusalem Post that the military was readying violence against the next two ships as well .
“ We boarded the ship and were attacked as if it was a war , ” he said .
“ That will mean that we will have to come prepared in the future as if it was a war . ”
Turkey expressed outrage at the commando raid for targeting the Turkish ship and killing mostly Turkish activists .
In a speech to parliament , Recep Tayyip Erdogan , the Prime Minister , called Israel ’s raid a “ bloody massacre ” .
The Obama administration put enormous pressure on Turkey , currently a member of the United Nations Security Council , to accept a watered - down statement from the Security Council , as discussions dragged on for 11 hours in an emergency session throughout the evening and night .
As a result of US arm - twisting and use of its power of veto , the UN made no direct condemnation of Israel and removed the call for an international investigation of the incident .
It also weakened the demand to end the economic blockade of Gaza that the activists were trying to break .
The Security Council issued a statement saying that it “ deeply regretted the loss of life and injuries resulting from the use of force during the Israeli military operation in international waters against the convoy sailing to Gaza ” .
It requested the immediate release of the ships as well as the civilians held by Israel and meekly suggested that the situation in Gaza was “ not sustainable ” .
It called only for an impartial inquiry into Israel ’s raid , which Washington interprets as leaving Israel free to organise its own whitewash .
According to the Israeli daily Haaretz , the Obama White House placed no pressure on Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu to cancel his scheduled visit to Washington , citing a White House source who said that the two sides talked about moving it up to Monday , but it was not possible .
A summary of Obama ’s phone conversation Monday with Netanyahu posted on the White House web site said that the meeting would be rescheduled “ at the first opportunity ” .
A State Department statement on the massacre was even clearer in its support for Israel ’s justification for the attack , appearing to blame the killings on the Palestinians and their supporters .
After calling upon the Israeli government to conduct a “ full and credible investigation ” of its own crime , the State Department added : “ However , Hamas ’ interference with international assistance shipments and work of nongovernmental organizations , and its use and endorsement of violence , complicates efforts in Gaza .
Mechanisms exist for the transfer of humanitarian assistance to Gaza by governments and groups that wish to do so .
These mechanisms should be used for the benefit of all those in Gaza . ”
There have been demonstrations against Tel Aviv ’s actions in London , Manchester , Paris , Sweden , Norway , Italy , Cyprus and more than 20 cities in Greece .
More are planned for the weekend .
Israel has imposed a complete media blackout on its actions , just as it did during its assault on Gaza in 2008 - 09 , in order to make sure that only its own version of the events — that the commandos acted in self - defence against an imminent lynching — gets a hearing .
With major media outlets accepting censorship and the passengers in prison , Israeli officials are largely in control of the news .
The naval base at Ashdod is off - limits to journalists and has been declared a closed military zone .
Netanyahu claimed that the commandos were enforcing a legal blockade and only fired in self - defence .
Israel ’s Foreign Minister , Avigdor Lieberman , told European diplomats that the ship ’s passengers were “ terrorist supporters who fired at IDF soldiers as soon as the latter boarded the ships . ”
The IDF issued an edited video shot from a helicopter , showing what it says was a melee on deck , in which its forces were met with a barrage of weapons and during which activists tried to “ kidnap ” a soldier .
But according to Ron Ben Yishai , a journalist with the Yediot Aharonot newspaper who was an eyewitness , these “ weapons ” were improvised and Israeli troops opened fire , with permission from their superiors , once they realised they were being overwhelmed .
The IDF video stops as a soldier aims his pistol at a passenger .
The Israeli version of the massacre has been flatly contradicted by passengers on board the Mavi Marmara , who reported that violence was initiated by the Israeli commandos who boarded the vessels firing sound and gas bombs and using live fire against unarmed civilians , even after a white flag was raised .
Passengers on other vessels , where the Israeli government claimed there was no violence , reported that , on the contrary , they were shot at with plastic bullets and subjected to beatings , blows from rifle butts and the use of electrical stun guns .
The activists were forced to lie on the deck and were brutally questioned by the commandos .
“ During their interrogation , many of them were badly beaten in front of us , ” said Aris Papadokostopoulos , a passenger on the Free Mediterranean , which was travelling behind the Turkish ship .
Uri Avnery , a former member of the Knesset and leader of the Gush Shalom peace group in Israel said , “ No one in the world will believe the lies and excuses which the government and army spokesmen come up with . ”
Richard Falk , a professor of international public law at Princeton University and the UN Special Rapporteur for the Occupied Palestinian Territories , said that the raid was “ clearly a criminal act , being on the high seas . ”
“ The people on these boats would have some right of self - defence , ” he added , as they were the ones who were under unprovoked attack , not Israel .
The raid was no accident .
All the signs are that Israel has been stepping up its provocations to engineer a casus belli for a war against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon .
Tel Aviv sees as unfinished business its inconclusive wars : the first in Lebanon in 2006 , and the second in Gaza in 2008 - 09 .
The military assault on the convoy was approved by Israel ’s inner security cabinet , headed by Ehud Barak , the Defence Minister .
The IDF confirmed this saying , “ This IDF naval operation was carried out under orders from the political leadership ... ”
Tensions have risen in Gaza , where there were protests at Israel ’s raid .
Shortly after the UN statement was released , there was an exchange of fire on Gaza ’s border with Israel that resulted in the deaths of two Palestinian militants .
Later , Israeli planes killed five Palestinian militants in Gaza .
Within Israel , the Arab Higher Monitoring Committee has organised a general strike among Israeli Arabs and police have been placed on high alert in anticipation of protests and demonstrations .
The raid has inflamed tensions throughout the region .
There have been demonstrations in Beirut , Damascus , Baghdad and Tehran .
The regime of Egypt ’s President Hosni Mubarak , which has played a key role enforcing the blockade , is in a particularly invidious position .
It has been forced by the strength of public opinion and protests outside the foreign ministry in Cairo to open the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and the Gaza Strip to allow humanitarian aid through , although it is unclear for how long .
The strongest reaction came from Turkey , where there have been furious demonstrations against Israel .
Ankara , a longstanding military ally of Israel , has recalled its ambassador from Tel Aviv and announced that it was cancelling three joint military drills .
Israel ’s foreign ministry has called on people planning trips to Turkey to delay or cancel their visits and urged Israelis in Turkey to return home .
In his hour - long speech to the Turkish parliament — which was translated simultaneously into English and Arabic , an unprecedented move — Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan stated : “ It is no longer possible to cover up or ignore Israel ’s lawlessness .
This bloody massacre by Israel on ships that were taking humanitarian aid to Gaza deserves every kind of curse .
This attack is on international law , the conscience of humanity and world peace .
Israel in no way can legitimize this murder .
It can not wash its hand of this blood . ”
The Turkish government criticized Washington for refusing to directly denounce the Israeli attack .
“ We expect a clear condemnation , ” said Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu Tuesday as he prepared to go into meetings with his US counterpart Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration ’s national security adviser , James Jones .
“ We expect full solidarity with us , ” Davutoglu added .
“ It should not seem like a choice between Turkey and Israel .
It should be a choice between right and wrong , between legal and illegal . ”
Asked whether the Turkish government would send naval vessels to escort future convoys headed towards Gaza , the foreign minister said that the government had not yet reached a decision on such action .
The Jerusalem Post quoted unnamed Israeli military officials as saying that while they viewed the deployment of Turkish warships as unlikely , given Turkey ’s membership in NATO , Tel Aviv still saw it as a “ great concern . ”
“ This is a definite possibility that we need to prepare for , ” a senior defence official told the paper Tuesday , suggesting that the Israeli state is getting ready for a confrontation that could trigger a catastrophic war in the region .
Got a cool $ 25 million to throw around ?
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PLEASE CONTACT ME ABOUT AN IMPORTANT BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY .
Or go squander it all on a Strand Craft 122 superyacht with matching supercar , I do n't care ( yes I do too , I want that money ) .
Beating the Bugatti Veyron hands down for exclusivity , the supercar has 880 bhp from its twin - turbo V12 engine and a claimed top speed of 234mph .
Only six will be built , each capable of hitting 60 mph from rest in 3.2 seconds .
But what about the design , yo ?!
Designer , Sweden - based 33 - year - old Eduard Gray , told CNN that he took inspiration from the lines and curves of sports car , the Ferrari Testa Rossa .
" We have really tried to achieve a strong harmony in our design -- so that the car looks like it was literally born inside the hull of the yacht , " he said .
But ultimately , he said , he wanted to design " something you want to be seen in -- the sexiest damn boat in the harbor ! "
Sorry Eduard , but I think we can all agree the sexiest damn boat in the harbor is my dinghy .
Just sayin : seats one comfortably , comes half - mast .
Ooh -- did I mention the pirate flag ?
There 's a pirate flag .
Plus a compass .
Hit the jump for a bunch more pictures of the yacht you 'll never own ( unless you really are rich in which case I was n't joking about the HJ ) .
What to get the superyacht owner with everything ?
A matching supercar [ cnn ]
and
Luxury yacht comes with free custom supercar [ yahoo ]
Thanks to Melissa , Benjamin , Ludd , Gauthier , colin and Ed , who are holding out for superplanes that come with complimentary supercopters .
Really ?
Because I 'd be cool with a jetpack .

Ever since 1993 , when President Bill Clinton 's plan to tax fuels was demolished by energy industry lobbyists , farmers , aluminum makers , anti-tax groups , conservative Senate Democrats and Republicans , energy taxes have been Washington 's shortcut to political suicide .
The Senate is about to test that dictum again this summer , deciding the fate of climate - change legislation that would put a price on carbon , the foundation of all fossil fuels , and remind drivers that the true cost of gassing up includes millions of gallons of crude drenching the Gulf of Mexico .
Oil 's true cost also includes the well - known litany of other hidden burdens : military spending to protect Middle East oil , the $ 1 billion of U.S. wealth and jobs sent overseas each day to buy oil , and pollution of all sorts , including carbon dioxide emissions .
None of these costs is included in the price of the fossil fuels Americans use .
' There has to be reward '
" There has to be a price , and a reward for moving to low - carbon fuels , " said Rep. Pete Stark , D - Fremont .
Stark may be the only one in Congress who has the temerity to propose a direct tax on carbon .
Economists of all stripes have long argued for such a tax as a way to get people to use less fossil fuel and more solar , wind or whatever energy sources the market decides are better alternatives , and give investors a reason to finance them .
" There may be more receptivity today to putting a price on carbon , given the price we 're paying in the gulf , " said UC Berkeley Professor Robert Reich , who was Clinton 's labor secretary .
" Yet most Americans still have difficulty making the connection , and anything that 's called a ' tax ' does n't stand a chance . "
Congress instead is considering cap - and - trade systems for carbon emissions that do the same thing as a carbon tax , as Republicans are quick to point out , labeling them " job - killing energy taxes . "
Energy taxes already exist , however .
Jay Apt , an economist at Carnegie Mellon University , calculated that a toll increase last year on the Pennsylvania Turnpike amounted to about a $ 40 - per - ton tax on carbon .
" Presented that way , people would have been out with pitchforks against the Turnpike Authority , " Apt said .
The leading Senate plan is the American Power Act by Sens. John Kerry , D - Mass. , and Joe Lieberman , independent - Conn. , which would set an increasingly stricter limit on carbon emissions and auction emissions permits .
Revenue would go to alternative energy investments and utility rebates to help low - income consumers burdened by rising energy costs .
It has no Republican support .
A similar bill , by Sens. Maria Cantwell , D - Wash . , and Susan Collins , R - Maine , takes a more direct approach .
A mere 39 pages , it would auction permits for carbon emissions , return 75 percent of the proceeds to all Americans in the form of a monthly dividend , and invest the other 25 percent in research for other fuels .
Environmentalists ' support
" It 's so sensible it just might pass , " said Steven Hayward , a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute .
The Cantwell - Collins bill also has broad support among environmentalists .
The House passed its own cap - and - trade bill last year , backed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
At 1,400 pages , it is mind - bogglingly complex , mainly because it ran into the same problems as Clinton 's BTU tax , which would have taxed the heat content of fuels .
( BTU stands for British thermal units . )
To get votes , Democrats gave away emission credits to politically powerful industries .
Hayward called it the " Keep Coal in Business Forever " act .
Some environmental groups disavowed it .
Taxing carbon alone , whether through cap - and - trade or a direct tax , would not end America 's addiction to oil , as President Obama vowed last week to do .
But raising oil 's price is key to reducing demand , as was demonstrated by the 2008 oil price spike when consumers briefly rushed to buy hybrid vehicles , the Hummer fell out of favor and investors piled into green fuels .
" Without sending a price signal that says we need to change the way we use this commodity , it 's very tough " to reduce demand , said David Pumphrey , deputy director of the national energy program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies , a Washington think tank .
U.S. dependence on fossil fuels is so great , however , that even a steep price on carbon would not begin to eliminate the need for oil .
The world consumes 83 million barrels of oil a day , about a quarter of that by Americans , and there is as yet no inexpensive alternative to the internal combustion engine .
Europeans pay $ 7 to $ 8 for a gallon of gas , mostly in taxes , and " they still drive , " said Severin Borenstein , co-director of the UC Energy Institute .
" They use much less oil per capita than we do but they still use more than we need to get to . "
14 % tax at the pump
State and federal gas taxes in the United States average 40 cents per gallon , and make up just 14 percent of gasoline 's price .
Americans drive bigger cars and drive more than Europeans do .
Cheap oil has shaped suburbs and homes , making people more dependent than ever on fossil fuels .
At this point , even a steep tax would not radically reduce demand , economists say .
Most recommend adding other measures .
Apt pointed to California 's appliance standards , adopted nationally , that became a model for efficiency and innovation .
Borenstein called for a big increase in federal funding for basic research into alternatives .
" When you take a realistic look at the economic side , without major technological breakthroughs at a much faster pace than we 've seen over the last couple of decades , it does n't look very doable , " he said .
" At the very least , we need to make sure scientists have all the funding they need to pursue every possible good idea , even though many of them will turn out to be failures .
That 's the only way you find the pot of gold . "
ピルはエストロゲンとプロゲステノーゲンというホルモンが入っている薬です。
これを飲むことによって、身体を妊娠しているのと同じようなホルモンバランスの状態にし、生理を止めることが出来ます。
主な活用例としては、望まない妊娠を避けるという目的や、生理不順・生理がとても重いなどのトラブルを抑える目的で使われています。
ピルというと避妊のためというイメージが強いですが、必ずしもそれだけではないのです。
また効果だけではなく、副作用について話題になることも多いです。
その症状は人にもよるのですが、ホルモンを摂取することで、妊娠と同じような状態を作るので、つわりのような吐き気を感じる人や乳房周辺がつっぱるような感じになる人、ニキビができやすくなる人もいます。
そして日本では手に入れるために処方箋が必要となっているので、医師による診断が必要となってきます。
きちんと医師の診断を受けて、その時点でピルを服用するにあたって問題がないかを診断してもらうことが大切です。
また、医師の指導に従って正しい時間に正しい量を飲んで、ホルモンバランスを調節していくということも、効果を最大限に発揮させるには重要な要素となってきます。
ただ産婦人科に行かなくてはいけないから恥ずかしいといった理由もあって、日本ではピルの利用はあまり一般的ではありません。
しかし、欧米ではもっと一般的なもので、服用している人が日本よりも多いと言われています。
さて、このピルはホルモンバランスを妊娠に近い状態にして、生理を止める薬であるということを紹介してきました。
しかしピルを飲み続けることで、来るはずの生理が来なくて、同じだけの時間で他の人には来ている生理を経験しないということにもなります。
それで生理の終わり、つまり閉経が早く遅れるのでしょうか、それとも遅れないのでしょうか。
実はその時期はピルを飲んでいてもあまり変わりません。
卵子がなくなると閉経になるといわれますが、同時に卵巣の老化も関わっているため、卵巣が老化すれば生理は止まり、閉経となります。
Scientists Spot Secret in Michelangelo God
Image via Wikipedia
Michelangelo used the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel to conceal a message the church would have found blasphemous , according to a pair of neuroanatomists .
God ‘s oddly lumpy neck in The Separation of Light from Darkness , a detail that has long puzzled art historians , is actually a completely accurate depiction of the human brain painted by the artist , who was a highly skilled anatomist .
The neuroanatomists have n’t speculated on what Michelangelo meant by including the brain diagram in the image of God , but it could well have been a comment on “ the enduring clash between science and religion , ” neurosurgeon R. Thomas Fields writes in Scientific American .
It may also be the case , Field writes , that Michelangelo — who had a strained relationship with the Catholic Church — was signaling that “ intelligence and observation and the bodily organ that makes them possible lead , without the necessity of Church , directly to God . ”

Although not programmers , every web designer needs to know at least a bit of JavaScript to do decently in one ’s career .
XHTML and CSS are great , but they can only do so much for a web page .
Adding the interactivity and / or special effects that JavaScript can allow can not only enhance a design , but also lead to a more pleasant user experience .
This is not going to be an in - depth post on JavaScript , or anything like object - oriented material .
Instead , this post will cover the basics of JavaScript that every designer must know to become better designers .
In this post , we ’ll cover some JavaScript features ( and trends ) that focus more on user experience and design elements themselves .
Accessing HTML Elements with JavaScript
Once a web page is loaded in plain HTML , it is set .
There ’s no more the browser can do with it to alter the image of a button , the style of a form , or the display of certain pieces of content .
What the user sees is what the user gets .
However , JavaScript can play an excellent role in changing up the page after it ’s loaded .
This means we can do image rollovers ( changing the image after the first image has been loaded ) , and we can change the style of a form as the user interacts with it .
We can also use JavaScript to do some even cooler things , like show or hide divs for tabbed content .
How to Change up the HTML
So how do you change the HTML of a page after it ’s loaded to do all the neat things we ’ve mentioned above ?
First , we must access the element :
document.getElementById(" elementid " ) .
HTMLATTRIBUTE = " value " ;
Once we ’ve gotten a hold of a piece of HTML with JavaScript , we can change its attribute to whatever we like .
Our main piece of code here is a built - in JavaScript function : getElementById ( ) .
With it , as long as we give any HTML element an id , we can grab it with our JavaScript code .
Let ’s take a look at a more specific example below :
<img id =" slideshowimage " src=" flower.jpg " alt =
" An image of a flower . " />
Above is some basic HTML showing an image , with an id of “ sideshowimage ” .
We can use the id to style it any way we want in our stylesheet , just as anyone would expect .
We ’ve also given our image an alt tag with an adequate description .
document.getElementById(" slideshowimage " ) .src = " bear.jpg " ;
Now , by using our JavaScript to grab out “ slideshowimage ” id element , we can change the source of our image .
We can also change the alt tag to make it more relevant :
document.getElementById(" slideshowimage " ) . alt =
" An image of a bear by the water . " ;
JavaScript has now altered our code , which with only HTML and CSS was set , to the following code :
<img id =" slideshowimage " src=" bear.jpg " alt =
" An image of a bear by the water . " />
Easy enough right ?
Simple knowledge of this kind of JavaScript action is the start to making pages more dynamic .
Accessing CSS with JavaScript
Accessing CSS styles is very similar to getting and changing the HTML attributes via JavaScript .
In fact , it technically is changing an HTML attribute itself : the style attribute :
< img src=" image.gif " alt = " An Image " id =" myImage " style= " padding : 5 px ; background : # fff ; border : 1 px solid # ccc ; " />
As anyone can guess , we just place style for the HTML attribute when accessing the image :
document.getElementById(" elementid " ) . style .
STYLEATTRIBUTE
= " value " ;
Because the style attribute in HTML can hold so many different values , we must get a bit more specific with our JavaScript code .
We have to include “ style ” then the name of the specific CSS attribute afterwards .
To clarify , below are the correct and incorrect ways of changing up the CSS :
Incorrect :
document.getElementById(" elementid " ) . style = " padding : 5 px ; background : # fff ; border : 1 px solid # ccc ; " ;
Correct :
document.getElementById(" elementid " ) .style .padding = " 10 px " ; document.getElementById(" elementid " ).style.backgroundColor = " #aaa " ; document.getElementById(" elementid " ) .style.border = " 1px solid # 555 " ;
One more thing to point out is that CSS styles can vary a bit from JavaScript ’s style syntax .
For example , notice that in JavaScript , to change the background color we had to use backgroundColor .
In CSS , we would use background or background - color .
For the most part JavaScript abides by camelCase ( first word lower case , and all remaining words capitalized , no spaces / dashes / underscores ) .
However , if any others have you stumped there are plenty of resources online .
Events : Making it All Actually Happen
Just as the word implies , JavaScript events make things happen .
We ’ve covered so far the syntax for how to alter code , but we currently have no way to trigger it .
Events are what do this .
The onClick event is one of the more popular JavaScript events .
It can be applied to any HTML element , and when the described event happens — when the element is clicked — the event inside the quotes is triggered .
< button on Click=" changeImage ( ) " >
Change Image </ button >
The code above creates a basic HTML button , and uses the onClick attribute for a JavaScript event .
When the user clicks the button , the changeImage ( ) function is called .
< button on Click =" this.style.border = ' 2 px solid # 555 ' " > Change Border </ button >
We can also put our JavaScript code directly in our event , without going to an external function .
Note that we had to change our double quotes into single quotes within our JavaScript code , to keep our HTML from getting confused on when the attribute begins and ends .
We can also use the “ this ” keyword to access the element we ’re currently in — no need to grab an element by its ID if we ’re already there .
Other Important and Commonly - Used Events
onLoad —
Used in the tag of an HTML page .
The event triggers when the page is loaded .
Example : ( Calls the sayHello ( ) function right when the page is loaded .
Will re-trigger on every Refresh . )
onBlur —
Triggers when an element is clicked , and then clicked off .
A common use of this is in forms for validation .
If a user clicked on field , then clicks away , onBlur can run a validation function or any other piece of JavaScript code .
Basically , onBlur triggers when something is clicked away from .
onFocus —
The opposite of onBlur .
Triggers when an element that can be focused is clicked .
For example , a form input field .
onMouseDown , onMouseUp , onMouseOut , onMouseOver —
All used with the interaction of the mouse .
This is usually how image rollovers are created .
When the mouse moves over an image – onMouseOver , the image changes , and then changes again when it moves away from the image – onMouseOut .
onMouseDown and onMouseUp are similar , but with actual clicks of the mouse .
Check out Events and Event Handlers for more information on events and a more descriptive list of available events to use .
JavaScript Libraries
While JavaScript can do a lot on its own , libraries are increasing in popularity because they can provide even more features .
Of course , what designers like most , is that these new libraries can provide a lot more in terms of design .
Many designers just jump into learning JavaScript through a library like jQuery or Mootools .
However , a step - by - step guide to easy jQuery tabs or something similar will not help anyone as a designer long - term .
It is still essential to learn the basics of plain JavaScript before jumping into using a JavaScript library .
While learning JavaScript is a great start , any library requires its own learning curve and has its own syntax or plugins .
For a list of all JavaScript libraries , and even features organized by special features and effects , check out the JavaScript Libraries website .
Despite the many options for JavaScript libraries , there are two that are most popular : jQuery and Mootools .
Learning how to work with these two , or any other libraries , is a great way to expand JavaScript ’s capabilities .
However , that is for another post .
In the meantime , be sure to check out at least the jQuery and Mootools websites .
Conclusion
Anyone can see that JavaScript can be a powerful force to adding interaction and variation to web pages .
Yet , even with all we ’ve covered above , we ’ve only touched the surface of what JavaScript can really do — for either developers or designers .
If you ’d like to get more advanced , be sure to check out what AJAX , along with JavaScript has to offer , or just get into some more advanced JavaScript topics , from arrays to object - oriented programming .
Also be sure to check out some of the resources we have listed above to find out more .
Your web applications will be able to go much further with just a bit more learning !

Will doing EVERYTHING my wife tells me turn me into the most perfect husband ?
Author A. J. Jacobs , 42 , describes himself as ' a living experiment ' .
He 's lived for a year according to the tenets of the Bible , attempted to become the cleverest man in the world and posed online as a single woman .
In his latest project , for one month he agreed to do everything his wife Julie , 41 , told him to , in an effort to be the perfect husband .
Here 's how it turned out ...
My wife is a saint .
Over the years , while I have been researching the various books and articles I have written , she has put up with all kinds of intrusive nonsense from me .
In the spirit of the kind of challenges I 've undertaken previously ( including spending a year following the rules of the Bible to the letter - which meant growing a huge , Biblical bushy beard ) I decided I need to spend a month doing everything she says as part of an experiment for my new book .
Julie - my wife of ten years and the mother of our three boys Jasper , six , and three - year - old twins Zane and Lucas - will be the boss .
I will be her devoted servant .
A.J. Jacobs agreed to do everything his wife , Julie told him to - for one month
When I first tell her this , she leaps around the living room , punching the air and shouting : ' Yes ! '
When I tell my friends they say : ' Is n't that what you 've been doing for the past ten years anyway ? '
It will be a month of foot massages , talking about our feelings and watching chick flicks ... or will it ?
A couple of days before I start , I ask Julie for some guidance .
What would make me an ideal husband in her eyes ?
Let 's just say , it 's a good thing I always carry a notebook with me .
' Let 's start with the bed , ' she says .
' Stop edging over onto my half - and no more waking me up when you come in at night by using your BlackBerry as a torch and shining it in my face . '
' And films .
No talking during films and no looking over at me during the sad parts to see if I 'm crying . '
I 'm scribbling away , trying to keep up .
It 's disturbing how easily this river of minor grievances flows - one after another , without a pause , pin-balling from one topic to another .
' No putting things back in the fridge when there 's just a teensy , tiny bit left - oh and no leaving books in random piles around the house . '
She was on a roll .
I have pet peeves , too , but I do n't think I could recall them with such speed and accuracy .
It 's both impressive and rather disturbing .
The demands continued : I was to stop making fun of her family , go to sleep at a decent hour , so I was n't a zombie in the morning , and be more knowledgeable about the state of our finances .
It went on and on , this list .
What 's happening here ?
Has the power already gone to her head ?
Or am I just unusually difficult to live with ?
I must have looked like I 'd just been punched in the stomach , because Julie softened .
' I love you , ' she says .
Noted .
' No talking during films .
A little pressie every day - and not hogging the bed '
Julie does have a point - she is the chief executive of our family .
I defer to her on all matters : travel , food , money and clothes .
She wears the trousers , but for the next four weeks I 'll be wearing them - and mending , washing and ironing them .
So it is the beginning of my ideal husband month - and I start as I mean to go on .
' Good morning , darling ! '
I chirp at breakfast .
' You look terrific !'
Julie decides to play along and thanks me sweetly for the compliment .
Soon after , I 'm assigned my first chore .
' Can you buy a third , small gift we can give your father for his birthday ? '
Julie asks .
Three gifts ?
That was my initial reaction .
My reflex was to make a sarcastic remark , like : ' Three gifts ?
Two are n't enough ?
What , was he born in a manger ? '
Instead , I say , with all the enthusiasm I can muster : ' Of course dear , how about a book ? '
This is something I notice throughout the day .
Whenever Julie says something , my default setting is to argue with her .
It 's ( usually ) not overtly hostile bickering , more like affectionate parrying .
But at the same time , I know it 's not good .
If you playfully bicker enough , after a few years it stops feeling playful .
I make a mental note to myself to stop seeing conversation as a series of offensive and defensive moves .
Marriage is n't a verbal boxing match .
I spend the day trying to suppress my first instincts .
Before every decision I make , I ask : ' What would Julie want ? '
I start to cut the melon for my sons ' breakfast and stop .
Julie once complained that I always saw at the melon , making a terrible mess .
Role reversal : A.J. Jacobs cleaned his way into his wife 's good books
I could n't care less , but it seems to matter to her so I look for a sharper knife and make a smooth and straight cut .
Frankly , it 's exhausting having to ask myself ' what would Julie want ? ' before I make a decision on anything .
Later on , the house feels chilly , so Julie slides her hands under my shirt to warm them up .
One of my least favourite of her habits - it feels like she 's plonked two ice lollies on my stomach .
But , being the ideal husband that I am , I bite my tongue .
When it comes to housework , as a writer working from home , I 'd always thought I did my share - certainly more than the average bloke .
According to a recent survey , women still do twice as much housework as men on average , a ratio that holds true even if both spouses work full - time .
Even worse for women is the childcare ratio .
Mums do an average of five times as much with their children as dads .
The same ratio as 90 years ago .
I asked Julie to list all the household chores she does .
' I clean the children 's rooms , I set up playdates for our kids , I take them to the doctor , I pay the household bills . '
If this were a movie , it would show clock hands spinning around , maybe calendar days flipping by .
It 's a very long list .
She continues : ' I fill the liquid soap dispensers , I wash our table mats , I get new toner for the printer . '
Julie does chores I did n't even know existed .
' I'm a shameless comparer .
Any time I hear about a husband behaving badly , I can hardly wait to tell Julie '
I tell her that I will do everything that needs doing for the next month .
Instead of being bowled over with gratitude , Julie says : ' I can't let you do that .
Our house would look like a rubbish tip . '
This is the problem .
Julie 's just more competent at a lot of these tasks .
Or all of them .
She 's the single most organised person in the world .
Maybe that 's why women do more housework .
They 're better at it .
They were born with the tidiness gene .
In the name of research , I call Helen Fisher , an anthropologist who specialises in genetic gender differences , hoping she 'll confirm my hunch .
No luck .
She tells me it is rubbish and I can't blame my laziness on my Y chromosome .
I 've decided , then , the key is to be aggressive - ' proactive ' as they used to say in business meetings .
I have to be an alpha house - husband .
My friend Albert emails .
He is working on a television drama and his first episode is airing in two weeks .
I type an email to Julie : ' Should we record it ? '
Before I press send , I pause .
The true meaning of my email is : ' Julie , would you record it ? '
I delete the email , trudge into the living room and program the Sky Plus .
Yes , I know .
I am a hero .
But now I 'm being an ideal husband I realise there are dozens of little jobs calling out to be done .
I 'm overwhelmed .
I spend the rest of the day re-attaching knobs to cabinets and putting stray CDs in containers .
To paraphrase the title of Allison Pearson 's best - selling book about modern mums , I do n't know how the hell she does it .
Julie reminds me that part of our agreement is that I would not compare myself to other husbands during this month .
And it 's true , I 'm a shameless comparer .
Any time I hear about a husband behaving badly , I can hardly wait to tell Julie .
Jacobs cooked his wife chicken piccata and waited on her all evening
' See ?
You 're lucky I do n't have affairs . '
Or : ' See ?
You 're lucky I do n't work till 11 every night . '
Another of Julie 's guidelines for Project Ideal Husband is , naturally , for me to buy her flowers .
I object with the argument that we 're in the middle of a fierce recession ( I know - not very obedient of me ) .
Flowers are so astonishingly dear at the moment , I can only surmise that they are kept hydrated with water drawn from the fjords of Norway by specially trained geologists .
' It does n't have to be flowers , ' Julie says .
' Gifts of any kind will do . '
When we started dating , I was a decent gift giver .
I gave Julie books and soaps and cinnamon - scented candles .
Then the presents slowly trailed off .
Maybe my gift - giving deficiency is genetic .
My dad is still living down the gift he gave my mother for their first Valentine 's Day together : nothing .
Going against family tradition , I 've started to bring Julie a gift a day .
Mostly , skinny lattes .
But also DVDs and soaps and books .
I 'm starting to plan these gifts days in advance .
I look forward to seeing Julie 's smile when I set them on her desk .
Since our twins were born three years ago , Julie rarely cooks anything other than fish fingers and spaghetti bolognese .
So I decide to cook us chicken piccata .
Incredibly , the rice does n't explode all over the kitchen walls and the chicken breasts do n't send us to the hospital with botulism .
' Now I actually notice when the hand soap dispensers and loo roll are empty - and refill them '
I light the candles , pour the wine and serve the chicken .
' No napkin over your arm ? ' asks Julie .
Aside from the napkin oversight , I 'd go so far as to say it 's a little romantic .
Clearly happy at being relieved of her cooking duties , Julie says : ' If you cook for me every night , we could make love every night . '
' But I do n't want to make love every night , ' I protest , somewhat alarmed .
' I thought all men did ? ' she asks ' All men who are 17 , ' I inform her .
Which brings up a question .
How often should the ideal husband sleep with his wife ?
The average married couple has sex just about twice a week , according to several recent surveys ( a statistic probably skewed by the randy just - married 22 - year - olds ) .
Is that what the woman wants ?
Or is it some compromise ?
It 's not clear .
' How often is ideal for you ? '
I ask .
' Once a week sounds good . '
She pauses .
' Do n't write that down . '
At 20 days in , I start to think the power is going to Julie 's head .
Her requests are coming thick and fast - and are no longer softened with a ' please ' or ' would you mind ? '
She has started snapping at me .
I try to ask her something while she is watching MasterChef and she answers me with a wave of the hand , sign language for ' get out of the room now ' .
It 's all starting to remind me of the Stanford Prison experiment in 1971 - where a group of college students were chosen to pretend to be ' guards ' and ' inmates ' for two weeks .
It was n't long before the guards started to abuse their power and demean the inmates and the experiment spun so out of control that they had to shut it down after six days .
I think I 've got a mini-prison experiment going on here .
Later , when I sit down to join her , she says regally : ' Can you turn up the volume ? '
We 're watching Ten Years Younger - her choice .
' You have the remote , ' I say , trying to keep my temper .
' I know .
But I want you to walk to the TV and turn up the volume on the set . '
I 'm not supposed to argue with her .
I heave myself off my chair .
Thank goodness there 's only two days left .
Julie admits that she is in a mood as she knows that the experiment is about to end and in 48 hours she 'll have to go back to doing everything .
To my surprise , I tell her that will not be happening - this has definitely made me appreciate how much my wife does around the home .
Before the experiment , I probably thought I was doing 45 per cent of what needed to be done - it turned out it was more like 20 per cent .
Now I actually notice when the hand soap dispensers and loo roll are empty - and refill them .
And it 's made us both realise it 's not always the big gestures that matter .
We now make an effort to be nice to one another and , obvious as it sounds , it makes us both happier .
Marriage is an accumulation of the little gestures .
The little gestures are the ones that count - like making chicken piccata .
I admit that when I hatched this grand plan , I rather hoped Julie would grow to hate the new doormat husband and miss my insubordinate , slobby and annoying ways .
Boy did that backfire .
Julie describes our little experiment as ' the best month of my life ' .
And my male friends are full of resentment because their wives are forever saying ' why can't you be more like AJ ? '
But the lessons I 've learned have , without a doubt , improved our marriage .
Unfortunately , they have torpedoed my comfy , ignorant existence for ever .

The LLDB Debugger ¶
Welcome to the LLDB documentation !
LLDB is a next generation , high - performance debugger .
It is built as a set of reusable components which highly leverage existing libraries in the larger LLVM Project , such as the Clang expression parser and LLVM disassembler .
LLDB is the default debugger in Xcode on macOS and supports debugging C , Objective - C and C++ on the desktop and iOS devices and simulator .
All of the code in the LLDB project is available under the “ Apache 2.0 License with LLVM exceptions ” .
Using LLDB ¶
For an introduction into the LLDB command language , head over to the LLDB Tutorial .
For users already familiar with GDB there is a cheat sheet listing common tasks and their LLDB equivalent in the GDB to LLDB command map .
There are also multiple resources on how to script LLDB using Python Python Reference is a great starting point for that .
Compiler Integration Benefits ¶ LLDB converts debug information into Clang types so that it can leverage the Clang compiler infrastructure .
This allows LLDB to support the latest C , C++ , Objective - C and Objective - C++ language features and runtimes in expressions without having to reimplement any of this functionality .
It also leverages the compiler to take care of all ABI details when making functions calls for expressions , when disassembling instructions and extracting instruction details , and much more .
The major benefits include :
Up to date language support for C , C++ , Objective - C
Multi-line expressions that can declare local variables and types
Utilize the JIT for expressions when supported
Evaluate expression Intermediate Representation ( IR ) when JIT ca n’t be used
Reusability ¶
The LLDB debugger APIs are exposed as a C++ object oriented interface in a shared library .
The lldb command line tool links to , and uses this public API .
On macOS the shared library is exposed as a framework named LLDB .
framework , and Unix systems expose it as lldb.so .
The entire API is also then exposed through Python script bindings which allow the API to be used within the LLDB embedded script interpreter , and also in any python script that loads the lldb.py module in standard python script files .
See the Python Reference page for more details on how and where Python can be used with the LLDB API .
Sharing the LLDB API allows LLDB to not only be used for debugging , but also for symbolication , disassembly , object and symbol file introspection , and much more .
Platform Support¶ LLDB is known to work on the following platforms , but ports to new platforms are welcome : macOS debugging for i386 , x86_64 and AArch64
iOS , tvOS , and watchOS simulator debugging on i386 , x86_64 and AArch64
iOS , tvOS , and watchOS device debugging on ARM and AArch64
Linux user - space debugging for i386 , x86_64 and PPC64le
FreeBSD user - space debugging for i386 and x86_64
Windows user - space debugging for i386 ( *) (*)
Support for Windows is under active development .
Basic functionality is expected to work , with functionality improving rapidly .

The betrayal of Sir Clive Sinclair 's real ' wife ' , as he marries a lapdancer
Sir Clive Sinclair would hardly seem the marrying kind .
After all , the millionaire inventor has devoted the past two decades to an unashamedly single way of life .
Despite his advancing years , he could often be seen dancing – or , as the mood took him , snoozing – at a variety of West End nightclubs amid an ever - changing roster of glamorous female companions .
The louche Stringfellows lap - dancing club has been a particular favourite .
So when , last summer , Sir Clive , 69 , said he was engaged to be married , even his closest friends were a little sceptical .
His rock : Sir Clive with his long - time confidante Elaine .
The pair were lovers before they became friends
And when , just a few weeks ago , he announced that vows had been exchanged and that Angie Bowness , a blonde former model and lap dancer 36 years his junior , was the new Lady Sinclair , doubt turned to shock , dismay and , in one particular case , distress .
Because Sir Clive already had ‘ a wife ’ – even if she had never been given the satisfaction of a formal ceremony .
Elaine Millar , 53 , had been by his side for a quarter of a century , first as a lover and then as a devoted companion and personal assistant who organised the daily routine of his computer business .
Beautiful girlfriends came and went , but Elaine was a constant , happy to organise his
private and professional lives .
She shared his home and his busy social life .
Today , however , she is alone in her elegant apartment in Harrogate , West Yorkshire .
In public she remains as dignified as ever , refusing to comment on the behaviour of the man she had hoped would marry her , but friends say that in private she feels comprehensively betrayed .
‘ Clive has behaved extremely badly to her , ’ said one close friend , who did not wish to be named but has known both of them for many years .
‘ I like them both but I have to take her side .
He really did the dirty on her .
It ’s not fair .
‘ They ’ve been together nearly 25 years .
Had they been married , it would have been some sort of anniversary .
It ’s disgraceful when she ’s given up everything for this man . ’
Younger rival : Sir Clive recently married Angie Bowness , a lapdancer at Stringfellows nightclub
The approach of the new Lady Sinclair has scarcely helped .
Keen to maintain some professional independence , perhaps , the former Miss Bowness has hired a publicist and recently posed in revealing lingerie pictures for a national newspaper .
Then , to make matters worse , she announced that she was helping Sir Clive with his businesses , which has been Elaine ’s role for most of her professional life .
As the companion of such a well - known personality , it might seem puzzling that so few outside their close social circle know of her existence .
For years , she was pictured as a ‘ mystery blonde ’ , standing by Sir Clive ’s side as she helped him fulfil his hectic schedule of social engagements .
That consistent lack of acknowledgement has been one of the most hurtful aspects of the way she has been treated , say her friends .
Elaine first met Sir Clive in a popular Chelsea wine bar in 1986 .
Recently knighted , he was already famous as the inventor of the world ’s first slimline pocket calculator and one of the first household computers to be commercially available .
Happy couple : Sir Clive and former model and lapdancer Angie - who is 36 years his junior - married earlier this year
He had just launched the C5 , the electrically powered tricycle , with great fanfare , although it was later judged a dangerous failure .
These inventions and his successful electronics firm , Sinclair Research , had made him a multi-millionaire with little problem meeting women .
He had been married , spending 22 years with the late Ann Trevor - Briscoe , a relationship that produced three children , Belinda , Crispin and Bartholomew .
By the time he met Elaine , however , the marriage had ended , he was single once again and apparently keen to make up for lost time .
For her part , Elaine was poised and beautiful , with big eyes and a warm smile .
Privately educated at Darlington High School for Girls and then the Sorbonne , she had travelled down to London to pursue a career in public relations in the hotel industry .
Understandably , she was attracting a great deal of male interest .
In fact , Elaine was happily dating two or three eligible young men at the time and at the start of the relationship it was Sir Clive who seemed the keener of the two .
Ladies ' man : Despite his advancing years , Sir Clive could often be seen at a variety of West End nightclubs
One friend says : ‘ He used to become very anxious at the thought it might end and would leave frantic , slightly garbled phone messages for her .
‘ Years later , if she was feeling down about something he ’d done , she would get out the old tapes and listen to him – proof that there had been a time when the boot was on the other foot . ’
Sir Clive ’s intelligence and persistence won through , however , and
they moved in together in a large house in Surrey .
There was a strong attraction between the two and they had much in common .
She was clever , gregarious and , like him , loved socialising , champagne glass in hand .
By coincidence , her own family background was in engineering .
Her grandfather had owned the Wallace Millar ship repair yard on Teesside .
And before meeting Clive , she had worked in Algeria negotiating contracts for new pipe work .
Elaine gave up her own job in hotel marketing and started working full - time for her millionaire lover , and for some years they were happy – until , that is , Sir Clive ’s interest in the opposite sex began to burgeon .
Over the years he had a number of well - publicised flings , and the physical side of his relationship with Elaine started to dwindle .
Yet she remained devoted , to his business and to him – even when he was openly escorting a succession of glamorous women , including Ruth Kensit , a cousin of the actress Patsy .
There was also Patricia Walsh , the playwright and actress who has most recently starred in Sky TV’s Pineapple Dance Studios , and actress Sally Farmiloe .
In the early Nineties , Sir Clive decided to move back into the centre of London , where a party lifestyle was easier to pursue .
He had flats first in Shepherd Market , Mayfair , and then in King ’s Cross , where he occupied a huge open - plan apartment in a converted factory – a perfect place for social gatherings .
Sometimes Elaine was living with him , sometimes he paid for her to live elsewhere .
Twelve years ago , when Sir Clive bought a plush apartment overlooking Trafalgar Square , Elaine moved , too , living in an adjoining flat with intercom .
By then she was a wealthy woman in her own right , thanks to her own property investments , and the unusual arrangement suited them both .
Elaine was directly on hand to help out with the contractual details of a rapidly diversifying business , which was moving away from computers and into more eccentric products , such as power units for wheelchairs .
Still she was his first choice of companion at public events .
‘ Wherever he went Elaine usually turned up too , ’ said a friend .
‘ And unlike some of his other women she never sought publicity for herself .
‘ They genuinely enjoyed each other ’s company .
And like a married couple they would bicker and argue .
It was a very close relationship . ’
Great minds think alike : Sir Clive with Alan Sugar in 1984
Other friends report that when Elaine attempted to break free from him and establish some romantic independence for herself , Sir Clive would become jealous .
That may be one reason her relationships with other men remained short - lived .
She put up with Sir Clive ’s affairs , knowing that few of his dates were likely to threaten their own unique partnership .
As recently as last year , they enjoyed regular nights out , trips to art galleries , restaurants and society events .
Their relationship , while no longer sexual , had settled into one of happy companionship and mutual support – not unlike many a long - lasting marriage .
But 12 years ago , Elaine took a call that was , although she did n’t know it at the time , to end her relationship .
It was from Angie Bowness .
Sir Clive had met her at String­fellows and had given her his card .
Angie was a dancer at the club , although it is not clear whether she had been working when they met .
At first it was a relationship that seemed to follow the normal pattern – it lasted just a few months before they parted .
Angie met businessman Mark Thornton and in April 1998 , she gave birth to his son , Marcus .
Sir Clive ’s interest remained undimmed , however , and the two stayed in touch .
Her relationship with Thornton ended and she started to meet Sir Clive socially once again .
From time to time , he made gifts of expensive jewellery , including last February a £ 35,000 diamond ring and , unknown to Elaine , the relationship was becoming serious .
So when in April , the day before her birthday , Elaine received a phone call from Sir Clive , it was a shattering moment .
He announced that he had flown to Las Vegas and married his younger girlfriend .
Elaine has now moved out of the Trafalgar Square apartment , the one linked to Sir Clive ’s , and her young rival is there in her place .
Inventor : Sir Clive at the launch of his A - bike at the Design Museum in 2006
Their public appearances together have ended , so have Sir Clive ’s regular phone calls .
There was no birthday present this year and , for the first time in decades , no party thrown in her honour .
Elaine , as you might expect , is maintaining a brave front .
She says she still admires Sir Clive , she still divides her time between London and Yorkshire , and remains a director and major shareholder in his company .
Today , Sinclair Research concentrates on the manufacture and sales of a lightweight foldaway bicycle called the ‘ A - bike ’ .
‘ I loved my job , ’ she told The Mail on Sunday .
‘ It was a way of life .
Clive is an extraordinary chap to work with and I learnt a lot during the years I worked with him .
I achieved board level and there were periods of intense high pressure during manufacturing , product launch and intellectual property protection .
‘ Equally we shared happy , amusing and entertaining occasions together with our many mutual friends and international colleagues .
In fact , I ’m planning to write my memoirs shortly . ’
But one of her long - time friends has a rather different take on the geeky inventor ’s latest gamble .
‘ I ’m amazed by what ’s happened , ’ she said .
‘ I really thought Elaine and Clive would end up together .
Now she ’s very much on her own .
Elaine has stood by patiently as she saw him going off with all those showbusiness types .
A lot of other women knew all about Sir Clive and Elaine , but they still walked all over her .
‘ She ’s a lovely , attractive woman .
When they first met , Elaine had other boyfriends and it was Clive who was the really keen one .
‘ She could have married many other people , but she stood by Clive .
I ’m sorry to say that she ’s rather wasted her life on him .
It ’s quite late for her now to find someone else .
‘ Sir Clive is a very clever man , but like many clever men he does n’t always use his brain but a body part lower down . ’
Sir Clive was not available for comment last night .
The body of a Canadian soldier killed Sunday in Afghanistan has begun the long journey home .
Hundreds of soldiers gathered on the tarmac of Kandahar Airfield early Tuesday local time to say goodbye to Sgt. Martin Goudreault , who was on his third tour in Afghanistan when he was killed by an improvised explosive device .
Goudreault , 35 , died while on foot patrol roughly 15 kilometres southwest of the city of Kandahar , Brig . - Gen. Jon Vance said .
" Prior to the IED strike , this patrol was searching for a weapons cache in the rural area of Panjwaii district , " Vance said .
" Insurgents hide their weapons and IEDs amongst the civilian population , and soldiers like Martin — both Canadian and Afghan — are working each and every day to find and eliminate these weapons caches . "
Lt. Matthew Hoare said he wo n't soon forget the battlefield lessons he learned from Goudreault .
" The guidance that he gave me personally is something that I will always carry with me , " Hoare said .
" It 's a loss I think we 're all going to feel . "
Goudreault , who was born in Sudbury , Ont. , was a 15 - year veteran of the Canadian Forces .
He was on his fifth overseas deployment when he died .
" Sgt. Goudreault was a model soldier ; someone the soldiers in his section could look up to and emulate , " Vance said .
He was from 1 Combat Engineer Regiment , based in Edmonton .
He was serving in Afghanistan as a member of the 1st Battalion , The Royal Canadian Regiment Battle Group , the military said in a statement .
Harper , Jean give condolences
Prime Minister Stephen Harper expressed his condolences to Goudreault 's family and friends .
" The lives of the Afghan people are better due to the efforts of Canadians like Sgt. Goudreault who provide security and stability , " Harper said in a statement .
" These are the cornerstones that will allow the country to rebuild and grow into the future . "
Gov. - Gen. Michaëlle Jean said she was profoundly saddened by the news .
" Yet again , we have received a cruel reminder of the dangers that daily confront our troops deployed to this troubled area of the world , " she said in a statement .
" We admire them all the more as their sense of duty compels them to answer their country 's call with valour , determination and incredible generosity . "
Goudreault is the 147th Canadian soldier to die in Afghanistan since the military began its combat mission in 2002 .
Yale Constitutional Law Professor Jack Balkin agrees that we need to remember the Confederacy :
I think Governor McDonnell of Virginia is correct that we need to remember the Confederacy and the causes that led Americans to forsake their country and commit treason .
Americans need to know their history , and how the world we live in came to be .
And he quotes Confederate Vice - President Alexander Stephens ' infamous 1861 Cornerstone Speech :
Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite idea ; its foundations are laid , its corner - stone rests upon the great truth , that the negro is not equal to the white man ; that slavery -- subordination to the superior race -- is his natural and normal condition .
[ Applause . ]
This , our new government , is the first , in the history of the world , based upon this great physical , philosophical , and moral truth .
There 's more , and I recommend clicking through to Balkin .
But the point is this : forgetting slavery was n't just a major omission ; slavery was the Confederacy 's defining characteristic .
Balkin also quotes from the articles of secession from Mississippi , South Carolina , and Texas .
Suffice to say that slavery is mentioned .
In a separate post , Balkin quotes directly from the Constitution of the Confederate States of America .
Once again , apparently surprisingly to McDonnell , slavery gets an occasional mention .
As if it were the key to the Confederacy 's existence .
Which , actually , it was .
I 've cut Balkin 's quotes , and I again urge you to click through :
Article I , section 9 , clauses 1 and 2 : The importation of negroes of the African race from any foreign country other than the slaveholding States or Territories of the United States of America , is hereby forbidden ; and Congress is required to pass such laws as shall effectually prevent the same .
Congress shall also have power to prohibit the introduction of slaves from any State not a member of , or Territory not belonging to , this Confederacy .
In other words , the slave trade was encoded in the Confederate Constitution .
Article I , section 9 , clause 4 : No bill of attainder , ex post facto law , or law denying or impairing the right of property in negro slaves shall be passed .
Balkin points out that this specifically guarantees the right to own " negro " slaves .
Ownership of slaves of other races may or may not be banned , but the right to own " negro " slaves was to be forever .
The Confederate Constitution not only defined itself by slavery , it defined itself by racism .
Article IV , section 2 , clause 1 : The citizens of each State shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States ; and shall have the right of transit and sojourn in any State of this Confederacy , with their slaves and other property ; and the right of property in said slaves shall not be thereby impaired .
As Balkin points out , this goes beyond Dred Scott .
It is a specific Constitutional protection of slavery .
No state can bar people from transporting their slaves across state lines .
Slavery is seen to be that important .
It also very specifically , and very blithely , defines human beings as property .
From Article IV , section 3 , clause 3 , Balkin quotes a section on what is to happen should the Confederacy acquire new territory :
In all such territory the institution of negro slavery , as it now exists in the Confederate States , shall be recognized and protected be Congress and by the Territorial government ; and the inhabitants of the several Confederate States and Territories shall have the right to take to such Territory any slaves lawfully held by them in any of the States or Territories of the Confederate States .
Once again , the importance of slavery could not be more clear .
Defining " negroes " as an inferior race , and protecting the ownership , transportation , and commerce of " negroes " was n't just a major aspect of the Confederacy , it was the very definition of the Confederacy .
Balkin :
I am sure that Governor McDonnell of Virginia will want to include careful study of these provisions as part of his celebration of Confederate History Month .
Surely we cannot understand why the Confederacy was such a noble and glorious cause worth commemorating without understanding the values and visions of the framers of the Confederate Constitution .
With all due respect - and I do mean all due respect - to Governor McDonnell , the history he wants to commemorate is one of the most heinous ever .
It was even worse than so many historical examples where slavery was allowed , because it very specifically designated one race as uniquely and Constitutionally defined as suitable for slavery .
If that 's the history of his own people that McDonnell wants to remember , so be it .
Let 's remember it .
When people celebrate or commemorate the Confederacy , they not only are celebrating and commemorating treason , they are celebrating and commemorating inhumanity itself .
Which defines them , and no one else .
Many people graduate from medical residency programs ready to start rewarding careers in obstetrics and gynecology with the best intentions .
They ’re prepared to provide patients with total reproductive health care , which includes abortions .
But their idealism is soon crushed by the medical establishment ’s significant opposition to abortion .
It came as a surprise to Lori Freedman , Ph.D. , Research Associate at Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health ( ANSIRH ) .
As lead author of the study “ Obstacles to the Integration of Abortion into Obstetrics and Gynecology Practice , ” Freedman conducted in - depth interviews with 18 doctors who had planned to offer abortions after graduating from their residency programs five to 10 years earlier .
Only three were in fact doing so .
Freedman and her co-authors did n’t expect to find so many physicians who ran up against “ significant professional barriers ” when they expressed an interest in providing abortions .
She expected to find “ more of the focus on fear of violence and controversy , maybe some moral dilemmas ” for those who were n’t providing abortions , but she discovered something else :
Many assume that young physicians give up abortion practice because they are afraid of violence or ignorant of the history of illegal abortion and deaths associated with it .
I do n’t believe that is really the problem .
The physicians I spoke with were quite aware of the history and the importance of safe and compassionate abortion care for women .
The barriers are formal and informal ; some are explicit before hiring and some surface after hiring .
Some of the new hires are gently advised , “ We ’re not going to be doing that . ”
Others receive specific warnings .
One doctor in the study was threatened in an interview by the outgoing senior partner .
He leaned across the desk and said , “ If I ever find out you did elective abortions any time in your professional life , you ’ll never practice medicine in [ this state ] again .
Do you understand that ? ”
A few of the doctors who tried to moonlight as abortion providers soon found out that was also prohibited .
New physicians have little power and professional support , so their ability to change the status quo is nil .
Freedman and her co-authors believe that providing training in contract negotiation and conflict management may help these doctors continue to provide abortions as they transition from residency programs to practice .
Young doctors can also benefit from ongoing contact with pro-choice colleagues and community members .
Freedman hopes that the study will help improve abortion care simply by revealing the impediments faced by potential providers :
Much effort has gone to motivating individual medical students and residents to provide abortion , which is imperative .
However , this study shows that individual - level motivation can only take them so far .
They need support and they need information about obstacles they may face in practice before they get there , so they can choose their jobs accordingly .
And I hope that the study will cause some larger organizations , private practice groups and hospitals to take a look at what kinds of barriers to abortion care they are perpetuating . ”
We need to dismantle those barriers .
Why should any doctor be prohibited from providing a legal medical procedure ?
It ’s not an option if it ’s not available .

South Korea has announced it has arrested a two - star general on charges of leaking the country 's entire war plan to North Korea .
It is the latest in a series of arrests of alleged North Korean spies , including a woman accused of using sex to secure sensitive information .
The alleged spy is accused of giving Pyongyang South Korea 's entire war plan , which includes preparations and responses to be implemented in the event of a conflict with the communist North .
The general was allegedly paid for betraying his country when the plans were passed on to a North Korean agent in China .
The leak is the latest in a series of damaging blows to South Korea 's security .
Two alleged North Korean assassins are about to go on trial in the South charged with attempting to kill a senior North Korean defector .
The former head of the North Korean workers party and tutor to Kim Jong - il , Hwang Jang Yop , defected to the South in 1997 .
The two assassins apparently trained for six years to carry out the assassination mission .
They came to the South posing as defectors , but were caught as they were preparing to strike .
And in another case , a North Korean woman allegedly posing as a defector has been arrested for passing on plans of Seoul 's subway system to Pyongyang .
She is accused of sleeping with a subway official to obtain the plans , which are now in the hands of Kim Jong - il 's regime .
One of South Korea 's chief spy hunters , prosecutor Oh Se - in , says the North is intensifying its spy missions into the South while their focus has been on the sinking of a South Korean warship in March .
He says it is a two pronged war - the visible war involving guns , ships and soldiers , and then the clandestine war involving spies , sex and secret plans .
However , despite recent tensions the South has approved two shipments of humanitarian aid to the North .
South Korea 's Unification Ministry says it has approved two private shipments of baby formula .
The aid is worth hundreds of thousands of dollars and will be sent this month .
Impoverished North Korea is suffering severe food shortages , and the United Nations estimates that one in three of its children is stunted by malnutrition .
Seoul says it will continue to offer humanitarian aid to Pyongyang , despite the recent tension .

A snaggle - toothed , furry creature with a bald face and a rat ’s tale has mystified natives in northern Ontario , but they have a name and a history for it .
“ The elders used to see it a long time ago , ” the manager of Sam ’s Store in Big Trout Lake told the Star on Friday .
“ No one has seen one for 40 years or so .
The elders have a word for it : omajinaakoos .
In English , it means ‘ the ugly one ’ . ”
Two Health Canada nurses training at the Kitchenuhmaykoosib Band reserve south of Hudson ’s Bay said their dog Sam hauled out the 30 - centimetre creature it found in early May floating face down near the causeway on the reserve , band spokesman Darryl Sainnawap told the Star .
“ It looks like a mixed breed of an otter and a beaver , ” he said .
“ We ’re just as curious as everyone to find out what it is . ”
One band member , 65 - year - old John McKay , said he remembered his grandfather talking about such a creature that “ feeds on beavers and otters . ”
Sainnawap ’s 80 - year - old grandfather had never seen anything like it , though .
Other elders “ think it could be a messenger for bad news , ” he said .
“ We ’ll see . ”
The discoverers threw it back in the water , thinking it was a commonly found northern Ontario beast , Sainnawap said .
The nurses themselves have been posted elsewhere , and staff at the nursing station wo n’t talk .
“ We work for the federal government , ” said one .
“ We ’re under a gag order . ”
Sainnawap rejected speculation that it could be a man-made hybrid created for pictures .
“ We do n’t play God here . ”
Nor would the nurses , he said .
“ It ’s got to have a mother and father out there , so one day we will find out what it is . ”
Cryptomundo.com , a site devoted to “ elusive and rare animals , ” has done an analysis of various small animals ’ skulls , with the muskrat seeming a close match — although the nasty teeth were judged un -muskrat - like .
Others speculate it may be the mythical Ogopogo , the Chupacabra or some other marine monster , like the Loch Ness Monster .
“ But more realistic considerations have talked about it being a known species , such as a bear cub ( Ursus americanus ) or other animals .
Even the mundane looks strange without hair , ” Loren Coleman at Cryptomundo said .
“ The other top candidate is that of the North American river otter ( Lontra canadensis ) . ”
A New Zealand zoologist examined the teeth , whiskers and paws and decided :
“ I think this is just another variation of an ordinary creature sculpted by the action of decomposition by water , as I demonstrated last year with the Gisbourne New Zealand Monster that was actually a drowned Opossum . ”
World 's most complete fossil of pre-dinosaur predator discovered
Brazilian paleontologists have found the near complete fossil of a fearsome predator that roamed the Earth before the dinosaurs .
The 22ft long creature , called Prestosuchus chiniquensis , lived some 238 million years ago .
It belonged to a family of reptiles called thecodonts and had a large , deep skull with serrated teeth and a long tail .
This Prestosuchus chiniquensis fossil is the most complete one ever found .
The 900lb predator was a relation of the crocodile
Weighing 900lbs , the carnivores romated Earth during the Triassic Period 250 to 205 million years ago .
Dinosaurs came to dominate from 230 million years ago up to their extinction 65 million years ago .
The well - preserved creature was found by a team from the Lutheran University of Brazil , in the town of Dona Francisca 160 miles from Porto Alegre .
' It is something that we could never imagine - the quality of preservation and the size of the fossils are sensational , ' Professor Da Silva said .
He added : ' They were amazing predators .
This discovery will allow a better understanding of the anatomy of Prestosuchus and will facilitate a more precise reconstruction of the skeleton of the animal . '
Two paleontologists evaluate the exposed part of the extraordinary fossil .
They hope it will remain in Brazil where it was found
How the Prestosuchus chiniquensis may have looked .
It was 22ft long and probably weighed around 900lbs
It is also the first find that includes a well preserved hind leg , which will help scientists work out how these ancient creatures moved .
The Prestosuchus was first discovered in Brazil in 1938 by a visiting German paleontologist called Friedrich von Huene .
The remains were found in a sedimentary rock formation , which was a lake millions of years ago .
Paleontologists believe that herbivore creatures stopped to drink at the site and were ambushed by carnivores such as the Prestosuchus .
Safari 5 includes a new secure browser extension system that is similar in many respects to Chrome 's extensions and Firefox 's Jetpack plugin .
Extensions are created completely in JavaScript , HTML , and CSS , and Apple takes great pains to differentiate extensions from plug-ins .
Safari plug - ins — written in native code — are solely for supporting new media types within the browser ( Flash , Quicktime , et cetera ) whereas extensions are for adding new functionality to the browser itself .
The first iteration of the extension system allows developers to add features to a number of carefully controlled places within the application .
Developers can create toolbars , add items to contextual menus , manipulate windows and tabs , add toolbar buttons , and manipulate and extract content within webpages themselves .
Extensions can also selectively inspect and filter resources and deny them from loading .
Apple provides a handy diagram to show all the parts of the application your extension can touch :
An Apple diagram showing which parts of the browser an extension can affect .
Thus it should be fairly obvious that it's not possible to add items to the status bar area to manipulate existing toolbars or toolbar items , or to change the display of the window itself ( outside of normal JavaScript abilities such as resizing the browser window and such ) .
This means the Apple extensions system is much closer to Chrome than it is to the Jetpack or native Firefox add - ons .
In fact , Apple 's developer documents contain a conversion document with helpful tips targeted specifically at existing Chrome developers .
A developer at WWDC's " State of Safari " talk said he was able to take his existing Chrome extension , develop a thin layer of Safari shim code , and have a nearly fully functional Safari port in roughly 12 hours of work .
Development of these extensions has been taking place at a breakneck place since the software 's unveiling at WWDC .
In less than a week , hundreds of extensions have been created and are currently being featured ad - hoc on blogs and Tumblrs .
Comments from developers we met this week at WWDC indicate that it 's nearly a given that Apple will be launching its own extension gallery at some point in the near future .
This gallery will undoubtedly share characteristics of Google 's Chrome extension gallery and Apple 's own dashboard widgets downloads site .
So you want to make an extension ?
This article will briefly walk you through the way that Safari extensions work and how the different parts of the architecture interact with the browser itself .
The very first thing you should do is open the Safari Preferences dialog , click on the " Extensions " pane , and flip the switch to " On . "
The second thing you should do is click on the " Advanced " pane and tick the " Show Develop menu in menu bar . "
Safari extensions start their lives as a simple folder on your computer .
These folders have a . safariextension extension and contain a series of files that make the extension tick .
Each extension contains , at the bare minimum , an info. plist , which is an XML file that defines metadata about the extension ( e.g. , the extension 's name , the name of the developer , the current version , the names of resources used , and so forth ) .
The folder will also optionally contain some of the following :
A global HTML file that will be loaded into memory and executed when Safari 5 is launched or the extension is installed .
HTML , CSS , and JavaScript files that define the markup , style , and behavior of extension toolbars
CSS and JavaScript files which are injected into webpages based on a set of domain rules specified in your Info. plist .
Any image resources you might be using in toolbar buttons or elsewhere in your extension .
An Icon.png that shows up in the Extensions section of the Safari preferences dialog .
Another XML file — Settings.
plist — that sets up information about your extension 's settings and which dictate how they appear in the preferences dialog .
Content files — typically HTML , but could be pretty much anything , like PDFs — which you can open in a full window or " inject " into an existing webpage through an iframe .
The extension builder tool is found within Safari 5 and makes configuring and deploying your extension a simple procedure .
Safari 5 bundles a nice tool called the Extension Builder that will help you create your Info and Settings files so you wo n't have to futz with XML by hand .
In addition , it provides functions that let you inspect your Global HTML file , install and remove your development extensions , and bundle your extension for distribution .
Before you can even get started developing and distributing extensions , though , you 'll need to sign up for a free Safari Developer account with Apple and then request a Safari Extension Certificate .
The certificate assistant makes this all a fairly simple procedure .
Perth has been ranked the least sustainable city in an assessment of the carbon footprint of Australia 's 20 largest cities .
The study looked at key indicators including air quality , climate change readiness , public transport and water use .
Darwin was first , Brisbane ranked third , Canberra was fifth , then Hobart , Melbourne , Sydney was 12th and Adelaide was 14th .
Don Henry from the Australian Conservation Foundation says even the most sustainable cities can still do more to reduce their ecological footprint .
" We found Darwin , the Sunshine Coast and Brisbane are up there near the top .
We found Perth , Geelong , Newcastle are near the bottom but I think the important point is we 're all in a pretty average space and our cities can do a lot better to be more sustainable " .
The Sustainable Energy Association 's WA chairman Ray Wills says the West Australian Government needs to follow the lead of other cities and introduce renewable energy programs .
" We have Australia 's best , in fact the world 's best resources in solar , in wind and there 's grand opportunities for much of Western Australia 's economy to in fact be powered by renewable energy . "
The Sustainable Energy Association 's WA chairman Ray Wills says Perth needs to step up to avoid lagging any further behind the national average .
" Across Australia the average use of renewable energy is around about 8 per cent , in Western Australia it 's about five per cent .
" The state government is certainly taking steps right now to improve that outcome but right now Perth city is lagging behind . "
Mr Wills says many years of low electricity prices in WA has slowed Perth 's renewable energy uptake .
" The increase in energy tariffs will actually lead to a more attractive uptake of renewable energy , because the price differential between what has been a subsidised fossil fuel price for 15 years is now going to be remedied by power increases . "
El maltrato animal es producto de la violencia en la familia .
Las mascotas son víctimas de una sociedad deshumanizada
[ email protected ]
El Abuelo llegó a un albergue con marcas de maltrato .
En casa lo comenzaron a relegar , ya no había espacio para él y le daban poco de comer .
Le servían las sobras .
Cuando empezó su caminar lento y ya requería de mayor atención , ya no sólo era tratado como un estorbo sino que , además , cualquier actitud malintencionada o intento de defensa era castigada con golpes , patadas .
El Abuelo no podía hacer más que apartarse y llorar .
La gente con la que convivió toda su vida ya no lo querían .
¿ Cómo recordarles a las personas que vivían en su hogar que El Abuelo tiene derecho a la protección ?
Nadie - dice Yolanda Romero - lo rescató de esos maltratos .
Y nadie lo iba a hacer porque El Abuelo es un perro , un animal de raza criolla que a sus 13 años fue trasladado a una perrera , donde acabaría muriendo .
“ Justo cuando se lo iban a llevar , yo pedí a los de la perrera que me lo dejaran porque estaba en tan mal estado que pensábamos que no duraría mucho ” , señala Yolanda , protectora de animales y representante de la organización Por nuestros hermanos sin voz .
Pero sobrevivió .
Ahora El Abuelo tiene 14 años .
Es uno de los 50 perros que habitan el albergue de animales abandonados y maltratados que atiende dicha asociación civil .
El perro casi ha perdido contacto con los humanos .
A quien se le acerca , aún para acariciarlo , le ronronea .
“ Es que sufrió tanto que ya no le gusta que ni se le acerquen ” , explica Yolanda , quien con 11 años de experiencia en el cuidado de estos animales se ha convertido casi en su terapeuta .
El Abuelo apenas tiene ganas de caminar .
Se acurruca bajo los árboles y su actividad no es más que la de ser un vigilante .
Ronda los tiraderos de San Pablo de las Salinas , donde Yolanda ubicó el albergue y en donde los dueños de perros no queridos terminan por abandonarlos para que se confundan entre la basura .
La salida fácil “ Nos hemos encontrado a perros a punto de morir de hambre , todos flacos .
Perros casi degollados porque atan sus cuellos con alambres de púas o cadenas .
Perros muertos a balazos , quemados con aceite hiviendo , o con rastros de pólvora en su pelaje porque les echan cohetes ” , comenta Yolanda .
Los llanos de San Pablo de las Salinas se ubican en el municipio de Tultitlán , en el Estado de México .
El paisaje es un desierto de tierra salitrosa con cerros de basura que recolectan los pepenadores y compradores de viejo que habitan esta zona .
Los tumultos de desperdicios de todo tipo , la escasa iluminación y la nula vigilancia policiaca y vecinal facilitan que las personas , día y noche , vengan hasta este lugar para deshacerse de los animales que ya no quieren .
Es ya hasta una costumbre casi ancestral .
“ Hace cinco años , un joven , junto con sus amigos , encendieron una fogata , venían de por aquí , de la unidad ( habitacional ) de los relojes y en el fuego echó a su gata y a las crías que había tenido .
Lo peor de todo que refleja el grado de perversidad en esos actos , es que los chamacos hasta se reían de cómo se retorcían los pobres animales en el fuego ” .
Pero abajo de esa salitre también hay historia .
Los perros que son abandonados y sobreviven hacen sus guaridas , cavan hoyos y depositan ahí a sus cachorros .
Hay todo un laberinto de cuevas .
Yolanda se mete en ellos para rescatar a los perros y a la hembra .
“ Aquí se pueden morir de hambre o crecen de manera salvaje y entonces es peor , porque comienzan a molestar o andar en jaurías después son víctimas de las peores formas de maltrato ” , asegura .
Otra amenaza .
Como hay basura acumulada siempre , los cachorros son presa de los animales rastreros .
“ Una vez me metí en un hoyo y empecé a decir : vente chiquito , vente , y cuando vi era una ratota .
Ellas se llevan los perritos a sus guaridas y se los comen ” .
Como Yolanda es conocida en la zona por su labor de rescate de animales , los vecinos le avisan cuando nacen los críos de los perros que vagan por los llanos .
La labor Esta vez hay un aviso del nacimiento de nueve cachorros .
Su asistente preparó los tranquilizantes para poder sujetar a la hembra .
Yolanda y él entraron al hoyo que cabó la madre y sacaron a ocho perritos .
Uno de ellos tiene un ojo irritado y otro prácticamente cerrado por la salitre .
Los demás salieron sedientos .
Cuando comenzaron a sacarlos uno por uno , una vecina se acercó , miró los perros y al más gordito y de color claro lo eligió para su hijo .
De inmediato se lo llevó a su casa , pero Yolanda le pidió que lo regresara porque tenía que vacunarlo .
No se lo dijo directamente , pero se opuso a que la señora se apropiara del animal porque afuera de su casa , esa vecina tiene dos grandes perros que las 24 horas del día se la pasan encadenados a los árboles .
Uno de ellos es bien conocido porque lanza la mordida a quien se le atraviese por el frente .
“ Así es la gente , no tiene conciencia de que un animal es un ser vivo como nosotros , que tenemos derecho a recibir buenos tratos , alimentación , un espacio seguro y cariño ” , comenta Yolanda , quien agrega que “ la violencia contra los animales es reflejo de una cultura también violenta y acostumbrada a resolver todo , cualquier situación a golpes ” .
Contra la cadena de violencia Irma León Barajas , cuarta regidora de Tultitlán y ex integrante de Control Canino , asegura que para evitar que San Pablo de las Salinas siga siendo un cementerio canino , iniciará una campaña local “ para que la gente sepa las responsabilidades que implica tener una mascota ” .
Atribuye el maltrato a “ la falta de cultura y educación ” de las personas .
Parte de la campaña que emprenderá la funcionaria incluye una serie de jornadas de esterilización que ya comenzaron .
“ En seis meses operamos a 970 perros y queremos llegar a todos los rincones para esterilizar a las mascotas porque , por lo regular , el abandono de los animales ocurre cuando la gente no sabe qué hacer con los críos de su perro ” , dice .
Carmen Partida , socióloga de la UNAM , coincide en que las agresiones contra los animales son parte de la cadena de la violencia doméstica .
“ Es muy común ver casos en los que el padre le pega a la madre , ella a los hijos y éstos a la mascota ” .
En todos los casos , dice , se tolera y hasta se ve normal .
La Ley de Protección de los Animales en el DF define como maltrato “ todo hecho , acto u omisión del ser humano que puede ocasionar dolor o sufrimiento , afectando el bienestar animal , poner en peligro la vida del animal o afectar gravemente su salud , así como la sobreexplotación de su trabajo ” .
Algunos derechos de animales establecidos por la ley son : alimentación adecuada , atención veterinaria y un reposo reparador .
Las sanciones por maltrato hacia cualquier animal , son la amonestación , la multa o el arresto y si el agresor es un niño , sus padres o tutores serán los responsables .
Karina Benítez , de la organización civil AnimaNaturalis , destaca que las sanciones previstas en la legislación no previenen la violencia contra los animales .
Por ello , desde el 22 de mayo , un grupo de asociaciones organizaron marchas en 10 estados para exigir a los congresos locales que reformen sus códigos penales y tipifiquen al maltrato como delito .
“ Los animales tienen también un sistema nervioso y sienten dolor , pero cada día son víctimas de abusos por falta de educación , sensibilidad o estabilidad mental ” , asegura la activista .

NASA Astronomers to Observe Hayabusa Homecoming
MOFFETT FIELD , Calif . --
A group of astronomers from NASA , the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency ( JAXA ) and other organizations are flying to the other side of the world for a front row seat and a rare opportunity to study a spacecraft 's targeted fiery descent through Earth 's atmosphere .
A Douglas DC - 8 airborne laboratory departed yesterday evening from NASA ’s Dryden Aircraft Operations Facility at Palmdale , Calif. , carrying nearly 30 scientists and their instruments to Melbourne , Australia to make final preparations for the highly - anticipated return of JAXA 's Hayabusa spacecraft .
This luminous re-entry will mark the end of the spacecraft 's seven - year journey to bring a sample of asteroid Itokawa back to Earth .
Hayabusa is expected to fall to Earth over a vast , unpopulated area of Australia at approximately midnight locally , or 7 a.m. PDT , on Sunday , June 13 , 2010 .
Earlier this week , JAXA announced it successfully completed the guidance of the Hayabusa spacecraft , so that it will land in the Woomera Prohibited Area in Australia .
" Hayabusa is hurtling toward Earth at an immense speed , comparable to that of an asteroid impact , " said Peter Jenniskens , the observation campaign 's principal investigator and a scientist at NASA 's Ames Research Center , Moffett Field , Calif. , and the SETI Institute , Mountain View , Calif .
" The capsule that protects the asteroid sample will be only 6,500 feet ahead of the rest of the spacecraft , which will break into numerous pieces , essentially making it a man-made meteor .
" Jenniskens and the team of astronomers onboard the DC - 8 will have their instruments secured near the plane 's specialized windows .
This , paired with their altitude of 39,000 feet far above light pollution and clouds , will enable the scientists to study what happens when the spacecraft and sample return capsule heat up high in the atmosphere .
When Hayabusa reaches an altitude of 190,000 feet , its heat shield will experience temperatures of more than 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit , while the gas surrounding the capsule will reach 13,000 degrees Fahrenheit - hotter than the surface of the sun .
The team ’s primary goal during the airborne mission is to study the Hayabusa capsule 's re-entry to gain technological insight into the heat shield that designers and engineers can use while developing future exploration vehicles .
Because of Hayabusa 's unique heat shield material , shape and the tremendous interplanetary re-entry speed of 7.58 miles per second , scientists expect its descent will provide new , valuable information about heat shields for computer models of re-entry conditions .
JAXA ’s Hayabusa is expected to be the second fastest man-made object to return to Earth ; NASA 's Stardust sample return capsule set the record re-entry speed of 7.95 miles per second in January 2006 .
" The return of Hayabusa provides NASA and JAXA with a rare opportunity to monitor the performance of an atmospheric entry vehicle at speeds much higher than that of the space shuttle returning from low - Earth orbit , " said Jay Grinstead , the observation campaign project manager and a research scientist at NASA Ames .
" The spectrum of the light emitted by the gas and surface at these extreme temperatures tells us about the physics and chemistry of atmospheric entry .
Our vantage point onboard the DC - 8 and the variety of instruments enable us to track the evolution of the spectrum and compare it to simulations used for design and analysis of entry systems .
"
The airborne observation team also will provide JAXA with data and images obtained during the flight to correlate with JAXA 's ground optical and radio observations and assist in locating the capsule on Earth .
Since the breakup of the main spacecraft will be visible as well , scientists will use images of the debris to validate computer models astronomers use to predict how an object will fragment and disperse as it enters Earth ’s atmosphere at these high speeds .
NASA astronomers made similar airborne studies from NASA 's DC - 8 flying observatory for the September 2008 re-entry of the European Space Agency 's Automated Transfer Vehicle " Jules Verne , " as well as the Stardust sample return re-entry airborne campaigns .
During those missions , NASA scientists studied the light emitted by the descending spacecraft , to better understand the mechanisms of atmospheric entry heats of natural and man-made objects .
The Hayabusa airborne observation campaign is supported by the In - Space Propulsion Technology Project in the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters , Washington .

Many seek out the 1950s type lifestyle where the woman was a stay at home person who tended to all the household chores .
The generational makeup at that time was a male dominated culture with women having little say in what transpired .
Many look at this as a form of slavery and this appeals to many in the M/s world .
My grandfather was a President for a toy company for many years .
During his tenure at that position , he was responsible for traveling throughout the eastern part of the country on business .
This was in a time when one did not hop the shuttle from NY to Philadelphia .
Instead , the common form of travel was the train .
As you can imagine , my grandfather was away from home for weeks at a time .
Many families endured a similar life in this era .
This meant my grandmother was the one in charge at home .
There were five children which include what today is termed a special needs child and one who qualified as a juvenile delinquent in any generation .
Certainly , my grandmother had her hands full .
The strength it took to raise 5 children under these circumstances was not easy .
Until her death , my grandmother was a very strong woman .
Before going any further , we need to remember the generation that we are dealing with .
Men were the heads of the household and women were consider inferior .
Women stayed home to raise children while men were the sole breadwinners .
All financial and " businesslike " decisions were made by the males .
And , like Leave it to Beaver , children were sent to their rooms until " your father gets home " .
The men were the ultimate disciplinarians within this family model .
To say that women in this generation were weak is a misstatement .
My grandmother is a prime example .
She had the strength to deal with the household in the absence of her husband .
While gone , she made all the decisions .
Of course , she stepped aside when my grandfather returned from his trips .
For many , this mindset sounds like a wonderful way to live the M/s lifestyle .
However , before relating it to this way of life , I need to clarify one other thing about my grandparents .
As mentioned , my grandmother willingly stepped aside when my grandfather returned .
She was also one to allow him to run at the mouth and never embarrassed him in front of others .
Basically , my grandmother was the ideal wife in an era were subservience was valued .
Nevertheless , I will not state that my grandfather was in charge .
There were a few times when I witnessed him run off a bit too much at the mouth and she cut him off .
She wasnt rude or demonstrative .
Instead , she simply stated " that is enough " and my grandfather knew to shut his trap .
In the end , the subservient one actually retained the power .
Of course , this is where a M/s relationship differs greatly .
Everything about the 1950s lifestyle could be applied .
It is possible for one to be controlled in all aspects where her only focus is on household duties .
Anything outside that realm is the responsibility of the Master .
However , I must point out that in a M/s relationship , all power resides in his hands .
Unlike my grandmother , a slave does not have the right to say " that is enough " .
Her subservience is complete .
The " homemaker " form of slavery seems to be popular these days - at least in the minds of many who are seeking a Master .
However , I find that it is a fairly unrealistic expectation for one simple reason : most lack the resources to live this particular way .
It is no secret that most Western families require two incomes to make ends meet .
This is a truth that extends back over 20 years .
It is a quarter century since we saw the ability for families to survive on one income .
What does this mean ?
This tells me that most will provide service to a Master in the form of earning a paycheck .
Now , many want to dispute the validity of this type of arrangement .
Get real .
If a Master tells a slave to get a job , that is fulfilling his wishes .
My slave maintains a full - time job which she earns a paycheck that is handed over to me .
Her efforts are going to benefit me .
It allows me to maintain a particular lifestyle for my household which I prefer .
Her service is not lessened in any way because of it .
Those who are seeking to be a 1950s " housewife " ought to look at the reality of the world today .
My grandfather was able to support his family on only one income .
So was Ward Cleaver .
And Ricky Ricardo .
Yet , we find the economic reality of the world altered to the point were people depend upon the two checks .
Unless our seeking slave is lucky enough to find a Master with a good financial balance sheet , I feel she ought to be prepared to work .
Which brings me to the next point : even if he is financially well off , a Master might still require a slave to work .
Extra income always comes in handy no matter what the financial makeup is .
In my situation , my standard of living was established before my present slave arrived .
However , her income makes my life that much easier .
Now I have the ability to invest in things that were not possible before .
I still cover the bills - her earnings are extra .
In the long run , this will net a tremendous payoff for me .
The idea of living as some of the matrons of the 1950s is a wonderful dream but I caution about the reality of it .
It is perfectly acceptable for one to seek this situation out .
However , as we know , in a TPE relationship , there are no guarantees .
A Master might decide that he wants the arrangement a different way .
For that reason , a slave cannot marry herself to a single idea .
There are many times when a Master will alter one aspect of the relationship .
Being flexible is one of the traits that a slave needs to have if she is to survive in M / s.
In many instances , I feel people are engaging in romantic pipedreams when searching this relationship makeup .
Once again , many are distancing themselves from reality .
While it might come true for a few , I believe the vast majority are going to be disappointed .
Like many things online , it is easy to promise something but a lot tougher to deliver .
The reality for many will be vastly different then they imagine .
Fox Business has made something of a splash claiming that Senator Casey has introduced a bill to bail out union pensions that will cost $ 165 billion .
Media Matters lashes back , arguing that the bill will only cost $ 8 - 10 billion and is n't a bailout .
Who 's right ?
As so often with these things , the truth is somewhere in between .
The bill in question will essentially let multi-employer union pension plans , like the Teamster 's plan that is currently causing UPS so much trouble , segregate out the workers of defunct companies and get the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp to pony up for their benefits .
Media Matters says that the bailout wo n't cost $ 165 billion , and they 're right ; that 's the total liabilities of the plan .
Theoretically , it could cost $ 165 billion if every single employer went bankrupt , but that 's not a very likely scenario .
However , Media Matters also says it 's not a bailout , which is silly .
When you give someone money because they 've gotten their finances into an untenable state , that 's a bailout .
$ 8 - 10 billion is double the current level of underfunding in the PBGC , and that 's just the undoubtedly rosy number cited by Senator Casey .
If the funding levels of the MEPs get worse ( as is possible , even likely ) it will cost more .
More to the point , the multi-employer plans have not paid any premiums for the benefits Senator Casey now wants to give them .
The PBGC provides insurance ( for which it does not charge adequate premiums , but that is another rant . )
It is not a charitable institution .
The whole point of a multi-employer plan is to pool the risk , and ensure that workers do not lose benefits merely because they have transferred around .
It is true that there are now big shortfalls in these plans , and the bankrupt employers are ( definitionally ) not around to help the going concerns make up their losses .
That makes it difficult to convince firms that they should , say , employ teamsters .
But while there 's a certain amount of unfairness to this , I do n't see why it 's more fair to get the taxpayers to suck up the bill .
The employers knew what they were getting into .
So did the unions .
The PBGC exists to shelter workers from total destitution in the event that their pension fund does not have resources to meet its obligations , and there is no going concern behind the fund able to make up the shortfall .
It does not exist to make UPS more profitable , or more competitive with UPS FedEx .

The crew of a French yacht have rescued a sea eagle they spotted injured and exhausted on the shore of a loch in the Western Isles .
They restrained the large bird using masking tape and alerted the Maritime and Coastguard Agency ( MCA ) .
Following its rescue on Friday on Loch Bhrolluim , off Harris , the raptor has been taken into the care of the RSPB .
It was being fed lambs ' livers from a butcher in Stornoway to build up its strength ahead of being released .
A tag on the bird has shown it is a three - year - old female born on the Uists .
RSPB Scotland officer Martin Scott said the bird may have been injured in a territorial dispute with another eagle .
The road to “ Avenue Q ” has had more than a few bumps and turns .
But the audience is always there giving clear directions about which way we need to go .

MY WORLD IS A LITTLE DARKER …
Martin Gardner has died .
I have dreaded to type those words , and Martin would not have wanted to know that I ’m so devastated at what I knew – day to day – had to happen very soon .
I ’m glad to report that his passing was painless and quick .
That man was one of my giants , a very long - time friend of some 50 years or so .
He was a delight , a very bright spot in my firmament , one to whom I could always turn to with a question or an idea , with any strange notion I could invent , and with any complaint or comment I could come up with .
I never had an angry word with Martin .
Never .
It was all laughs and smiles , all the best of everything .
Forgive me for writing this without any editing .
It ’s just as it occurs to me .
I can’t quite picture my world without him , and just yesterday I printed up a new set of mailing labels for him , plus stationery , which did n’t get mailed .
For the last few years I supplied him with that small favor , assuring him that he should notify me when he ran out , but he never did , because he thought it was too much trouble for me .
Only when I received a letter from him last week that was hand - addressed , did I know that it was time for another shipment to Oklahoma .
He was such a good man , a productive and useful member of our society , and I can anticipate the international reaction to his passing .
His books – so many of them – remain to remind us of his contributions to us all .
His last one was dedicated to me , and I am just so proud of that fact , so very proud …
It will take a while , but Martin would want me to get on with my life , so I will .
It ’s tough …

CNN gets a rare inside look at nuclear weapons testing on " The Situation Room " with Wolf Blitzer from 5 to 7 tonight .
Livermore , California ( CNN ) --
The new START arms control agreement with Russia calls for the United States to significantly reduce its nuclear stockpile , but critics are rightly asking whether this will leave the U.S. safe .
They say the U.S. must maintain a healthy nuclear deterrent , even as it works toward President Obama 's goal of a world free of nuclear weapons .
That leaves questions about the quality of the nuclear weapons the U.S. will keep in its arsenal , which are aging .
Are they safe ?
Are they reliable ?
And , given that the United States stopped testing nuclear weapons by blowing them up -- both above and below ground -- 18 years ago , how will we know ?
Those are some of the questions that CNN's Foreign Affairs Correspondent Jill Dougherty and I sought to answer when we flew to Northern California for an exclusive tour of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory .
At Livermore , it is all about virtual testing .
Scientists actually generate the conditions of a nuclear weapon to analyze the nuclear stockpiles to make sure they are functioning correctly .
The word " cool " does not begin to describe it .
First , Brian Cracciola showed us around Livermore 's High Explosives Applications Facility , where he is the operations manager .
At HEAF , scientists conduct up to 1,000 explosions a year and heat up explosives to react to thermal changes .
He walked us into a tank that can blow up 22 pounds of explosives .
" When and if the president ever has to push that button , we need to know that the weapons will work , " Cracciola said .
" And as we scale down the nuclear weapons , we are working to make them much safer and much more reliable . "
Bruce Goodwin , who runs the weapons program at Livermore , explained that high - explosive molecule testing is even more extensive than the traditional testing done before 1992 , when a nuclear test involved blowing up a nuclear weapon .
" There are hundreds of ways a nuclear device can fail , " Goodwin told us " We catalogue those and we test against them in a non-nuclear fashion .
And , more importantly , we can do complete three - dimensional simulations of things that you could n't possibly test in the old days . "
At Livermore , you can cut the explosives in half by laser without melting or sparking .
We learned that this means you do n't disturb the atoms inside the high explosive .
Goodwin said the test vibrates the atoms at a rate of a millionth - billionth of a second , so fast that heat and shock waves can't be conducted .
This removes the atoms one at a time from the high explosive and provides a more accurate reading of the condition of the explosive .
" We found failure modes in the stockpile that we could never have found with nuclear testing because we 're able to do these massive simulations , " he said .
" These are the largest calculations that man has ever done . "
All of these simulations are cataloged on Livermore 's supercomputers , which are some of the fastest in the world .
Michel McCoy , the lab 's associate director for computation , showed us around the supercomputer rooms , which he calls the lab 's " crown jewel . "
There , thousands of computers pull together all of the physics necessary to model a nuclear weapon 's reliability and safety .
Did I mention these computers are fast ?
We are talking about a hundred trillion operations per second .
It is about to get even faster , with a new computer system called the petaflop , which would be able to do about a quintillion operations per second .
McCoy said even that is n't fast enough for what the U.S. needs to do to fix the nuclear weapons as they age .
We ended our day at Livermore 's National Ignition Facility , where the world 's largest laser generates the temperatures and pressures found only in stars , the sun and in nuclear weapons .
The equipment looks like a spaceship about to take off .
This summer , NIF will begin experiments that will focus the energy of 192 giant laser beams on a tiny target filled with hydrogen fuel .
The goal is to obtain fusion energy , which is what powers the sun and stars .
Inside the target chamber , the target that each of the lasers needs to hit is smaller than the diameter of a human hair .
The director of the NIF , Edward Moses , showed us a full - scale target , which can fit in his hand .
Inside a little gold can is a red dot the size of a pencil eraser .
There , Moses said , " the isotopes of hydrogen sit ... and get ready to be blown to bits . "
" We can model parts of physical processes that go on inside a weapon without testing , " Moses said .
" This is the only place in the world where you can get to the nuclear phase of the weapon without blowing up a bomb . "
In fact , we found that at Livermore , scientists could learn more about what 's going on inside a nuclear weapon without actually testing it than they can with a nuclear test .
Every night , the control room , modeled on NASA 's command center , runs a laser experiment using 2,000 computers and 60,000 control points .
" We 're finally at the point with this laser facility and our computers and with other facilities for the first time to do this kind of thing , " Moses said .
" And I think this is why President Obama probably has more confidence -- one of the many reasons he has -- to go forward with this new policy . "
Best Unboxing Ever
There 's a certain set of us out there that sort of have , um , problems when we get new things .
We like to open them .
Not just the box , but whatever 's in the box , and whatever 's in that .
Unboxings and uncasings are nothing new these days .
Sometimes you just want to take things apart and see what makes them tick .
And sometimes , it 's a box with a $ 7000 sex doll .
And , sometimes , you just take something , something that was already fun , and you make it even more fun .
Like scalping your real doll and putting in an Interactive Fleshlight .
And then you take the after care pictures .
I love running this site .
Thanks to deusbot for sending in the modification photos and making my god damn year .
It 's been two months since BP's Deepwater Horizon oil rig started spewing toxicity into the Gulf of Mexico .
And we 're just now learning how the rig's last line of defense failed to prevent one modern history 's biggest ecological disasters .
Advertisement
The video above , from the NY Times , outlines how Deepwater Horizon 's blowout preventer — and more specifically , the " blind shear ram " designed to shut down the well in event of a blowout — was supposed to work , and why it did n't .
Advertisement
BP workers did try to deploy the blind shear ram by hitting the emergency button , but the system , designed with too few backup measures , did not perform as designed .
Today , at least , it 's impossible to know exactly why that is , but there 's plenty of evidence showing that blowout preventers are n't the foolproof failsafe they 're advertised to be .
It 's a fascinating read , and part of the NYT 's comprehensive overview of all aspects of the oil disaster , from a spill tracker to a detailed timeline of failed fixes .
And , of course , an array of live video feeds to remind you how bad it continues to be .
Terrific coverage , to be sure sure .
But let 's hope it's not too long before they do n't have to update it anymore .

For centuries , ginger has been used as a home remedy , and by homeopathic doctors to help ease numerous health complaints .
Ginger is very easy on the body , and does not cause unpleasant side effects like typical western prescription drugs .
Although ginger should never replace an important medication your doctor has recommended , it can be extremely useful in treating some common every day problems .
1. Nausea
The most well known ailment that ginger is helpful for is nausea .
Ginger has shown to be highly effective in easing nausea and motion sickness .
Remember when you were young and your mom had you drink ginger ale for an upset tummy ?
That is because ginger is widely known to ease a sick stomach .
Ginger is even good for nausea that is caused by morning sickness in pregnant women .
2. Migraines
Ginger helps to ease migraines by inhibiting platelet aggregation .
A study published in the Journal of Ethnopharmacology cited a case where a woman took 500 mg of ginger at the onset of a migraine .
The study reported the migraine began to subside shortly after the ginger was ingested .
When taken regularly , the study also claimed ginger could reduce the frequency and intensity of the migraines .
3. Menstrual Cramps
Chinese medicine has used ginger tea with brown sugar to ease menstrual cramps for centuries .
Ginger is a natural painkiller , helps to improve circulation , and relax the muscles .
This calming tea is made by peeling a fresh ginger root , slicing into small pieces , and letting it simmer in hot water for about 20 minutes .
After the tea is strained , you can add one teaspoon of brown sugar to make a delicious and relaxing warm tea .
4. Heartburn
Another benefit of ginger on the digestive system is the ability to rapidly ease heartburn pain .
The anti-inflammatory properties of ginger help it to quickly tackle heartburn .
Many people will add ginger to their food , or eat a small amount of ginger before each meal to prevent the onset of heartburn .
If heartburn has already set in , however , making a warm cup of ginger tea can help to ease the heartburn pain in as little as 20 minutes .
5. Colds and Flu
Studies have shown that ginger extract cultured with a live flu virus helps inhibit viral growth .
This not only means that ginger can help fight a cold and flu you already have , but when taken regularly , can also help prevent your body from catching the germs to begin with .
6. Ovarian Cancer
The University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center has released findings that conclude ginger induces cell death when applied to cancerous cells .
The researchers say ginger helps to control inflammation , which is a key factor in cancer growth .
No matter which of these health problems trouble you , adding ginger to your diet in the form of a spice , tea , or capsule , is a safe and effective way to gain extra relief .

BitTorrent Inc. has made the remote access ' web ' feature of its Falcon client iPhone compatible .
uTorrent users can now remotely control their downloads from wherever they are with their iPhone .
Torrents can be added , paused and removed using an interface with a look and feel identical to that of the uTorrent application .
The Falcon release is one of the main pillars for uTorrent ’s future .
Among other things , it allows users to access their downloads from anywhere through a secure web interface .
A few weeks ago the uTorrent ‘ web ’ feature opened up to the public and today the team announced that support for the iPhone has been added .
“ In our ever - connected world , users want the ability to control their torrents on the go anytime , anywhere .
So , in a continued effort to make our products more accessible we are introducing µ Torrent Web for iPhone , ” says Simon Morris , BitTorrent ’s VP of Product Management .
“ While µ Torrent Web is currently only available as part of our experimental Project Falcon software , we continue to fill out the feature set prior to a large - scale rollout , ”
Morris added in a recent blog post .
Although we have n’t been able to confirm it , we assume that uTorrent web is supported on the iPad as well .
The Falcon release of uTorrent is key component of the client ’s future .
It is very similar to the standard uTorrent application but has several added features including support for the web interface and video streaming .
Together with Griffin and Pheon , the Falcon project is part of the recently announced uTorrent Labs which give users early access to beta projects .
In order to use the web interface at web.utorrent.com users will have to download and install the latest Falcon release .
After an encryption swipe and logging in , users will see the iPhone compatible interface that gives them all the controls they are familiar with in their regular PC client .
uTorrent Web for iPhone
For those wondering why there are no BitTorrent - related apps in the App Store , it is because Apple notoriously bans all applications that have anything to do with BitTorrent .
“ Because this category of applications is often used for the purpose of infringing third party rights .
We have chosen to not publish this type of application to the App Store , ” is Apple ’s official explanation .
Despite its desire to control every aspect of its business , Apple is not censoring the websites that people access on their phones just yet , so the uTorrent web - interface can be reached through the Safari browser .
Fingers crossed .
For all the talk of disruptive technology in the publishing and media worlds , it is n’t easy to be an optimist these days .
But it ’s hard not to notice that Clay Shirky , one of the digital age ’s most original , engaged thinkers , is remarkably sanguine about the prospects of new media — especially for a man so immersed in discussing its problems .
In 2008 Shirky ’s book , Here Comes Everybody : The Power of Organizing without Organizations , was one of the first to predict the power of social media , lauding the power and potential of a collaborative digital space , from crowdsourcing to the kind of sharing now popularized by Twitter , Facebook and Flickr .
This month , he ’s back with a new book , Cognitive Surplus : Creativity and Generosity in a Connected Age ( Penguin Press ) , an equally prescient book that extols the possibilities of the Internet age and outlines the social obligations that come with it , beyond tweeting , or posting pithy status updates .
“ How we put our collective talents to work is a social issue , ” Shirky writes , “ not solely a personal one . ”
A teacher in the Interactive Telecommunications Program at New York University — a bustling hive of art projects , digital media , and collaborating students — and soon to be teaching in the NYU journalism school as well , Shirky is a sought - after writer and speaker on all things digital and a popular consultant , particularly when it comes to media .
“ My interest in the last couple of years has turned especially to the production of nonfiction media , ” Shirky told the New York Observer in a recent profile .
“ Whether it ’s long - form journalism or investigative journalism , ” he said , “ it ’s no fun to just be the guy diagnosing the problem . ”
Principled
So prominent is Shirky in the zeitgeist of the digital world , he even has his own principle .
In April of this year , Wired ’s Kevin Kelly turned a Shirky quote — “ Institutions will try to preserve the problem to which they are the solution ” — into “ the Shirky Principle , ” in deference to the simple , yet powerful observation .
“ It reminded me of the clarity of the Peter Principle , which says that a person in an organization will be promoted to the level of their incompetence , at which point their past achievements will prevent them from being fired , but their incompetence at this new level will prevent them from being promoted again , ” Kelly explained .
“ The Shirky Principle declares that complex solutions , like a company , or an industry , can become so dedicated to the problem they are the solution to , that often they inadvertently perpetuate the problem . ”
For the publishing world , the Shirky Principle certainly warrants examination .
But while he resists being labeled a utopian , Shirky is unquestionably optimistic about the power of the Internet to make things better .
That ’s because the Internet , he says , will liberate us from a decades - long addiction to sitcoms and other forms of passive entertainment .
More and more people are now “ donating ” their free time to create and engage with each other on an unprecedented scale — resulting in the “ cognitive surplus ” about which he writes .
Efforts include the fun and frivolous — such as the Internet phenomenon LOLcats — as well as life - saving innovations , such as UShahidi.com , a Web solution that allows Kenyans to report crime .
To what end we apply the Internet medium is now Shirky ’s main preoccupation — as it is for publishing — especially now that our leisure time is , as Shirky puts it , a “ global resource . ”
With just 1 % of the hours we spend watching TV , he notes , people created Wikipedia , a bank of collective and constantly updated and corrected knowledge .
When you put it like that , maybe there is reason for optimism .
PW caught up with Shirky at his NYU office to talk about his new book , the state of the digital debate , and of course , the changing world of publishing .
PW : Since your last book , Here Comes Everybody , the discourse around the Web — its uses and abuses — seems to have mushroomed .
Clay
Shirky : I ’ve spent almost 20 years saying , “ This is going to be a really big deal , ” and almost all of the debate for the last 20 years has been a bunch of people lining up to say , “ No it ’s not . ”
Paul Krugman once said the effect of the Internet was going to be no bigger than that of the fax machine .
The debate was once between people who thought the Internet was going to be a really big deal and people who thought it was n’t , and for me that was a bit like being on the Harlem Globetrotters .
You had opposition , but not really .
The other side was showing up , but they were n’t even playing the same game .
But over the last five years — and in 2010 with a vengeance — the debate is between people who understand the Internet in fairly deep ways , some who say this is going to be good for society and some who say it ’s going to be bad .
On the other side from me now are Andrew Keen , Nick Carr , Jaron Lanier , Chris Hughes .
When I wrote my first book , Here Comes Everybody , publishers basically said , “ If it says the word Internet in it , we ’re not publishing it ; no one buys those books . ”
So , I had the luck of having the only book on the shelves when the Obama campaign took off , and all of a sudden people changed their minds about how important social media is .
This book , Cognitive Surplus , comes out at a time when there are informed participants on all sides .
And the conversation is on .
PW : What ideas are completely unique to Cognitive Surplus ?
CS : The surprise to me in writing the book was this business of the difference between communal and civic values .
I write about LOLcats , fan fiction , PatientsLikeMe.com [ a Web site for patients to share treatment information ] , and Nisha Susan [ organizer of an on - the - ground and online campaign protesting a right - wing political group ’s repressive treatment of women in Mangalore , India ] .
All of these are effusions of people pooling their spare time and talent , but some of them are good for the participants , and some are good for society as a whole .
What ’s critical about Nisha Susan , or PatientsLikeMe , for example , is that there is real opposition to them doing what they ’re doing — it takes guts to be Nisha Susan , and if we do n’t create a culture that celebrates the creation of that kind of civic value , all we get is communal value , like groups of people that band together for self - amusement : “ you like Harry Potter , I like Harry Potter . ”
When people have the guts to act on their convictions in ways that are tough for them , like the people on PatientsLikeMe , saying , “ I ’m manic - depressive .
These are the drugs I ’m taking ; these are the ones that are working , ” they defy the current medical culture that says , “ Whatever you do , do n’t tell anyone . ”
This is the conversation I ’m most interested in having .
That ’s the thing I care most about .
If we do n’t celebrate civic value , we underuse the medium .
PW : Many interviews you ’ve done seem to have a fairly predictable pattern : interviewers ask you to defend the Internet against its putative dangers .
How does it feel to be that voice in the conversation ?
CS : People invite me to be one side of a synthetic argument on the assumption that I ’m casually optimistic about all this stuff .
So I ’m expected to answer for the worst excesses of the most utopian Internet thinkers because if I think it ’s at all good , I must think everything is immediately good all the time .
Not even optimists have that kind of optimism .
It is possible to think that the Internet will be a net positive for society while admitting that there are significant downsides — after all , it ’s not a revolution if nobody loses .
I ’m optimistic mainly because I teach in a graduate program and spend more time with 25 - year - olds than 55 - year - olds .
My environment is set by smart young people using this medium in ways that make me glad every day .
But even the optimists among us have to get good at being anti-utopian .
The casual , utopian view of the Internet has the obvious disadvantage of being wrong and the more pernicious disadvantage of making it seem like someone else is going to take care of things .
I gave a guest talk recently to a Harvard University journalism and public policy class , and someone said , “ Newspapers will go away , but the ecosystem will take care of things . ”
Ecosystems do n’t do things ; people do things !
To be in a room with people who care about what happens to the press and to offload to the ecosystem the idea that things will somehow be OK is to opt out of our cultural obligation to figure out what the “ invisible college ” model is right now , that is , to sign ourselves up for a more rigorous view of what the medium is capable of , beyond LOLcats .
I like LOLcats as much as the next guy but they ’re in no danger of going away .
No one will ever wonder , is there anything amusing for me on the Internet ?
That is a solved problem .
What we should really care about are [ the Internet ’s ] cultural uses .
That ’s the part of the debate I ’m trying to surface .
PW : But there are those who find these cultural uses inherently flawed .
Jaron Lanier , for example , writes that “ amateurs are treating the fruits of their intellect as fragments to be given without pay to the hive mind . ”
CS : I have two responses to that .
First , we do n’t think of bar owners as illicitly profiting off our conviviality .
They provide a service by jacking up the price of liquor enough to afford us chairs , where we can sit with our friend to have a nice conversation .
[ Lanier ’s ] mental model washes away all participatory logic and says what people who produce content are doing is piecework , and if they ’re not being paid by the piece it ’s somehow unfair .
The other argument is the economic argument , “ the lump of labor fallacy . ”
Every time something comes along and takes away something that was previously a job and remands it instead to the population , there are people wringing their hands .
In Here Comes Everybody I told the story of the Abbot of Sponheim who in 1492 wrote a book saying that if this printing press thing is allowed to expand , what will the scribes do for a living ?
But it was more important that Europe be literate than for scribes to have a job .
In a world where a book had to be a physical object , charging money was a way to cause more copies to come into circulation .
In the digital world , charging money for something is a way to produce fewer copies .
There is no way to preserve the status quo and not abandon that value .
PW : I recently attended a London Review of Books talk called “ The Author in the Age of Internet , ” and one of the writers there said about the Internet , “ It ’s not as if something vast and new is occurring .
Jonathan Swift blogged ; he would do it to rid himself of an indignation . ”
What do you make of the tendency to minimize the scale of change now hitting literature and publishing ?
CS : One of the big problems with the discourse right now is that people are invited to think that nothing has changed .
The deeper problem is this invidious habit , from — alas — Plato , which is to make a distinction between the difference in degree and the difference in kind , as if to say , “ Oh , if anything like this happened before , then this is just more of the same . ”
To say that Jonathan Swift wrote for himself , or wrote letters to his friends , and therefore “ blogs are not new , ” is to say there is no value in being instantaneous , global , two - way , permanent , searchable , the list goes on .
Have you read Tiger Beatdown ?
It ’s my new favorite blog .
Back in 1991 , Naomi Wolf wrote in The Beauty Myth that the great tragedy of women ’s magazines is n’t that they do n’t provide a free place for women to have a female conversation ; the great tragedy is that they could have , but advertising took it away .
Blogs give it back .
Anyone who tells you that Jonathan Swift did this is ignoring at least half of the human race that never had presumptive access to publishing in an unfiltered way .
What Sady Doyle is doing with Tiger Beatdown would be inconceivable in a professional publishing context , and while I hope she does get recognized and gets picked up to do a book , she does n’t need a book to have a voice .
In literature there ’s never been the kind of place for women ’s voices that there is now .
It ’s spectacular .
PW : I ’ve often thought that when it comes to the Web and certain kinds of innovation , publishing is the anti-porn — given that pornographers , in order to reach consumers , innovated so many things we take for granted on the Web , from streaming video to credit card verification .
CS : Just today I was talking to a bunch of newspaper people about the future of the newspaper business — not the newspaper ecosystem — and I wanted to talk about sharing , because with new models like Wikileaks , or ProPublica , you have a kind of pooling of resources .
But all everyone wanted to know was how existing newspapers will make money .
If I ’d been told this was the question I ’d been invited to talk about , I would n’t have come , because I do n’t know and I do n’t care .
I care about news in a democratic society .
But if a newspaper has to do something different next week — it ’s not my problem .
The greatest thing going for the publishing industry is that they ’ve seen what has happened to the music industry ; they ’ve seen it happen to the magazine people .
They ’re watching it happen to the movie people right now ; they ’ve seen it happen to the software people .
They ’ve seen Blockbusters close , they ’ve seen Virgin Records close .
They ’ve seen GameStops close .
And they ’re saying — not us , because we have these [ taps book ] .
PW : Where does that come from — complacency , anxiety ?
CS : Some of it is anxiety .
Some of it ’s the brilliant Upton Sinclair observation : “ It ’s hard to make a man understand something if his livelihood depends on him not understanding it . ”
From the laying on of hands of [ Italian printer ]
Aldus Manutius on down , publishing has always been this way .
This is a medium where a change to glue - based paperback binding constituted a revolution .
But the interesting clash for me is n’t between Apple , Amazon , and Macmillan .
The interesting clash to me is between you and say , Sonny Mehta .
I can only name two publishers — Sonny Mehta and my own .
You ’re both in the same industry , but from his point of view if he can just hold it together 10 more years , he ’s fine .
He can retire .
But you know that if you stay in the book industry 30 more years , there ’s no way that things will be anything like today .
Sonny Mehta ’s incentive is to postpone — even if it makes things worse — the moment of shock to right after he retires .
But you do n’t have that option .
I ’m interested in young writers and editors entering a system that is plainly structured around the vestiges of a world fast draining away .
In Ken Auletta ’s recent article in the New Yorker he suggested that eventually digital could be up to — oh ! 50 percent !
That ’s right before it becomes 51 , 52 and so on .
At what point do we think it stops ?
PW : At what point will fear and anxiety no longer be appropriate responses ?
CS : The point at which you think you can no longer get away with your pension under the current system .
That ’s the point .
I saw it happen in the music business .
To be in my industry , you have to be in San Francisco , New York , and London at least once a year just to absorb the air .
But all of a sudden in 2003 - 4 , L.A. start - up culture got really interesting .
It was the moment where 30 - year - olds said , “ Wait a minute .
The people steering the ship only want to get it this much further and then they ’re willing to see it sink .
I ’m bailing out now . ”
All these little companies said , “ If we accept that the Internet is going to hang around for a little while , would we do the music business differently ? ”
PW : When do you think a similar realization will come to book publishing ?
CS : I think someone will make the imprint that bypasses the traditional distribution networks .
Right now the big bottleneck is the head buyer at Barnes & Noble .
That ’s the seawall holding back the flood in publishing .
Someone ’s going to say , “ I can do a business book or a vampire book or a romance novel , whatever , that might sell 60 % of the units it would sell if I had full distribution and a multimillion dollar marketing campaign — but I can do it for 1 % percent of the cost . ”
It has already happened a couple of times with specialty books .
The moment of tip happens when enough things get joined up to create their own feedback loop , and the feedback loop in publishing changes when someone at Barnes & Noble says : “ We ca n’t afford not to stock this particular book or series from an independent publisher . ”
It could be on Lulu , or iUniverse , whatever .
And , I feel pretty confident saying it ’s going to happen in the next five years .
TORONTO ( Reuters ) - Kicking off protests that will draw thousands to Toronto during two top - level summits next week , oil - smeared demonstrators urged Canada on Thursday to stop subsidizing fossil fuels and act against world poverty .

The group paraded through Toronto ’s financial core with an outsized papier - mache head of Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper , handing out fake C$ 1 billion bills that spoofed the price tag just for security at the summits .
“ ( Harper ’s ) backing the wrong solutions , ” said Graham Saul of the Climate Action Network Canada , part of the umbrella organization that organized the march .
“ We ’re here to say we need to stop subsidizing the problems , phase out subsidies for fossil fuels , and we need to invest in clean energy technology . ”
Fears of violence prompted a U.S. State Department recommendation that Americans avoid downtown Toronto next week because the large - scale demonstrations around the June 26 - 27 summit of the G20 rich and emerging nations could turn nasty .
“ Even demonstrations that are meant to be peaceful can become violent and unpredictable , ” the State Department said in a travel alert that expires on June 28 .
“ You should avoid them if at all possible . ”
Nongovernmental groups have promised peaceful protests , but previous summits have attracted violent groups intent on disrupting the meetings or fighting with police .
Organizers admit anarchist groups may join these demonstrations too .
The summits kick off on June 24 when the Group of Eight industrialized countries meet in Huntsville , Ontario , a resort town about two hours north of Toronto .
The G20 meets in Toronto from June 26 - 27 .
The security bill for the summit is already over C$ 1 billion ( $ 970 million ) , an amount that was a key focus of Thursday ’s protest .
“ It ’s outrageous that they spend so much holding this summit , ” said Mark Fried of Oxfam , adding that his group is not trying to disrupt the events so much as draw attention to issues it feels should be addressed .
“ It is important that they get together , because when they ’re there ... with the world ’s eyes upon them , they want to look good and they announce things that can be very positive . ”
This Super Cafe Racer is one of the most unique and spectacular builds we have seen in a while .
It is named ‘ Taimoshan ’ which is the highest mountain in Hong Kong and building this bike was no small feat .
You see , it ’s been built around the classic Norton featherbed frame using a 2004 Aprilia RSV 1000 engine .
Given the fact that the featherbed frame is over 50 years old there was a lot of thought put into strengthening the frame and working out how to hide all the technology within it .
We think the owner / builder ( a fellow Aussie ) who goes by the name ‘ Norzilla ’ on the Aprillia Forum has done an exceptional job combining old school cafe racer style with all the modern features of todays bikes .
We love the handmade aluminium Manx tank and the custom cafe seat ( although unfinished in photo ) .
If you want to see some more pics of this beast hit this jump to the Aprilia Forum .
To hear and see this bike in action you can view this short video on youtube .
Those custom stainless pipes make an impressive bark , apparently 4 times the UK legal noise limit .
[ Thanks to Troy for the pics and tip ]
Pakistan bans Facebook in outrage over online competition to draw Prophet Mohammed
A Pakistani court has ordered the government to block the popular social networking website Facebook over an online competition inviting users to submit images of the Prophet Mohammed .
The page has caused an outcry in Pakistan and throughout the Muslim world .
Images of the Prophet are considered blasphemous .
A series of cartoons of the prophet published in a Danish newspaper in 2005 sparked violent protests and death threats against the cartoonists .
Outrage : Pakistani religious students shout slogans during a protest in Karachi against the Facebook page asking using to submit images of the Prophet Mohammed today
Revolt : Supporters of Islamic political party Jamat - e - Islami join the Karachi protest today .
A Pakistani court has temporarily banned the entire Facebook website
The Facebook page ' Everybody Draw Mohammed Day ! ' encourages users to submit images of the prophet on May 20 .
It was set up to protest threats made by a radical Muslim group against the creators of ' South Park ' for depicting Muhammad in a bear suit during an episode earlier this year .
' We are not trying to slander the average Muslim , '' the Facebook creators wrote on the information section of the page , which was still accessible this morning .
' We simply want to show the extremists that threaten to harm people because of their Mohammad depictions that we 're not afraid of them .
That they can't take away our right to freedom of speech by trying to scare us into silence . '
More students join in today 's protest .
As of early this afternoon , Facebook was still available in Pakistan
In an attempt to respond to domestic criticism , the Pakistani government ordered Internet service providers in the country to block the page Tuesday .
But a group of Islamic lawyers went one further - and asked the Lahore High Court on Wednesday to order the government to fully block Facebook itself .
This was because the site had allowed the page to be posted in the first place , said the deputy attorney general of Punjab province , Naveed Inayat Malik .
The court complied with the request by the Islamic Lawyers Forum and ordered the government to temporarily block the site until May 31 , Malik said .
Lawyers outside the courtroom hailed the ruling , chanting ' down with Facebook ' .
As of early this afternoon , the controversial Facebook page had been blocked , but the site itself was still functioning .
Ali , the Pakistani telecommunications official , said he was awaiting final instructions from the government before ordering Internet service providers to fully block Facebook .
For its part , the Treasury appeared to be opposed to any options that did not involve making the banks whole on their A.I.G. contracts .
At Treasury , a former Goldman executive , Dan H. Jester , was the agency ’s point man on the A.I.G. bailout .
Mr. Jester had worked at Goldman with Henry M. Paulson Jr. , the Treasury secretary during the A.I.G. bailout .
Mr. Paulson previously served as Goldman ’s chief executive before joining the government .
Image A shareholder asked Robert Benmosche , A.I.G. ’s chief , if there was a plan to recoup money from Goldman .

A Close Association
Mr. Jester , according to several people with knowledge of his financial holdings , still owned Goldman stock while overseeing Treasury ’s response to the A.I.G. crisis .
According to the documents , Mr. Jester opposed bailout structures that required the banks to return cash to A.I.G.
Nothing in the documents indicates that Mr. Jester advocated forcing Goldman and the other banks to accept a discount on the deals .
Although the value of Goldman ’s shares could have been affected by the terms of the A.I.G. bailout , Mr. Jester was not required to publicly disclose his stock holdings because he was hired as an outside contractor , a job title at Treasury that allowed him to forgo disclosure rules applying to appointed officials .
In late October 2008 , he stopped overseeing A.I.G. after others were given that responsibility , according to Michele Davis , a spokeswoman for Mr. Jester .
Ms. Davis said that Mr. Jester fought hard to protect taxpayer money and followed an ethics plan to avoid conflict with all of his stock holdings .
Ms. Davis is also a spokeswoman for Mr. Paulson , and said that he declined to comment for this article .
The alternative bailout plans that regulators considered came from three advisory firms that the New York Fed hired : Morgan Stanley , Black Rock , and Ernst & Young .
One plan envisioned the government guaranteeing A.I.G. ’s obligations in various ways , in much the same way the F.D.I.C. backs personal savings accounts at banks facing runs by customers .
On Oct. 15 , Ms. Dahlgren wrote to Mr. Geithner that the Federal Reserve board in Washington had said the New York Fed should try to get Treasury to do a guarantee .
“ We think this is something we need to have in our back pockets , ” she wrote .
Treasury had the authority to issue a guarantee but was unwilling to do so because that would use up bailout funds .
Once the guarantee was off the table , Fed officials focused on possibly buying the distressed securities insured by A.I.G .
From the start , the Fed and its advisers prepared for the banks to accept discounts .
A BlackRock presentation outlined five reasons why the banks should agree to such concessions , all of which revolved around the many financial benefits they would receive .
BlackRock and Morgan Stanley presented a number of options , including what BlackRock called a “ deep concession ” in which banks would return $ 6.4 billion A.I.G. paid them before the bailout .

This article is more than 10 years old
Channel 4 is launching a new religious strand to be screened daily after Channel 4 News .
4thought.tv , a series of 90 - second films , featuring an individual speaker talking directly to camera , will debut on 5 July .
The first seven programmes will be a series of films about the July 2005 terrorist attacks on London to mark the fifth anniversary .
Comparisons with Thought for the Day , the long - running Radio 4 religious slot broadcast during the Today programme , are likely , although Channel 4's equivalent will draw on a wider range of themes and presenters .
Channel 4's head of specialist factual , Ralph Lee , said contributors to the slot will be " as diverse as the views expressed " .
They will include members of minority religions including Bahá'í and Zoroastrianism .
Lee added : " These films will give voice to a plethora of beliefs and opinions ...
Crucially , it will provide a space for views about religions and ethics that receive virtually no coverage on any other channel . "
A website , 4thought.tv will also be launched .
The strand will be made by independent producer Wadell Media .

In 1983 , my girlfriend and I left Cape Town to travel to London .
I had made the decision to leave South Africa a year previously , when I graduated from university and received yet another set of call - up papers to the army .
In 1983 there was a sense of things moving .
The subsequent clampdown had not yet happened .
The state of emergency had not been declared .
Troops were not yet , by and large , occupying the townships .
When the former prime minister John Vorster died , we had a Vossie 's gevrek !
( Vorster 's dead ! ) party on Llandudno Beach outside Cape Town .
Anything seemed possible .
It seemed perfectly possible , for example , to discard the life I had and to hitchhike to England , to be someone else .
I gave away everything I owned except for my rucksack , sleeping bag , tent and stove , and a wad of travellers ' cheques .
Ostensibly I was leaving for " political " reasons , to avoid being conscripted into the apartheid army .
But the truth was that I wanted to go - I had a sense of a bigger world out there .
And so we did .
New Year 's Day 1990 .
My girlfriend and I have taken the first steps towards creating a home in London by buying part of a house near Arsenal Football Club .
She is attempting to teach me the basics of crosswords .
" Take ' Pretty girl in crimson rose ' , " she says .
" Eight letters .
What does it mean ? "
" It means , " she continues , " that we have a pretty girl and she is wearing something red , or pink .
She is wearing something that suits her prettiness .
Prettiness , girls , roses - they all go together . "
I nod .
" Got it , " I say .
" It means , " says my girlfriend , " nothing of the sort . "
I nod again and smile encouragingly .
I am keeping up .
" That , " she says , " is what they want you to think it means .
What it actually means is either the first word or the last word .
What it actually means is ' rose ' . "
Outside in the street , Arsenal fans are shuffling by after a game .
It is already dark but I can tell from the suppressed hum of satisfaction that Arsenal won .
" So give me another word for crimson . "
" Red ? "
" Very good . "
She writes down R E - - - - - D on a piece of paper .
She looks at me expectantly .
" And pretty girl ? "
" You ? "
" I 'm not a girl . "
Outside the window a football crowd thins .
" Belle .
Belle is another word for ' pretty girl ' .
And then we put belle , which means pretty girl , inside red , which means crimson , and we get R E B E L L E D , Rebelled .
Et voilà . "
" Rebelled means rose ? "
" It does . "
In reading a crossword clue it is sometimes necessary to take a different approach .
I recently , for example , spent long hours looking at " Hormone red in Lana Turner ( 9 ) " .
I even went so far as to look up some of the things that Lana Turner is purported to have said , including , " A successful man is one who makes more money than a wife can spend .
A successful woman is one who can find such a man . "
" Yeah , right , " snorted my girlfriend , who was with me at the time , and is not a fan of the philosophical musings of Hollywood stars from the 1940s and 1950s .
It was only when I took another approach that I got it .
The other approach was to think of " Turner " as the anagram indicator : the anagram was of " red in Lana " , and the answer was that well - known hormone , adrenalin .
At this time anagrams seem to me the poor cousins of the crossword world , although in fact they need not be .
I am beginning to realise that the art of the anagram is not the process of finding the " other words " , but the process of telling the story that encapsulates the words .
" Girlfriend " , for example , is an anagram of " direr fling " , or " fling rider " , or " rifling red " , or a whole host of other seemingly unconnected words .
The art of the setter is to take those unconnected words and bind them with his wit .
My next lesson in crosswords takes place in Chad in the summer of 1991 .
The person who teaches me more about crosswords here works for a British NGO .
She has a copy of the Guardian , and is telling me that it is the crossword that defines the character of the newspaper .
This is a new idea to me .
" The Guardian crossword is not , " she says , " like the Telegraph .
This is not only a matter of taste .
It 's a question of style and of personality .
It is a matter of attitude , and of how you understand the world . "
Many years later a managing editor of the Times told me the old newspaper maxim : " They come for the news ; they stay for the features . "
And in particular they stay for the obituaries and the crossword .
I am not yet ready to form allegiances on the basis of obituaries , but I am interested to know more about crosswords .
My friend says , " It makes such a difference if you know who the setter is .
If you know that , you 're halfway there . "
The setter in this case is Rufus .
Sitting in Chad it does not seem possible to me to know someone called Rufus , but my teacher seems to think she does .
" He 's one of the easiest , " she says .
" That 's why I like him .
That 's not his real name , " she adds .
That night I look again at Rufus .
I am armed with two things : one is the knowledge that he is one of " the easiest " ; the other is that , if you know the setter , you are halfway there .
A clue catches my eye .
" Émigré beaten up by the authorities ( 6 ) " .
By now I know enough to recognise an anagram .
" Regime , " I say to myself , as I fall asleep .
This is where I date my beginning .
In the spring of 1994 , South Africa held its first democratic elections .
Many years later I learned that the Guardian setter , Araucaria , composed a puzzle to mark the occasion .
It was puzzle number 20014 , and according to the preamble it was , " A tribute on election day to the fighters for democracy , especially martyrs such as 6 , 16 and 3 . " 6 , 16 , and 3 were Ruth First , Steve Biko and Chris Hani , all great leaders murdered in the course of the struggle for national liberation .
Other heroes of this particular struggle who found their way into the puzzle were Alan Paton , and Helen Joseph and Joe Slovo ( who , touchingly I thought , shared a clue ) .
Then there was the triumvirate who more than any others transformed the African National Congress from the voice of plaintive nationalism to the mass movement it became , and the party of government it now is : Nelson Mandela , Walter Sisulu and the late Oliver Tambo .
There was also space for Cyril Ramaphosa , who led the negotiations that resulted in the new democracy .
The idea for the puzzle came to Araucaria late , and he had to telephone John Perkin , the editor , and ask him , as it were , to hold the back page for a " special " .
Perkin remembered the moment vividly , and was able to tell me both the puzzle number ( 20014 ) and that Araucaria had used Guardian grid number 40 .
Recently I asked Araucaria why he did it , and his answer was typically direct .
" These were people I thought Guardian readers should know , " he said .
He said this with strength and conviction , with the moral force of his life as a priest , and with a hint of anger , and it was only afterwards that it occurred to me that " should " in this context can have more than one meaning .
Crosswords tell stories .
But who is telling the story ?
Is it the solver , or is it the setter ?
A good clue will send the solver shooting off into a variety of orbits , but he will always come back to the same point .
In the end , all that is required is that he think of a synonym for the definition .
How hard can that be ?
For some years I imagined I might move to the US , where the crossword and the hard - boiled thriller were invented , but American crosswords did n't do it for me .
The New York Times puzzle lacks the narrative quality of British puzzles .
Its clues are too literal , its meanings too obvious .
They lack also a common vocabulary , the difference between cricket , perhaps , and baseball .
In January 1998 , the New York Times crossword editor , Will Shortz , allowed a young man to propose to his girlfriend by putting a message into the crossword .
Shortz was a little suspicious when Bill Gottlieb called him .
" At first , " Shortz told me , " I thought I could n't do this .
I could n't let the Times be used for something so personal .
But then I called him up , and he seemed to me to be an earnest and sincere young man , and completely in love with Emily .
I agreed . "
" So anyway , " Gottlieb told me , " Emily 's doing the puzzle and I 'm reading the rest of the paper and pretending not to know anything , and watching as she becomes suspicious .
She fills in her name , and then my name .
And then one answer is ' Will you marry me ? ' and she gets that .
And then we had ' Yes ' as an answer .
And the clue for ' Yes ' was ' Hoped for answer to " Will you marry me ? " '
" And by then , " Gottlieb continued , " she knew something was up , and that 's when I asked her , properly , to marry me .
" And I said ' yes ' , " said Emily .
As an art form , the cryptic puzzle has been appropriated by the British ; they have written the rules in their own image .
What appealed to me was not only the general idea of British crosswords , but the particular form they take in British broadsheets , the Guardian in particular .
I am not , for example , a Telegraph person .
I do like , though , the story of how the long - time editor of its crossword got into trouble for this clue : " Outcry at Tory assassination ( 4,6 ) " .
The answer is BLUE MURDER .
It is not , on the face of it , an objectionable clue .
But it appeared in the Telegraph on July 30 1990 , the day that Ian Gow , a junior minister in Margaret Thatcher 's government , was blown up in the driveway of his home by the Provisional IRA .
Under the circumstances , it is not surprising that some people took offence , although the editor 's defence - that the clue had been prepared weeks before , and she had no foreknowledge of it - is not unreasonable .
How much greater , one wonders , would have been the offence , had the same clue been phrased as it appeared in the Guardian recently .
" Clamour for Tory assassination ( 4 , 6 ) " has a much more sinister edge , and leaves one in no doubt as to the political sympathies of the setter , and his presumed readership .
( Actually that should be " their " readership .
Gemini , the setter , is not one , but two people . )
Since it was crosswords that offered me a grip on the seemingly blank cliff face of Britain , I started teaching myself about them and the people who create and solve them .
I was curious about how they worked , and I was curious to ask the question that had been bothering me since Chad .
Can a crossword have a personality ?
Who are the setters ?
Who is Rufus ?
I meet Rufus in a London pub .
He comes complete with notes and anecdotes , and is very helpful .
He was born in Wolverhampton in 1932 , and left school at 15 to join the navy .
When he resigned , he became an entertainment officer , a redcoat at Butlin's .
For the past 40 - odd years he has been making his living as a comedy - magician , which is , he says , " as good a definition of a crossword compiler as any " .
Rufus is famous in the crossword world for the sheer volume of his output .
He has had more than 57,000 puzzles published , at an average output of 38 puzzles each week .
He has been cataloguing , first on cards and now on a computer , all his clues since 1963 .
I ask him about " émigré " and he is able to look it up and tell me when and where it was published ( the Guardian , 1991 ) .
Similarly , I ask about " Pretty girl in crimson rose ( 8 ) " , and he is able to tell me that it is not one of his .
" But I did use ' Pretty girl in red and rose ( 8 ) ' in the early 1980s , " he says , " and ' Rose , a lovely girl in crimson ( 8 ) ' in 1997 .
They are all pretty much the same thing . "
Like other setters , Rufus has several other pseudonyms : Hodge in the Independent and Dante in the FT .
He shows me a letter ( subtitled " my favourite ! " ) to the Guardian dating from March 1992 .
It reads : " For me , Araucaria is the Beethoven of setters - immensely impressive , but laboured and heavy footed at times .
Too many of his clues are tortuous and meaningless .
The incomparable Rufus , on the other hand , is Mozart -- concise , elegant , witty , sparkling ... "
Like all professional entertainers , Rufus takes the business of self - promotion seriously .
He gives me a list of favourites , some by himself , some by others , and then tells me one that is not on the list , which he credits to the author , Ian Polley .
" Wrinkled old retainer , " he says , " seven letters . "
I am some way off the mark .
" Scrotum , " says Rufus , with a chuckle .
I arranged to meet the Guardian setter , Pasquale , in a pub near Waterloo station .
Pasquale is a friendly , gentle man who works for Oxford University Press .
Like Rufus he is known for his prodigious output , and claims to " set a clue every three hours or so " ( including sleeping hours ) .
I am eager to meet him because of his puzzles , but also because he is one of the few people to have criticised Araucaria in print .
Pasquale 's particular criticism is that Araucaria strays too far from the rules , and is sometimes guilty of grammatical unsoundness .
He is , the accusation goes , prone to creating clues that could only be clues , clues in which the surface meaning is too far removed from everyday usage .
That said , like everyone else he enjoys doing Araucaria 's puzzles .
Pasquale is a setter on several national papers , but he also edits the puzzles of the Church Times , for which Araucaria sets .
" I do n't do it much any more , " Araucaria tells me .
" He keeps changing my clues , which I do n't much like .
Of course , " he adds , " we have had a long - standing war over this . "
Pasquale and I eventually meet for supper in a pub south of the Thames .
I ask him about his criticism of Araucaria , and his face lights up .
" I 've got the prize puzzle , " he says , " on Saturday .
Have a look at it .
It 's my comment on some of Araucaria 's clues . "
The prize puzzle in the Guardian is mostly set by Araucaria , but sometimes others get a look - in .
Bunthorne may have one a month .
Enigmatist from time to time .
Occasionally Paul .
And now Pasquale .
" Do the puzzle , " he says .
And then , as all setters do from time to time , he has a moment of doubt about the clue .
" It 's a quotation , " he adds , " a bit obscure .
But it is in the dictionary .
I think people will get it .
I think it will be all right . "
( " All right " is an expression setters use frequently , as a euphemism for " fair " . )
And so I get the paper and look eagerly for the clue , which is : " See cluer 's use of rare , silly pseudo - lingo - absurd nonsense from 4 ( 10 , 5 , 5 , 5 , 9 ) " .
I can see the reprimand .
Silly pseudo - lingo and all that .
But the quote ?
I have a moment of doubt .
If this is to be a good clue , then both the solution and the surface meaning must feed each other .
It will not do for the answer to have nothing to do with " cluers " and their ( alleged ) silly pseudo - lingo .
It must somehow complete the story .
And when I get it , of course , it does .
The answer to 4 down in this puzzle is Chomsky .
So we can put that into the clue : " See cluer 's use of rare , silly pseudo - lingo - absurd nonsense from Chomsky ( 10 , 5 , 5 , 5 , 9 ) " .
Something Chomsky said , then , and an anagram indicated by " absurd " .
The answer is COLOURLESS GREEN IDEAS SLEEP FURIOUSLY , an anagram of " See cluer 's use of rare , silly pseudo - lingo " .
This , many Guardian solvers will know , is the sentence with which Noam Chomsky announced his arrival as a force to be reckoned with in the field of linguistics , the example he chose to demonstrate that sentence might be grammatical without being meaningful .
The reprimand is complete .
" Good grief , " says Araucaria when I ask him .
" Was that about me ?
I did solve the puzzle - I do n't always - but it passed me by completely . "
Araucaria is now an old man , but he continues his prodigious output of 15 crosswords each month , as he has for 45 years .
He is a stylist , and his reputation for fiendish complexity is matched only by his reputation for fairness , which is to say he will not knowingly cut corners in a clue .
Araucaria wrote the clue that Nick Smith in a letter to the Guardian on January 21 2001 claimed to be " the best crossword clue ever " .
Consider two pieces of information that would have been readily available to Guardian readers such as Nick at the time .
The first is that in 2000 , 13 years after he told it , Jeffrey Archer 's lie about Monica Coghlan came back to haunt him .
The second is that , before his subsequent trial and conviction , Archer retired from the public eye and took refuge in the Old Vicarage , Grantchester .
And so to the clue : " Poetical scene has surprisingly chaste Lord Archer vegetating ( 3 , 3 , 8 , 12 ) " .
The answer is The Old Vicarage , Grantchester , a " surprising " anagram of " chaste Lord Archer vegetating " , or as Nick Smith put it to me , " the most perfect clue , probably the best ever " .
Why ?
Those who do n't do crosswords may think this a small point .
But those who do will know that legitimate 26 - letter anagrams are few and far between .
They will know that clues calling on such a range of knowledge for their solution come along only now and then .
They will have experienced the tedium of simple anagrams .
And they will know that , somewhere in this clue - and in the puzzle that surrounded it , for the theme of the day was English verse - a particular kind of genius is at work .
I asked Araucaria to re-create for me the process of creating this clue .
Although he has now acquired a computer and may on occasion use it , he prefers to do his anagrams with an old Scrabble set .
He spills the pieces on to the table in the sitting room of his small house , and spells out The Old Vicarage Grantchester before scraping the rest of the pieces back into their box .
As he does so , I detect a change in him .
From being a shy and quietly - spoken man , he takes on a mantle of authority .
The set of his mouth changes .
His fingers caress the Scrabble pieces and I notice that some of them are so worn that he has had to ink in the letters again .
" Lord Archer came first , " he told me with a twinkle , and he removes from the jumble of letters the ones that make up the two words .
" And he had been in the news a lot .
I think they call it a flair for publicity . "
He pauses and moves the letters around on the rosewood coffee table .
" And I thought it would be interesting to do something with Lord Archer . "
But I can see that he is not really thinking about me , or about Archer .
His mind is calculating other anagrams , his fingers dancing from one to another like a jazz pianist groping for a song .
" But it did n't leave me much , " he says , a little affronted that he should be left with so few letters .
Those that remain are T , H , E , V , I , C , A , G , E , G , A , N , T , E , S , T . " Not very much at all . "
Again he casts his hands across them , mixing times and keys , playing snatches from forgotten clues .
" At first I got the word ' teach ' and I was trying to think what to do with ' teach ' .
And of course I had ' ing ' .
But ' teach ' or ' teaching ' did n't lead anywhere .
What have they to do with Archer ?
So the clue only came when I worked out that I could have ' chaste ' .
And I knew immediately that ' chaste ' and ' Lord Archer ' could make something interesting .
And so I took ' chaste ' out " - which he does as he speaks - " and I was left with this lot . "
And he looks down at these letters and again I notice the twinkle in his eye : T , E , V , I , G , E , G , A , N , T .
" And then I had it . "
Araucaria and I look at each other , and I see that the look in his eye is not just a twinkle .
There is something else there , a suggestion of sterner stuff , and a knowledge that he is straying into territory where only the braver setters go .
He is making a political statement .
He is delivering a reprimand to Archer and all his vain , dishonest ilk , and he is doing it in the most delicate , most imaginative manner possible .
And in doing so he is giving rein to a notion of romance and of patriotism to which I do not believe Lord Archer can begin to aspire .
Some months later , after Archer had been convicted , a Guardian reader in the Netherlands remembered the Araucaria clue and proposed a new clue .
" Now that [ Archer ] has changed addresses " he wrote , " may I suggest an update :
Where shaken Archer 's ' I 'm noble ! ' palls ( 1,8,6,4 ) " .
The answer , of course , is : A Belmarsh prison cell .
In the early winter of 2001 , I decided that I wanted a puzzle about me to appear in the Guardian for my 40th birthday , and I wanted Araucaria to set it .
As a theme I chose " thrillers " .
I gave Araucaria a list of words .
He got most of them in , but there were some he left out .
He did n't find a place for " English " .
Nor did he fit in " previously undiscovered meanings " , although of course the puzzle , like all crossword puzzles , is about just such meanings .
But he did get in " hero " and " Sandy " , " thriller " and " autobiography " .
I asked for Guardian grid 40 , but Araucaria was of the view that this is a lousy grid and did not offer enough variety of word length .
Instead , he used grid 28 .
When Araucaria sends me the puzzle , it arrives in a form I have not previously seen .
The clues are on the left - hand side of the page .
The solutions are on the right , together with various forms of crossword annotation to explain each answer .
" I hope you think it 's all right , " he says .
" I think it is .
I think it should be OK . "
Along with crosswords , Araucaria has long since mastered the art of the understatement .
My puzzle appears in the Guardian on February 16 2002 , puzzle number 22445 .
I rise early and hurry to the newsagent , where I buy up the entire stock of Guardians .
I take them home and spread one out on the kitchen table .
To forestall a lurking panic attack and to make sure there are no typing errors , I quickly fill in the grid .
It all looks fine .
I am a little nervous , though .
Now that I see it in print , I am not sure whether it will stand the scrutiny of thousands of solvers .
Will they spot some glaring error that neither Araucaria , nor I , nor the Guardian editor have seen ?
I am still gazing at it , with a grin on my face and a certain melancholy in my heart , when the children come down to have their breakfast .
" Happy birthday , Daddy . "
" Look , " I say , " I 'm in the paper . "
" Are you ?
Where ? "
They cluster round me , and I show them the grid , complete with my name .
They look disappointed .
" That 's not you , Daddy , " says my younger daughter .
" That 's a crossword puzzle . "
Children have a way of seeing through things .
My girlfriend was more understanding .
" Nice one , " she said , and it was .
Nine days after the puzzle appeared in the Guardian , a list of the winners appeared .
I called them all , to see what they thought .
Three could n't remember the puzzle .
They send in 10 or 15 entries a week , and a puzzle is forgotten as soon as it is finished .
Two thought it was great , but both immediately made self - deprecating jokes .
" I think that of everything by Araucaria , " said one .
" He seems to be head and shoulders above the rest . "
" Is n't he lovely ? " asked the other .
" Everything he does is so witty . "
The former is 22 and studying mathematics .
The latter is 76 , and has been doing crosswords for more than half a century .
It seemed to me entirely appropriate that this puzzle should have brought pleasure to people so different in age .
Talking to these setters and solvers , however , I realise that I still have some way to go before my range of reference points equals theirs .
I look forward to the journey

Wit and wisdom
This video is from a segment on 60 Minutes that was aired Sunday May 16 , 2010 .
The discussion is mostly about what happened with Deep Horizen in the Gulf of Mexico , interviewing one of the survivors , but it also addresses another great concern which is an much larger oil rig owned by BP that is even further out in the Gulf and MUCH deeper ( over 7,000 feet ) .
Vodpod videos no longer available .
This video blew me away .
The whistleblower ’s name is Kenneth Abbott , a former project control supervisor contracted by BP .
He filed suit on May 17th “ to force the federal government to halt operations at another massive BP oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico , alleging that BP never reviewed critical engineering designs for the operation and is therefore risking another catastrophic accident that could “ dwarf ” the company ’s Deepwater Horizon spill . ”
More :
Abbott alleged that BP failed to review thousands of final design documents for systems and equipment on the Atlantis platform — meaning BP management never confirmed the systems were built as they were intended – and did n’t properly file the documentation that functions as an instruction manual for rig workers to shut down operations in the case of a blowout or other emergency .
Abbott alleges that when he warned BP about the dangers presented by the missing documentation the company ignored his concerns and instead emphasized saving money .
“ There were hundreds , if not thousands , of drawings that had n’t been approved and to send drawings ( to the rig ) that had n’t been approved could result in catastrophic operator errors , ” Abbott told ProPublica .
“ They turned their eye away from their responsibility to make sure the overall design works .
Instead they are having bits and pieces fabricated and they are just hoping that these contractors who make all these separate pieces can pull it together and make it safe .
The truth is these contractors see a piece of the puzzle ; they do n’t see the whole thing . ”
More from this same article :
Congress and the Minerals and Management Service have been investigating Abbott ’s concerns since last year , when he and Food and Water Watch , an environmental organization based in Washington , D.C. , first filed the complaints .
But according to both Abbott and FWW , little has been done .
After the Deepwater Horizon Gulf spill underscored their concerns , they decided to jointly file the lawsuit .
Abbott was laid off shortly after he raised the concerns to BP management .
According to the lawsuit , by Nov. 28 , 2008 , when Abbott last had access to BP ’s files , only half of the 7,176 drawings detailing Atlantis ’ sub - sea equipment had been approved for design by an engineer and only 274 had been approved “ as built , ” meaning they were checked and confirmed to meet quality and design standards and the documentation made available to the rig crew .
Ninety percent of the design documents , the suit alleges , had never been approved at all .
The Atlantis rig is even larger than the Deepwater Horizon rig that sank in April .
It began producing oil in 2007 and can produce 8.4 million gallons a day .
The components include some of the critical infrastructure to protect against a spill .
According the suit , none of the sub - sea risers – the pipelines and hoses that serve as a conduit for moving materials from the bottom of the ocean to the facility — had been “ issued for design . ”
The suit also alleges that none of the wellhead documents were approved , and that none of the documents for the manifolds that combine multiple pipeline flows into a single line at the seafloor had been reviewed for final use .
Directions for how to use the piping and instrument systems that help shut down operations in the event of an emergency , as well as the computer software used to enact an emergency shutdown , had also not been approved , the lawsuit says .
According to the lawsuit , 14 percent those documents had been approved for construction , and none received final approval to ensure they were built and functioning properly .
“ BP ’s worst - case scenario indicates that an oil spill from the BP Atlantis Facility could be many times larger than the current oil spill from the BP Deepwater Horizon , ” the lawsuit states .
“ The catastrophic Horizon oil spill would be a mere drop in the bucket when compared to the potential size of a spill from the BP Atlantis facility . ”
Can you even imagine …
If they do n’t have the technology or safety features nailed down in order to be able to stop this massive leak from the Deep Horizon ( which has been amply demonstrated ) , why would anyone allow drilling to continue with this other , larger rig — owned and run by the same people who are apparently skipping corners there as well — in much deeper water , with a MUCH greater output ..
What are they thinking ?
( I know … , dollars ) .
What are WE thinking by letting them !
As Gorette at The Daily Kos said , “ Until regulators can “ prove ” that Atlantis , the Gulf ’s second largest oil rig is safe , it should be shut down . ”
Amen to that .

Trial begins against ex-Chicago police commander accused of torture
By Naomi Spencer
2 June 2010
The federal trial began last week for former Chicago police commander John Burge , who has long stood accused of the torture of hundreds of poor , black prisoners beginning in the early 1970s .
During his 22 - year tenure at the police department , Burge oversaw the routine coercion and abuse of suspects leading to confessions and countless wrongful convictions , including death sentences .
The case is a window to the meat - grinder of the city ’s criminal justice system .
Burge is facing one count of perjury and two counts of obstruction of justice pertaining to a 2003 civil suit , in which he denied knowledge of torture under his command at Area 2 on Chicago ’s South Side .
Because of the state ’s statute of limitations , Burge cannot be charged in the torture allegations .
For this reason , the federal attorney for the Northern District of Illinois , Patrick Fitzgerald , charged Burge in October 2008 with perjury and obstruction of justice instead .
The charges are punishable by up to 45 years in prison .
Burge , a former military police trainer at an interrogation camp in Vietnam , entered a not guilty plea and is presently free on bond , still collecting a hefty police department pension .
The expiration of the statute of limitations for the torture charges was achieved only through a united front of official stonewalling .
First among those responsible for this are longtime Chicago Mayor Richard Daley , and Richard Devine , the state ’s attorney for Chicago ’s Cook County .
The two repeatedly declined to investigate charges against the Area 2 police unit over the years , in no small part because of the direct role the two played in the corrupt criminal justice system in the city .
When allegations of the abuse began surfacing in the 1970s , Daley was serving as the Cook County state ’s attorney , and Devine was his assistant .
Their folded hands during this period not only allowed the abuse to continue , their silence represented a tacit approval of Burge ’s methods .
Many of the prisoners subjected to Burge ’s interrogations were convicted in the Cook County system of crimes they did not commit , their confessions the only scrap of evidence against them .
In 2003 , revelations of coerced confessions by prisoners facing execution in Chicago compelled then - Governor George Ryan to commute the sentences of all death row inmates — a decision that Cook County state ’s attorney Devine called “ outrageous and unconscionable . ”
Cook County ’s system accounted for 100 of the 167 commuted death sentences .
The great majority of former death row prisoners later proven innocent had been convicted in Cook County , including four Chicagoans to whom Ryan granted full pardons because they had been tortured into their confessions by Burge .
Two of Burge ’s victims took the stand last week at the Dirksen federal courthouse to describe their treatment .
The first to testify on Thursday was Anthony Holmes , who was arrested in 1973 for a murder he did not commit .
Now 63 years old , he served 33 years in prison .
Holmes had been a member of a gang on the poor , mostly black South Side .
He told the court he first encountered the Chicago Area 2 police force when Burge and other officers broke down his door and arrested him , Burge putting a gun to his head .
Holmes was taken to the headquarters for interrogation .
After he denied any involvement in a murder , Holmes said Burge left the room for a moment , then returned carrying a box .
“ He took the box and plugged it into the wall , ” Holmes testified .
“ He put one wire on my ankle ( shackles ) , and I assume he put the other one on my handcuffs .
He said , ‘ Nigger , you ’re going to tell me what I want to know . ’ ”
Burge shocked him repeatedly and suffocated him by tying plastic bags over his head until he passed out .
When Holmes fell unconscious , Burge would remove the bag , revive him , and repeat the torture .
The Chicago Tribune published excerpts of his account on May 26 .
“ He kept doing me like that ; I did n’t know if it was daytime , nighttime — I just could n’t take it .
I was in a different world .
All I know is that when he took the bag off , I ’d say whatever he wanted me to say . ”
According to the Tribune , during cross-examination , Burge ’s attorney , Rick Beuke , “ pummeled Holmes with questions about why Holmes did n’t tell more people about the abuse while he was in jail for the murder .
‘ You spent 1973 to 2004 and told no one about being tortured ? ’ ” Holmes told the court , “ I told the parole board but they did n’t believe me … .
This happened to me .
I ca n’t speak about anybody else , but this man and his crew tortured me .
They did n’t have to , but they did .
They tried to kill me . ”
In 1973 , Holmes also told his court - appointed public defender , Larry Sufferdin , about his treatment .
Sufferdin , now Cook County commissioner , testified Thursday that Holmes had wept about the torture and abuse during their meetings together , but that Sufferdin never attempted to raise it as an issue during Holmes ’ trial , nor make a motion to strike the false confession .
Melvin Jones , the second witness to testify against Burge , took the stand on Thursday .
Like Holmes , Jones was arrested as a homicide suspect .
Now homeless , Jones was convicted of homicide and spent almost seven years in prison before being retried and found not guilty .
He maintained his innocence throughout his ordeal .
He said that for four days in 1982 , he was held at the Area 2 headquarters and tortured .
The Chicago Sun Times quoted portions of his testimony May 27 .
“ He said his name was Lt. Burge and asked me if I was ready to confess and if I knew him .
When I said , ‘ No , ’ he said I would know him before I would leave here , ” Jones told the court .
Jones said Burge attached wires to his penis and shocked him repeatedly and handcuffed him to the radiator , causing burns to his bare skin .
“ I was just thinking , he ’s a madman , ” he testified .
“ I told him he ca n’t do me like this .
He said , ‘ Who ’s gonna tell ? ’
He looked at [ another detective in the room ] and said , ‘ Do you see anything ? ’
And [ the detective ] just looked up at the ceiling . ”
Jones described other abuse , including being struck with a stapler so hard he still bears a knot on his head , and Burge cocking a gun against Jones ’s temple and threatening to “ blow [ his ] black head off . ”
In a telephone interview with Chicago Defender reporter Kathy Chaney , published May 26 , death row prisoner Stanley Howard recounted his encounter with Burge in March 1983 .
Howard maintains his innocence , and said that he was slapped and kicked by detectives , then suffocated with a plastic bag .
“ I came to because one of the guys was smacking me trying to wake me up .
Then another officer kept kicking me in my left shin , every chance he got , ” he said .
Detectives took him to the crime scene and “ spoon fed ” him information they wanted him to include in his confession .
“ When they figured out I was n’t going to confess when the state ’s attorney came , one of the officers uncuffed me and told me to run .
Then another officer pulled out the gun , ” Howard told the Defender .
“ I knew then they were willing to kill me to get a confession .
They took me back to the police station and I was being suffocated .
It was then that I decided to sign the confession .
I should n’t have done it . ”
Howard said he thought the confession would collapse under the scrutiny of the judicial system , but his case sailed through to a death penalty conviction .
“ I did n’t know that no Cook County judge was n’t willing to stand up against that guy [ Burge ] , ” he told the paper .
“ I was sentenced to Death Row in 1987 .
I do n’t understand why I ’m still here .
I need a new trial .
I need some mercy . ”
Many other similar accounts make clear that torture , racism , and sadism were routine conduct for the Chicago police force .
It is also clear that Burge ’s coworkers and superiors were aware of the abuse ; the police department suppressed an internally - prepared report for several years in the early 1990s as abuse complaints mounted .
Moreover , the state ’s attorney ’s office , the prosecutorial prowess of which was bolstered by the endless stream of in - the - bag guilty murder cases Burge provided , resisted the public outcry over wrongful convictions and demands for a trial .
Mayor Daley , state ’s attorney Devine , and others are thus implicated in the decades of abuse .

Until now .
The world 's most famous street artist has made his directorial debut , and has emerged - sort of - to promote his film .
In his only Australian interview , conducted , after much rigmarole , by email , the elusive artist talks about his much - discussed film , his anonymity and his Melbourne stencils .
His film , Exit Through the Gift Shop , in which he " stars " , appearing in shadow and speaking through a voice distorter , purportedly began as someone else 's film - that of the seemingly crazy Frenchman Thierry Guetta , an amateur filmmaker living in Los Angeles .
Guetta spent years obsessively filming street artists at work , starting with his cousin , the celebrated Space Invader , and LA 's Shepard Fairey , best known for his iconic Barack Obama poster .
Through Fairey , Guetta meets Banksy and the pair strike up an odd friendship ; Banksy allowing Guetta to film him in exchange for Guetta helping him find street canvases in LA .
Without giving too much away , Banksy realises Guetta is no filmmaker at all , and the two swap roles - Banksy takes over the production and Guetta cynically transforms himself , almost overnight , into an artist - with astonishing results .
Like many Banksy creations , the film works on a comedic level and as a statement about fame and the commodification of art .
Since its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in January , speculation has been rife that Exit Through the Gift Shop is a " mockumentary " , a brilliantly executed prank .
Banksy insists it 's not .
" The film is a documentary , not a work of fiction .
If I 'd written it myself there would have been a car chase and lasers .
Unfortunately there 's neither , " he says .
" It 's proof that truth is stranger than fiction , and that truly strange people cause a lot of friction .
You could n't make it up , although I often wish I had .
" The film has … split opinion - people either find it truly inspiring or utterly depressing .
Or they could n't care less . "
Prank or not , the film features extraordinary footage of street artists at work , complete with police busts and daredevil exploits as Banksy and others scale buildings in search of prime graffiti real estate , providing the first big - screen record of the medium .
Putting it together , says Banksy , was hard work .
" Making a film is n't as much fun as it looks .
I spent a year … watching footage of sweaty vandals falling off ladders , " he says .
" If I make another film it 'll be called something like ' Kate Moss Undressing ' and maybe then I 'd take more interest in the camera angles . "
The film also pokes fun at the art world elite , a favourite target of Banksy's , particularly since his works have found favour with celebrities and their prices skyrocketed .
But his work still divides critics , with many regarding him as nothing more than a vandal .
" I would n't expect the art world elite to embrace graffiti , it 's way more important than that , " he says .
" The truth is that most graffiti actually improves the environment .
Frank Lloyd Wright said , ' A doctor can bury his mistakes , but an architect can only instruct his clients to plant vines ' .
Well that was before they invented 500 - millilitre cans of extra - wide chrome paint . "
Banksy is a fan of Melbourne 's renowned graffiti scene , where several of his works are on show .
" Australia is an isolated place … and that can be a weakness or a strength .
Sometimes being in the middle of nowhere puts you right in the heart of the action .
'' The Melbourne graffiti scene has always been fiercely independent … and it is n't chasing some 1970s , New York idea of cool , " he says .
" I doubt its something the authorities are particularly proud of , but Melbourne street art leads the world . "
But that 's not to say he agrees with this week 's Victorian government proposal to " protect " the city 's street art , in the wake of Banksy 's famous rat being painted over .
Nor does he like the " preservation " of his work behind transparent plastic , as building owners did with his " little diver " work in 2008 .
Preserving street art , transitory by its very nature , defeats the purpose , surely ?
" Graffiti is n't meant to last forever .
I 'd prefer someone draw a moustache and glasses on one of my pieces than encase it in Perspex , " he says .
" I 've always been uncomfortable with the way galleries put things on a pedestal .
I think art should be a two - way conversation , not a lecture from behind glass . "
But he vows to continue his Zorro - style night painting .
" Making the film was n't a conscious attempt to expand my CV ; I just had a story I wanted to tell .
There 's no danger of a sequel or a clothing line , '' he says .
" I 'd like to say I 'm politically motivated but the reality is I 'm just far too lazy for capitalism .
If Banksy has become a brand , then it's a brand that does n't believe in itself . "
And a " brand " that will never reveal its true identity ?
" There 's probably a contradiction in hiding your face while shooting off your mouth , " he concedes .
" But I do n't think it 's terminal .
My job requires a little light lawbreaking so I do n't have much choice .
Since I was a little kid I wanted the power to become invisible , I seem to have that now , so why would I give it up ? "
So how can we be sure we 're talking to the real deal ?
" Is this really Banksy ?
That depends .
If the interview makes me sound charming and intelligent then it's me , " he says .
" If I sound like an idiot then I 'll say it was an impostor . "
Exit Through the Gift Shop opens in limited release in Sydney on June 24 .

Mr Noble took six trains and three taxis to reach the French ferry port
A London businessman stranded in France by the no-fly ban is back in the UK after having to buy a women 's bicycle to allow him aboard a returning ferry .
Thom Noble , 52 , from Highgate , said operator Norfolkline had no foot passenger tickets left and would only let him on as a cyclist .
He said staff at Dunkirk even made him ride the cycle , which he bought from a second - hand shop , up the ferry 's ramp .
Norfolkline was not available for comment on Saturday .
Child 's bike
He said half a dozen people grounded by the volcanic ash had the same idea and boarded the boat in a wobbling parade of two - wheelers .
One man , a British Airways gold card member , was riding a children 's bicycle .
Mr Noble , the managing director of a marketing company , and his colleague , set off on Friday morning from Zurich in Switzerland .
The trip involved six trains and three taxis just to reach the French ferry port .
He said the second - hand shop had had a run on bicycles and he bought a women 's bike for 49 euro ( £ 43 ) while his colleague picked out a bright pink contraption with a giant basket in front .
Mr Noble said once in Dover they were forced to dump the bicycles in order to get on a bus to go to the railway station .

Hopefully this gets fixed , zerg gets balanced , bnet gets reverted to 1.0 , and lan gets added to release .
Then everything will be in harmony .

In Technology Preview 1 we ’ve shown that Phusion Passenger 3 can be up to 55 % faster on OS X .
Performance is good and all , but it wo n’t do you any good unless the software keeps running .
When Phusion Passenger goes down it ’s an annoyance at best , but in the worst case any amount of down time can cost your organization real money .
Any HTTP request that ’s dropped can mean a lost transaction .
Although stability , robustness and availability are n’t as hot and fashionable as performance , for Phusion Passenger 3 we have not neglected these areas .
In fact we ’ve been working on hard on implementing additional safeguards , as well as refactoring our designs to make things more stable , robust and available .
Self - healing
In Phusion Passenger 2.2 ’s architecture , there are a number of processes that work together .
At the very front there is the web server , which could consist of multiple processes .
If you ’ve ever typed passenger - memory - stats then you ’ve seen the web server processes at work .
Apache typically has a dozen of processes ( prefork MPM ) and Nginx typically has 3 .
For Phusion Passenger to work , there must be some kind of global state , shared by all web server processes .
In this global state information is stored such as which Ruby app processes exist , which ones are currently handling requests , etc .
This allows Phusion Passenger to make decisions such as which Ruby app process to route a request to , whether there is any need to spawn another process , etc .
This global state exists in a separate process which all web server processes communicate with .
On Apache this is the ApplicationPoolServerExecutable , on Nginx this is the HelperServer .
For simplicity ’s sake , let ’s call both of them HelperServer ( in Passenger 3 they ’ve both been renamed to PassengerHelperAgent ) .
The HelperServer is written in C++ and is extremely fast and lightweight , consuming only about 500 KB of real memory .
As you can see the HelperServer is essentially the core of Phusion Passenger .
The problem with 2.2 is that if the HelperServer goes down , Phusion Passenger goes down with it entirely .
Phusion Passenger will stay down until the web server is restarted .
For various architectural reasons in Apache and Nginx , it is not easily possible to restart the HelperServer upon a crash in a reliable way .
Now , why would the HelperServer ever crash ?
Bugs .
We are humans too and we can make mistakes , so it ’s possible that there are crasher bugs in the HelperServer .
In the past 2 years we ’ve spent a lot of effort into making the HelperServer stable .
For example we check all system calls for error results , and we ’ve spent a lot of effort into making sure that uncaught exceptions are properly logged and handled .
However one can never prove that a system is entirely bug free .
We are n’t aware of any crasher bugs at this time but they might still exist .
Limited system resources .
For example if the system is very low on memory , the kernel will invoke the Out - Of - Memory Killer ( OOM Killer ) .
Properly selecting a process to kill in low - memory conditions is actually a pretty hard problem , and more often than not the OOM Killer selects the wrong process , e.g. our HelperServer .
System administrator mistakes .
Passing the wrong PID to the kill command and things like that .
System configuration problems , hardware problems ( faulty RAM and stuff ) and operating system bugs .
There are some people who have reported problems with the HelperServer .
Their HelperServer crashes tend to happen sporadically and they usually cannot reproduce the problem reliably themselves .
For many people ( 2 ) is often the cause of HelperServer crashes , and increasing the amount of swap is reported to help , but for other people the problems lie elsewhere .
The crashes are n’t always our fault ( i.e. not bugs ) , but they are always our problem .
It saddens us to say that we ’ve been unable to help these people so far because we simply cannot reproduce their problems even when we mimic their system configuration .
But this is going to change .
Enter Phusion Passenger 3 with self - healing architecture
Phusion Passenger 3 now introduces a lightweight watchdog process into the architecture .
It monitors both the web server and the HelperServer .
If the HelperServer crashes , then the watchdog restarts the HelperServer immediately .
Of course if the watchdog is killed then it ’s still game over , but we ’ve taken extra care in terms of code to try to make this extremely unlikely to happen .
The watchdog for starters is extremely lightweight , even more so than the HelperServer .
It is written in C++ and uses about 150 - 200 KB of memory .
Its only job is to start the HelperServer and other Phusion Passenger helper processes and to monitor them .
The codebase extensively uses C++ idioms that promote code stability , such as smart pointers and RAII .
By employing heavy testing as well , we ’re expecting to have brought the possibility that the watchdog contains crashing bugs to a minimum .
The small footprint and the fact that it does nothing most of the time minimizes the chances that it ’s killed by the OOM Killer .
In fact , if the watchdog is running on Linux and has root access , it will register itself as not OOM - killable .
No longer will HelperServer crashes take down Phusion Passenger , even if the crash is n’t our fault .
Restarts are fast
It only takes a few hundred miliseconds to restart the HelperServer .
Crashing signals are logged
If the HelperServer crashes then the watchdog will tell you whether it crashed because of a signal , e.g. SIGSEGV .
This makes it much easier for system administrators to see why a component crashed so that they might fix the underlying cause .
In Phusion Passenger 2.2 this was not possible .
Guaranteed cleanup
Upon shutting down or restarting the web server , Phusion Passenger 2.2 gracefully notifies application processes to shut down .
It does not force them to .
This would pose a problem for broken web applications that do n’t shut down properly , e.g. web applications that are stuck in an infinite loop , stuck in a database call , etc .
Phusion Passenger 3 guarantees that all application processes are properly shut down when you shutdown / restart the web server .
It gives application processes a deadline of 30 seconds to shutdown gracefully ; if any of them fail to do that , they ’ll be terminated with SIGKILL .
This mechanism works so well that it even extends to background processes that have been spawned off by the web application processes .
All of those processes belong to the same process group .
Phusion Passenger sends SIGKILL to the entire process group and terminates everything .
No longer will you have to manually clean up processes ; you can be confident that everything is gone if you shutdown / restart the web server .
Zero - downtime web server restart
In Phusion Passenger 2.2 , whenever you restart the web server , HTTP requests that are currently in progress are dropped and the clients receive ugly “ Connection reset by server ” or similar error messages .
This can be a major problem for large websites , because during the 1 second that Phusion Passenger is restarting hundreds of people could be getting errors .
If your visitor happens to be clicking on that “ Buy ” button , well , tough luck .
In Phusion Passenger 3 we ’ve implemented zero - downtime web server restart .
Phusion Passenger and the web server are restarted in the background , and while this is happening , the old web server instance ( with the old Phusion Passenger instance ) will continue to process requests .
The architecture is actually a little bit more complicated than what ’s shown in the diagram because behind the web server there are a bunch of Phusion Passenger processes , but you get the gist of it .
When the new web server ( along with the new Phusion Passenger ) has been started , it will immediately begin accepting new requests .
Old requests that are n’t finished yet will continue to be processed by the old web server and Phusion Passenger instance .
The old instance will shut down 5 seconds after all requests have been finished , to counter the possibility that the kernel still has leftover requests in the socket backlog that hit the old instance after its done processing everything already in its queue .
This works so well that we can restart the web server while running an ‘ ab ’ benchmark with 100 concurrent users without dropping a single request !
Zero -downtime application shutdown
Suppose that a Ruby application process has gone rogue and you want to shut it down .
The most obvious way to do that is by sending it a SIGTERM or SIGKILL signal .
However this would also abort whatever request it is currently processing .
In Phusion Passenger 2.2 , you could also send SIGUSR1 to the process , causing it to shut down gracefully after it has processed all requests in its socket backlog .
However this introduces two problems :
If the website is very busy then the process ’s socket backlog will never be empty , and so the process will never exit .
Exiting after the process has detected an empty backlog can introduce a race condition .
Suppose that , right after the process has determined that its backlog is empty but before it has shutdown completely , Phusion Passenger tries to send another request to the process .
This request would be lost .
In Phusion Passenger 3 , SIGUSR1 will now cause the application process to first unregister itself so that Phusion Passenger wo n’t route any new requests to it anymore .
It will then proceed with exiting 5 seconds after its socket backlog has become empty .
This way you can gracefully shutdown a process without losing a single request .
Conclusion
Although Phusion Passenger has been powering many high - traffic Ruby websites for a while now , some people still have some doubts about whether Phusion Passenger is fit for production .
Instead of using words convince them , we would rather convince them with real results .
Phusion Passenger 3 raises the bar in the areas of performance , stability , robustness and availability yet higher , but it does n’t stop here .
Please stay tuned for the next Technology Preview in which will unveil even more of Phusion Passenger 3 .
Gaza Flotilla : If Chavez had been the killer instead of Netanyahu
http://alainet.org/active/38803 by Roberto Montoya

﻿ If Chavez had been the killer instead of Netanyahu
What you ’ d expect to see from the mainstream media
The USA Fourth Fleet , with its aircraft carrier and three nuclear submarines , its two dozen cruisers and fourteen patrol torpedo boats , its 120 F22 and F117 fighters , six Apache AH - 64 helicopters , sixty tanks and 20,000 marines , backed by B2 bombers and AWACS planes , is being deployed toward the Venezuelan coast to enforce a total blockade of Venezuelan ports .
“ The Pentagon has established a ‘ no - fly zone ’ over Venezuela and installed Patriot anti-ballistic missiles in Columbia and Honduras .
The goal is to prevent the dictator Chavez from using his nuclear arsenal against the USA or its neighbors .
The Pentagon has mobilized reinforcements for its seven permanent bases in Columbia on the Venezuelan border ” , The American secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , and the secretary of Defense , Robert Gates , at a press conference pointed out .
“ We have no intention to comply with the tepid response from the UN Security Council against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela . ”
“ The elite forces of the National Bolivarian Armada from the Agustín Armario Naval Base , made up of several GC - 21 coastal patrol boats , a few PC - 33 corvettes , and some PC - 24 patrol craft ATTACKED IN INTERNATIONL WATERS of the Caribbean Sea a FREEDOM FLOTILLA of six boats carrying 750 peaceful anti-Chavez activists and NGO members from several countries .
The comandos boarded the ship and opened fire on the passengers , leaving between nine and nineteen dead and dozens injured ” reported Gates .
“ The Venezuelan dictator ” , added Hillary Clinton , “ in his usual acts of distraction and propaganda , has accused the murdered civilians of carrying arms on board the ship and of being connected to the CIA , Mossad , and Columbian Intelligence Services . ”
President Obama , flanked by his Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair , said that American intelligence has long known that Chávez wanted to provoke an international diplomatic crisis disguised as legitimate self - defense .
“ The dictator was planning to invade Columbia with the help of the FARC .
He would then proceed to overthrow one by one the governments of Latin America that did not bend to the will of ALBA and the Latin American Axis of Evil .
Chávez ’s twisted dream is to build a Great Bolivarian Nation , which in reality would be nothing but a huge regional dictatorship . ”
Blair remarked .
After a moment of silence , Obama ’s face grew very serious .
He then made a revelation that astonished all present .
“ We have decided to invade Venezuela and extradite Chávez to Guantánamo where he will be judged by a military tribunal .
We have conclusive evidence that the dictator has been sheltering Osama bin Laden in the jungle south of the Orinoco River .
Furthermore , we have intelligence that Chávez has smuggled enriched uranium from Ahmedinijad and installed missiles targeting America . ”
“ And if this were not enough to justify our Crusade , it is my responsibility to inform the world of a vital discovery , a discovery which dispels one of the great mysteries of our time .
Our intelligence services have located the weapons of mass destruction for which my indefatigable predecessor scoured Iraqi territory in vain .
Now we have absolute proof that the weapons of mass destruction were smuggled into Venezuela by Saddam Hussein himself before he was apprehended .
They now under the direct command of the Chávez family . ”
No sooner had the press conference wrapped up when the White House telephones started ringing off the hook .
The leaders of the European Union , of the United Nations , of Israel , and of many other nations were climbing all over one another to assure the president of their support and to jump aboard his worthy Crusade .
At the insistence of European leaders and prestigious ‘ think tanks ’ , President Obama called for an international summit to study the inclusion of Cuba in The Great Crusade , dubbed Latin American Free Operation .
The Castro brothers would be captured and detained at Guantánamo .
Business leaders , led by Gerardo Díaz Ferrán of Spain , suggested the time was ripe to complete the democratic makeover of Latin American by the overthrow of totalitarian regimes .
The continent would be freed of coke fiends Evo Morales and Rafael Correa , of guerrilla leaders Daniel Ortega and Pepe Múgica , of the pinko priest Fernando Lugo , of the rabble - rowser Cristina Kirchner .
The continent would be freed of everyone and anyone who dares challenge the interests of the multinationals , the multinationals that have only the best interests of The People in mind .
Thus did Díaz Ferrán retrace the steps of German president Horst Köhler , who in May was forced to resign .
Köhler had declared that the valiant mission of Germany in Afghanistan was the following : “ We know that for a country of our size , its economy dependent on international commerce , military intervention is necessary to defend our interests .
Trade routes must be kept open and regions must be kept stable and safe , because otherwise our commercial interests would be negatively impacted . ”
Obama , his European Allies , the UN , the IMF , the International Development Bank , the World Bank , the most important multinationals and lobbies , have reached a consensus .
It can be assumed that resources freed by Latin American Free Operation will solve the the global financial crisis in the short or medium term .

By Stephen Prothero , Special to CNN
I am a big fan of the Dalai Lama .
I love his trademark smile and I hate the fact that I missed his talks this week in New York City .
But I can not say either " Amen " or " Om " to the shopworn clichés that he trots out in the New York Times in “ Many Faiths , One Truth . ”
Recalling the Apostle Paul — “ When I was a child , I spoke like a child ” — the Dalai Lama begins by copping to youthful naivete .
“ When I was a boy in Tibet , I felt that my own Buddhist religion must be the best , ” he writes , “ and that other faiths were somehow inferior . ”
However , just as Paul , upon becoming a man , “ put away childish things , ” the Dalai Lama now sees his youthful exclusivism as both naïve and dangerous .
There is “ one truth ” behind the “ many faiths , ” and that core truth , he argues , is compassion .
Like the Dalai Lama , who writes of how he was influenced by Thomas Merton , I believe we can learn greatly from other religions .
I too hope for tolerance and harmony in our interreligious interactions .
I am convinced , however , that true tolerance and lasting harmony must be built on reality , not fantasy .
Religious exclusivism is dangerous and naïve .
But so too is pretend pluralism .
The cause of religious harmony is not advanced in the least by the shibboleth that all religions are different paths up the same mountain .
If you ask religious universalists what lies at the top of the mountain , the answers they will give you are not one but many .
Gandhi and philosopher of religion Huston Smith say that at the top there is the same universal God .
But when others describe this religious mountaintop they invariably give voice to their own particular beliefs and biases .
Followers of the Dalai Lama revere him as a reincarnation of Avalokiteshvara , the bodhisattva of compassion .
So it should not be surprising that he sees compassion at the heart of all religions .
But this is a parochial perspective , not a universal one .
And like any form of pretend pluralism it threatens to blind us both to the particular dangers of individual religious traditions and to their unique beauties .
To be sure , all religions preach compassion .
But it is false to claim that compassion is the reason for being of the great religions .
Jesus did not die on a cross in order to teach us to help old ladies across the street .
The Jewish milieu in which he was raised already knew that .
And as the Dalai Lama points out , so did the rest of the world ’s religions .
Jesus came , according to most Christian thinkers , to stamp out sin and pave the path to salvation .
Similarly , the Buddha did not sit down under a
Bo tree in India in order to teach us not to kill our brothers .
The Hindu milieu in which he was raised already knew that too .
He came , according to most Buddhist thinkers , to stamp out suffering and pave the path to nirvana .
As I argue in my new book , " God is Not One : The Eight Rival Religions That Run the World — and Why Their Differences Matter , " religion is an immensely powerful force both personally and politically .
So if we want to understand the world we must understand the world 's religions .
This includes reckoning with both similarities and differences , and with the capacity of each of the great religions to do both good and evil .
I know that when it comes to the Dalai Lama we are all supposed to bow and scrape .
So I am happy to applaud his project to find “ common ground ” across the world ’s religions .
But I also know that the Buddha said to worship no man .
And I cannot agree with the Dalai Lama ’s claim that “ the essential message of all religions is very much the same . ”
The Dalai Lama was doubtless naïve when , as a boy , and before learning about other religions , he arrived at the conclusion that only his religion was true .
But it is no advance out of innocence to make the equally fantastic claim that all the religions are at heart vehicles for compassion .
If we are to build a world of interreligious harmony , or even a world of interreligious détente , it will have to be constructed on a foundation of adult experience rather than youthful naivete .

Ad campaign seeks to derail US net plan
By Maggie Shiels
Technology reporter , BBC News , Silicon Valley
The US plans to connect its population A $ 1.4 million TV advertising blitz has been launched across the US in an attempt to derail efforts to increase regulation of broadband services .
The ads claim " Washington wants to spend billions to take over the internet " and urges the public to help stop the " Washington takeover " .
The campaign is a response to new " net - neutrality " rules that require cable firms to treat all net traffic equally .
The rules are part of plans to bring high speed net access to every citizen .
" This is a naked power grab , " Phil Kergen of Americans for Prosperity told BBC News .
He described the new rules as an " aggressive regulatory approach " .
" The FCC wants to reduce the internet to an old - fashioned government - regulated utility , " he said .
Some of the other groups involved included the National Taxpayers Union , Free State Foundation and the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council .
Market failure
The regulation was introduced by the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) following a high - profile spat with cable firm Comcast .
A court ruled that the regulator did not have the power to sanction the firm for selectively slowing down the connections of subscribers who downloaded large files .
Rule changes for net access in US Advocacy groups said that the ruling threatened net neutrality as well as putting plans to provide every American citizen with access to high speed internet in " legal limbo " .
Last week the FCC said it would reclassify broadband services from an information service to a telecommunications service .
For cable companies and internet service providers this means moving from a light - touch regulatory system to a more hands on one .
Commission chairman Julius Genachowski said the reclassification is needed for it to pass formal net neutrality rules and to implement parts of its national broadband plan , released in March .
Meanwhile one lawmaker is seeking to strip the FCC of its power to regulate internet access services without evidence of a market failure .
" I see no reason for internet regulation , " said Republican Representative Cliff Stearns who is also a senior member of the Communications , Technology and Internet subcommittee .
" If there is ever a cause for regulation , it is a decision to be made by Congress - not the FCC . "
In October , Senator John McCain , an Arizona Republican , and Representative Marsha Blackburn , a Tennessee Republican , introduced bills to prohibit the FCC from creating formal net neutrality rules , after the agency launched a rule - making process to do so .
Both bills have gone nowhere ' Misinformation '
As the advertising strategy was announced , advocacy group and net neutrality supporters Free Press hosted a day - long forum on media reform .
At the event , FCC member Mignon Clyburn , a Democrat , hit out at " misinformation " efforts by groups opposed to the FCC 's course of action .
" An unfortunate reality is that having an open forum with reasonable and honest debate in this sphere appears unlikely , " said Ms Clyburn .
" Instead , the lobbying machine for some extremely powerful interests has already been churning out quote - worthy lines at a rapid rate .
We are merely looking to preserve the authority that almost everyone assumed we had ... prior to the court 's decision . "
The voice - over internet telephone service Skype , with over 560 million users , is a supporter of the FCC 's attempts to shore up its power to oversee broadband services .
" We do n't see this as about regulating the internet .
It is just making sure that people who control the on-ramp to the internet provide fair and balanced access , " Josh Silverman , Skype 's chief executive officer told the BBC .
" The right answer is for Congress to mandate and give the FCC the appropriate authority .
Providing open access to content is a fundamental principle of the internet , " he said .

Fast car fast = meh .
Sure , a Russian mobster with money oozing from his pores can get a fast ride .
Not impressed .
A couple mill on the barrelhead buys you a Veyron .
Okay , fine .
You tweaked the stock market in your day trading hobby long enough to afford something nice .
Now show me a backyard mechanic working over a couple of years who 's bolted together a big block 460 in his Torino GT with blowers , big sticky meats and a few other tricks .
Will it go as quick around corners , not a chance - but nobody expects anything from it , either .
Do n't get me wrong .
The Veyron is an awesome automobile and worthy of praise .
Same with the GT-R .
But they reflect nothing on the owner or driver , except to say , there 's a guy with a nice car .
I might envy him , a little .
The mechanic wins my respect .
The other guys wo n't get that , not just for driving around .
Madeline Leonard ’s nightmare with an area Mazda dealership , who charged her an eye - popping $ 25,000 more than a car was worth , appears to have drawn to a close .
The dealer promised Friday night to tear up the Orangeville woman ’s contract , reimburse all payments and apologize to her .
Earlier in the day he fired two senior employees for their conduct in the sale of the 2010 Mazda6 G6 sedan .
“ I will do whatever it takes to make this woman happy , ” said Sonny Bains , owner of Mazda of Orangeville , although he stopped short of offering Leonard a new car for her troubles .
“ I do n’t want her to be short one penny out of her pocket . ”
On Friday , the Star reported that Leonard arrived at the Mazda dealership last December to replace her tires .
She drove away the unexpected owner of a car whose price had been massively overinflated .
“ I ’m very excited and almost totally relieved , ” she said Friday night .
“ It has been very stressful . ”
Leonard , 56 , who is intellectually disabled , said she had never intended to buy a car or trade in her other Mazda , but the salesman talked fast , confusing her with numbers , and she signed a deal .
A few days later , after doing some homework , she complained to the Ontario Motor Vehicle Industry Council , which regulates new and used car dealers .
“ I felt manipulated and cheated , ” she said .
The regulator ’s investigation revealed that Leonard actually paid a whopping $ 66,000 for the car , including taxes and the value of a trade - in vehicle .
The car should have cost $ 41,000 or less .
Bains promises to reimburse Leonard $ 8,000 the dealership paid for her trade - in once Leonard returns the car .
Investigator Carrey Smith said the dealership had actually sold Leonard a “ demonstrator ” model , which dealers use for test driving .
As well , add - on items had been sold three times what they should cost .
The dealership had also saddled her with an eight - year loan and heavy financing costs .
Leonard , who is unemployed and lives on a disability pension in a subsidized apartment , should have never qualified for the loan , Smith said .
Last week , the regulator charged the dealership , business manager Kien Trung and sales manager Mohammed “ Moe ” Shaikh with “ engaging in unfair practice by making an unconscionable representation ” contrary to the provincial Consumer Protection Act .
In an interview on Thursday , Trung said he did n’t do anything wrong and “ made a little bit of money on the deal . ”
Bains said he could not discuss the reasons for the abrupt dismissals of the salesmen because the case is before the courts .
The defendants are to appear in court next week .
“ In my opinion , everyone thinks we did something wrong , ” Bains said .
“ Therefore , I ’m going to fix the situation .
I do apologize for what she went through and suffered . ’’

If found guilty , the dealership could face a maximum penalty of $ 250,000 .
The salesmen could receive fines of $ 100,000 each and / or two years less a day in jail .
The regulator could also revoke their registrations to sell vehicles .
The Better Business Bureau of Mid-Western and Central Ontario has issued a D+ rating for the dealership , on a scale of A to F , after receiving complaints .
Conan O'Brien is heading to Minneapolis later this month where he will fundraise for former SNL colleague Al Franken -- the second time in recent weeks that SNL alumni have come out to raise money for the senator .
The reception and dinner with O'Brien will be held at a private home in Minneapolis on May 17th , according to an invitation .
It comes on the heels of a Los Angeles fundraiser for Franken hosted by Dan Aykroyd last week , featuring SNL alums Kevin Nealon and Dana Carvey .
Franken also brought SNL cast member Seth Meyers to Minneapolis in March for a fundraiser .
Guests must give a minimum of $ 500 to attend the reception with O'Brien , who is gearing up for his new television show on TBS this fall .
" Diehard Activists " can donate $ 4,800 to attend the dinner and have their photo taken with Conan and Franken , according to the invite .
The event will be hosted at the Mount Curve Ave. home of Gloria Finley and Robert Levine .
Levine contributed to Franken 's campaign and is employed as a real estate developer , according to Federal Election Commission records .
Proceeds will go to Franken 's joint fundraising political action committee , " Franken MVPs , " which directs the funds to both his campaign committee and leadership PAC .
The leadership PAC will likely use the money to support Democratic candidates in this fall 's mid-term elections .
The events mark a departure from Franken 's Senate campaign , when the former comedian largely dowplayed his SNL connections .
Pauline Kwang wanted to scream Friday after she saw what was left of the southeast Houston church where she has worshipped for 20 years .
An arsonist late Thursday torched the Community of the Servant - Savior Presbyterian Church .
On Friday , all that remained was charred wood and brick that had been pushed into piles and surrounded by a long stream of safety tape after the last sections of the ruined building were leveled .
“ It 's an empty feeling , ” Kwang said .
“ It 's like you 're losing someone you really love . ”
The fire was intentionally set , said Patrick Trahan , a spokesman for the Houston Fire Department , but authorities have not determined the motive or found a suspect .
More than 100 firefighters battled the blaze , which broke out about 11 p.m. Thursday at the church at 11303 Hughes .
The arsonist apparently set off the fire in a breezeway near the middle of the church .
“ It started there and spread very quickly in both directions , ” Trahan said .
The intense fire was brought under control in about an hour .
A section of a wall fell on an electrical worker who was cutting off power to the building , injuring his leg , Trahan said .
Church elder Jerry Beetz was among a handful of members who came by on Friday to console each other , shed a few tears and plan the next step for the congregation .
“ This was our house .
This is where we came together , ” Beetz said .
Beetz learned about the fire early Friday after noticing that he had missed a late - night call on his cell phone from another church member .
“ He was saying , ‘ The building is fully involved in flames .
It 's going to the ground , ' ” Beetz said .
“ I thought , ‘ Good Lord .
Did I hear him right ? ' ”
The heavy percentage of wood in the structure , which is believed to be about 40 years old , caused the fire to burn extremely hot , HFD officials said .
“ They had to water down the fire trucks while they were putting water on the fire , ” Trahan said .
Page Rander joined the church about 13 years ago when she moved to Houston .
Because her relatives were back on the East Coast , the congregation provided her with a much - needed sense of belonging .
“ I knew that I could spend Thanksgiving with family here at this church , ” Rander said .
“ I never felt uncomfortable or unwelcome . ”
Church members pride themselves on their inclusiveness .
Their Web site said they welcome people of any nationality , race , sexual orientation or religious affiliation .
“ No one was going to be judged for anything they 've done wrong in their past or how they live their lives or what color their skin is , ” Rander said .
Although they are occasionally sent critical mail and , more commonly , conservative tracts , Beetz said he can't recall any major problems because of the church 's progressive position on controversial issues .
“ They do n't bother us .
They do n't threaten us — other than sending us literature by the bale , ” Beetz said .
Services on Sunday will be held on the grounds .
The building was insured and members expressed confidence that it will rise again .
“ The old church is gone , ” Kwang said , “ but the new one is coming . ”

Peter Orszag becomes the first Obama official to depart the administration .
| John Shinkle / POLITICO
Orszag to bail next month
White House budget director Peter Orszag plans to leave government in July , becoming the first member of President Barack Obama ’s Cabinet to depart , administration officials said Monday .
Orszag is likely to join a think tank , colleagues said .
Presidential advisers say a possible successor as director of the Office of Management and Budget is Rob Nabors , who was Orszag 's deputy and went over to the Chief of Staff ’s office to be a senior adviser to Rahm Emanuel .
Nabors now he attends the 7:30 a.m. senior staff meeting and insiders say his stock never dropped , but only gained in value .

Two other possible replacements each served as chief economic adviser to President Bill Clinton : Laura D’Andrea Tyson of the University of California at Berkeley , named by Obama as a member of the President ’s Economic Recovery Advisory Board ; and Gene Sperling , now a counselor to Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner .
Tyson would provide the economic team with an effective spokesperson on television .
And she ’d add gender diversity at the top of the administration , especially if Christina Romer , chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers , becomes president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco , as expected .
Obama has nominated the current president , Janet Yellen , as the Fed ’s vice chair .
An outsider is unlikely to get the job , the officials said .
One possibility would be Robert Greenstein , director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities .
Jack Lew , Deputy Secretary of State for Management and Resources , was also mentioned , but held the job under Clinton , and so is considered unlikely to want to go back .
Officials have said for some time that Orszag was trying to decide between leaving this summer and early next year , after the next budget is released .
“ He went back and forth and could n’t quite commit , ” said a senior colleague .
Top aides had pressed him for a decision , and he decided on sooner rather than later , the officials said .
Hans Nichols of Bloomberg News first reported the planned departure .
Orszag , 41 , is to be married in September to Bianna Golodryga , now co-anchor of the " Good Morning America ” weekend edition , as well as ABC News ' business correspondent .
The pair was engaged in December , adding to the unlikely celebrity of the wonky Orszag .
Tyson served in the Clinton administration from January 1993 to December 1996 , first as chairman of the President 's Council of Economic Advisors , then as chairman of his National Economic Council .
Sperling , her successor as chief economic adviser , served all eight years in the Clinton administration .
Tyson is now Berkeley ’s S.K. and Angela Chan Professor of Global Management at the Haas School of Business .
Orszag has two signature accomplishments : the stimulus bill and health reform , which he advocated from the beginning of the administration .
That ’s on top of two budgets :
The first was deemed “ historic ” by pundits ( “ Obama , Breaking ' From a Troubled Past , ' Seeks a Budget to Reshape U.S. Priorities , " said the New York Times banner headline in February 2009 ) .
The second was considered tough by administration insiders because it included a freeze on non-security , discretionary spending .

There are a few neat ones over there , but this one is the best of the bunch .
It looks up toward the tops of buildings to see the shapes — letters — formed by sky peeking in .
Brilliant .
It ’s hard to make a fun game set in the Wild West .
The guns are inaccurate , there ’s no body armor and your method of transportation needs to be fed and groomed .
Luckily for us , Red Dead Redemption is a Western in motif only , sporting pinpoint accurate guns , enemies of scaling toughness and super horses .
This is the company that made the Manhunt series and Grand Theft Auto .
When did Rockstar suddenly grow a conscience ?
That ’s not a criticism ; I can only imagine how terrible this game would be if I had to euthanize my horse every time it ran over a wayward gopher hole .
The old west is a terrible place full of disease , hardship and no plumbing .
Rockstar did a good job of focusing on the fun , romantic aspects of the gunslinger experience .
You ’re a former gang member , John Marston , who turned a new leaf and is now being forced to hunt down your old gang by the government in a contract which I assume is the early form of a plea bargain but is still known in this time as blackmail .
You accomplish this by making friends with the locals doing ranching jobs and making enemies with the crooks by shooting them .
You can reverse that if you like but I do n’t recommend it as all the law men appear to have secretly invented Kevlar .
The process of shooting bad guys involves eyeballing them toward the center of your screen , hitting the aim and fire buttons and letting the auto - aim do the rest .
Rest assured you ’ll always hit everything up to and including a moving sparrow a quarter mile away because the auto - aim is as forgiving as a Canadian therapist .
In the event that you ’re riding your horse and ca n’t get behind cover , you can just use Dead - Eye , the new name for the bullet time mode which is now officially the second most common feature in shooters after guns .
The auto - aim does tend to make fights boring after a while , but oddly it simulates actual shooting better than most console shooter mechanics .
In reality you do n’t have a crosshair in the middle of your eye or a lot of time to line up your shot , so the process involves eyeballing a target , then pointing your gun and firing .
So despite every fight being insultingly easy , it manages to stay immersive .
However , the apparently instantaneous ability of Wild West weapons to reload and cock themselves takes away most of the reasons to upgrade your weapons .
Having cared only about damage and clip size , I never found any reason to spend money at a store for new guns when the plotline missions provide you with everything you ’ll ever need .
Riding from place to place is as boring as any other sandbox shooter , as is doing repetitive side quests .
The NPCs even seem to be a little annoyed by how far apart the cities are as whenever one of them is riding along with you for a quest they talk about every meaningless topic which crosses their mind .
While the voice actors do their best , the writing tends to stretch when the rides frequently pass the five minute mark .
John Marston even uses the time to make a lot of broad insightful political statements like “ there wo n’t be any peace so long as there ’s guns and gold . ”
Excuse me ; this is the company that made the Manhunt series and Grand Theft Auto .
When did Rockstar suddenly grow a conscience ?
I guess that ’s where the “ redemption ” part comes in .
Wandering around in the wilderness might not be exciting at all if it were n’t for the constant threat of cougars .
Cougars in this context are sort of a reverse Schrödinger ’s cat .
John Marston ’s state of being either alive or dead is a probability function whose outcome is determined upon being observed by a cougar .
The plotline meanders , or should I say moseys , around more than a drunken horse .
What starts as a pretty clear manhunt turns into saving a con artist , a grave robber and a drunk from every scrap of trouble they get into , without ever making a ‘ salesman , a drunk and a grave robber walk into a saloon ’ joke .
Eventually you ’ll be fighting a revolution in Mexico , followed by some good old fashioned cowboys versus Indians which somehow involves a sequence wherein you ride a tank through what looks like a Civil War reenactment .
When the entire gamut of Wild West stereotypes has been filled and you ’ve saved your loved ones and killed all the bad guys , the game does n’t even have the good sense to end .
There ’s a reason stories tend to say “ happily ever after ” rather than saying “ wait , wait , but you wo n’t fully appreciate the hero ’s struggle if I do n’t go on for five hours about how idyllic his life is afterward . ”
Literally , this section entails you going through all the tutorials you did in the beginning of the game as the teacher , instead of the student , for your wife and son .
Yeah the action eventually picks back up again and the hero must save the day once more , but that ’s what ’s supposed to be known in the writers department as “ the sequel . ”
The graphics are better than any other sandbox game , which is quite a statement for Rockstar .
It helps that the atmospheric dry heat of the western setting lets you insert blur effects on every draw distance over twenty feet .
As usual for Rockstar , the voice acting is terrific .
Unusually for Rockstar , so is the lip syncing .
If you want to roam around doing whatever you please , sort of the definition of a sandbox game , the online multiplayer is a welcome addition .
You create a new character and ride around with friends or strangers robbing bandits or businessmen and doing whatever your black little heart desires free of limitations like plotlines and long term consequences .
The game encourages you to do its side quests by making most of the story line inaccessible at night .
Ways to pass the time involve camping , hunting or playing games of gambling against the computer .
Let me just say that if you have a gambling problem , specifically with Poker or Liar ’s Dice , and your family has asked you to end your addiction , by all means play this game .
Nothing kills the fun in a bluffing game faster than trying to read the poker face of a computer with no face and no eyes .
I ca n’t say enough good things about Red Dead Redemption .
No seriously , I can ’t ; I want to call it good and justify all the fun I had playing it , but I ’m not sure where the fun came from .
Other than good acting and graphics it really did n’t have much to offer .
But somehow the gun battles and characters keep the plotline interesting for the thirty hours or so it takes to beat it and I guess that ’s what counts .
Well , the first two thirds are interesting , anyway , when you ’re not playing Farmville with your wife .

Man Trapped in Furnace , Amputated Own Arm to Live Following surgery , doctors say Conn. man saved life by severing his arm .
June 11 , 2010  --
Surgeons today grafted muscle tissue onto Jonathan Metz 's shoulder , two days after he amputated his arm with household tools to free himself from his basement furnace .
Metz 's arm had become caught between heating cores inside the boiler on Sunday , Battalion Chief Matthew Stuart of the West Hartford Fire Department told ABC News.com .
Three days later , Metz , 31 , could smell the flesh of his crushed arm beginning to rot , the telltale sign of life - threatening infection .
Floating in and out consciousness , and drinking water leaked from the furnace , Metz made a decision that doctors say saved his life :
He placed a makeshift tourniquet near his left shoulder and , using the tools he had available , began to cut off his arm .
Today 's surgery was the first step in fitting him for prosthesis .
" This morning we went back to reexamine the wound , " Dr. Scott Ellner , the surgeon who operated on Metz at St. Francis Hospital in Hartford , Conn. , told ABCNews.com .
" The area around the wound looked healthy and viable .
He is in very stable condition and is in recovery .
He is awake , talking and appreciative .
He has a very strong sense of what 's going on and understands his situation , " he said .
The surgeon said Metz saved his own life by amputating .
The dying tissue would have caused a deadly infection , he said .
" People wonder how someone could go to that extent and remove his own extremity .
But he saved his life by removing the non-viable part of the extremity .
The wound released toxins that were circulating through the body .
Cutting away that dead tissue saved his life , " he said .
Ellner did not know the tools Metz used to sever his arm , but said the cut " was very clean for someone who had no medical experience .
He was able to preserve blood from leaking . "
A small bit of fat and likely a nerve were all that prevented Metz from fully amputating the arm , Ellner said .
Metz , who lived alone , was rescued Wednesday after a friend , Luca DiGregorio , grew worried when Metz did not show up for work and missed a Tuesday night softball game .
Metz did not answer the doorbell when DiGregorio stopped at his home Wednesday , but he said he saw Metz 's beagle " yipping at the back door . "
DiGregorio called police , who found Metz in the basement .
" I was a little worried , especially when the first cop showed up , " DiGregorio told reporters .
" Then more showed up , and then the ambulance showed up , so it got a little nerve - racking . "
Firefighters used a spreader , normally used to tear apart cars with people trapped inside to remove Metz from the furnace .
" We used the spreader normally used to tear a car apart .
It was pretty old boiler and this particular unit was very strong .
We had to cut a support rod inside the boiler and spread apart the two halves , breaking the cast iron in order to extricate the arm from unit , " Stuart said .
After he was free from the furnace , Metz was taken to the hospital , he said .
Metz 's family lives in North Carolina and did return calls left by ABCNews.com .
Neighbors described him to the Associated Press as a quiet and friendly man who helped them shovel their driveways after snowstorms .
Metz case recalls that of hiker Aron Ralston , who cut off his arm with a dull knife after becoming trapped under a boulder in a remote Utah canyon in 2003 .
First some positive news .
It seems the authorities in one country have decided that accusations of raping children deserve a proper investigation .
Belgian prosecutors this week raided the headquarters of the Belgian Catholic Church as part of their investigation into child sex abuse claims , as reported by the BBC in Belgian Catholic offices raided in sex abuse probe :
Brussels prosecutors were looking for material relating to allegations of sex abuse , a spokesman for the prosecutors ' office said .
" This is a case that the Brussels prosecutors ' office received recently , containing a statement of facts in relation to alleged sexual abuse of minors by a number of people within the Church , " said Jean - Marc Meilleur .
" The object of the searches is to verify the declaration and eventually gather evidence about these declarations . "
Finally , the prosecution body of one country at least has decided that professing belief in a magic invisible sky fairy does n’t mean that you can rape children without the possibility of being prosecuted .
Better late than never .
Let ’s hope that other countries now follow suit .
Regular criminals , when investigated , usually profess innocence at this point , as they are entitled to do .
The Vatican though , sings a different tune .
They are shocked , shocked I tell you , that the authorities dare to treat the church as though they did n’t have a special exemption to the rules that affect everyone else .
You just knew this was coming : Vatican ' indignant ' over Belgium police raids
The Vatican has expressed shock at raids , including the " violation " of a cathedral crypt , by Belgian police investigating alleged child sex abuse .
Get that ?
the Vatican is shocked , not that its priests would rape children , but that the authorities would dare to investigate such alleged crimes .
Shocked , not that children were violated , but that a bleeding crypt if you please was violated .
It gets better :
The Vatican has summoned the Belgian ambassador to the Holy See to voice anger over Thursday 's raids .
I hope the Belgian ambassador told them to go to hell .
And just when you thought they could n’t get any more hyperbolic , one of their men in dresses tells us Belgium raids ' worse than Communist era '
The Vatican has stepped up its criticism of raids by Belgian police investigating alleged child sex abuse , calling the detention of priests " serious and unbelievable " .
Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone , the Vatican Secretary of State , said " there are no precedents , not even under the old communist regimes " .
He goes on to claim that the priests were held for nine hours without food or drink , which if true would be wrong .
The accused deserve to be treated according to the law , which should include the rights to food and drink , not to mention a lawyer .
But there are “ no precedents ” for this ?
“ Not even under the old communist regimes ” ?
Doubtful .
I think what he means is that there are “ no precedents ” for treating the Catholic Church just like any other body that is accused of breaking the law .
Which may well be true .
And it ’s about time such a precedent was set .
A jury Tuesday found the AWARE Inc. domestic violence program coordinator guilty of felonious assault for threatening her husband with a hammer .
Jurors deliberated about two hours and came to a conclusion shortly before 5 p.m. , Oakland County Prosecutor Jessica Cooper said .
Oakland County Circuit Judge Martha Anderson is to sentence LaDonna Glenn , 46 , on June 21 .
Glenn , who has a leadership position at the largely state - funded Jackson agency , faces a maximum penalty of four years in prison and a $ 2,000 fine .
She was accused of going Sept. 24 to her and her husband ’s condominium in Southfield , beating on the door with a hammer and twice raising the tool at her husband , George Glenn , 69 , whom she alleged was unfaithful .
Efforts Tuesday to reach Glenn or her husband were unsuccessful .
Her lawyer , Andrea Fanning , said little when reached by phone .
“ The jury has spoken , ” Fanning said .
She did not return a call seeking further comment .
Rebecca Filip , executive director of AWARE , which provides services and support to sexual assault and domestic violence victims , and board President Bree Thurlby did not respond to messages left at their offices about 5 p.m. Tuesday .
When asked about Glenn , her employment or the charge against her , both women previously have declined comment .
“ AWARE cannot comment on the exact circumstances surrounding an employee matter due to employee confidentiality and the law , ” according to a letter submitted by the board last week to the Citizen Patriot .
“ When the legal process is complete , the board determines what action it must take as an employer on a case - by - case basis .
Issues involving AWARE ’s employees are addressed pursuant to the agency ’s policies and procedures .
The board fully supports its executive director and all employees . ”
Another AWARE employee , Sade Gant , 24 , recently pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor charge of maintaining a drug house .
She is to be sentenced June 17 in Jackson County Circuit Court .
LaDonna Glenn was arrested after George Glenn told police he had to grab his wife ’s hands and wrestle her to the floor to remove the hammer from her grip , according to a Southfield Police Department report .
She had been hitting a glass table with it and calling her husband a cheater .
When officers , who were summoned by a neighbor , arrived at the home , George Glenn was sitting on LaDonna Glenn as she lay on her stomach , pinning down her hands at the wrist , according to the report .
LaDonna Glenn told officers her husband forced her into the living room and threw her to the ground , hurting her right knee .
She went to a hospital before going to jail .
She is out of jail on bond .
She has a Blackman Township address , according to court records , but Southfield police referred to the address in Oakland County as her and her husband ’s home .
In the Jackson area , Glenn has spoken publicly about domestic violence issues and participated in efforts to prevent it or educate others about its effects .
Despite what the ads show you , Cargo is not your typical space - station horror movie .
It 's Switzerland 's first large scale science fiction film , and it's one that showcases enough smarts and skill that it ranks among scifi cinema 's best .
Advertisement
Cargo is a much grander work than the Alien clone it looks like in trailers , blending classic scifi ideas about the destiny of humanity with massive visual scope and confident direction from first - time feature directors Ivan Engler and Ralph Etter .
In all honestly I was completely taken aback when the first act of Cargo started to play .
I knew Engler 's budget was a mere fraction of what Neil Blompkamp had for District 9 and even less than Duncan Jones had for Moon , so where were all these massive Blade Runner by way of anime shots coming from ?
I expected the film to be peppered with the odd establishing shot here and there to give the illusion of scope beyond the frame , but in Cargo epic shots keep coming and coming and coming .
And just when you think the film can't get any bigger , Engler and Etter set their entire 15 minute climax in space , outside a HUGE space station .
And the VFX shots are truly staggering , competing with anything coming out of Hollywood .
You can see the production crew 's sleepless nights up on the screen and it is this kind of sheer ambition that makes Cargo such a rewarding viewing experience .
Advertisement
So , if Cargo is n't a monster movie , or really even a horror movie , then what 's it all about ?
It feels more like a mystery than a straight up thriller .
There are certainly moments of eerie suspense and a couple of decent action beats , but it never truly crosses over into " scary movie " territory .
Some viewers might consider this a flaw in the film , but I think the Cargo crew would rather have this film lumped into the " smart scifi " genre and so the film plays more like Blade Runner , Solaris , Soylent Green , Moon or Sunshine than Event Horizon or Alien .
Essentially , the human race is in a bad way .
The earth is dying and quickly becoming uninhabitable .
Massive space stations the size of multiple cities are orbiting the earth , but even these can't accommodate earth 's refugees .
Disease , pollution and a new terrorist group is quickly making life on the stations unbearable .
Those lucky enough to be rich or win the travel lottery , are able to find passage to RHEA , a new colony set up on another planet .
Otherwise space travel is just too long and too expensive for everyone to go .
No " light speed " here , folks .
Enter Cargo 's protagonist , Laura Portmann ( Anna - Katharina Schwabroh ) , a doctor who takes a position on an eight - year cargo mission delivering building materials to the unmanned " Station 42 " to make enough money to go to RHEA and reunite with her sister .
Most of her time on the mission will be spent in cryosleep , but each crew member is required to spend a certain amount of time awake to make sure the piece of crap ship stays together during the mission .
Advertisement
Three and a half years into the mission it is Laura 's turn to live alone on the freaky space freighter and weird stuff starts happening .
Eventually there is a malfunction in the cargo hold and Laura wakes the other members up to investigate .
When they realize that the malfunction was sabotage , they begin to discover that their cargo is part of a major conspiracy to control the human population by whatever means necessary ( do n't worry , Soylent Green is n't people here , gang ) and that someone is willing to kill to keep it hidden .
Advertisement
Cargo is a classic dystopian epic .
It nails the look and feel of a world that 's falling apart at the seams .
It 's certainly gritty and realistic .
The ship is a piece of crap where stuff 's always breaking down .
Space travel is long , boring , expensive and hella cold and the crew loves to complain about it .
In fact it 's so cold that there 's even snow in the the cargo hold .
Technology in the Cargo world seems to be extremely advanced , and we see a lot of gadgets and body manipulations throughout the film .
Unlike other scifi films which tend to gloss over the issue of light years , Cargo gives us realism :
Even though you can send electronic messages to other stations or planets , it takes years to get a message in return .
Advertisement
At the center of the film is the ship 's cargo hanger , so large it's like another world - metallic and deadly - where " railings do n't exist " ( a space opera pre-requisite once uttered by George Lucas ) .
Entering the hanger is strictly prohibited and when the crew goes in you can see why .
It 's pretty darn treacherous making your way through the maze of moving house - sized containers .
Two of the film 's most unique sequences take place in the hanger and the execution is simply great .
I wanted to make sure to mention the film 's score , because it 's Fredrik Strömberg 's first time out of the gate and it 's simply astounding .
Haunting , beautiful and sumptuous , it marries the film 's visuals and really elevates Cargo to a classic status .
Advertisement
But of course , as no film is perfect ...
I 've seen Cargo three times now and despite how much I love the film for it 's story , acting , production design , music and cinematography , I think that Engler and Etter could have cranked up the horror factor a bit to give the film a more immediate sense of peril .
There are a couple of kills in the film , but because they happen fast and you see none of the violence you do n't feel the threat level rise as much as you should .
That said , I know Engler wrote a few drafts of the film .
One was much more violent , but it was toned down in favour of putting emphasis on the film 's scifi elements .
Since Cargo is n't meant to be a horror film I can see the logic , but still , a little more of the ol ' ultra-violence to turn the screws a little would have made the experience that much more engaging .
Advertisement
Despite this minor quibble , I think Cargo is primed to stun viewers who wo n't be expecting its unique story , confident direction and striking visuals .
I certainly was n't .
The film is definitely in the same league as any of the latest scifi films we 've been loving like Moon or Sleep Dealer and I hope everyone gets a chance to see it .

Cargo was released this year in Europe , and played at the SXSW film festival in the U.S. this month .
No word on when we 'll be able to get it in the U.S .

PASADENA , Calif . —
With his frizzy hair pulled into forward - protruding spikes and his goggle - size glasses , Max Pauson resembles one of the futuristic comic - book characters he admires and draws .
Ebullient and eager to show a sketchbook filled with startling portraits , he seems to have identity to spare .
But this promising art student ’s strong sense of self was hard - earned .
It was forged in an unstable , emotionally wrenching childhood and , in an odd detail that might serve as a metaphor for his struggles , it comes after 19 years of life without a legal name .
His birth certificate read only “ ( baby boy ) Pauson . ”
Name to come .
His father had disappeared .
His mother — in his words , “ a pack rat who takes a really long time to decide on anything ” — did not pick a first name at the hospital in San Francisco in 1990 .
And she never followed up , leaving him in a rare and strange limbo .
While Mr. Pauson was long aware of the blank spot in his identity , he never quite had the time or means to correct it .
He lived with his mother in a house that sometimes lacked electricity .
He spent time in foster care and returned to live with his mother in homeless shelters and in public housing .
Finally , at 15 , he ran away to live with friends ’ families .
Update : Installer now available to the public and it also allows sharing files over the Internet ( Wi - Fi only )
Phones and SmartPhones are social devices by nature ; we can talk , text , email , browse the web , run applications and access our favorite social networks .
Even though SmartPhones are more capable every day the technology world has a fixation on “ cloud ” and “ cloud based social networking ” , it ’s almost as if we ’re forgetting how powerful computers ( and now SmartPhones ) can be used to truly enhance the way we interact with the people around us .
Sharing files can be an issue
For example , record a video from your phone video camera and try sending it to people next to you , if it ’s more than a minute long you wo n’t be able to send it via email because it ’s too large .
You ’ll be forced to upload it to the web — or deal with the nuances and shortcomings of Bluetooth , which is slow and cumbersome to set up .
Now imagine sending that same video to 6 other people in the room .
If social interaction can happen directly between two or more people that ’s the way it should be : phone to phone .
Your messages and data should never have to travel all over the internet if they need to end in another device in the same room .
When you want to share files with the people near you , you should n’t need cables .
You should n’t even need an internet connection .
We think Wi -Fi connectivity and FrostWire is all you should ever need on your phone .
FrostWire for Android allows multiple Android users connected to a Wi -Fi network to Chat and Share Files at very high speeds in a peer to peer fashion , no third parties involved
Update :
By popular demand FrostWire now goes beyond the local Wi -Fi network by allowing users in different Wi-Fi networks to connect through the Internet .
With FrostWire for Android you ’ll now be able to do things you could not do before :
Schools
Teachers and students can chat and share class related material like documents , notes and rich media .
Teachers are always looking for ways to engage with students and FrostWire will be a great opportunity to connect to your class .
Conferences
Speakers will now be able to deliver presentation slides and related material straight from their Android device to all the attendees , who can in turn help seed the content .

Data Exchange without censorship
In countries like China and Iran where there are strict controls over the internet , true peer to peer applications on Wi-Fi networks can provide a safe way to exchange information .
What FrostWire for Android IS
FrostWire for Android is Peer to Peer client that allows chatting , browsing , searching , and transfering files between Android devices either locally ( on the same Wi - Fi network ) or over the Internet ( if the Wi - Fi network is internet enabled )
It implements a new p2 p protocol meant for WiFi networks and mobile devices , keeping in consideration things like battery life , packet de-congestion on the WiFi hotspot .
The name of this protocol is MetaFrost , we will release all the specifications once it ’s matured enough for the Open Source community to implement compatible clients .
In our tests we ’ve been able to transfer files at average data rates of up to 1.2 Mb/s , the closer to the Wi-Fi hotspot you are the faster the transfer will be .
Tight integration with the desktop version is coming soon , and as of now it ’s free .

What FrostWire for Android IS NOT
FrostWire for Android is not a BitTorrent or Gnutella client .
Why ?
Because the wireless carriers can barely deliver your emails and web pages at this point .
Also because you would be breaking your wireless carrier contract if you did P2P networking on their infrastructure .
Connectivity is not very reliable on 3G / EDGE and your phone will do more harm than good to the health of the existing internet P2P networks ( by just leeching intermittently ) and not to mention the limitations of space and battery that we still face on mobile devices .
Mark your Turf
FrostWire for Android will more fun if you have some friends around you .
If you find an Open Wi-Fi network with lots of people to connect to it will make sense marking your territory , we think the best way to mark your territory will be with FrostWire Stickers

Police And Courts Regularly Abusing Wiretapping Laws To Arrest People For Filming Cops Misbehaving In Public Places
from the to - protect - and - serve ?
dept
The courts , however , disagree .
A few weeks ago , an Illinois judge rejected a motion to dismiss an eavesdropping charge against Christopher Drew , who recorded his own arrest for selling one - dollar artwork on the streets of Chicago .
Although the misdemeanor charges of not having a peddler 's license and peddling in a prohibited area were dropped , Drew is being prosecuted for illegal recording , a Class I felony punishable by 4 to 15 years in prison .
In 2001 , when Michael Hyde was arrested for criminally violating the state 's electronic surveillance law -- aka recording a police encounter -- the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court upheld his conviction 4 - 2 .
In dissent , Chief Justice Margaret Marshall stated , " Citizens have a particularly important role to play when the official conduct at issue is that of the police .
Their role cannot be performed if citizens must fear criminal reprisals .... "
( Note : In some states it is the audio alone that makes the recording illegal . )
The selection of " shooters " targeted for prosecution do , indeed , suggest a pattern of either reprisal or an attempt to intimidate .

Back in April , we wrote about the case of a motorcyclist in Maryland who was wearing a helmet - mounted camera while riding his motorcycle ( admittedly , above the speed limit ) .
As he stopped at a traffic light , an off - duty police - officer in plain clothes and an unmarked car jumped out of his car with his gun drawn .
All of this was caught on video .
No matter what you think of the cop 's reaction , what happened later is ridiculous : after the biker , Anthony John Graber III , posted the video from his helmet cam to YouTube , he was arrested for illegal wiretapping , based on Maryland 's two - party consent rule for recording .
As we explained at the time , wiretapping laws that require all parties to consent were not , at all , designed for this type of situation .
However , apparently this sort of thing is becoming all too common -- and stunningly , many courts are siding with the cops .
Gizmodo recently had a good article highlighting how police in states that require all parties to consent to recordings have been using this law against being videotaped in public , and the courts are siding with them .
What 's really scary is that most of those laws even have clearly written exceptions for recording in public places " where no expectation of privacy " exists .
Yet , the police and the courts both seem to ignore that part of those laws : That last sentence is the real problem here .
Two - party consent laws were clearly designed to be used in situations where someone was being recorded privately -- such as over a phone call , or in a private conversation .
When police are doing things ( especially questionable activities ) out in public , we should bethe public to record those incidents and report them .
The laws are being abused to try to stop people from whistleblowing on bad behavior by police .
That has nothing to do with the purpose of two - party consent laws .
It 's really scary that the courts did n't immediately throw out these cases .

One year since the Honduran coup
28 June 2010
Today marks the first anniversary of the military coup that ousted the elected president of Honduras , Manuel Zelaya , inaugurating a period of repressive violence against the country ’s working class that continues to this day .
The Obama administration ’s defense of the current regime of President Porfirio Lobo Sosa and its campaign for the normalization of its relations with the hemisphere and the world represents the culmination of Washington ’s tacit backing for the coup .
On June 28 , 2009 , heavily armed troops burst into the presidential palace in Tegucigalpa , marched Zelaya out at gunpoint and bundled him onto a plane bound for exile .
The operation represented the first successful 21st century coup in Latin America , a region where US - backed military dictatorships ruled over country after country during large parts of the 20th century .
The ostensible aim of the coup was to abort a consultative plebiscite organized by Zelaya to gauge popular support for the convening of a constituent assembly to rewrite the country ’s constitution , a regressive charter that was dictated in 1982 by an outgoing military dictatorship and the US embassy .
In justifying the coup , its backers within the Honduran oligarchy accused Zelaya of launching an extra-constitutional power grab for a third presidential term .
This accusation , dutifully repeated by the media in the US , was nonsensical on its face , given that no vote to convene a constituent assembly could be organized before the ballot to choose Zelaya ’s successor .
Both Honduras ’s ruling “ 10 families ” and the Obama administration in Washington had other reasons to seek Zelaya 's overthrow .
The native oligarchy had begun to view Zelaya , himself a wealthy landowner and timber baron , as a traitor because of minimal reforms , such as an increase in the minimum wage , which threatened a slight infringement on fortunes built through its collaboration with the transnational corporations in the super - exploitation of low - wage Honduran labor .
For Washington , Zelaya ’s forging of friendly ties with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in return for cheap oil and credit was seen as a potential threat to US imperialism ’s domination of a region it has long regarded as its “ backyard . ”
This was viewed with particular alarm , given that the largest US military base in all of Latin America is located in Honduras .
Having been forced out of its air base in Manta , Ecuador last year , the prospect of being denied use of the Palmerola facility in Honduras was for the Pentagon strategically unacceptable .
While Obama declared his formal support for Zelaya ’s return to office , his administration refused to take any action against the coup ’s leaders or to condemn their repression against those who opposed it .
The truth is that the ruling class of Honduras , which is dependent upon the US for the overwhelming share of the country ’s investment and trade , would not have taken such a step without a green light from Washington .
Nor would a military that is trained , advised and largely armed by the US have executed it without the Pentagon ’s approval .
One year later , the base at Palmerola is functioning normally — as it did from the day of the coup onward .
Last month , Gen. Douglas Fraser , chief of the US Southern Command , made his first trip to Honduras since the coup , declaring that there are “ many opportunities for cooperation ” with the country ’s military .
Military aid from Washington has resumed .
The financial oligarchy that organized the military overthrow remains firmly in charge of the government of President Lobo .
He was named the victor in a travesty of an election held last November , under conditions of de facto martial law and with more than half the electorate boycotting the vote .
Those who organized the coup and the bloody repression that followed enjoy absolute impunity .
The political leader of the coup regime , Roberto Micheletti , has been named “ congressman for life ” to ensure that he will never lack parliamentary immunity .
The coup ’s military leader , Gen. Romeo Vasquez , has been installed as the head of Hondutel , the Honduran telephone corporation .
The repression continues in an especially brutal form , one that has a long and dark history in Honduras — death squad murders .
Nine journalists have been killed since Lobo took office , making Honduras the most dangerous country in the world to practice that profession .
Also targeted for political assassination are union leaders and others identified with opposition to the June 2009 coup .
Human rights groups have confirmed 14 such killings since Lobo took office .
No one has been arrested for any of these murders , or for any of those committed in the wake of the coup .
Other forms of repression , including arbitrary detentions , beatings , torture and the shutdown of opposition media continue unabated .
The Lobo government , having declared itself bankrupt in February , has embarked upon a series of draconian austerity measures , including regressive tax hikes and a 20 percent across - the - board cut in government spending .
Untouched by these cuts are the country ’s security forces , whose funding has been increased .
These policies are aimed at making the impoverished Honduran masses pay for the crisis created by global capitalism and the costs of suppressing opposition to last year ’s coup .
Conditions of life for Honduran working people , who were already among the poorest in the hemisphere , have only worsened .
According to the Honduran National Institute of Statistics , fully 51 percent of the working - age population is unemployed , with young workers largely locked out of the labor market .
Nearly 60 percent of the population lives in poverty , with over 36 percent subsisting below the extreme poverty line .
Unemployment is being used as a battering ram against the working class , with employers and the government pressing for wage cuts , speedup and the wholesale repeal of labor laws .
One year on , the overriding political lessons of the Honduran coup have clearly emerged .
The first is the debunking of claims that the election of Barack Obama signaled a shift of US foreign policy to “ mutual respect ” and peaceful cooperation internationally , and in Latin America in particular .
The Honduran events , followed by the drive to secure bases in Colombia , the military intervention in Haiti and the stepped - up US support for the drug war in Mexico , have demonstrated that the Obama administration is prepared to use counterrevolutionary violence and military force to reassert Washington ’s domination of the Western Hemisphere .
In the face of American capitalism ’s protracted economic decline , it is turning to these methods to counter the growing challenges posed by the resistance of the Latin American working class , as well as the growing penetration of the region by powerful rivals , including Europe and China .
The second lesson is the bankruptcy of bourgeois nationalism , exemplified by the actions of the ousted Honduran president .
Zelaya worked continuously to subordinate resistance to the coup to his own vain attempts to curry favor with Washington and secure his return to office via a US - brokered settlement with those who overthrew him .
The Honduran events have confirmed once again that it is impossible to successfully oppose imperialist intervention , coups and dictatorship outside of the independent political mobilization of the working class .
While Honduran workers from the outset heroically resisted the coup regime installed last year , their struggles were dissipated and diverted by a leadership tied to the bourgeois Liberal Party , the party of both Zelaya and Micheletti .
The burning necessity in the face of the present crisis gripping Honduras and all of Central America is the building of a new revolutionary political movement of the working class , independent of all bourgeois parties , and armed with a program for the socialist transformation of not only Honduras , but the entire region , as part of the struggle for a United Socialist States of the Americas .

Gov. Jan Brewer
Arizona politicians have accused illegal immigrants of a lot of nasty things over the past few months , but Gov. Jan Brewer threw out a new one Wednesday night on national television .
The Republican governor told Fox News she signed the state ’s new immigration law to prevent , no kidding , beheadings brought on by illegal immigrants .
“ We cannot afford all this illegal immigration and everything that comes with it , ” Brewer told host Greta Van Susteren live from the Arizona desert .
“ Everything from the crime to the drugs and the kidnappings and the extortion and the beheadings . ”
It was one of many grim pictures the governor painted of what she called “ violence , terrible violence ” in Arizona during her national television appearance .
Watch the video below .
The comment comes just after the six - minute mark .
Or read a full transcript of the interview .
If Elena Kagan , President Obama 's nominee to the Supreme Court , is confirmed , the nation 's high court will be , for the first time in its history , devoid of Protestants .
Kagan is Jewish , as are Justices Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg .
All of the other justices — Chief Justice John Roberts , Samuel Alito , Anthony Kennedy , Antonin Scalia , Clarence Thomas , and Sonia Sotomayor — are Catholic .
How did this situation come about in a historically Protestant - dominated country ?
And should evangelicals be concerned ?
It 's important to note that the composition of the Supreme Court has never reflected the composition of the country .
All justices were white until the appointment of Thurgood Marshall in 1967 , and all justices were male until the appointment of Sandra Day O'Connor in 1981 .
When President Andrew Jackson appointed the court 's first Catholic member , Roger Taney , in 1836 , the Roman Catholic Church was already well on its way to becoming the country 's largest single Christian body .
Most justices have also shared connections to a small group of elite schools .
Harvard Law School trained the highest number , 14 justices , including five members of the current court .
( Justice Ginsburg attended HLS but graduated from Columbia . )
Kagan , a graduate and former dean of HLS , would make a sixth .
Throughout the court 's history , some groups — notably Episcopalians , Presbyterians , Unitarians , and Jews — have been significantly overrepresented in comparison to their prevalence in the American population , while other groups have been significantly underrepresented .
Though Baptists constitute the country 's largest Protestant group , there have been just three Baptist justices .
The second - largest Protestant group , Methodists , ...

The Apple - Google zingers at today 's WWDC gathering ( that 's the one where the Apple faithful dress up in robes and dance and sing around trees , right ? ) were actually pretty tame compared to the war of words we 've grown used to over the past few months , and we did n't spot any out - and - out untruths like in previous keynotes .
But there 's one line that we do n't want to let slide .
And that 's the quote from Google co-founder Larry Page regarding multitasking and battery life that Apple CEO Steve Jobs paraded in front of .
It read : " ... software running in the background , that just sort of exhausts the battery quickly . "
That 's coming from a TechRadar piece from a few weeks ago .
What Jobs conveniently left out was the follow - up from Google CEO Eric Schmidt , who said , " And people bring in applications that are not particularly smart about that , which is what Larry is trying to get at . "
Read in context , it makes sense .
Badly coded apps drain battery life .
If you 're going for the cheap shot , well , look up .

A shadowy group presumed to be funded by business interests has spent as much as $ 1.5 million on behalf of conservative Democratic Senator Blanche Lincoln in her attempt to fend off a primary challenge from current Arkansas Lieutenant Governor Bill Halter .
According to the Washington Post ’s Greg Sargent , Americans for Job Security ( AJS ) has spent that amount on two ads accusing Halter of having outsourced American jobs to India when he was on the board of directors of WebMethods , a tech company that opened a Bangalore office in 2004 .
Halter denies that any company on whose board he served has transferred jobs oversees .
ADVERTISEMENT
The Service Employees International Union has now released an ad of its own , mocking AJS for hiring Indian actors to make its racially - tinged ad attacking outsourcing .
“ It was Blanche Lincoln who voted to ship our jobs to Mexico and China , helping corporations and hurting us , ” the SEIU ad charges .
Lincoln has denounced the AJS ads but has no control over the group , which is not required to reveal its funders .
“ It ’s not out of the realm of possibility , ” Sargent writes , “ that this group ’s spending could help decide this Senate primary — without us ever knowing where the money came from , or who the group is even pulling for .
That ’s a pretty big deal . ”
It is unclear whether the intent of the ads is to help Lincoln or to make things easier for a Republican challenger next November , but AJS is well known as a corporate front group that regularly supports conservative Republicans .
In an email exchange with blogger Markos Moulitsas , the US Chamber of Commerce has denied funding the Arkansas attack ads , but it does appear that corporate backers of some sort must be involved .
AJS was created in 1997 as a spinoff from a group founded by the Chamber of Commerce to counteract soft money spending by labor unions .
It played a prominent role in the 2002 elections , when it spent heavily on ads attacking Sen. Paul Wellstone ( D - MN ) in the weeks prior to his death in a plane crash on October 25 .
One day earlier , on October 24 , Salon ’s Joe Conason had written , “ Americans for Job Security [ is ] a mysterious group with ties to the Republican congressional leadership and big business that intervenes in political races around the country , always on behalf of conservatives .
It first gained notoriety a few years ago when Trent Lott , then the Senate majority leader , shook down a group of Washington lobbyists to donate money to the organization , which was helping a Republican senatorial candidate in Michigan .
This year , the same outfit has targeted Minnesota Sen .
Paul Wellstone with radio and TV ads of dubious accuracy .
In fact , AJS is spending a million dollars attacking the Democrat during the weeks leading up to Election Day . ”

“ AJS bills itself for tax and regulatory purposes as a ‘ nonpolitical trade organization , ' ” Conason explained .
“ As such , AJS is forbidden from partisan activity on behalf of a candidate ; legally , it can only run issue - oriented advertising .
But the AJS advertising against Wellstone has gone way over that blurry line . ”
This same behavior led the watchdog group Public Citizen to charge in complaints filed in 2007 with the IRS and the FEC that AJS had violated both its tax status and federal election law .
“ Americans for Job Security is registered under Section 501 ( c ) ( 6 ) of the tax code , the category reserved for business leagues and trade associations , ” an accompanying press release explained .
“ Groups that are registered under this section are prohibited from engaging in efforts to influence elections as their primary purpose .
But AJS , which maintains no Web site and appears to have only one paid employee , spends millions of dollars on advertisements to influence elections without appearing to engage in any other substantive efforts . ”

It appears that the same pattern is now at work in Arkansas in 2010 .
The Grand Conclave of World - Masters is getting closer here in Toronto , as are the protests against them and the police operation against said protests .
Expect the odd post on related subjects .
One interesting event has been the recent firebombing of a bank in Ottawa , with responsibility claimed by the ‘ Fighting for Freedom Coalition ’ , 3 members of whom have apparently been arrested with a bunch of bullets .
The type of those bullets has already been said to be one thing and then reversed by police , and since I know few facts I ’m agnostic about whether the bullets were really found or planted or what .
Naturally this helps legitimise the police in whatever steps they take next week , so they ’re probably glad of the whole affair .
There ’s predictable outrage in some quarters , including the familiar ‘ You ’re no different from al - Qaeda ! ’ line , and I ’ve seen a couple of comments expressing strong condemnation not only of these three individuals but of anyone who denies the legitimacy of state structures per se .
So I thought it might be interesting to take this action as something to consider the ethics of .
Was it wrong , and if so why ?
To clarify the facts as I understand them : the bombing was carried out at night , in an empty bank , so no damage to persons was involved .
The damages are estimated at $ 500,000 .
The costs of the policing operation at the G20 summit has been estimated at $ 1,000,000,000 .
The bank targetted , RBC , is the largest financial sponsor of oil sand extraction in Alberta , which is one of the most environmentally destructive activities going .
It was also heavily involved in sponsoring the 2010 Winter Olympics , and some people had beef with that over land rights and homelessness .
Is this wrong in terms of its overall consequences ?
Well , that depends on many things , e.g. : does it incentivise banks against financing environmentally destructive activities , how does it affect public opinion , how will it influence police tactics , how much will the perpetrators suffer from their punishment , and of course how much are people inconvenienced by having to walk further to their bank ?
All of these are very hard to estimate .
I ’m inclined to think the total probably comes out negative , because the action is so isolated and chaotic that it ’s likely to be more alienating and frightening to most people than it is inspiring or ‘ movement - building ’ .
If it was an action with a weighty social force behind it , accountable to those it claims to represent , etc. then that would be different , but I ’m sceptical of the efficacy of this style of action .
But I could easily be wrong .
But the real point is that this sort of evaluation wo n’t give any very strong judgements .
If the intentions were good , then even if the overall effect is negative that only warrants calling the actions ‘ foolish ’ , ‘ ill - advised ’ , or ‘ unfortunate ’ .
But that does n’t account for the vitriol , and the incarceration , that this group are likely to receive .
So is some stronger sort of condemnation warranted ?
Perhaps it ’s wrong because it carried some small risk of harm to people if the fire somehow spread to other buildings .
But small risks are run constantly – certainly they should be minimised but if we never did anything with that kind of risk we ’d never do anything .
Perhaps it ’s wrong to cause damage to useful things like buildings , in principle ?
But then would n’t it be equally wrong to demolish buildings in order to build something else there ?
Indeed , it would also be wrong to hold onto food long enough for it to go off , or throw it out when it ’s still useful , something I and most supermarkets are guilty of .
Moreover , those useful things have value because of their usefulness to people , so should n’t actions that ‘ destroy ’ usefulness be wrong in the same way ?
This would include disrupting people ’s plans , denying them opportunities , or wasting their time .
These things are probably still wrong , but only in the mild utilitarian way , based on whether they ’re worth it .
Certainly , the lost use - values expended on paying for the G20 security operation would seem to completely swamp the lost use - values from destroying one bank branch – as I said , by roughly a factor of 2,000 .
Maybe the big thing is that you can damage your own stuff , but you should n’t damage that which belongs to other people – in this case , the RBC company owned the branch , and the FFFC did n’t .
But surely their legal ownership is only morally relevant if they have a genuine moral right to own it – and how would they have come by that right ?
They accrued interest on capital , often by means of financial chicanery , and often by means of releasing large quantities of poison into air , land , and water which they certainly did n’t own .
They would n’t even exist if it were n’t for the genocidal conquest of North America .
Why not say that you forfeit your right to not have other damage your property when you damage the property of others ( e.g. by enormously financing climate change ) ?
Or why not say that legal ownership is morally inconsequential in a world where property distributions reflect a long history of war , dictatorship , and oppression ?
Or even just in a world where the economy is controlled primarily by relatively narrow interests , who designed it to uphold their status ?
Or maybe the issue is just that it ’s against the law , whether the law is right or wrong .
This , it seems to me , is the only thing about this action that really distinguishes it from run -of - the - mill possibly - foolish - possibly - not , well - intentioned actions .
Is this a big deal ?
Well , some laws are , of course , very important , such as laws against harm to persons .
But we ’ll only confuse ourselves if we run together all laws and suppose that because laws against murder are important , so too is strict adherence to all laws , even pointless ones .
But consider some quotes :
“ Police reassured the public that they are confident they will be able to meet any threat during next week ’s meetings of world leaders . ” ( not ‘ Police reassured banks that … ’)
“ I firmly believe Ottawa is safer today than yesterday ” ( not ‘ I firmly believe that banks are safer … ’ )
It seems like we ’re encouraged to let our reactions to the event be governed by a symbolic link between ‘ us ’ , bound together by our shared adherence to law , and ‘ RBC ’ , such that attacks on them are also attacks on us .
But does this link rest on any real basis ?
It might rest on ‘ us ’ being united by some sort of similarity ( e.g. ‘ shared values ’ ) – except that there are as many dissimilarities between people in Canada ( or in the world ) as there are similarities .
Or it might rest on shared interests – ‘ we ’re all in this together ’ .
But are we ?
It seems to me that most of us have as many divergent interests from those of RBC as we do shared ones .
Or it might rest on nothing , but be a psychological consequence of some deep - seated emotional attachment to the idea of obedience to law as something that brings safety and happiness .
This might be related to the difficulties in attributing responsibility for collective acheivements , which encourage us to focus on symbolic totems like ‘ law ’ .
Since I ’m inclined to the latter view , I find myself unable to judge this bombing as wrong in a way that goes beyond being possibly counter - productive .
But maybe I ’m wrong , or have missed something .
( Newser ) – A grizzly bear is believed to have killed a hiker near Yellowstone National Park just hours after researchers trapped and tranquilized the animal .
Officials tracked the bear using a signal from a radio collar that had been placed around its neck , shooting it today from a helicopter .
It died about 2 miles from where the body of Erwin Frank Evert was found on Thursday , reports the AP .
His wife set out looking for the 70 - year - old when he did n't return from a noontime hike ; she met one of the bear researchers , and the two went back to the spot where the huge adult male had been left to wake up after it was tranquilized —
Evert 's body was there .
Scientists plan to use DNA testing to confirm that the downed bear was the one who attacked Evert .
In 1983 , a grizzly bear that had been drugged 12 times killed a camper near Yellowstone , causing some to speculate that bears that have been tranquilized may turn aggressive .

With each day that oil fouls the Gulf of Mexico , more drivers are weighing a choice at intersections across the United States : if BP is on the left and some other station is on the right , is filling up at BP an endorsement of the company ’s conduct ?
Advocacy organizations like Public Citizen urge consumers to stay away from BP stations .
About 550,000 Facebook users have clicked the “ Like ” button on the Boycott BP page .
And angry people have picketed at BP stations .
This does n’t send a particularly powerful message to BP , though .
After all , BP owns only a handful of the 11,000 stations that bear its brand and is trying to sell the few still on its books .
So those who wish to inflict the maximum amount of pain on the company are instead putting much of the hurt on the family businesses that actually own the stations .
Just how little does BP gain from its gas stations , besides whatever ancillary marketing benefit it gains from the signs ?
The gas in its pumps may not be extracted , refined or stored by the company and may just get a spritz of BP additives right before it ends up at the service station .
All of this puts a mere handful of coins in the company ’s pocket per fill - up .

Ever since 9/11 , American society has had the self - destructive tendency of primarily seeing jihadist terrorists as monsters intent on devouring our social experiment in human liberty and popular rule .
Rather than listen to what motivates the individual terrorists that have attacked the United States here and abroad , Americans only hear a convenient narrative left over from the Bush years : " They hate our freedoms . "
This belief , however , is nothing more than a collective delusion that continually feeds a foreign policy destructive of our homeland security .
Nothing proves this more than examining the motivations of three men who have punctured Americans ' sense of security over the past year .
In September , federal authorities arrested 25 - year - old Najibullah Zazi who was planning to suicide bomb the New York subway system .
The Afghan immigrant recently pled guilty of conspiring to murder innocent commuters .
According to the New York Times , Zazi rationalised his motive to kill innocents this way : " I would sacrifice myself to bring attention to what the United States military was doing to civilians in Afghanistan by sacrificing my soul for the sake of saving other souls . "
A little more than two months later , Americans were shocked when Major Nidal Malik Hasan , a Muslim army psychiatrist , murdered 13 people – 12 service members and one civilian – at the military base at Fort Hood , Texas .
Much like Zazi , Hasan 's motivation to massacre his fellow comrades seems to have arisen from his horror at US foreign policy , a policy he was entrusted to carry out .
Two years before his crime , Hasan lectured colleagues that American wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were an assault on Islam .
" It 's getting harder and harder for Muslims in the service to morally justify being in a military that seems constantly engaged against fellow Muslims , " Hasan said in a self - fulfilling PowerPoint presentation .
And while Hasan did n't blow himself up at Fort Hood , there seems little doubt that he never intended to walk away from his attack .
And he did n't , an officer 's bullet left him paralysed .
Finally on Christmas Day , 23 - year - old Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , a rich kid from Nigeria , stashed powdered explosives in his underwear and attempted to blow up Northwest Flight 253 on its way to Detroit .
Fortunately he failed .
After his botched attack , National Public Radio investigated why the son of a prominent banker would choose the path of a suicide bomber .
One reason , it seems , was the treatment of Muslim detainees at Gitmo .
NPR's West African correspondent Ofeibea Quist - Arcton said the anger motivating Abdulmutallab was unique in its violence but not in its sentiment .
" I have to say that a lot of people I spoke to in northern Nigeria , if it was n't specifically Guantánamo , were also talking about the fact of US foreign policy , the wars in Iraq , Afghanistan , the Middle East , Palestinian - Israeli crisis , how they felt so personally that the US was attacking not only Muslims , as they felt , but even Nigerian Muslims . "
It 's time for the American people to realise that jihadist suicidal terrorism is n't primarily the product of religious fanaticism , but a logical response to US imperialism .
" The central fact is that overwhelmingly suicide - terrorist attacks are not driven by religion as much as they are by a clear strategic objective : to compel modern democracies to withdraw military forces from the territory that the terrorists view as their homeland , " Robert Papes , the pre-eminent US expert on suicidal terrorists , told The American Conservative Magazine in 2005 .
Religion , according to the author of Dying to Win : The Logic of Suicide Terrorism , only factors into suicide terrorism when the occupying power is of another confession .
Say hello to the US - led invasions and occupations of Afghanistan and Iraq .
The tragedy of it all is that Osama bin Laden bet the United States would take his bait and lash out in revenge and hubris .
By invading and occupying predominantly Muslim countries , undermining the rule of law through preventative detention and torture , and delivering death by drone , the United States proved Bin Laden 's narrative of Christian crusaders and holy war .
This accomplished two necessary goals for al - Qaida : it manufactured more jihadists and it economically and militarily weakened history 's greatest hegemon .
This positive - feedback cycle of imperialism and jihadism leaves Americans poorer , less secure , and more afraid .
But rather than dig for the root , Americans continue to address the sprouts .
Zazi's plot draws Congressional calls for more mass transit security spending .
Hasan 's massacre leads the Pentagon to develop policies to identify and address violent extremism ( pdf ) .
Abdulmutallab's underwear bomb leads to rapid deployment of full body scanners critics call " virtual strip searches " .
Almost nine years after 9/11 , the United States has spent approximately a trillion dollars to fight this global " war on terrorism " as well as hundreds of billions of dollars of escalating expenditures on homeland security .
In return , American taxpayers continue to jeopardise their economic future for an imperium few benefit from and which brings the war to American shores while simultaneously eating up cherished liberties .
The United States , however , has an easy and moral way to rip out the root and make itself more secure and fiscally sound in the process .
It should immediately begin to responsibly draw down its empire by withdrawing from Afghanistan and Iraq , shuttering its worldwide archipelago of military installations , and bringing home its service members .
This will help dampen the allure of the jihadist narrative the likes of Abdulmutallab , Hasan , and Zazi latched onto .
These men were n't born jihadists , they were made jihadists .
The tragic irony is that the United States helped al - Qaida to do it .
And because of that , we spend evermore on security but continue to feel less and less safe .
Image caption Falsone is believed to have had plastic surgery
A top mafia boss and one of Italy 's most wanted men has been arrested in the south of France after a decade on the run , officials said .
Giuseppe Falsone is thought to be the mafia boss for the province of Agrigento in Sicily .
He has already been sentenced to life imprisonment for murder and international drug trafficking .
The 40 - year - old has also been linked to renowned mobster Bernardo Provenzano , who was arrested in 2006 .
He was caught in Marseille and is believed to have had plastic surgery and to have been using false identification .
Police footage showed a small hideaway in the south of France where they say Falsone had been living .
At least 26 people have been killed in clashes in Kyrgyzstan 's second - largest city of Osh , officials say .
More than 400 people were wounded in the fighting , which is reportedly between Kyrgyz and ethnic Uzbek groups .
The cause of the clashes was not immediately clear .
A state of emergency has been declared in the southern city .
Osh is home to a large ethnic Uzbek community and was the power base of former president Kurmanbek Bakiyev , who was overthrown in April .
According to local reports , fighting broke out between rival gangs and developed into gun battles late on Thursday .
The current situation demands self - restraint , wisdom and patience from all of us Roza Otunbayeva , Interim President
In pictures : Kyrgyz unrest
Gangs of young men armed with metal bars and stones attacked shops and set cars alight .
Firefighters tried to put out the flames , but angry youths reportedly threw stones at them .
Local journalists say a group of young men attacked soldiers and took their weapons .
Residents say the shooting continued into Friday morning .
A number of buildings , including cafes , a local TV channel and a theatre , were also said to be on fire .
Many of the injured were being treated for stabbing and gunshot wounds , health ministry spokeswoman Yelena Bailinova told the Associated Press news agency .
Image caption Officials say the shooting has stopped
More than 40 were reported to be in a serious condition .
The interim government , which came to power after Mr Bakiyev 's removal , has been struggling to impose order in the city ever since .
The leaders of Russia and China have appealed for calm .
The political crisis has raised fears of a civil war in the country , where both Russia and the US have military bases .
Gun battles
Interim President Roza Otunbayeva said those responsible for the violence were " trying to destabilise Kyrgyzstan and plunge it into fighting or conflicts " .
She called on people to show restraint and " not yield to provocations " .
It appears that the majority of the properties attacked belonged to ethnic Uzbeks .
In recent weeks , several incidents have prompted fears of inter-ethnic violence between Uzbeks and Kyrgyz .
The country 's interior and defence ministers are reportedly travelling to the region .
Mr Bakiyev fled with his family to Belarus after clashes between government forces and protesters on 7 April , which left at least 85 people dead in the Central Asian state .
The violence was the culmination of months of discontent over rising prices and allegations of corruption in Kyrgyzstan , which had been regarded as one of the more progressive states in the region .
The interim government has promised to hold elections in October , after a constitutional referendum on reducing presidential powers .

It 's exactly 400 years since Galileo first pointed a telescope at the planet Saturn .
He immediately realised he had discovered something remarkable : the planet appeared to have ears .
Today , we know the mysterious bulges he described are a magnificent network of rings .
Their intricate beauty is captivating but Saturn 's rings are more than cosmetic wonders .
Many astronomers now believe the patterns encoded in the rings tell us something fundamental about the forces that formed the entire Solar System .
And that is part of the story we wanted to tell in the second episode of BBC2's Wonders of the Solar System - Order Out of Chaos .
Seen from a telescope on Earth , the rings of Saturn appear to be a solid disk that encircles the planet .
But we know they cannot be solid - the gravitational forces around the planet would tear them apart .
The rings are actually made of billions of chunks of ice all independently orbiting Saturn in a belt that is over 70,000 km wide , but as little as 3 m thick .
And , although the rings are a billion kilometres away , you do n't have to travel far to get a sense of what they must be like .
A glacial lagoon in Iceland , packed with icebergs was the perfect filming location for the series , which left a lasting impression on the programme 's presenter , Brian Cox .
" I climbed up a floating iceberg in the lagoon and was left there alone whilst we did a series of sweeping helicopter shots , " he recalls .
" It was a magical and quiet place ( until the helicopter flew past ) and I allowed my mind to drift .
The rings are magnificently pure water - ice , just like the icebergs , and I genuinely felt transported three - quarters of a billion miles away to the rings of Saturn .
" I make a comment on the show to that effect in an astonishingly broad Oldham accent , which shows that my mind was elsewhere ! "
Saturn - the " supermodel of the Solar System "
It 's by studying the dynamics of the icebergs in the rings that scientists hope to understand how the whole Solar System formed .
One of the enduring mysteries of the Solar System is how the ordered network of planets orbiting the Sun spontaneously emerged form the chaos of space .
In Saturn 's rings , we can see similar ordered patterns and structures assembling themselves from the chaos of the ring particles .
Images sent back from the Cassini spacecraft ( which has been in orbit around Saturn since 2004 ) have revealed how the fine structure of the rings is broken up into intricate patterns of thousands of ringlets and gaps .
Carl Murray , from Queen Mary , University of London , is one of the senior British astronomers on the Cassini mission .
He believes the whole Saturn system is an excellent model for the early Solar System .
" In the rings , we 're learning something about our own origins , " he says .
Because the physical processes that go on in the rings are probably similar to what went on in the early Solar System and we 've got this incredible opportunity to observe those processes happening in front of our eyes . "
One of the key discoveries has been the role Saturn 's moons play in maintaining the order and structure of the rings .
Saturn has a network of over 60 moons and as they orbit the planet their gravitational influence sweeps through the rings .
In some of the most breathtaking pictures from Cassini we can actually watch the moons at work .
As the moons pass close to - or even through the rings , their gravitational pull tugs waves of the ring particles towards them , twisting and shaping the ring and sweeping paths through them .
These close - range effects are wonderful to watch .
But the most significant influence is wielded by the moons that orbit thousands of km outside the rings .
Even at this distance , they carve delicate patterns in the rings through a phenomenon called orbital resonance .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .

The particles of ice in the rings orbit Saturn like cars speeding along a road .
Particles nearest to the planet move more quickly than those further away .
Beyond the rings , the moons orbit even more slowly .
Resonances occur between the moons and ring particles whose orbital rate is a simple ratio of the moon 's orbit .
For instance if a ring particle orbits the planet in exactly half the time that the moon does , it will always line up with the moon in exactly the same place in orbit and will repeatedly get a gravitational tug in exactly the same direction .
Over many orbits , these tiny nudges add up and shepherd the particles into one of Saturn 's countless ringlets .
But orbital resonances can do much more than gently sculpt Saturn 's rings .
It 's now believed orbital resonances between planets played a crucial role in the evolution of the whole Solar System - and may ultimately have helped make Earth a habitable planet .
Influence on Earth
It is thought that the giant planets did not form where they are now - instead their orbits drifted for hundreds of million of years .
Eventually , the two giants of the Solar System , Jupiter and Saturn , fell into a resonant order - where Jupiter was orbiting exactly twice in the time it took Saturn to complete one lap of the Sun .
This resonance had such a powerful gravitational surge that it distorted the orbits of all the outer planets .
It 's believed that Neptune was catapulted from its orbit into the heart of the Kuiper Belt , the ring of icy comets surrounding the Solar System , where it caused chaos .
For a hundred million years , a rain of comets was fired from the Kuiper Belt into the inner Solar System .
It was called the Late Heavy Bombardment .
The comets left their scars .
The craters they caused can still be seen on the moon - and the Earth would have received similar damage .
But the effects were n't all bad .
It 's believed that up to half the water we have on Earth today was delivered by that rain of comets .
The same forces of orbital resonance we see carving the delicate patterns in Saturn 's rings helped to make our planet the place it is today .

Lapwings are one of the rare species expected to be attracted Some of the country 's rarest or most threatened wildlife species in Kent are to be safeguarded by a £ 2 m environmental compensation scheme .
Land at Great Bells Farm , on the Isle of Sheppey , is being transformed into a wildlife habitat to make up for land lost to future flood - management work .
The Environment Agency says a rare Maid of Kent beetle and threatened lapwings and water voles should be attracted .
The site will be managed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds .
Poor quality Great Bells Farm was bought by the Environment Agency as compensation for land it will need to take elsewhere within the Special Protection Area to reduce the risk of future flooding in the county .
The 193 - hectare site is currently described as poor - quality grazing marsh .
But work carried out for the Environment Agency will improve the land , providing good - quality freshwater grazing marsh , and possibly new mudflats and saltmarshes - known as an inter - tidal habitat - to house marine life and seabirds .
Environment Agency area manager Andrew Pearce said : " The new wildlife habitat at Great Bells Farm is an important part of our long - term plans to manage the risk of flooding in the Medway and Swale Estuary .
" The new habitat will also boost internationally important local wildlife , including some of the nation 's favourite birds , insects and animals . "
The agency says the transformation will take up to 10 years to ensure the new site is up to the standard of land being lost when flood defences are strengthened .
Total cost , including land acquisition , is about £ 2 m .
The agency says the eventual habitat should accommodate rare and threatened species that might otherwise be lost as sea defences are enhanced .
The Maid of Kent Beetle was rediscovered in the 1990s after being thought extinct for 30 years .
Lapwings are " red-listed " by the RSPB because of their declining populations .
Water voles have disappeared from 94 % of their UK homes .
Chris Corrigan , the RSPB 's South East regional director , said : " The Isle of Sheppey holds some of southern England 's most amazing wildlife hotspots already , so restoring the habitats at Great Bells Farm will be the icing on the cake - conservation on a landscape scale .
We 're thrilled to be invited to bring this place alive . "

Hillary Clinton says she is intrigued , but unconcerned , by Britain 's coalition
By James Robbins
Diplomatic correspondent , BBC News , in Washington
The extraordinary pace of political events in Britain over the past few days forced William Hague to take an unconventional route to Washington for his first overseas trip as foreign secretary .
The swearing in of new government ministers at Buckingham Palace early on Thursday evening , and the kissing of hands with the Queen meant Mr Hague needed to fly first to New York , and then catch the train to the nation 's capital to see Hillary Clinton on Friday .
He attached enormous importance to the talks , as he told me while the train glided down the north - east corridor through Philadelphia and Baltimore .
President Obama , he pointed out , had been the first world leader to telephone David Cameron and congratulate him on becoming prime minister .
Hillary Clinton had been the first to welcome him as foreign secretary .
Coalition ' chemistry '
What was this first meeting as direct counterparts like ?
As William Hague and Hillary Clinton chatted for the cameras before their talks , it was clear she had been following developments in British politics very closely on television .
The US secretary of state said she was enthusiastic about the " chemistry " between Prime Minister David Cameron and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg as coalition partners - a chemistry the new foreign secretary hopes to develop with her .
Their discussions ranged widely across the really tough challenges they both face , above all in Afghanistan , Pakistan , Iran and the Middle East .
Afterwards , both stressed their unity of approach on the war in Afghanistan and the need for further UN sanctions against Iran .
As for Britain 's coalition , Hillary Clinton talked about being intrigued by this new incarnation of democracy in Britain .
I see nothing at all unusual about this new government and , from our perspective , it is off to a very strong start
Hillary Clinton , US Secretary of State
Hague holds talks in DC
She rejected any suggestion possible future splits at Westminster could threaten strong partnership with Washington .
I asked her if she worried at all that possible fractures in a coalition government could threaten the relationship with Britain , and America 's ability to rely on Britain as a partner ?
" The answer is no .
I have absolutely no concerns whatsoever , " she said .
" We do n't formally have a coalition government in the way that you have formed one in the UK now , but we have enough of our own internal differences that we have to sort through .
" So I see nothing at all unusual about this new government and , from our perspective , it is off to a very strong start .
" And certainly on the foreign policy front , which I follow very closely , obviously , we are extremely pleased .
" And this meeting and discussion just confirmed our close partnership and our commitment to working together . "
' No differences ' William Hague beamed .
He talked about continuity and of following similar lines to the last Labour government when tackling the gravest threats .
" Everything I 've said today about our approach to relations with the United States is an approach shared by the whole cabinet and I 'm speaking on behalf of a united government , " he said .
So the first signs are of the two foreign ministers in early harmony .
William Hague insists he would be more relaxed than the previous Labour governments ever were about possible differences with Washington but he is equally eager to point out that no such differences currently exist .

Not So Naughty Bear Achievements
by David ' Hades ' Becker [ Wednesday , 12th of May 2010 - 10:20 PM ]
I mean it is good to see that they are rewarding you for playing the game for the most part and not forcing you to do some inane things for gamer score .
Not like the Wasting Your Life achievement from Saw where you simply have to stand still for five minutes .
From the way it reads you will have to play the game in many different ways to get the full count here , and in multiplayer as well .
At least twice that is .
Maybe the one secret achievement and the platinum , when the trophy list is revealed , will have some very naughty title .
Doubtful , but we can hope .
In either instance , here is the list of 50 achievements and 1000 points to add to your gamer score on June 8th , at least in the US :

Based upon our hydraulic modeling , MWRA has selected very specific areas in the MWRA system and Boston and Brookline for flushing ( those areas closest to the Chestnut Hill Reservoir or those areas most likely to receive the water from this source ) .
If a community desires to flush their system , please take precautions to limit and control the amount and velocity of water moved .
The potential for discolored water or the possibility of non-representative coliform results could occur from the non-routine movement of water related to flushing ( especially during this boil water order increased sampling period ) .
BOIL WATER ORDER STATUS
Ongoing water quality sampling continues in MWRA communities and initial sample results are beginning to be analyzed .
The time frame for the lifting of the boil water order is still uncertain .
Therefore it would be irresponsible for MWRA to speculate on when the boil water order will be lifted .
As soon as MWRA has more precise information , we will inform our member communities .

I want to start this article by giving a formal " you 're welcome " to the Guardian and the good people of Britain for all the great work we 've been doing .
You know , a lot of people still think BP stands for British Petroleum and they 're very mad at you .
Just sayin' .
Anyways , down to business .
You want to know how to succeed in public relations so you 've called upon the best .
First , a quick overview of what public relations entails .
Honestly , 90 % of the time and when things are going well , our work is incredibly easy .
We work about three or four hours a day and we spend most of it messing around on social networking sites and taking personal phone calls .
However , the other 10 % of the time , when the client is in trouble , the job can be tough .
You see , big corporations often make a lot of irresponsible decisions because for the most part , they are fuelled by greed .
Our job is to step in and engage the public while villains hide out and look for legal loopholes so they can make money again .
Here are the simple steps you must take in any PR campaign .
We 'll use our most recent BP campaign as a case study :
1. Acknowledge the problem without acknowledging specifics .
This was our very first tweet :
@BPGlobalPR : We regretfully admit that something has happened off of the Gulf Coast .
More to come .
2 . Be open about one piece of bad news and no more .
You want to appear human , but you do n't want to appear like a bunch of idiots .
There 's another word I 'd use there , but I do n't think I can .
It rhymes with mickleticks .
@BPGlobalPR : Sadly we can no longer certify our oil as Dolphin Safe .
3. Threaten legal action if anyone crosses a line .
You 're in PR , but you need to make sure you flex your muscle and establish some ground rules .
@BPGlobalPR : Please do NOT take or clean any oil you find on the beach .
That is the property of British Petroleum and we WILL sue you .
4 . Choose the language for your campaign and you change the dialogue .
For instance , people have called this oil spill an unmitigated disaster , an oilpocalypse and a catastrophe .
So I spun it here …
@BPGlobalPR : Catastrophe is a strong word , let 's all agree to call it a whoopsie daisy … and sure enough almost every pundit calls it a " whoopsie daisy " now .
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED !
5 . People love it when you refer to vague spiritual / Christian ideals .
It always helps .
So try and incorporate that into your message .
@ Jesus walked on water and soon you can too !
( Please pray for BP , we 're losing a lot of oil ) .
6 . Be willing to laugh at yourself !
After I spilled a salad on my lap , I immediately tweeted about it .
@BPGlobalPR : Eating at a very expensive restaurant and spilled salad dressing on my pants .
Not sure how to tackle this .
7 . Any hard feelings or problems that come up can almost always be solved with a " free " T - shirt .
Offer them to people who are upset and you will win them over almost instantly .
We 've sold $ 10,000 worth of free " BP cares " T - shirts to benefit the Gulf Restoration Network .
''IF YOU ladies leave my island , '' screams Gunnery Sergeant Hartman to his fresh recruits in Full Metal Jacket , '' if you survive recruit training , you will be a weapon …
But until that day you are pukes .
You are the lowest form of life on Earth .
You are not even human … beings .
You are nothing but unorganised grabastic pieces of amphibian shit . ''
Use interactive tool to search Defence contracts database
Ship - shape ... Jodie Low on board HMAS Ballarat .
Basic training for Australian troops might still begin with gruelling obstacle courses and day - long marches through the bush , but for some in the Defence establishment , the drill master has lost the buzz cut .
Jodie Low , the blonde model and fitness celebrity who once starred on Foxtel 's Aerobics Oz Style , is on contract to keep Australia 's fighting personnel trim and taut .
Black and white images are special .
When you strip away the colour from something , you can get right to its soul .
It does n't matter whether it 's a portrait , a landscape , a street scene or anything else , when it 's reduced to textures , tones and lines , you see it in a different way .
It 's a sad truth that in the age of easy Instagram filters some people feel that converting an image to black and white is enough to make it " arty " and " cool " .
The best black and white images are carefully crafted ; they are n't just desaturated versions of normal colour images .
Creating a powerful black and white image is a skill unto itself !
In this article I 've gathered 100 awesome black and white images .
There are portraits , landscapes , street scenes and everything in between in the mix .
The one thing they have in common is that they are all monochrome images .
Around half of them were taken before 1950 by masters of the craft like Ansel Adams .
The other half are more modern images , the majority taken with digital cameras .
Things to Consider
Rather than just scrolling through this collection going , " Oh , that 's cool ! " , when you see an image you like , you should spend an hour slowly browsing through all the images considering them carefully .
You should look at each image as an individual work of art but also consider how it relates to the other images in the collection .
You might want to think about things like :
How has a particular style of photography ( for example , portraiture ) changed in the past 100 years ?
Take a photo from two photographers , maybe one from Ansel Adams and another from Rod Waddington ; what are the similarities and differences between them ?
Take your favourite image from the collection .
Why do you think the photographer converted it to black and white ?
Was it driven by the film stock available such as in the case of the news images or was it a deliberate choice ?
As you look through , consider what would each image look like in colour ?
Would it be stronger or weaker ?
Why ?
Some photographers have multiple images in the collection while others have only one .
Without looking at the captions can you identify which photos come from the same photographers ?
What is it that gives it away ?
How are they creating a style even without colour ?
What emotion does each image you feel ?
Is the black and white heightening that emotion or reducing it ?
Would you feel a different emotion if it was in colour ?
There are plenty more things to consider with each image .
Do n't feel my list of ideas is exhaustive .
Use it as a jumping off point .
The only important thing is that you actively think as you view each image .

Smart Fuel : Eggs
Remember in the movie Runaway Bride when Julia Roberts ’ character could never decide how she liked her eggs ?
We say , do n’t worry about it Ms. Roberts , with so many health benefits associated with the consumption of eggs , you should eat ’em however you can get ’em !
On the most superficial level , eggs are an excellent source of protein , providing 5.5 grams per 68 calorie serving and all 9 essential amino acids ( all for less than 0.5 grams of carbs ! )
Digging deeper , eggs are perhaps best known for supplying choline , an “ unofficial ” B vitamin that our bodies can only produce in limited quantities ( often too limited for optimal health , with one study indicating that 90 % of Americans are currently choline deficient .
Among choline ’s many benefits , it is considered a key component of fat - containing structures in cell membranes , particularly those associated with the brain , making them particularly important for fetal brain development as well as overall brain function and health .
In the mineral department , eggs are an excellent source of selenium , which is thought to prevent cancer , particularly tumors affecting the prostate ( although researchers are currently going back and forth on this one ! )
Eggs are also a great source of lutein and zeaxanthin , two types of carotenoids important for eye health ( with several studies indicating that these compounds may prevent macular degeneration as well as reduce the risk of developing cataracts ) .
Additionally , eggs are thought to be one of the only foods that contain naturally occurring vitamin D , providing roughly 10 % of the recommended daily intake per serving .
Still need convincing ?
A 2005 study in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition suggests that eggs keep hunger at bay longer than bagels ( or “ dietary disasters ” as they should be renamed ! ) .
In addition , eggs ’ high sulfur content and wide variety of vitamins and minerals can promote healthy hair – and may even speed up growth rate in those with such deficiencies – as well as help nails grow .
And now to address the bad press .
In recent years , eggs have come under considerable fire for their high cholesterol content , with many suggesting that they could increase the risk of cardiovascular disease .
However , a 1999 Harvard School of Public Health study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association determined no such link and even went as far to say that regular egg consumption may actually prevent blood clots , stroke and heart attack .
Not bad , eh ?
So , there you have it .
Eggs really are egg- ceptional .
Some might even consider them egg - cellent and still others would even go as far to call them eggs - quisite ( ok , we promise we ’ll stop now ! )

We all know that sitting in a left - hand - turn lane or waiting to turn across lanes of oncoming traffic can be time - consuming and even treacherous .
The New York Times Magazine has a great article by Joel Lovell on a highly focused effort by UPS to eliminate left - hand turns from its drivers ' delivery routes .
The company is using a " package flow " software program to pre-plot delivery sequences for its 95,000 vehicles .
It may sound comically anal - retentive , but the results are staggering : Lovell reports that UPS lopped off some 28.5 million miles from its delivery routes last year thanks to the software , saving 3 million gallons of fuel and cutting carbon dioxide emissions by close to 69 million pounds .
We have to wonder :
If such a strategy can yield this kind of savings for UPS , what can it do for the average person ?
How much fuel , time , and sanity might we save in a year of driving if we pre-planned errand - running to minimize ( or even eliminate ) left - hand turns ?

THIS pic shows a Spanish matador being gored by a bull .
Veteran bullfighter Julio Aparicio stumbles and falls to the ground , then the bull charges him .
The bull 's horn enters Aparicio's throat and protrudes through his mouth , during the fight at Plaza de Toros las Ventas bullring as part of the San Isidro Festival in Madrid .
Apricio is in hospital in a critical condition .

ONCE upon a time , sex in the animal kingdom seemed pretty simple .
Flamboyant male met coy female , male courted female , male deposited spermatozoa in the vicinity of an ovary , then headed out to do it all again elsewhere .
Then biologists began to look more closely , at what really happens .
They found that being the biggest and brashest male does n’t always win you mating rights .
Among weaver fish , for example , it is good fathers , the ones who will take care of the fry , who get the girl .
Females do n’t always conform to type either .
The female bean weevil , for instance , would rather drink her mate ’s ejaculate than use it to fertilise her eggs .
Reproduction , it turns out , is a complex affair .
Just how complex has been emphasised anew with a slew of studies that highlight the staggering diversity of sexual practice in the animal kingdom .
Intercourse is a bizarre and often dangerous pursuit , where sexually transmitted infections can be desirable , living in a male harem inside your mate can make sense , and headless lovers give you extra .
Relations between the sexes are also surprisingly convoluted .
Biologists have charted virgin births , spontaneous sex changes and , perhaps weirdest of all , males who father their brother ’s offspring .
Human sexual exuberance is tame compared with some of the things that animals get up to in the name of reproduction .
Take the male praying mantis , the poster boy of risky sex .
In an ideal world , he will jump …
When Israeli commandos attacked the so - called Freedom Flotilla , both sides were well armed — with video cameras — and both sides have released a blizzard of video clips as evidence that the other side was the aggressor in the conflict on Monday , which left nine activists dead .
Once again , the political power of the moving picture is on display , as it was last year when a video showing the death of a young protester in Iran , Neda Agha - Soltan , became a symbol of resistance in that country .
The flotilla videos have proved a popular draw online , with one from the Israel Defense Forces attracting more than 600,000 views on YouTube .
Scenes from both perspectives have been shown in a continuous loop on television news programs all over the world , stirring public outrage .
But what is missing so far from the flotilla clips on both sides is context : it is difficult to establish the sequence of events or , more simply , to determine who attacked first .
The videos have made it all the more murky .
This week Tina Fey , writer and star of US sitcom 30 Rock , was honoured with the prestigious Mark Twain Prize for American Humour .
Previous recipients include Steve Martin , Whoopi Goldberg and Bill Cosby .
Fans of the one - woman gag factory behind Mean Girls , Saturday Night Live , that infamous Sarah Palin impersonation and the aforementioned joke powerhouse of a sitcom will be raising their Liz Lemon - approved hotdogs in salute .
Let 's take time to bask in some of her finest moments :
▶ Liz Lemon , her 30 Rock alter ego , quizzes a rude florist about the identity of the sender of a bouquet .
She ends the phone call : " You know what ?
I found the card .
Actually , they 're from your mom .
So tell your gay mom I said thanks . "
▶ Liz goes to extreme lengths to avoid jury service , dressing in full Princess Leia costume and uttering the immortal line : " I do n't think it 's fair for me to be in a jury because I can read thoughts . "
▶ Her snippy interplay with screen boss Jack Donaghy ( Alec Baldwin ) includes some of the finest putdowns written by man or woman since Dorothy Parker .
Examples include : " I like you .
You have the boldness of a much younger woman . "
" Lemon , women your age are more likely to be mauled at the zoo than get married . "
▶ Fey 's 2004 feature film writing debut , Mean Girls , was a trenchant encapsulation of the high school experience .
The droll couplets flew forth like a food fight in a canteen .
Two enduring favourites are the following .
When Janice introduces new girl Cady ( Lindsay Lohan ) to her effeminate friend : " This is Damian .
He 's almost too gay to function . "
And later , Janice points out the school gossip to Cady : " She knows everything about everyone . "
Damian agrees : " That 's why her hair is so big .
It 's full of secrets . "
▶ Fey 's impression of Sarah Palin appeared on Saturday Night Live in the run up to the US election , and lives on thanks to YouTube .
Almost too many gems to choose from , but this , from an election debate sketch , is hard to beat : " While Senator Biden has been in Washington all these years , I 've been with regular people .
The hockey moms and Joe Six -Packs .
And I 'd also like to give a shout out to the third graders of Gladys Woods Elementary who were so helpful to me in my debate prep . "
Hole In One !
A house - sized boulder ( 10 m diameter ) rolled down - hill , scoring a hole in one ( ~60 m diameter crater ) !
Portion of LROC NAC M122597190L , image width is 500 m across .

Boulders like this are incredible because we can determine where the boulder came from by back - tracking along the boulder trail .
In fact , Apollo 17 Astronauts Schmitt and Cernan sampled a large boulder at Station 6 , and because scientists were able to trace the original position of this boulder using its boulder trail , we can infer what the composition of the rocks up - slope may be .
In this case , the boulder trail curves abruptly as the boulder approached its final resting place .
What might have caused this boulder to deviate from its straight , downward course ?
You can see the boulder trail intersects a crater rim as the local slope was flattening out .
As the boulder was slowing , it encountered a new steep slope on its right , thus turning it into the crater .
Boulders fall from high elevations to lower ones because of gravity after being knocked loose by small impacts or moonquakes .
Changes in slope can stop boulders ; when a steep slope ( like that of a crater wall ) suddenly shallows , the boulder may not have enough inertia to continue moving .
Inertia , or Newton 's First Law of Motion , describes an object 's resistance to change in velocity .
So , a boulder will continue to move until something changes its speed or direction .

The Pioneer 10 ( also known as Pioneer F ) spacecraft , launched in 1972 and now on a very long journey towards Taurus , has a plaque mounted on it which is designed to inform alien civilizations about the spacecraft ’s origin .
The plaque contains a diagram of our solar system , the trajectory of the spacecraft , a drawing of a man and woman , and groups of vertical and horizontal strokes — you guessed it , binary code — that gives information about how to find us :
Disclaimer : I ’m a computer scientist , not a physicist or astronomer .
Binary Encoding
The binary information in the diagram is encoded as groups of vertical strokes ( | ) and horizontal strokes ( — ) .
| means 1 , and — means 0 .
For example , | —|— is 1010 .
Each group of strokes represents a binary integer , and there are binary integers associated with three entities : pulsars , planets , and people .
I ’ve annotated the original diagram and highlighted their encodings in gray :
Hydrogen As a Yardstick
The hydrogen atom , indicated by the two circles at the top left of the diagram , serves as a universal reference for time and distance .
Specifically , the atom ’s hyperfine transition , which is about 1420 MHz , is the base of measure .
A frequency of 1420 MHz gives a period of about 7.04 * 10 - 10 seconds , and a wavelength of about 8.3 inches .
These numbers are implied as units in other parts of the diagram .
Pulsars
There are 14 radial lines in the diagram , representing the positions of 14 pulsars relative to the sun .
Pulsars emit radio waves at a different frequencies , which helps identify them .
The waves emanate across much of the galaxy , so presumably an alien culture could detect them and locate our solar system .
Also , since a pulsar ’s frequency decreases with time , aliens could use that to determine when the spacecraft was launched .
Each pulsar line is labeled with an encoded binary integer , which is read in the direction of the gray arrows I ’ve drawn .
Starting at the unlabeled line ( appearing at 3:00 in the diagram ) and heading clockwise , those numbers and their decimal equivalents are :
Binary Encoding of Pulsar Periods Pulsar Number In Binary In Decimal 1 1000110001111100100011011101010 1,178,486,506 2 10110010011000101011101101111 374,101,871 3 100000110110010110001001111000 551,117,432 4 111100011011011001010100111 126,726,823 5 10101011011001101100101000011 359,455,043 6 101100111011010101011110001011 753,751,947 7 10110011100000101010000010 47,057,538 8 100111101000110101000100111000100 5,320,116,676 9 111100011111100011111000010110 1,014,906,390 10 101101100101101001000010110001 764,842,161 11 101111001111001110011000001101 792,520,205 12 11110010111110001110100011110 509,549,854 13 10011001011010111010010111000 321,746,104 14 100000110100101010001110101100 550,675,372
These numbers represent the period of the pulsar ’s radiation , counted in units of 7.04 * 10 - 10 seconds .
Multiply each integer by 7.04 * 10 - 10 to get the period .
Planets
The binary code for each planet indicates its average distance from the sun .
( Pluto is included because it was still considered a planet in 1972 . )
The distances are relative to Mercury ’s distance from the sun , which is given as 10 units .
For example , Saturn is 24.7 times farther from the sun than Mercury .
Confusingly , the wavelength derived from the hydrogen atom plays no role in these values .
Binary Encoding of Distance from Sun Planet In Binary In Decimal Mercury 1010 10 Venus 10011 19 Earth 11010 26 Mars 100111 39 Jupiter 10000110 134 Saturn 11110111 247 Uranus 111101111 495 Neptune 1100001100 780 Pluto 1111111100 1,020
People
The height of the woman in the diagram is encoded by the |— — — , which is 1000 , or 8 in decimal ( nevermind that it ’s written from the bottom up and one of the horizontal strokes has a defect in it ) .
If you multiply this by the reference unit of length , 8.3 inches , you get the height of the woman — about 5 feet , 6 inches .
Commentary
Will aliens know how to read binary code ?
Will they know that the binary code represents binary integers ?
Will they understand that the units of distance and time associated with those integers , in most cases , are derived from properties of the hydrogen atom ?
Will they make numerous other assumptions required to understand that plaque ?
Not likely .
But the scientists wanted to make an attempt at communication , and having chosen binary is a testament to its simplicity and universality .

Two military professors have written an interesting piece in the NY Times .
They have come up with a plausible answer to the question “ how many nuclear weapons do we need to assure our national security ” .
They come up with a number , 311 , and provide evidence that this number would be more than sufficient .
After all , as they point out , in 1965 the Secretary of Defense argued that around 20 megatons of nuclear explosive power would be enough to destroy more than one - quarter of the population and two - thirds of the industrial capacity of the ( then ) Soviet Union .
And 311 of our current nuclear weapons is equal to 1,900 megatons , or enough to wipe out 5 times the population of the former Soviet Union .
What ironic about this is that recently , the Pentagon told the public ( for the first time ever ) that we have 5,113 nuclear weapons .
In other words , we have 4,802 more such weapons than we could ever possibly use .
Even the recent ( historic ) treaty , signed by Obama and the Russian president , only gets us down to 1,550 weapons , which is still almost 5 times as many as we need .

" Your honor , we should n't be required to look for prior art that precedes our invention , because shurely such prior art would be outdated and irrelevant " :-)
Does that mean the patent becomes valid when that Amiga stops working ?

We should have a prior art museum , to house it all .
Between all of us , I can imagine we could fill a warehouse with what we keep
around .
I know I got a few large rooms full ( out of the way rooms , but still
alot of stuff ) .
Is there such a place ?
A museum , with a FOSS mentality ?
For donations of working stuff ?

If I remember from a previous article , it is very hard to appeal a finding of
fact by a jury .
Did the Judge do anything which could be a cause of appeal ?
Until we have the transcripts and can analyze them only PJ will know .
Will they pull a tSCOg and appeal on the issue that the patent invalidated the
prior art since they " invented " it indepedently , filed for and
received the patent .

Wow .
I 've got 3 working Amigas ; two A500s with Kickstart 1.2 and 1.3 ,
and a B2000 with Kickstart 2.mumble and a GVP 68030 accelerator
board .
And an upgrade module to give it 2 MB of CHIP RAM .
And
a serial accelerator .
And ....
I ran that 2000 as my main machine for 9 years , well past it's
go - bankrupt - by date .
One of the hard disks I had in it was
from a surplus store and still has " NFG " ( No Functioning Good )
marked on it in felt - tip .
They do n't hardly ever get used more than a couple times a year ,
now , but they all still work .
I really need to find a scan converter for them .

The people who developed the Amiga did n't patent this idea .
They were people who created things , not parasitic patent trolls .
They were too busy developing exciting new technology to waste time reading the kind of rubbish that is in patent filings .
I guess that 's one of the ways you tell the difference between creative innovators and parasitic patent trolls .

Well , if this was for multi-tasking on PC's , then I think that QNX had the lead
on this , quite a bit before the Amiga , on the IBM PC and compatibles .
Of course ,
it was known as Qunix at the time , until AT&T complained that it was too
similar to Unix , so Quantum Software changed the name to QNX , which is still
around .
QNX is now a division of Research In Motion who just bought it from
Harman International .
FWIW , I still have my 5 1/4 inch floppies of pre-release
version 0.7 , serial number 8 that I got in 1982 . [ Reply to This | # ]

Cool !
While I found an VS100 on ebay , carrying in an Amiga
into the court room is soooo much easier than a VAX 11/750 +
VS100 .
I 'm amazingly glad they were able to demo the Amiga .

Amazing !
But so was the Amiga in its day .
I used one briefly for a project at work a long time ago .
It was running CP / M on a Z - 80 emulator , to support a cross- assembler for some microcontroller , probably 8048 , and with all the layers of emulation it was still usable .
Our client had done that because their old CP / M machine had died .
Both the OS and the emulator must have been very tightly coded for it to perform acceptably .
But , more importantly , observe just where innovation did not come from !
Just imagine how fast and efficient an up to date Amiga based on a Power PC or Cell would be , compared to your most hated OS ! [ Reply to This | # ]

Now , one can never say for sure what it was that turned the tide with a jury , unless they tell us , which they have n't .
But it surely helped to have three examples of prior art , one of which was used in a live demo .
And from reading the transcripts of the trial , I can surely say it ought to be what did it , or at least had to be a major piece .
That is a cautious statement by PJ .
It is hard to overestimate the value of good demonstrative evidence .
Demonstrative evidence can be documents , pictures , videos , enactments , and objects .
To have a witness enact with a toy how a subject held and wielded a weapon is better than a thousand questions and answers .
The only thing better than witnessing and being at the actual event in question is a video of the event .
Drug dealers rarely go to trial when there is a video of the deals in question .
With this trial , the Amiga actually made the jury witness to the inventions in question .
It was not a witness recalling an event .
The event and the invention were right in the courtroom before them .
They could take what the plaintiffs explained as their claims of invention and apply it to the Amiga .
They could even use the plaintiff 's own experts .
It will then become clear that the Amiga does exactly what the patented invention claims .
Then everyone is asked what came first , the patent or the Amiga .
The Amiga made a lie of the claim that the patent was an invention .
The jury wiped out these false patents .
The question then becomes why did the plaintiffs go to trial against such strong and obvious demonstrative evidence ?
Were they advised by their lawyers ?
Did they proceed with no fear because they had a USPTO granted patent , valid or not ?
Or is it the troll IQ ?

I would love to see a photograph of * that specific Amiga * system with the
' window switching feature ' prominently displayed just as it looked in the court
room that day , and to have that photo to adorn this monumental article here on
Groklaw .
Why ?
Since this article may very well become archived in the Library of
Congress , what better way could be possibly thank this dedicated historic
collector ?
His hard work would thus be immortalized in the National Archives for
all US Citizens , present and future , to see until the end of time !
Many thanks to this dedicated technological historian !

In addition to something used at trial the comment revealing the Exhibit B prior art also contained a second citation for another piece of Rooms and a third for Smalltalk - 80 .
Not meant as ego gratification , rather it 's acknowledgment of the work someone else subsequently put into the process doing analysis against patent claims .
While it took a few hours hours googling to find these prior art elements mostly searching for dates of publications while otherwise holding a semi- knowledgeable view of who , what and when , someone went to the effort of doing priority analysis of all these submissions .
From an arm chair perspective it must have been a significant effort for each of the twenty - five or so prior art submissions .
Finding prior art is the tip of the elephant 's trunk , while successfully defending against the patents is akin to whole animal veterinary care .
In my case I grabbed a bunch of elephants by the nose , handed them off haphazardly to the vets and wandered off .
What 's significant about this is that as a result open source evaded a major patent troll bullet through the same many hands contribution process that allows software success .
It 's also significant that the information is on the net still , can be found by egalitarian search and is not behind pay walls .
All the links I provided are still active .
Imagine having to pay to find old information , or what you might find if the plaintiff to the infringement suit owned the ' one true search engine ' .
All the sudden those many hands would n't be able to contribute to the process .
This speaks to net neutrality , ideological wars and propping up outdated business models .
The Internet we have today is an amplifier of our abilities and represents the creative commons .
What happens when the Cloud is sawn into cubes and put into nice little proprietary boxes in the sky ?
I 'm somehow reminded of Star Trek episodes focusing on the Ferengi where everything is pay as you go .
Open source reflects the things in our history that proactively defend the creative commons against embrace , extend and extinguish - the reduction in production and distribution costs avoiding needless middleman expenses .
Open source depends on respect for ' intellectual property ' laws .
In this case it is demonstrated by the invalidation by prior art patents held in the hands of those out to wall off our creative commons .
We 're balancing innovation that entails profiting by walling knowledge away versus the ability to build on the shoulders of those who came before us whose work is in the creative commons .
There 's a lot to be said for having a venue for readily contributing such as occurred here on Groklaw .
In this case we made a difference .
Imagine had Groklaw been silenced prior , would we have been able to then ?
Thanks for the opportunity PJ . [ Reply to This | # ]

I grew up with Amiga 600 , then later a 1200 .
It booted up in 10 seconds and
after those 10 seconds had very little HDD usage if any on a 14MHz 68030 CPU .
But if people looking for prior art or and in the business of searching for
prior art .
Now there 's a business idea -
First there were patents , then Patent
Trolls , then Prior art collectors ( ? )
( Art collectors , where have I heard that
term before ?
Is n't there money in Art Collecting ? )
I could ' almost ' consider the Amiga to be ' art ' in the traditional sense of the
word .
( 4 channel stereo sound and 4096 colours on screen at the same time , back
in 1985 .
Said to be the original Multimedia Computer , although the term was n't
used till years later .
I used to collect emulators , Frodo a Commodore 64 emulator .
Shape Shifter an
Apple II emulator , but I 'm not sure about the legalities of them , but I never
did get Shape Shifter working .
PC - Task , an IBM PC emulator that I could run DOS
and Windows 3.1 , although it was slow , it worked .
I never would have thought
about emulating the same computer system on itself like VMWare , or Virtual PC ,
there was no need back then .
I also had other programs that simulated circuit
boards .
Also there was a Basic called AMOS that made it easy to create games .
Within
AMOS was AMAL , an animation language .
I have no doubt that if it was extended ,
it would be what Macromedia Flash was years later .
And I remember a vector
animation program that included a long animation of dinosaurs ( in 2D that is ) as
a demo with sound which I thought was awesome at the time , but I can never
remember it 's name , but if you saw it today you 'd think it was a flash animation
for sure .
Blitz Basic was around as well and was better for writing Workbench
programs , and is now popular on Windows and Linux as well .
Many people , myself included thought the Amiga and it's inventor Jay Minor , were
years ahead of their time , which now makes it an ideal place to search for prior
art = )
Along with other systems of the time as well of course .
Hopefully
someone somewhere finds my ramble here somewhat useful .
Oh and one last thought , the operating system was in ROM of which still needed a
floppy disc or HDD to boot .
And you could get a copy of the source code , in C ,
from a book store , ( I remember buying a 2nd hand one for $ 2 ) without signing a
NDA or anything like that .
Such was the trust in the good ol days before patents
went mainstream and before they tried to extend copyright .

It is not likely that there will be an appeal , if I 'm remembering the verdict
right .
The jury found non infringement and patent invalidity .
For an appeal
to be useful , plaintiff would have to get both of those findings overturned .
That is similar to the case Acacia lost against Microsoft in 2007 .
The
verdict was similar , and those were the reasons they did not appeal that
one . [ Reply to This | # ]

See , that is why , despite others who talk prior - art searching down , I am firmly committed to it .
Of course there are people who talk Prior - Art searching down .
They are terrified of it , because a good demonstration like this can kill a patent , which means that they 've wasted resources .
You see the problem is that there is Prior - Art out there for EVERYTHING .
Seriously .
The USPTO is terrible at searching for Prior - Art , and so they grant tons of patents of all sorts ( hardware as well as software ) which legally should not be granted .
Over 90 % of ALL patents are junk , and should not have been issued .
As to the remaining 10 % , I have my doubts about them as well .

This may be a huge surprise to you ( judging by your amazement that an amiga from
1986 still works ) but most computers from that era still work fine .
I collect
Atari's and amigas and I have a room with probably 25 - 30 of them in various
models and all work fine .
Several of them run 24x7 .
The only ones I have
trouble with are the 520ST's and people had trouble with those back in their
heyday .

As a committee member of one Amiga club and a attendee of another ... we often
see working A1000's .
It 's virtually impossible to kill them ... so unless one is
thrown out it 's still working .
http://go.to/maug
www.aug.org.au
Other more powerful amiga 's A500's , A2000's , A3000's and A4000's , etc ... are
likewise preferred to A1000's ... but A100 ;s remain used regularly by at least
some members of our club .
Most of these computers are 20 years old or more ...
and but continue to be used with some of the newest hardware ( wireless ,
internet , SSD's , USB , etc ... ) demonstrating that they embodied advanced
engineering concepts which are often only appreciated in hindsight .

OK ...
But I 'm a bit worried by this , what if nobody had been able to produce
the Amiga in court ?
Would the case have been lost ?
I do n't see why a brochure from the period would n't be enough , to just
" describe the idea " - that 's all the IP Troll does , no implementation
is actually
needed .
Failing that what about documentation ?
A historical document to describes
how the Amiga worked ( past tense ) .
I do n't like the idea that one always has to find some old machine that works
to prove prior art , seems the burden of proof is somewhat skewed .
I guess if it means that some of these old machines are kept working that 's a
good thing , but does seem rather unfair .

I have two 500's and a 1200 with a 68030 board + MMU .
I remember going to computer clubs with my mate and his A1000
and forgetting to bring a kickstart disk .
We taped one to the
base " just in case " after that .
I remember it being a big deal that it could spawn 1000
processes and still keep the ball bouncing .
Of course the OS
would die every five minutes , but it was " science ! " :) [ Reply to This | # ]

I have a working A1000 ... i also have a working A500 ( the next generation for the
mass market ) , I also have several newer Amigas too .
A1200 , A600 and A4k .
the
only real Amiga that I have never owned is an A3000 - strangely i still found
that more desirable than the A4000 ... but maybe because of the thinner form
factor ?
either way .... all these systems are working and , even though its 15
years later .. none of the currect systems work as intuitively or works for the
user ( Windows , MacOSX , Linux , the computer makes you work its way )

Prior - prior art : in the 1970's Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory ( SAIL ) ran a networked , time - shared OS with a multi windowed graphical UI named WAITS .
This was the pre-cursor of Xerox Star , the Apple Macintosh , and the Sun workstations .
Quote from SAIL Farewell :
I got a rather elegant display system in 1971 that put terminals in everyone 's office , with full computer text and graphics , including grayscale , 7 channels of television ( some lab - originated and some commercial ) and 16 channels of audio all for about $ 600 per terminal .
It had a multiple - windowing capability and was far ahead of anything commercially available at the time but unfortunately we never told anyone about it .
Dick Helliwell made displays on unused terminal read " TAKE ME , I 'M YOURS . "
I have a number of advanced features that still are not available on many modern systems , including the ability for individual users to dial out on telephone lines and contact other computers througout the world , the ability to detach jobs and leave them running , then later attach them to either the same terminal or one in a different place .
I also would remind users of appointments at the appropriate times .
In the 70s my users decided to give my operating system a name since it had evolved quite a bit away from the DEC system running on other PDP - 10s .
The users chose the name WAITS , because , they said , " it waits on you hand and foot " ( or was it the user who waits for me , I forget -- I 'm sort of Alheimerish these days ) .
To this day I still run this reliable system with its very reliable disk structure .
Some people thought WAITS was the Worst Acronym Invented for a Timesharing System , but I 've grown rather attached to it .

What if the guy had n't had the working Amiga ?
Are we on the threshold of an age
where things get re-patented every 20 years because the tech which was prior art
is no longer functional ?
Hopefully some good museums of technology are going to be setup around the world
to keep a lot of this old stuff in working order ( I know there are some museums
already including computers and other tech in their collections , but I hope
we 'll have enough that anything for which there should be prior art , will have
working specimens ; I also hope that various blueprints / cad files / source code
repositories / etc are being preserved , so that full replicas can be manufactured
as the original equipment becomes non-functional [ or so old it has to be kept in
special vaults to preserve it ] ) .

A Calgary family is counting down the days until their son and grandson is returned to Canada .
12 - year - old Noah Kirkman is in foster care in the state of Oregon even though he 's a Canadian citizen .
A state judge ruled Friday he 'll allow Noah to come back to Calgary after the school year is complete in mid-June .
" We do believe he 's coming home , " said Noah 's grandmother Phyllis Heltay .
Noah was seized by Oregon authorities two years ago when he was caught riding a bicycle without a helmet .
The child was visiting his stepfather at the time , who is an American citizen , but does n't have legal custody of the boy .
Noah has been living in foster homes in Oregon ever since .
On Friday , the judge ruled Noah could return home to Canada when the school year is over .
" I 'm absolutely elated .
I was literally speechless that he was actually coming home , " said Noah 's mother Lisa Kirkman .
Phyllis Heltay and her husband Mike Heltay were even granted permission to spend some time alone with their grandson while they were in Oregon testifying at the hearing .
" He was thrilled to see us , contrary to how they tried to make it sound like in the hearing , he was thrilled , " said Mike Heltay .
Lisa Kirkman was n't allowed to attend the hearing , but she was granted her first unsupervised telephone conversation with Noah since the ordeal began .
" I told him that I love him more than anything in the world , " said Lisa Kirkman
Maria Sbert is a special investigator with the Missing Children Society .
She says she 's never seen a case like this .
" I still do not understand fully the reasons why the state of Oregon decided to keep Noah Kirkman .
I may never understand it , and it can't be just because he was n't wearing a bike helmet .
That 's not a logical explanation , " said Maria Sbert .
Lisa Kirkman wonders if it 's because she 's a licensed by the federal government of Canada to use marijuana for medicinal purposes .
She also edits a cannabis magazine .
Whatever the reason , she 's just looking forward to the day her son is back on Canadian soil .
Her parents vow to fly to Eugene , Oregon to bring Noah back themselves .
The family is hopeful Noah will return home to Calgary shortly after school ends on June 17th .
The words " offer sheet " combine for a horribly dirty phrase for some in the hockey world .
It 's considered dirty pool by many fans and major media personalities , while general managers like Darcy Regier and Brian Burke take it as a personal affront .
Though it 's not such a terrible sleight that it prevents them from later making moves that they deem right for the team , such as unloading Ales Kotalik on the evil guys that send out offer sheets .
Collectively , the authors here at The Copper & Blue are hockey 's biggest ( and quite possibly only ) proponent of dual offer sheets .
The concept of a dual offer sheet is simple : send offer sheets to two separate restricted free agents currently employed by the same team , especially when that team is in some amount of cap distress .
Essentially , you are forcing a team to make a choice between their assets .
I 've been lauding them for a couple of years and wrote an article about them last season in which I detailed and predicted that Phil Kessel trade , thank you very much .
Because the team making the offer sheet must surrender draft picks , it does n't make sense for a team in the lottery to make an offer , unless the player being targeted is high - end , lottery - like talent .
The strategy makes the most sense for teams in the bottom third of the draft that may have a difficult time finding talent to make an impact , or teams in the bottom two - thirds of the draft that may need an impact player but do n't see that player in unrestricted free agency .
Article 10.4 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement [ Warning , PDF link ] covers the compensation levels and draft pick requirements for offer sheets :
Clubs must use their own draft picks ( being those awarded directly to the Club by the League for use by it in the Entry Draft , including such draft picks described in the first clause of this parenthetical that a Club has traded or encumbered , and subsequently re-acquired or unencumbered . )
Clubs cannot acquire picks to use as compensation ( with the exception being a Club 's own draft selections that are traded and then re-acquired ) .
Article 10.4 also outlines that the selections must be available the following season :
Clubs owing one ( 1 ) draft selection must have it available in the next draft .
Clubs owing two ( 2 ) draft selections in different rounds must have them available in the next draft .
Clubs owing three ( 3 ) draft selections in different rounds must have them available in the next draft .
Clubs owing two ( 2 ) draft selections in the same round , must have them available in the next three ( 3 ) drafts .
Clubs owing three ( 3 ) draft selections in the same round must have them available in the next four ( 4 ) drafts , and so on
Below are the estimated salary ranges and corresponding compensation for 2010 - 2011 , based on a $ 2,000,000 cap increase :
Salary Range Compensation $ 1,029,448 No Compensation $ 1,029,449 $ 1,559,770 2011 3rd round pick $ 1,559,771 $ 3,119,539 2011 2nd round pick $ 3,119,540 $ 4,679,310 2011 1st round pick , 2011 3rd round pick $ 4,679,311 $ 6,239,080 2011 1st round pick , 2011 2nd round pick , 2011 3rd round pick $ 6,239,081 $ 7,798,850 2011 1st round pick , 2012 1st round pick , 2011 2nd round pick , 2011 3rd round pick $ 7,798,851 2011 , 2012 , 2013 , 2014 1st round picks .
Given the compensation , the only way to put together dual offer sheets without using multiple first round picks is by using the third [ $ 1,559,771 - $ 3,119,539 ] and fourth [ $ 3,119,540 - $ 4,679,310 ] salary ranges which require a 2nd round puck and a 1st and 3rd round pick as compensation , respectively .
By sending out a dual offer sheet in this manner , the offering team is putting each of their top three picks on the line , but at worst can only lose either the 1st and 3rd round picks or the 2nd round pick .
I 've sorted the target teams by next year 's contracted cap hit , so the teams at the top of the list are in the most cap distress .
Chicago Blackhawks
Andrew Ladd ( $ 1,600,000 )
Antti Niemi ( $ 800,000 )
Niklas Hjalmarsson ( $ 600,000 )
The Blackhawks are in trouble next year .
They 're going to need to find about $ 12 million in cap space and fast .
I do n't know that any of these players are worth a 1st and 3rd round pick , so if I were a general manager and wanted to target these players , I would make an offer to Ladd in the [ $ 1,559,771 - $ 3,119,539 ] range and to Hjalmarsson in the [ $ 1,029,449 - $ 1,559,770 ] range .
A team like the San Jose Sharks could use a tough minutes guy like Ladd or a top four defenseman on the cheap like Hjalmarsson .
New York Rangers
Dan Girardi ( $ 1,600,000 )
Marc Staal ( $ 800,000 )
Staal has become the Rangers go - to defenseman in any and all matchups .
Even though he 's young , his qualcomp is that of a veteran and he is a very steady presence for the Rangers .
Girardi was Tom Renney 's pet project , but has grown into a very reliable second - pairing defenseman .
Stall immediately provides value at $ 3,750,000 - $ 4,000,000 and on a long - term deal and Girardi should be of value in the $ 2,750,000 - $ 3,000,000 range .
Both the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Los Angeles Kings seem like a natural fit for an offer like this .
Montreal Canadiens
Carey Price ( $ 2,200,000 )
Jaroslav Halak ( $ 800,000 )
Any general manager that is high on goaltending would be apt to make a move like this , but the man with the history of giving exorbitant contracts to goaltenders , Dale Tallon , already has an organization stocked with them .
Halak 's playoff run came at a really lucky time for him as Montreal is likely going to pay him more than he 's worth which could be up to $ 5,000,000 per season .
That leaves Price , the kid with the pedigree and the bad reputation in the lurch .
Would a team in need of a goaltender and a general manager that perhaps overvalues goalies give Price a long - term offer in the $ 2,500,000 - $ 3,000,000 range in exchange for a 2nd round pick ?
Maybe that team would be the San Jose Sharks if they are n't going to chase after a big - name goalie .
Washington Capitals
Eric Fehr ( $ 800,000 )
Jeff Schultz ( $ 700,000 )
Tomas Fleischmann ( $ 700,000 )
Like the Blackhawks ' RFAs , none of the Capitals on this list are worthy of a large contract .
But Jeff Schultz is an underrated beauty of a stay - at - home guy with size and skill .
He 's easily worth $ 2,750,000 - $ 3,100,000 and a team like the Colorado Avalanche needs a defenseman just like Schultz .
They could also send an offer to Fehr for $ 1,500,000 to try and wedge Schultz out of Washington .
Edmonton Oilers
Sam Gagner ( $ 1,600,000 )
Andrew Cogliano ( $ 1,100,00 )
The Oilers are wedged against the cap again next year and if their first overall pick makes the team , that 's another $ 3,750,000 towards the cap .
Gagner has slowly progressed into an excellent young center , though he still struggles in the faceoff circle .
Cogliano has some of the best skating legs in the league and started his career with a scoring touch , but the Oilers have n't been able to find a place for him .
The Anaheim Ducks could use a young center behind Ryan Getzlaf who can eat up easy minutes and help on the power play .
An offer in the $ 4,250,000 range for Gagner and something in the $ 1,900,000 range for Cogliano should be enough to put the screws to the Oilers .
Dallas Stars
Nicklas Grossman ( $ 1,000,000 )
James Neal ( $ 800,000 )
Neal gets the headlines because he 's become a legitimate power forward in a very short amount of time .
Grossman is overlooked and underrated , but like Marc Staal , he 's handling tough minutes and doing it well .
The New York Rangers would be an ideal destination for either one of these guys , and both Neal and Grossman are worth something near the upper - bound of each salary range .
Nashville Predators
Denis Grebeshkov ( $ 3,100,000 )
Patric Hornqvist ( $ 700,000 )
Hornqvist came out of nowhere , well actually Sollentuna , Sweden , to score thirty goals last season .
Grebeshkov was the odd defenseman out in the salary cap crunch in Edmonton .
Giving a sizeable offer sheet to Hornqvist is risky , considering he has no track record , but a team like Phoenix ( provided the NHL allows them to spend money ) should make a pitch to Hornqvist to squeeze Nashville .
The downside of that move is that the NHL might look terrible when the league - owned team uses economic pressure to squeeze one of the teams in the league on a budget .
San Jose Sharks
Joe Pavelski ( $ 1,600,000 )
Devin Setoguchi ( $ 1,200,000 )
Pavelski caught hold of a lucky run in the playoffs and will turn that into millions in his next contract .
Setoguchi was demoted to the second line with Dany Heatley 's arrival and his shot rates and counting stats took a major hit .
Both are all - zone players with excellent offensive game .
Both would be excellent additions to a young team with a need for a complete forward , a team like the St. Louis Blues who are losing of one of the worst contracts in the league may be an ideal fit .
They 've got money to spend and draft picks .
Either Pavelski or Setoguchi are good value in the two targeted salary ranges and both of them are much better defensive players than Paul Kariya .
Colorado Avalanche
Chris Stewart ( $ 800,000 )
Kyle Quincey ( $ 500,000 )
Chris Stewart is big , strong , a 25 goal scorer and only 22 years old .
Quincey is a good all - around defenseman , one of only two Avs that did n't look out of place in the playoffs .
Though both deals would be enormous raises , the Detroit Red Wings could use both of these kids , especially Stewart .
Offer Quincey something in the area of $ 3,500,000 and Stewart $ 2,750,000 - $ 3,100,000 and hope that Colorado is n't ready to match .
Stewart skating on the wing instead of Todd Bertuzzi is a major upgrade for Detroit .
Phoenix Coyotes
Wojtek Wolski ( $ 2,800,000 )
Martin Hanzal ( $ 1,000,000 )
We it and loathe it ; we admire but are also suspicious of those who are good at it ; we place it in such high esteem that we make children study ( or pretend to study ) it almost every day of every year that they are in school ; and we use it as a major criterion for college entry .
We put math on a pedestal and then we avert our eyes , or else we spit at it -- as happens with most things that we put on pedestals .
Math is that school subject that we can't BS our way through .
That 's one thing that makes it so scary to so many .
There are right and wrong answers to every question , no partial credit .
It also seems to many people that math performance reflects basic .
To do badly is to come across as logically inept , so fear of failure is even greater in math than in other school subjects , and fear of failure always inhibits learning .
I suppose the reason math counts so much on the SAT and ACT college admissions tests is that people think it is an index of general reasoning ability .
But they are wrong .
The first step in coming to grips with math is to knock it off its pedestal .
The real - life problems that are important to us are problems like these :
Whom should I marry ?
Should I marry ?
Should gays be allowed to marry ?
What should I go into and how should I prepare for it ?
If I invent gizmo X , will people buy it ?
Should corporations have the same constitutional rights as individuals ?
What 's the best way to unplug the toilet ?
Math plays little if any role in solving such problems , nor do such problems have clear - cut right or wrong answers , demonstrable by some formula .
Human intelligence and reasoning reside in , not math .
Wisdom is the ability to bring one 's values , likes and dislikes , knowledge about other people and their likes and dislikes , and general knowledge of the world together in a manner that leads to workable solutions to the problems that confront us -- solutions that promote our own and others ' and decrease our own and others ' miseries .
Math has its purposes , indeed it has some valuable purposes in our modern world , but it is far from the core of intelligence .
Humans were intelligent long before math was invented .
Some of the smartest people I know -- even some of the best scientists I know -- are not particularly good at math .
The second step in coming to grips with math is to realize that math is not particularly difficult .
There is nothing magical about it .
You do not need some natural gift beyond that of a normal human brain to do it .
Nor does it require the thousands of hours of study that we try to force upon school children .
In fact , those thousands of hours of forced work at math , done for a grade and not for fun or for any practical use , are what make math seem so difficult and intimidating .
The best evidence I know that math is not hard comes from the experiences of people involved in the unschooling movement and the Sudbury " nonschool " school movement .
I have written about these movements in previous posts .
Unschoolers are homeschooling families that do not provide a curriculum for their kids or evaluate their learning in any formal way .
Sudbury schools are those that are modeled after the Sudbury Valley School , where kids of all ages are free all day to interact with whomever they choose and pursue their own interests .
Unschoolers and Sudbury schoolers defy our cultural beliefs about what kids must do to succeed in our society .
All available evidence shows that the kids in these settings grow up to become happy , productive , ethical members of the larger society , who continue to take charge of their own lives and learning throughout adulthood ( for references to research on Sudbury Valley graduates , see my post of Aug. 13 , 2008 ) .
Several weeks ago I invited readers of this blog to send me stories about the self - directed learning of math .
A total of 61 readers kindly responded , some with beautifully written pieces that could be stand - alone essays .
I am extraordinarily .
Most of the stories came from unschooling parents who described math learning that they observed in their kids .
It has taken me several days to organize and analyze qualitatively these stories to extract the common themes , but now I have completed that task in at least a preliminary way and am ready to relay those themes to you .
I have found it convenient to organize the stories into four categories based on the primary motive that seemed to underlie the math learning that was described .
I have labeled the four categories as : playful math ( which might also be called " pure math " ) , instrumental math ( math learned as a tool to solve problems encountered in daily life ) , didactic math ( math studied according to some curriculum or plan set out by someone other than the learner ) , and college admissions math ( math learned for the explicit purpose of performing well or adequately on the SAT , or ACT , or some other test used for college admissions ) .
As I relay the stories about each of these categories of math learning my convention will be to use only the first names of the storytellers and not to use children 's names at all , as some requested anonymity .
In what follows , I have put my own comments in Italics and the words of contributors in Roman after bullets , so as to help you guide your reading if you choose to skim .
Playful Math
I 've chosen to start , most joyfully , with playful math .
Playful math is what some call " pure math . "
It is what real mathematicians do , and it is also what 4 - year - olds do .
Playful math is to numbers what poetry is to words , or what music is to sounds , or what art is to visual perception .
I will write later about math that is used as a tool in play , but now I am writing about math that is play -- math done for no other purpose than the sheer fun and beauty of it .
Playful math involves the discovery or production of patterns in numbers , just as poetry involves the discovery or production of patterns in words , and music involves the discovery or production of patterns in sounds , and art involves the discovery or production of patterns in visual space .
Four - year - olds have a knack for bringing the whole world around them into the realm of play .
They play with words , so they are poets .
They play with sounds , so they are musicians .
They play with crayons , paints , and clay , so they are artists .
And they play with numbers , so they are pure mathematicians .
I 've noticed that students at Sudbury Valley , who are free of any imposed curriculum , do n't stop such play as they grow older .
They continue to play with words , sounds , paints , and numbers and often become really good at such play .
The same seems to be true for kids growing up in unschooling homes .
The earliest math play , by little kids , commonly involves the discoveries that numbers come in a fixed sequence , that the sequence repeats itself in a regular ( base - ten ) way , and that once you understand the pattern there is no end to how high you can count .
Here are three quotations from unschoolers ' stories that nicely illustrate this point :
• Evelyn wrote , of her 4 ¾ - year - old son ( who " insists that the ¾ be included " ) : " When he found out about connect - the - dot drawings , it started to click for him how numbers proceed in order .
He started counting aloud all the time , when walking , when in bed , etc. ...
The other day he was playing with one of his in - school friends , and her mother expressed shock that he did so well with the ‘ ' numbers .
. ..
He counted to thirty for her in Spanish and then told her he could count to one million in English .
So , since then , he has been counting morning , noon and night .
This , as you can imagine , can sometimes be hard on others , and we have to remind ourselves it 's a good thing !
...
He is now at 5068 ....
And when I tell people he is counting to one million , he says , ‘ No , ten million . '
I hope I can survive it ! "
• Lucy , in the UK , wrote about her son who has just turned 5 : " He counted to one hundred once just for the fun of it whilst getting dressed .
It was the first time I realized he could do that !
He loves to line up number magnets and get me to tell him what the number is , particularly when the number goes into the millions !
He can work out what a number is into the thousands from playing with fridge magnets .
He has learned about odd and even numbers from walking around locally and noticing the numbers on houses .
He can recognize them in other contexts now .
He also learned to count in twos by predicting the next house number .
We have never done any formal arithmetic or written anything down . "
• Kathy wrote : " Our oldest son , who is 6 , has always been fascinated by numbers .
He could count to 199 before the age of 4 .
He loved to count , and to have me count , and to do rhythmic things with his body .
He would jump while I counted , or bounce on the couch .
He started on math when he wanted to know how many things he would have if he doubled them .
We went through a doubling phase ! "
In their continued math play , young children often discover the basic concepts of adding , subtracting , multiplying , dividing , and more .
Once they have the concepts , the actual ways of performing these operations come easily .
Here are a few quotations from the many stories that reinforced this idea :
• Janet wrote , of her young daughter : " She developed counting skills as most toddlers do , using fingers , food and toys , and game pieces and spaces on game boards and computer games .
...
That naturally led to adding and subtracting with fingers and objects , and then doing that in her head .
...
Often , seemingly out of the blue , she would ask questions like , ‘ Does four plus ten equal fourteen ? '
Me , ‘Yes . '
She , ‘ Then does five plus ten equal fifteen and seven plus ten equal seventeen ? '
She quickly found patterns in the adding and subtracting of numbers and would apply these rules , which she discovered on her own , and increase the values used .
This genuine interest in the patterns numbers create was most noticeable in her seventh year .
... I myself was quite terrified of math as a school child and teenager .
But I have to say that [ my experience watching and talking with my daughter ] has given me a new appreciation for math and a sharpness of mind , with regard to calculations , that I had never previously felt .
I also see real beauty in the unfolding of her relationship with numbers . "
• Unschooling mom Lori wrote : " One thing just happened two minutes ago .
My younger son [ age 5 ] was building with Legos while I was in another room , and he called out to me with a smile on his face , while jumping on the couch , ‘ Mom !
What is 4 plus 4 plus 4 plus 4 ? '
I said , ‘ 16 . '
He smiled and said , ‘ What is 8 plus 8 ? '
I said , ‘ 16 . '
He smiled more and said , ‘ What is 2 plus 2 plus 2 ... ' and he got exactly the right number of 2's to go to 16 .
It was clear that he knew the answers to these questions before he asked .
These were not memorized from having been taught , but concepts that he figured out from working with Legos and playing around with the numbers in his head and on his fingers .
And he was thrilled to manipulate the numbers , all on his own .
To him , it was a game . "
• A - L wrote of her young son : " When he was 3 or 4 , one day he went into our living room where we have a large window and noticed that there were four rows of seven panes .
‘ So , ' he said , ‘ if I count to seven four times then it 's 28 . '
I do n't think we 'd ever talked about multiplication at that point , but he 'd essentially figured out how it worked and how to do it on his own from looking at the arrangement of squares .
He began experimenting with it on his own , [ putting ] buttons in rows arrayed like the panes of glass .
He still had to count up most of his answers because he had n't committed them to , but he understood how it worked and what it meant . "
• And Barbara wrote this about her unschooled young daughter : " She had just been telling me what games she and her friend had been playing , and then we were both quiet for several minutes .
All of a sudden she exclaimed , quite excitedly , ‘ Oh , I get it !!!'
I asked her what she meant , and she replied , ‘ I understand division . ' ...
She then proceeded to explain that when you have a whole of something and you want to break it up into some number of equal parts , that 's division .
Then she asked me to quiz her , and she indeed knew how to do simple division .
Before this moment we had never played around with division .
I had never given her any problems to solve , nor had I even tried to explain what it was .
...
My story does n't explain how she has learned these math concepts .
But I do know that our lifestyle gives her the time to integrate , ponder , and wonder about the things she sees and hears in the world around her .
In her own way , she gets to make the connections , puzzle things out , and test her theories .
And I am certain that when she ‘ gets ' something she will remember it and use it because it is truly her discovery . "
• Aurore wrote of her son : " One evening , at age 7 , he had brought home a pack of Skittles .
Like many kids , he likes to put them on a plate , sort them by color and play with them .
On this day he had nine left and arranged them into three rows of three .
He said , ‘ you know , the number nine is a square . '
I told him that 's what it 's called , a square number , and that he could also make a square with four rows of four .
He ended up making bigger and bigger squares ...
When it became impractical to keep making squares with skittles ( too big ) , or perhaps because he was just getting bored with doing that , he used a calculator to find more square numbers and wrote them down . "
Some readers are no doubt thinking , " Well , a good teacher can use these sorts of demonstrations to teach math and thereby help children learn more quickly and efficiently than they could through self - discovery . "
But the problem with such reasoning is that every child is different and no teacher , no matter how brilliant , can get into every child 's mind and come up with just the trick that will engage that mind at that exact time .
That 's why self - learning -- learning in which the child is in charge -- is almost always , in the long run , more efficient and enduring than anything that can be taught by even the most brilliant teacher .
Instrumental Math
Math is not just play .
It is also a useful instrument ( tool ) in our daily lives , and to that extent we naturally learn it in our daily lives .
Most of the math stories sent to me included at least some account of learning math as a tool in daily living .
Here are a few choice quotations from those stories :
• Amy , a homeschooling mother of seven , wrote : " They all know how to divide and multiply , calculate percentages , add and subtract , just by handling money and cooking .
I 'm sure it helps that they have to share limited amounts of yummy snacks not only among the 7 of them but with various friends who are always around .
Food and money teach kids a LOT of math , and it highly motivates them . "
• Anne wrote : " All five kids learned to read recipes , measurements , how to divide and how to double or triple a recipe 's ingredients .
They read maps and figured out the mileage .
They all played various card games and board games that use numbers and / or reasoning skills -- Uno , Skip - bo , Pinochle , etc .
As they became involved in local sports , they learned how to keep the scorebook and figure out averages .
One son learned how to make a spreadsheet to keep track of his team 's batting averages .
They all kept their own ledgers in their bank savings accounts . "
• Vincente , a staff member at a Sudbury school , sent me this cute story : " Somehow we always end up with a lot of loose change , which needs to be rolled to be deposited .
One of our very young students chose to do this [ with my help ] .
We make stacks of five and count to fifty , stack and roll .
This is just the beginning ; it gets better .
... A week later I 'm dodging vampires .
Another of our mega - young invites me to play in one of the first role - playing adventures he 's running .
...
The penny - counter and others are watching us , learning .
The dungeon master rolls 4 fives in a dexterity check , his vampire executing a superb jump and spin landing on one hand on a pencil thin branch .
Out of secondary hearing the penny - counter 's words clink into the space reserved for Peter 's blog : ‘ four times five is twenty , five four times is twenty . '
Commutative property of multiplication -- check . "
• And this , from Jennifer : " Three years ago , my son [ at age 8 ] was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes .
Now , every meal is math .
We calculate total carbohydrates from nutritional labels , total carbs for a meal , carb to insulin ratios by time of day , correction factors , percentages , etc .
Now he NEEDS to know math to stay alive .
He still hates memorizing times tables .
...
If I asked him , " What is 3x6 ? " I just got a blank stare .
Then one day at lunch he wanted cookies , so I said , ‘ OK , if each cookie has 6 grams of carb and you are going to eat 3 , how much carb is that all together ? '
Without even blinking , he replied , ‘ 18 ' .
But it 's not just food and money .
Here 's another example :
• Beatrice wrote : " Playing the piano , my daughter told me she was doing math .
She was encountering fractions -- half notes , quarter notes , eighth notes , sixteenth notes , all in musical notation as well as in patterns and rhythm . "
Many of the stories sent to me about instrumental math had to do with games .
Most of the games that kids play today involve numbers , at least to keep score ; and many of them involve really complicated math , which the players pick up eagerly in order to play the game .
Here are a few representative quotations :
• H wrote : " I have 3 kids attending a democratic free school with no imposed curriculum .
My kids have spent a lot of time playing online games .
Real games , not those stupid educational ones .
My 11 - year - old son plays MapleStory and has figured out complex mathematical structures to play the game .
‘ If I want to buy this helmet for this amount , how many hours do I have to play making this amount per hour in order to buy the helmet ?
If I sell this item in the market and the fee to sell is a certain percentage , how much will I have left after the fee ?
If I have this percentage of experience and I make a certain percentage per hour of experience , how many hours will it take to level up ? ' ...
Plus in the game you work with three different currencies and have to be able to translate back and forth among them regularly .
Put these problems isolated from the game context to a bunch of 5th graders in ‘ real ' school and ask them to show their work and see what you get . "
• Rebecca wrote : " Before my oldest son was ‘ school age ' he learned to solve basic math problems so that he could save the world from enemy invaders . "
• Gillian wrote : " My 10 year old and 5 year old are unschooled and there is no way to avoid them being exposed to math if they live a stimulating life .
In particular , the computer and PS3 games that my son plays -- World of Warcraft , Second Life , Uncharted , City of Heroes -- have math concepts built into them in a completely natural way .
I do not particularly like games that are deliberately ' educational ' and my children have never liked them .
Any time I have tried to direct them to those games they lose interest very quickly , perhaps because those games are often condescending in tone and less complex than a well - designed game .
But give them intelligent games to play and almost inevitably they learn lots of things that schools try to cover in the school syllabus , and they learn them in a much more natural and effortless way . "
• And Erica wrote : " My sons ( ages 11 and 7 ) made up a game together called ‘ Draw Fight ' .
It 's a strategy game that uses addition and subtraction .
Each of them draws their own character and ... each character gets 50 points to spend at the beginning of the game towards his fighting skills , weapons , health , and armor .
Choosing where to spend your points is very important because some of the things are worth more than others .
After each player has had a turn to attack , you must add up your damage points done to the enemy character and subtract points that were taken from your character .
The player with the most points remaining at the end of the game wins . "
Beyond the world of food , games , and handling your own money , math is also an essential tool in some careers -- such in physics , engineering , and accounting .
People who freely choose such careers eagerly learn the math they need as part of their self - training , regardless of any deficiency in their previous math .
Here are quotations from three stories about math for careers :
• Terry , a homeschooling ( but not unschooling ) mom , wrote : " My oldest always balked at math ....
He fought me about doing any math workbooks and I started asking for less and less in the way of math .
...
We stopped after 5th grade .
He had always enjoyed pretty much unlimited computer time and enjoyed writing games and programs in a self - taught way .
He was offered [ at age 17 ] an internship doing programming at a company that auctions municipal bonds .
He did so well that they hired him and he is still working there at age 20 .
He really has a knack for programming and finds the bond and tax stuff fascinating .
He is often on the phone with big - time bank executives who have no idea that they are talking to someone so young .
He still can't tell you what 6 times 7 is without having to add it in his head .
He took placement tests to get into community college and did badly on the math part and was supposed to take a remedial math class .
This bothered him because you have to pay to take the remedial math , but you do n't get credit for it .
So ... he did two days of math study [ my emphasis ] and re-took the test .
This time he placed out of both the remedial math and the basic math courses .
If he sees a reason to learn something , he will do it .
Otherwise , forget it ! "
• Dan , a Ph.D. candidate in anthropology , wrote to me explaining that the out - of - context math courses he took in college left him poorly trained for the statistics he needed in his graduate work .
He added : " Through a lot of self - teaching and a little mentorship , I am [ now ] better at statistics than most of the professors I encounter . "
• A colleague of mine , a highly esteemed biologist whose work includes the development of mathematical models , wrote in an autobiographical sketch that he performed poorly in math in high school and college and learned little .
He wrote : " I took one year of math in college , freshman calculus , and it almost killed me .
In graduate school I had strong reason to learn math so I did .
I purchased Calculus for Dummies , practiced hard , and pestered more knowledgeable graduate students when I got stuck .
It was n't exactly fun , but every time I figured something out I had a feeling of triumph that motivated me to take the next step .
I published my first theoretical paper while still a graduate student and now I 'm a well - known theoretical biologist . "
Didactic Math
If this were a typical article about math education , it would be entirely about didactic math -- math as it is taught by " expert " educators to naïve students .
Our society is so convinced that this is how math must be learned that even parents who become unschoolers are often reluctant , at first , to give up the formal or semi- formal teaching of math .
They tend , for awhile , to succumb to the cultural beliefs that ( a ) math must be learned to be successful in our society and ( b ) math is no fun , so most people will not learn it on their own .
But over time , watching their kids , they change their minds and stop the instruction .
Here are two quotations that nicely express these points :
• Rebecca wrote : " With my son 's apparent agreement , we succumbed to using a packaged program , with a video component ....
And then it happened .
Both my son and I lost our enthusiasm .
He was bored .
I did n't like the way things were going in the material ... repetition , repetition , and more repetition .
So , after internal writhing , I pried my white - knuckled hands from the crutch of the packaged , predictable , lock - step curriculum and told my son that I was done with my part in making that happen .
...
Letting go of the math curriculum ( and expectations ) has been a huge weight off of my mind .
For so many years I had a split home - learning --‘ we unschool , except in math . '
I was all tied up in knots about math and felt I had to strongly encourage ( coerce ? ) my son to adopt a traditional approach to learning it . "
Rebecca went on to explain that her initial concern for teaching math had to do with expectations about college .
For years she could n't let go of the idea that her son must attend college to have a good life and he must learn math in order to get into college ( even though he was not yet 9 years old ! ) .
• Carin2 Learn wrote : " I confess that it was a moment of almost - that motivated me to show my son the math worksheet website .
...
He also claimed he wanted a math workbook .
I bought him one , and it remains unused .
Thankfully there is more to math than sitting down and writing . "
A number of other respondents pointed out that math lessons and programs are easy for kids who choose to do them and are allowed to do them in their own ways , on their own schedules .
Here are several quotations to that effect :
• Carlotta wrote , about her son who did no formal math lessons until age 12 : " He then shot through Key Stage 3 Maths in about 3 weeks of doing just a little bit here and there .
He found it almost ridiculously easy , doing things like memorizing his tables ( with some interest in the various patterns that he spotted ) in less than an hour .
Trigonometry easy peasy , equations no problem .
... OK , so he had spent a considerable amount of his younger years playing the markets on Runescape and solving other mathematical problems in various ( fun ) games ... but that had been it .
SOO much less sweat . "
• Fawn wrote : " My 11 - year - old daughter was home schooled for grades 2 - 5 .
We did very little formal math instruction , maybe an hour a week total .
She had a workbook she could do when she felt like it , and if she had a question I would briefly explain , but she was pretty much on her own .
At the end of 4th grade she scored way above grade level on a standardized math test .
She is now in 6th grade in a traditional school , at her request , and she has a 94 average in math . "
• Leslie wrote : " We did some hands - on stuff , but honestly , I was handicapped by my own math education to the point that when I would try to explain to my kids how to do something , one of them would interrupt me and say , ‘ you 're confusing me -- this is how I do it ' and then explain some much more elegant way of coming to the right answer that showed me that they had a much better understanding of HOW math worked than I ever did .
It always humbled me . "
• An anonymous commenter on my last post wrote : " One friend of mine was an unschooler and the extent of her son 's math education was reading Murderous Maths when he felt like it .
At 14 he decided he'd like to take algebra at the community college .
He picked up a textbook and learned all of arithmetic in a few weeks .
Another friend put her son into school at 5th grade .
After the testing the school said her son would never be at grade level by the end of the year .
He caught up in a month . "
• Chris , whose daughter went to a traditional school , wrote : " [ She ] was diagnosed with .
In grade school she could intuitively give me the answers to complex homework math problems involving large fractions or long division , but she did n't consciously know how she got the answers .
She would weep loudly when I tried to show her the steps to ‘ write out ' the problem for her homework , wailing , ‘ That is not how the teacher told me to do it !'
Then she would try to work out what to her were the meaningless magical steps of long division that she could not remember correctly and so never gave her the right answer .
She refused to accept my version of the ‘ steps , ' even though it gave the right answer , because it was not the way her teacher told her to do it . "
College Admission Math
And now , finally , we come to the math that middle - class parents most worry about .
For some odd reason we have decided , as a society , that all young people who go to college -- even those who want to become poets or linguists -- must show their mettle on a test of ability to do a certain amount of algebra , geometry , and trigonometry that they will never again use as long as they live .
And so , some companies make lots of money tutoring kids -- kids who have already ‘ taken ' thousands of hours of math in school -- to do those tests .
And quite often the tutoring does the trick because the young people at this point want to learn what they must to get into the college of their choice .
Then they can promptly forget , forever , the math that they had put into their temporary memory banks .
Here are two pieces about how unschooled kids prepare for the math SAT or ACT .
• Leslie wrote this about her son who was entirely unschooled until he went to college : " The first real formal math he did was when he studied for the ACT test .
When he was younger , we had math workbooks and even a couple textbooks around the house , but they barely got looked at .
... The ‘ dirty little secret ' about math is that it just does n't take as long to learn it as we 're culturally indoctrinated to believe it takes .
My son learned enough math in just a few weeks to get a 33 on the ACT test just by studying some ACT test prep books . "
[ Note :
In the United States , the ACT is most commonly used in the middle states and the SAT is most commonly used on and near the two coasts . ]
• To find out more about how kids with no formal math training deal with college admissions math , I interviewed Mikel Matisoo , the Sudbury Valley staff member who is most often sought out by students who want help in preparing for the math SAT .
He told me that the kids who come to him are usually those who have relatively little genuine interest in math ; they just want to do well enough on the SAT to get into the college of their choice .
He said , " The way the SAT is structured it is relatively easy to prepare directly for it ; there are certain tricks for doing well . "
Typically , Mikel meets with the students for about 1 to 1 ½ hours per week for about six to ten weeks and the students may do another 1 to 1 ½ hours per week on their own .
That amounts to a range of about 12 to 30 hours , total , of math work for kids who may never before have done any formal math .
The typical result , according to Mikel , is a math SAT score that is good enough for admission to at least a moderately competitive college .
Mikel explained that the kids who are really into math , and who get the top SAT scores , generally do n't seek him out because they can prepare on their own .
--
And so , dear parents , please stop worrying about your kids ' learning of math .
If they are free to play , they are likely to play with math and learn to enjoy its patterns .
If they live real lives that involve calculations , they will learn , in their own unique ways , precisely the calculations that they need to live those lives .
If they choose to go to college , they can learn quickly - - from a test preparation book , program , or tutorial -- the specific math tricks necessary to do well enough on college admissions math .
If they choose some career that involves math , they will eagerly find ways to learn the specific kinds of math that they need for that career .
Your worry is only a hindrance .
And so , dear educators , please step out of your boxes and take a look at these remarkable educational movements -- the unchooling and Sudbury movements -- and study them to see , from a different point of view , how education can work in such a painless and joyful manner when kids are free and in charge of their own learning .
Nobody , at least no student , benefits from the thousands of hours of forced math " study " that we put kids through in our schools .
The same amount can be learned in a small fraction of that time by kids who are free .

Niger
Aid organisations are warning that millions of people are facing starvation from drought and crop failure in the West African country of Niger , and some people are turning to desperate measures to survive .
Famine hit Niger in 1984 and 2005
If you look up " bo " on the internet , nothing that makes sense comes up .
But we were looking at a bo , or rather looking for it .
We were walking along the bank of the Niger river , searching for the tracks of a hippopotamus that was ravaging the corn on Karim 's farm .
All of a sudden , a lizard about the size of a small crocodile hurtled out of the undergrowth and raced up a nearby baobab tree .
" It 's a bo , " everybody cried , racing to the foot of the enormous tree .
Now I had never seen a bo before , so I was interested out of pure curiosity .
The handful of villagers with us had other ideas , though .
" The bo is delicious , " explained Karim .
" It has the taste and texture of fish , and the inside of it is all white .
" You do n't see them very often .
There are not that many about . "
Moustafa , Karim 's head man , was talking excitedly into his mobile phone .
" He 's calling the kids from the village , " explained our host .
" He wants them to climb the tree and get the poor creature down . "
It was hardly surprising , I thought , that the bo was scarce .
It is rotten luck to be a delicious animal in a land where people are hungry .
Tortured beauty
For people are hungry in Niger .
The rains failed last year and the staple diet of millet is running out .
Cattle are finding it hard to survive
There was famine in 1984 , and again in 2005 .
Now it is about to happen once more .
We travelled north to Tillaberi , a rolling landscape of sand , wind - blown dust , and sparsely scattered bushes and trees , seemingly in the very last stages of desiccation .
Here and there were thin cows , beautiful cows with tall horns , but with their hides hanging from fleshless frames .
The goats , too , the lovely black and white African goat , that looks as if it were jet black but had the front part of the body dyed white , have long ago given up hope of finding even the least scrap of sustenance from the parched earth .
As we travelled on , the country became even more barren , with here and there a dead cow , others on their last legs , moving like wraiths among the leafless trees .
This is not to say that the place was devoid of beauty .
It possessed a tortured and hellish majesty .
At length we emerged from the nothingness we had passed through to a strange and unexpected scene : the wells of Timbouloulag .
Dotted amongst the sparse trees were a dozen low mounds .
On the top of each was a hole , the edges of which were defined with twisted logs , set flush into the ground , like wooden lips .
Standing forlornly among the trees were scores of animals , patiently waiting to drink .
Hope among despair
In the shade of a particularly leafy tree sat a group of women , each enveloped in robes of beautifully printed cotton .
Standing nearby , at one of the wells , was a corresponding group of men .
Akili Mayaki hopes for a brighter future " Salaam alaikum . "
They smiled in welcome as we shook their hands .
They were a dozen or so , and they looked truly magnificent , tall and graceful with skin of flawless black , and swathed in robes of blue , black and white .
A proud - looking man stepped forward as spokesman .
He was Akili Mayaki , about 50 years old , and wearing a blue - and - white - striped djellaba and an immaculate white turban .
His people were destitute .
Many of their cattle , their sole source of support , were now too weak to stand .
There was hope that this year the rains would not fail , and that somehow they would come through .
Hope there was too for the future , with improving education perhaps it would never get this bad again .
Finally , I asked him what I really wanted to know : how did he feel about this land he lived upon ?
Would he ever leave and go to the city in search of a less precarious existence ?
Akili looked at me weighing his words , then he said : " When the rains come , and all these trees burst into leaf and flower , and the earth is deep in lush grass , then I tell you there is no more beautiful place on this earth .
" I would not leave here , not even to go to Paris . "
Tatola leaves are soaked and cooked for three hours before eating Next , I turned to talk with the women .
Who reclined , each with her baby , in the dappled shade .
They had a tin bowl full of what looked like dried bay leaves .
" These are the leaves of the Tatola tree , " said the young spokeswoman .
" We boil them and pound them and add a little salt , then we put them with the millet husks , which are all we have left now .
" The husks do not satisfy our hunger , but if we add some boiled leaves , it helps . "
Much later , far away back home in Spain I got an e-mail from Karim .
The village kids were still camped beneath the baobab , waiting for the poor bo to come down .

There ’s no point in letting BP take all the blame for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill .
Since the oil rig exploded more than two months ago , Texas - based petroleum company Anadarko has stayed mostly under the radar , letting BP sink slowly into infamy .
But just when the world needed a new villain , the 25 percent owner of Deepwater Horizon surfaced when it attempted to distance itself from BP and legal liability .
“ The mounting evidence clearly demonstrates that this tragedy was preventable and the direct result of BP ’s reckless decisions and actions , ” said Anadarko CEO Jim Hackett in a statement last week .
“ BP ’s behavior and actions likely represent gross negligence or willful misconduct and thus affect the obligations of the parties under the operating agreement . ” ( emphasis mine )
As TPMmuckraker ’s Rachel Slajda notes , use of the phrase “ gross negligence or willful misconduct ” is very intentional .
But , needless to say , BP does n’t expect to shoulder all the responsibility for the spill .
“ Other parties other than BP may be responsible for costs and liabilities … We expect those parties to live up to their obligations , ” a BP spokesman told TPM .
In a word , this is going to get messy .
As we ’ve written before on the GJEL blog , the BP oil spill has set off a bevy of tough class action lawsuits claiming injury and economic damage in the months following the spill .
And even before Anadarko jumped into the mix , defendants and plaintiffs waged a turf war , each side attempting to get a “ home court advantage . ”
BP , for example , wants the class action suits and multidistrict litigation ( MDL ) tried in Houston , which one Louisiana lawyer called “ the epicenter of the oil and gas business worldwide ” where “ almost every one of those judges there would be related in some way to the oil industry . ”
Meanwhile , plaintiffs continue to push for New Orleans , which has suffered the vast majority of the spill ’s damage and could be more sympathetic to victims .
Thanks to its 25 percent ownership of Deepwater Horizon , Anadarko would have surfaced as a potential defendant sooner or later .
But unless the company can prove that BP is responsible for all of the “ gross negligence or willful misconduct ” that contributed to the spill , Anadarko will become another public punching bag in addition to jumping feet first into the legal firestorm about to engulf BP .
We ’ll keep you posted .

A vast ocean covered the northern lowlands of Mars some 3.5 billion years ago , suggest planetary scientists .
In the current Nature Geoscience journal , Gaetano Di Achille and Brian Hynek of the University of Colorado , Boulder , looked at Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter ( MOLA ) measurements made from NASA 's 1996 Mars Global Surveyor .
The pair find 17 of 52 delta features appearing in the data correspond to a common sea level , suggesting an ocean once covered about 1/3 of Mars .
" Collectively , these delta front elevations approximate an equipotential surface at the mean elevation of - 2,540 m ( - 8,333 feet ) with a standard deviation of 177 m ( 580 feet ) .
Indeed , a contour traced at this elevation effectively outlines acomplete closure within and along the margins of the northern lowlands , delineating the boundary of the basin within which the deposits formed , " says the study .
The contour corresponds to an " Arabia shoreline " feature noted by earlier studies .
Valleys feeding the ocean all seem to occur at about the same heights with distance from the vanished sea :
" The latter observation probably suggests a progressive retreat of the ocean after its maximum extension during the Late Noachian .
Furthermore , the distribution and outlet elevation of the 210 known martian palaeolakes within open basins is also consistent with the elevation of the enclosure : a negligible number of lake outlets show terminations below this level , " says the study .
All told , the ocean would have covered 36 % of Mars to an average depth of 1,805 feet .
" Collectively , these results support the existing theories regarding extent and formation time of an ancient ocean on Mars and imply that surface conditions during that time probably allowed the occurrence of a global and active hydrosphere integrating valley networks , deltas and a vast ocean as main components of an Earth - like hydrological cycle , " conclude the authors , at about the time that life was getting started in oceans on Earth .

Europe ’s media warn of global social unrest
2 June 2010
When Karl Marx wrote in the Communist Manifesto that “ a spectre is haunting Europe , ” he did so on the eve of the revolutionary eruptions that began in Italy and France in 1848 and engulfed much of the European continent .
In recent days , a number of media commentaries have predicted a similar eruption of social unrest of revolutionary dimensions as a direct result of the worsening economic crisis .
These warnings are accompanied by dire predictions that Europe will suffer the return of nationalist tensions , the emergence of fascist movements and even war .
Writing in the Financial Times May 24 , for example , historian Simon Schama stated , “ Far be it for me to make a dicey situation dicier but you ca n’t smell the sulphur in the air right now and not think we might be on the threshold of an age of rage . … in Europe and America there is a distinct possibility of a long hot summer of social umbrage . ”
Schama notes that there is often a “ time - lag between the onset of economic disaster and the accumulation of social fury , ” but after an initial period of “ fearful disorientation , ” there comes the danger of the “ organised mobilisation of outrage . ”
This outrage will be directed against the super - rich and those seen to be responsible for the crisis , he writes , comparing “ our own plutocrats ” with the financiers so memorably targeted during the French Revolution of 1789 as “ rich egoists . ”
In the Observer of May 30 , Will Hutton , its former editor and now an advisor to the British Conservative - Liberal Democrat coalition government on cutting public sector pay , declares , “ The future of Europe is in the balance .
The potential disintegration of the euro will be a first - order economic and political disaster .
Economically , it will plunge Europe into competitive devaluations , debt defaults , bank bailouts , frozen credit flows , trade protection and prolonged stagnation .
Politically , whatever resolve there is to hold our disparate continent together , where the old enmities and suspicions are never far from the surface , will evaporate . …
What will emerge will be a Europe closer to the 1930s .
Fearful , stagnant and prey to vicious racist and nationalist ideologies . ”
By far , the most apocalyptic warning of what is to come was made by Deutsche Welle , Germany ’s international broadcaster , on May 26 .
Its article begins by returning to the warnings made in 2008 of the impact of the global economic collapse by United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon , IMF head Dominique Strauss - Kahn and Robert Zoellick , head of the World Bank .
Strauss - Kahn had , for example , warned that “ social unrest may happen in many countries — including advanced economies . ”
Deutsche
Welle writes that these warnings are “ closer today than at any other time since this current financial crisis — the worst since 1929 — began . ”
Citing the demonstrations by hundreds of thousands in Greece , it warns that the same fate can engulf “ financially fragile European governments like Spain , Portugal and Italy ” and that “ nations all around the world are concerned about rising social discontent . ”
“ There is a feeling among experts that the deep anger brewing in these countries is fermenting worldwide against the same institutions , the same people , and the failure of global capitalism , ” the report continues .
It cites how the US director of national intelligence , Dennis C. Blair , warned the Senate Intelligence Committee of a continued economic crisis “ increasing the risk of regime - threatening instability , ” from which “ the United States would not be immune . ”
Deutsche Welle concludes with comments by Marie - Hélène Caillol , the president of the European Laboratory of Political Anticipation think - tank , and Gerald Celente , the financial and political trends forecaster and publisher of the Trends journal .
Celente explains , “ What ’s happening in Greece will spread worldwide as economies decline . …
We will see social unrest growing in all nations which are facing sovereign debt crisis , the most obvious being Spain , Ireland , Portugal , Italy , Iceland , the Ukraine , Hungary , followed by the United Kingdom and the United States . ”
Calliol states , “ This crisis is directly connected to the end of the world order as we know it since 1945 — and even earlier since the European colonisation process .
Therefore , the whole global fabric centred on the US for 60 years is slowly collapsing , generating turmoil of all sorts . ”
Asked where social unrest will end , she replies , “ War .
It ’s as simple and as horrifying as that . ”
Both Calliol and Celente reject claims that agitators are behind the wave of social unrest .
“ There are no organisations behind this response — it ’s a public response , ” said Celente , who also invokes Marx ’s monumental work .
“ This is a 21st century rendition of the ‘ workers of the world unite . ’
The people are fully aware of the enormous bailout going to the ‘ too big to fail ’s ’ that they are being forced to pay for .
The higher the taxes go , the more jobs that are lost , the greater the levels of protest . ”
Such statements demonstrate how seriously Europe ’s rulers take the growing danger of social revolution on the continent .
That is what their advisors are telling them is the inevitable product of the worsening economic crisis .
But this is made all the more certain by their own efforts to place the entire burden on the backs of working people in the interests of the major banks and corporations — in the process setting out to destroy what remains of the welfare measures and working conditions previously won by workers .
The ruling classes of Europe are preparing for the emergence of mass working class struggles through the promotion of various middle - class fake - left organisations to prevent the development of socialist consciousness and block the political independence of the working class — the New Anti-Capitalist Party in France , the Left Party in Germany , Syriza in Greece , etc .
They are also preparing for the use of mass state repression and the introduction of dictatorial forms of rule .
The advantage presently enjoyed by the ruling class is that the working class does not have the required socialist and revolutionary perspective and leadership to mount its own counter - offensive .
Instead , those organisations falsely designated as representing the workers — above all the trade unions — act as a fifth column of big business .
Whether they organise their various one - day protest strikes , such as in Greece , Portugal , Italy and Spain , or do nothing at all like Britain ’s Trades Union Congress , the unions function as instruments for imposing austerity measures and cuts through the deliberate suppression and containment of the class struggle .
They work hand - in - glove with the employers and governments , whether these are their formally social democratic counterparts or the archest of conservative administrations .
In the end , this will only ensure that the emerging class struggle will pass over these organisations like a tidal wave .
The World Socialist Web Site shares the prognosis outlined so well by Trotsky in the Transitional Programme : “ The orientation of the masses is determined first by the objective conditions of decaying capitalism , and second , by the treacherous politics of the old workers ’ organisations .
Of these factors , the first , of course , is the decisive one : the laws of history are stronger than the bureaucratic apparatus . ”
Far from a source of complacency or fatalism , this prognosis underscores the crucial question of revolutionary leadership .
The indispensable instrument for closing the gap between the revolutionary implications of the world crisis and the present level of working class consciousness is the Marxist party .
Those who see the need for a socialist alternative should make the decision to join and build the Socialist Equality Party .

Scaling Down Thuban ’s Cores
Depending on core counts , cache , and power consumption , processors may not be running at their " best " with all cores enabled .
After all , AMD's Thuban - based Phenom II X6 1055T and 1090T share the same 6MB L3 cache as the manufacturer 's Phenom II X4s , X3s , and X2s .
Today we 're looking into the new Phenom II X6 processor 's performance , power consumption , and efficiency by testing it with all possible core counts , from six down to one .
Most people would n’t think of disabling processor cores .
After all , you ’d assume that people buy six - core CPUs for a reason .
However , our numbers show how well the Thuban architecture can scale performance and power as its core count climbs .
In the end , six cores are certainly fastest under threaded workloads , but they do n't necessarily deliver the best power efficiency .
Also , the leap from four to six cores might not be as significant to you as the move from two to four cores .
Looking at the differences between four and six cores makes sense from another perspective : as you could see in our article Meet Zosma : AMD ’s Quad - Core Phenom II X4 960T Gets Unlocked , it 's possible to unlock some AMDs processors to get additional processing cores .
Whether or not this unlocking is reliable is a different story , though , as the six - core processor was probably turned into a quad model because of yield issues on one or two cores .
This is why you should run extensive reliability testing before even thinking about putting the system into commission .

• Kissinger joins warnings of collapse in US public support • Major changes expected in Isaf force as Petraeus takes over
Barack Obama today rejected calls to abandon his Afghan war strategy and either offer an open - ended commitment to US troops fighting there or start withdrawing immediately , after his dismissal of the US and Nato commander in Kabul , General Stanley McChrystal .
Leading Republican politicians and the former American secretary of state Henry Kissinger have called on the president to drop a July 2011 deadline to begin withdrawing US troops , saying that it undermines the effort to defeat the Taliban .
Voices on the Democratic party 's left want withdrawal to begin immediately , saying the war can not be won .
But today , Obama said he intended to stick with the strategy and timetable agreed last year , while indicating that US troops could remain in Afghanistan in significant numbers well after the withdrawal is due to start next summer .
" We did not say , starting in July 2011 , suddenly there will be no troops from the United States or allied countries in Afghanistan , " Obama said at a press conference with the Russian president , Dmitry Medvedev , who sidestepped a question about whether , in light of the Soviet Union 's defeat in Afghanistan , a foreign army can expect to win a war in Afghanistan .
" We did n't say we'd be switching off the lights and closing the door behind us .
We said we 'd begin a transition phase that would allow the Afghan government to take more and more responsibility . "
Obama added that part of the strategy would include a reassessment at the end of this year .
" In December of this year , a year after the strategy has been put in place , at a time when the additional troops have been in place and have begun implementing the strategy , then we 'll conduct a review and make an assessment .
Is the strategy working ?
Is it working in part ?
Are there other aspects of it that are n't working ? " he said .
Lindsey Graham , a Republican senator who sits on the powerful armed services committee and backed Obama 's dismissal of McChrystal , said the July 2011 deadline undercut the war effort : " It empowers our enemies .
It confuses our friends .
And I think it needs to be re-evaluated . "
Graham said McChrystal 's replacement , General David Petraeus , who led the US troop surge in Iraq , had testified to Congress that he would urge Obama to delay the pullout if he believed it was unwise .
" If the president says , no matter what General Petraeus may recommend , we 're going to leave in July of 2011 , we will lose the war , " Graham said .
Kissinger , writing in the Washington Post , warned of the potential for a collapse in US public support for the conflict – similar to that which occurred during the Vietnam conflict – that could lead to a political focus on " an exit strategy with the emphasis on exit , not strategy " .
He said it was a mistake to impose a deadline for US involvement .
" The central premise is that , at some early point , the United States will be able to turn over security responsibilities to an Afghan government and national army whose writ is running across the entire country .
This turnover is to begin next summer .
Neither the premise nor the deadline is realistic , " he wrote .
But a Democratic senator , Carl Levin , the chairman of the armed services committee , called for the US to rapidly turn over responsibility for military operations to the Afghans .
" There 's a greater chance of success if people in Kandahar , in Afghanistan , see it 's their army that is in control .
It is their army that is taking the lead against the Taliban , rather than outsiders . "
Other critics of the war have noted that the article in Rolling Stone article magazine that forced McChrystal out offered a disturbing insight into the mindset of America 's frontline troops in Afghanistan .
The troops are quoted as saying that the ousted general 's strategy constrained their ability to fight the Taliban , and that they are losing the war .
In Kabul , there is a belief that changes at the top of the International Security Assistance Force ( Isaf ) are inevitable , including the purging of McChrystal 's entourage , especially the source of the anonymous quotes in Rolling Stone magazine criticising senior US officials .
Mark Sedwill , Nato 's ambassador in Kabul , who worked closely with McChrystal , said the former commander of ISAF was " an outstanding military commander " .
He said : " But the mission is bigger than one man and , in choosing General Petraeus , [ Obama ] has picked one of the absolutely finest soldiers in the world ... and exactly the right man to lead this campaign over the coming period . "
Petraeus is regarded as a good choice by those who will have to work with him because of his success in leading the " surge " in Iraq .
But even the strategy 's strongest supporters say it is a task far harder than Petraeus faced in Baghdad .
His main enemy is an unforgiving political timetable .
The scale and timing of the drawdown will depend on how the campaign is going .
If violence has decreased , it may be possible to " slow the Washington " clock , as McChrystal 's team used to say .
If things continue to look like they are going disastrously – and if this September 's Afghan parliamentary elections are a repeat of last year 's electoral fiasco – policymakers in Washington are likely to conclude the strategy is unworkable and will look for alternative ways of dealing with Afghanistan , almost certainly involving far fewer troops concentrating mostly on counter - terrorism operations against al - Qaida .
Showing progress will be tough .
Petraeus will have to demonstrate clear declines in insurgent violence in the most violent areas of southern Afghanistan , particularly in Marjah , a small farming community in Helmand that was the target of a huge Isaf offensive in February .
But progress in Helmand has been frustratingly slow , and in Kandahar , the other main target of the strategy Petraeus is inheriting , it has been delayed even though it should already have begun in earnest .
Petraeus will need to prove that strides are being made on " transition " – getting Afghanistan 's corrupt , poorly trained and undermanned army and police force in a position to take over security .
He will also need to have shown progress on country 's " reintegration " attempt to persuade mid and low - level insurgents to stop fighting and settle down in peace .
But the plan 's ambitious calls for huge numbers of jobs to be created for insurgents ( who will also be offered vocational training ) has been met with great scepticism by experts .
And though people talk of July 2011 as a " deadline " , the actual cut - off point is more like November , when Nato foreign ministers meet in Lisbon .
At around the same time there will be a US assessment of progress .
It is assumed in Kabul that Obama will want to be in a position to decide the fate of US operations in Afghanistan by his state of the union address in January .
Palladium Books received a response from the court today about Palladium ’s request for a temporary restraining order against Trion Worlds for their use of the term “ Rift . ” Palladium argued that an upcoming computer trade show in Los Angeles ( E3 , I am assuming ) appearance of Trion ’s Rift game would damage Palladium ’s trademark .
The judge ruled against Palladium ’s request for the restraining order .
However , he did schedule a hearing about the preliminary injunction next week .
I read the document and it sounds like the judge wants both parties in court to discuss the restraining order before rendering a decision .
I will post after the injunction hearing information enters the system , probably around June 10 - 11 , 2010 .
Here is the full document for your examination .

A novel engineering capstone project enables a robot to be controled using a brain - computer interface .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
A squat , circular robot scurries along the floor of a laboratory , moving left , then right , then left again , before coming to a stop .
A Northeastern University student researcher commands the gadget through a brain - computer interface that controls the movement of the robot using signals produced by his visual cortex .
The innovative technology was developed for a senior capstone project under the direction of electrical and computer engineering professors Deniz Erdogmus and Bahram Shafai .
The team members , who won first prize in the electrical and computer engineering capstone project competition , included Saumitro Dasgupta , Mike Fanton , Jonathan Pham and Mike Willard .
Erdogmus says that the technology could serve a variety of practical uses , from assisting or enhancing human cognitive or sensory motor functions in disabled or neurologically impaired users , to controlling military vehicles , light switches or TVs .
Scientific researchers have long experimented with brain - computer interfaces , but only in the last 10 years has technology advanced far enough to make the impossible possible .
“ People with disabilities will soon be able to communicate through the computer to operate wheelchairs or other vehicles or devices , ” Erdogmus says .
A user ’s ability to command the robot to move in any direction is based on a neurological principle :
When the retina experiences a visual stimulus , ranging in frequency from 3.5 to more than 100HZ , the brain generates electrical activity at the same frequency .
Team members exploited the phenomenon .
They divided a computer screen into four checkerboard patterns that flash at different frequencies and represent different control commands for the robot , including the ability to move left , right and forward .
When a user stares at one of the checkerboard patterns , the resulting brain signals are picked up by electrodes attached to the back of the head and sent to a computer software program .
The program wirelessly transmits the control command to a laptop that is mounted on the robot , moving it according to the user ’s visual cortex command .
The user can track the robot ’s whereabouts through real - time video feedback using Skype .
Noting the “ good accuracy and speed ” of his team ’s system , Dasgupta says , “ Navigating through obstacles requires a degree of fine control .
You can use this system to control different types of environments . ”
Next year , a new team of electrical and computer engineering students will advance the project a step further by designing a brain - computer interface for a wheelchair , Dasgupta says .

Amazing Pencil Drawing Art by Paul Lung

It is hard to believe these beautiful pencil drawing .
I inspired such an unbelievable art is done by 38 - year - old graphic artist from Hong Kong Paul Lung .
Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels is , predictably , getting hammered from social conservatives for his statement that the next president will have to call a “ truce ” in the culture war in order to focus on economic issues .
He has already been blasted by Concerned Women for America and the Family Research Council and right - wing activists continue to pile on :
“ When it involves life , no one can make no a truce .
There is no room for gray area , no time to play dead , and no time to stick out head in the sand .
When you realize that 1.3 million babies are aborted every year , Governor Mitch Daniels ’ words show a level of cowardice that is not expected from a presidential hopeful , ” she told LifeNews.com .
Kristan Hawkins , the president of Students for Life of America — a group that has spearheaded efforts to oppose Elena Kagan and the pro-abortion health care bill — did n’t mince words either .
“ Something like this will cost him any consideration from one of the key constituencies of the Republican Party , ” he told LifeNews.com .
Others , like Austin Ruse , president of the Catholic Family and Human Rights Institute and an early supporter of 2008 presidential hopeful John McCain , says Daniels will have a hard time winning the GOP nomination if he demurs on pro-life issues .
Even Mike Huckabee , who has steadily been working to establish himself as the champion of the socially conservative wing of the party , is getting in on the action … and using it to raise donations for his HuckPAC :
I received an astonishing email today from a concerned friend who has been very influential in the fight to end the scourge of abortion .
Apparently , a 2012 Republican presidential prospect in an interview with a reporter has made the suggestion that the next President should call for a “ truce ” on social issues like abortion and traditional marriage to focus on fiscal problems .
In other words , stop fighting to end abortion and do n’t make protecting traditional marriage a priority .
Let me be clear though , the issue of life and traditional marriage are not bargaining chips nor are they political issues .
They are moral issues .
I did n’t get involved in politics just to lower taxes and cut spending though I believe in both and have done it as a Governor .
But I want to stay true to the basic premises of our civilization .
For those of us who have labored long and hard in the fight to educate the Democrats , voters , the media and even some Republicans on the importance of strong families , traditional marriage and life to our society , this is absolutely heartbreaking .
And that one of our Republican “ leaders ” would suggest this truce , even more so .
Governor Daniels is a personal friend and a terrific Governor , and I ’m very disappointed that he would think that pro-life and pro-family activists would just lie down .
Are you ready to stop fighting for traditional marriage ?
I cannot .
I will not .
Can you let the tragedy of abortion go unchecked while we get our financial house in order ?
I cannot .
I will not .
A strong leader does n’t need to focus myopically on one or two issues – but a strong leader is willing to fight for and defend their principles while rising to meet new challenges and solve all of the existing systemic problems confronting us .
For me these issues are critical .
Indeed they are founding principles of my personal conservatism and part of the ideological foundation of the Republican Party .
If you agree , I am asking you to help me send a signal .
…
Help me raise 2,012 new donations within the next 7 days for Huck PAC .
That will help me show the importance of these issues to our Party and give us the financial resources we need to support strong conservatives who are fighting for life , traditional marriage , lower taxes , lower spending , secure borders and a strong national defense .
Help me send a strong signal – life and traditional marriage are NOT bargaining chips .

Uncontroversially , U.S. domestic oil production has been declining for roughly 40 years now , yet public policy still subsidizes its consumption ( see Peak Oil 101 ) , and , as every free - market economist will tell you , a subsidy means we over - consume it .
What could solve the growing divergence between our domestic energy supply and energy demand ?
We could continue what we have been doing :
Subsidizing oil ( $ 300 – 550 billion annually — this last is from the Financial Times )
Fight resource wars for overseas oil
Or we can start building a society with more sustainable policies :
Conservation
European building codes require the “ passivehaus ” standard of construction .
Essentially , building to this standard means a building consumes no net energy .
Amory Lovins reports that conservation is competitive with conventional energy sources now , and enlightened companies understand cutting waste gives them a competitive edge .
Food
A recent U.N. study found that raising livestock caused more climate change than all human transportation combined .
Currently U.S. agriculture is not even “ solar . ”
We burn ten calories of petroleum to produce one calorie of food .
Anna Lappé ’s Diet for a
Hot Planet systematically debunks all of the objections from the unsustainable industrial agriculture that currently dominates our food supply .
Objections that food would necessarily be more expensive , or less plentiful are all demonstrably false .
Public policy has an enormous impact .
Farm subsidies amount to 40 % of U.S. agricultural income .
Michael Pollan quotes one farmer saying “ It ’s just like laundering money for Cargill and ADM ” ( two agribusiness giants ) .
How sympathetic are Cargill and ADM to American consumers ?
Not too long ago their executives did some jail time for an illegal conspiracy to fix prices .
Personal action here would have enormous impacts .
Despite what you hear about our population eating less meat , livestock consumption is up five - fold since the 1950s .
See Dr. Barnard ’s healther diet here .
Cities
Building cities in sprawl — so all the different “ uses ” ( stores , homes , offices , etc. ) are in widely separated locations has been the American development pattern for the last half century .
That does not , however , follow traditional settlement practices .
Traditionally , neighborhoods mix uses — a corner store with offices or residences upstairs is common .
They also connect the different uses with pedestrian - friendly streets .
In England , even highways come with foot paths .
Public policy is important here , too .
The misguided sprawl planning and building codes need to be replaced by “ Smart Codes . ”
If FNMA changed its loan underwriting standards to require smart codes guide any new development , the U.S. would stop building sprawl , and start building traditional villages virtually overnight .
It takes one to raise a child , you know .
Such development would not only have the beneficial effect of reducing vehicle miles travelled ( between one - third and two - thirds ) , it would make the inhabitants healthier ( they could walk to real destinations ) , and would lay the groundwork for transit .
Who believes transit will ever work in sprawl if people can’t walk to the stops ?
As for those 100 - mile - per - gallon cars , we have them now .
They ’re called “ buses . ”
Building sprawl insures all transit must be subsidized .
In traditional mixed - use , pedestrian - friendly neighborhoods , transit can actually be profitable .
Bicycle amenities would help existing sprawl .
Current transportation spending favors highways above all else , though .
Skeptics may believe transitioning to renewables is impossible , or would mean a return to stone - age living , but Europeans and the Japanese live modern - age lives consuming only half the energy the U.S. does per dollar of GDP .
It ’s more than possible ; it ’s necessary .

Apparently Eric
Cantor thinks that instead of electing our leaders to make informed decisions after we put them in office , they should instead be taking their cues from the uninformed electorate and making decisions on how to govern based on polls .
Genius ... genius I tell you !
Okay , that said and snark aside , I guess it could n't be much worse than how they typically govern now which is based on the opinions of lobbyists and their big campaign contributors .
As our own Jon Perr pointed out , this latest gimmick of Cantor 's wo n't do much to change that .
YouCut Deficit Sham is Cantor 's Latest Gimmick :
Go read the entire post for more on Cantor 's hackery and why this latest game by Cantor and the GOP is exactly what it appears to be , just the latest attempt by them to pretend to be serious while living in opposite - land .
And from Think Progress Cantor is having a bit more trouble in the irony department with this gimmick as well when it comes to benefiting his own district and talking out of both sides of his mouth .
Will Cantor Put A Rail Project That He Supports Up For A Vote On The ‘ YouCut ’ List ? :
Congo ’s New Mobutu
You might expect that the Democratic Republic of the Congo — which suffered under what was arguably the most brutal colonial administration in sub-Saharan Africa , a dismal three decades of repression under strongman Mobutu Sese Seko , and a regional war that resulted in the deaths of some 5.4 million and counting — would want to move on from its past .
But the country ’s 50 - year independence celebration on June 30 will do exactly the opposite :
In an attempt to recreate that historic day in 1960 when Congo ’s first prime minister , Patrice Lumumba , took over the reins of leadership from Belgium ’s King Baudouin , President Joseph Kabila has invited the former colonial power ’s current sovereign , Albert II , to be the guest of honor .
Yet try as Kabila might , casting himself in the same light as Congo ’s iconic independence leader is proving a difficult sell these days .
It ’s much more accurate to say that he is the new Mobutu .
The two leaders have a disheartening amount in common .
Mobutu , archetype of the African strongman , was fond of pink champagne , leopard - skin hats , and pushing political opponents out of helicopters while his backers in Washington footed the bill .
Mobutu siphoned vast profits from Congo ’s mineral wealth and presided over a willfully dysfunctional state .
Kabila is less audacious — so far — but his government has a similar penchant for silencing political opponents .
As to his backers , it ’s true that the good old days of Cold War money have ended , but what Congo has now is equally good : loads of donors , from the World Bank , the International Monetary Fund , and the European Union to bilaterals like Britain , the United States , and France , who hold their noses but do n’t let bad politics chase them out .
Now 50 years into Congo ’s woeful history as an independent country , the stakes are as high as ever to get things right — and the consequences as dire if yet another leader chooses self - perpetuation over progress .
Why ?
Because today ’s Congo is about as dismal as a country can get .
Nearly 80 percent of the country ’s 70 million people survive on less than $ 2 a day , annual government spending on health care amounts to just $ 7 per person ( only Burundi spends less ) , and one out of every 10 infants never makes it to childhood .
Three hundred thousand refugees are still afraid to return home despite the official end of the war seven years ago , and most of the country ’s 2 million internally displaced people fled their homes since 2007 .
And even as foreign rebels and homegrown militias continue to stalk the eastern borderlands and a new rebellion gains ground in the remote north , Kabila is calling for Congo ’s U.N. peacekeeping mission — already struggling to compensate for the shortcomings of a singularly incompetent national army — to begin pulling out .
The symbolic withdrawal of 2,000 of the United Nations ’ 20,000 peacekeepers seems to have sated the young president ’s appetite for more sovereignty ahead of the June 30 celebrations .
But many fear that with further downsizing Congo could backslide into generalized chaos .
Few had heard of Joseph Kabila before 1996 when he emerged from exile in Tanzania to serve as an officer in a Rwandan - supported rebellion led by his father , Laurent .
When the rag - tag force swept practically unopposed across the vast country , Western governments reveled in Mobutu ’s downfall .
But before long , Kabila the father , with his rampant cronyism and bizarre affinity for Marxist rhetoric , was eliciting gasps of horror from the likes of U.S Secretary of State Madeleine Albright .
His decision to break with his Rwandan backers in 1998 helped plunge Congo into the deadliest conflict since World War II .
Laurent was assassinated by his bodyguard three years later , and his son , Joseph , took the reins .
It was hoped that he would be a new leader , a symbol of progress and reconciliation .
And when he won Congo ’s first democratic election in four decades in 2006 , he did so much to the relief of Western diplomats who thought him flawed , but vastly preferable to his chief opponent , the populist former warlord Jean - Pierre Bemba .
But any chance that Kabila , then 35 , would usher Congo toward a new era of freedom , democracy , and respect for human rights soon fizzled .
In January 2007 , just weeks after his swearing in , Kabila ordered police to clamp down on a small politico - religious sect known as Bundu dia Kongo , which was protesting what it alleged — and not without reason — was the rigging of the gubernatorial election in western Bas -Congo province .
More than 100 members of the sect were shot or stabbed to death , and the security forces would return about a year later and slaughter over 200 more .
" The fact that we said nothing and the U.N. hushed up their own report into the incident told Kabila everything he needed to know about how much he could get away with in the future , " one Western diplomat , who was posted to Congo at the time , told me .
Indeed , it was only the beginning .
In just three short years , Kabila ’s regime has amassed one of the world ’s worst human rights records .
The government has arrested , tortured , and murdered political opponents .
In March 2007 , hundreds of civilians were killed when clashes erupted between Kabila ’s army and Bemba ’s personal security detail on the streets of downtown Kinshasa .
In the wake of the fighting , as Bemba fled to Portugal , military intelligence officers and soldiers rounded up hundreds of politicians and activists from his political coalition , suspected supporters , and civilians from his home province of Equateur .
Around 100 cases of summary executions were reported to the United Nations during the crackdown , and investigators later discovered around 40 bodies , some blindfolded or with their hands tied behind their backs , floating in the Congo River .
From August 2006 to May 2008 , Kabila ’s elite Republican Guard alone was responsible for 125 summary executions and " disappearances , " according to Human Rights Watch .
More than three years on , the political opposition has yet to reorganize .
Backed by a docile parliament and a stacked judiciary , Kabila is left to rule with a free hand .
But " rule " would be a gross overstatement .
Africa ’s third - largest country is horribly fractured .
Roads and railways have fallen into ruin , and expensive air travel is well beyond the reach of most Congolese .
The result is an ever - deepening divide between the inhabitants of its jungle north and savannah south , its Lingala - speaking west and its Swahiliphone east , destroying national identity and fanning the flames of tribalism .
It is the country ’s lawless east where the byproduct of this callous neglect is felt most strongly , with conflict simmering and occasionally erupting .
This is where Congo ’s army — an ill - equipped and poorly trained force cobbled together under the 2003 peace deal from formerly rival government loyalists , rebels , and militia factions — commits rampant human rights abuses , including looting , rape , and murder .
In May last year , soldiers killed at least 50 Rwandan refugees in a village called Shalio , according to the United Nations .
Between May and September , Human Rights
Watch documented at least 270 killings , mostly of women , children , and the elderly , by government troops near the town of Lukweti .
And in November , the army opened fire on villages where thousands of civilians had gather to receive measles jabs from French medical charity , Médecins Sans Frontières .
These are just a few of the worst incidents that have come to light .
Against a backdrop of such lawlessness and violence , it would seem that one more death would be just a drop in the well .
After all , human rights activists and journalists have been the targets of assassination since 2005 , when leading human rights activist Pascal Kabungulu Kibembi was shot dead in the eastern city of Bukavu .
But the recent murder of Floribert Chebeya , perhaps Congo ’s most respected human rights defender , has had an unprecedented impact .
On June 1 , Chebeya was summoned to meet with General John Numbi , head of the national police force and a much - feared member of Kabila ’s secretive inner circle .
For years , the activist had been a constant thorn in the side of the regime , helping to expose the killings of Bemba supporters in 2007 and campaigning for improved prison conditions .
But perhaps his most blatant affront to Kabila was his call for an amnesty for 51 prisoners condemned for involvement in the murder of the president ’s father , Laurent .
Chebeya had been the target of threats and intimidation in the past and , in the weeks before his death , told friends he believed he was again under surveillance .
He left his office at 5:00 p.m .
A few hours later he sent a text message to his wife saying he was still waiting at Numbi ’s office .
By 9:00 p.m. that evening , when he no longer answered his phone , friends and colleagues already feared the worst .
He was found dead in the back seat of his car the next morning on the outskirts of Kinshasa ’s sprawling slums .
Details released by the police smacked of a ham - handed cover - up .
The body of the 47 - year - old was found in the backseat , surrounded by used condoms and sexual stimulants , as if he had somehow perished during a Viagra - fuelled tryst with a prostitute .
His driver had disappeared and has yet to be found .
Family members and U.N. human rights officials were given only limited access to the body , stoking further suspicion .
" Floribert Chebeya was killed in circumstances which strongly suggest official responsibility , " Philip Alston , the U.N. ’s special rapporteur on extrajudicial executions , said in a speech to the Human Rights Council in Geneva on June 3 .
The day before , Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon had offered the world body ’s assistance in investigating the alleged murder — assistance that was declined .
Meanwhile , individual countries also protested .
The United States issued a statement expressing that it was " deeply concerned . "
Britain urged Congo to carry out a full investigation .
Beyond the finger - wagging , however , there ’s been little else in the way of applying pressure or demanding transparency from Kabila ’s regime .
On paper , the West should have leverage ; donor financing amounts to $ 2.6 billion , almost half of Congo ’s 2010 budget , and that does n’t include the nearly $ 830 million the United Nations is requesting of donors for emergency humanitarian assistance and projects to prop up the failing — or non-existent — education and health care systems .
Western governments , with the United States taking the lead , also pay nearly $ 1.4 billion annually for Congo ’s U.N. peacekeeping mission — the world ’s largest .
However , the game is not that simple anymore .
After winning the 2006 elections , Kabila set out to solicit foreign investment and diversify his donor portfolio , reducing his dependence on traditional Western partners in favor of Turkey , Iran , and India .
Kabila ’s greatest coup so far was the signing of a $ 6 billion package with Beijing that essentially outsourced Congo ’s post - war reconstruction and development to Chinese companies in exchange for rights to tap lucrative copper and cobalt mines .
Chinese firms are building or rehabilitating thousands of miles of roads and rail lines , hundreds of hospitals , health centers , and schools , and thousands of homes for government employees .
Meanwhile , China ’s policy of not meddling in the internal affairs of its global partners has , for many in Kabila ’s government , come as a refreshing change from the West ’s endless lectures on good governance and human rights .
The West ’s involvement in Africa is not nearly as straightforward as it was during the Cold War .
Today , the West wants more than just friendship ; it wants change .
Institutions such as the World Bank and the IMF demand economic and political reforms in exchange for loans .
And bilateral aid often requires development gains , such as health and education .
In Congo , however , the development needs are so great that it ’s enormously difficult to contemplate pulling aid money out over governmental misbehavior .
No one wants to make a decision that would deprive children of clean drinking water or rape victims of medical treatment to prove a political point .
" To a certain extent Kabila is holding them hostage to their own development goals .
They ’ve already invested heavily .
They have to spend this money .
And they have to show that past investments were not in vain , " Jason Stearns , an independent Congo analyst and writer , said in an interview .
" They ’re also hostage to their own budgetary processes .
And he calls their bluff every time . "
That ’s exactly what he ’ll do on June 30 , when Kabila ’s triumphant moment will most likely go off without a hitch .
After grumblings from Brussels about the shady circumstances of Chebeya ’s death , Kabila duly suspended his chief of police and several other officers while investigations are carried out .
Though Dutch medical examiners were eventually allowed to assist with the autopsy , preliminary findings were inconclusive , and Congo ’s attorney general Flory Kabange Numbi said on June 3 that a joint investigation with outside participants was out of the question .
In the end , it will be a superficial inquiry and one of Congo ’s most dogged advocates for justice and human rights will still be dead .
The second coming of Mobutu should be a major cause for concern for Congo ’s destitute population — not to mention the prospects of establishing lasting peace in the region .
But apparently , it is n’t .
If the IMF goes ahead with the expected cancellation of the bulk of the country ’s $ 13.1 billion debt in the coming weeks , Kabila will get an added boost as he opens his campaign for a second and , in theory final , term .
" I see Kabila winning a second election , with the West overlooking violence and fraud that does not rise to levels which would be unacceptable politically , and then settling back into the same routine of attempting quiet diplomacy while he continues to consolidate power , " a former Kinshasa - based diplomat told me .
" And then I expect a lot of feigned surprise when Kabila forces through changes to the constitution which enable him to stay in power beyond his second term . "

The cyclists were returned to the beach at Dover by Royal Navy landing craft
Cyclists who toured the battlefields of northern France as part of the 70th anniversary of the evacuation of Dunkirk have raised £ 1 m for charity .
The money will go to forces charity Help for Heroes , originally set up to raise money for Headley Court rehabilitation centre in Surrey .
The 275 cyclists left Portsmouth a week ago and were brought back to Dover on Sunday by Royal Navy landing craft .
Some of those taking part were injured as serving members of the armed forces .
" While serving in Afghanistan my Land Rover hit an IED and smashed up my right left pretty badly , " said one of them , Cpl Marcus Selby of 60 Squadron , Logistic Support Regiment .
' Less fortunate '
" Headley Court got me off crutches and onto walking sticks and eventually walking without the aid of any stick at all .
" I just felt I needed the challenge and to raise some money for guys less fortunate than myself . "
The cyclists left HMS Victory at Portsmouth Historic Dockyard , Hampshire before taking a ferry to Le Havre .
The route to Dunkirk traced some of the Northern France 's most significant First and Second World War battle sites , including Thiepval on the Somme .
It is the third year the ride has taken place and this year the cyclists joined in the commemorations taking place in Dunkirk .
" It 's been an amazing six days and an emotional and rewarding journey , " said Bryn Parry , who founded the charity to improve facilities at Headley Court , near Epsom .
" I have been very humbled riding alongside serving military personnel and members of the British public who have taken on this awesome challenge to raise much needed funds to help our wounded troops . "

I 'm surprised how quickly the left side of the blogosphere is proclaiming that the Administration is failing to respond .
The truth is , they have been engaged every day .
If you check the link referenced above the fold , you 'd see they are actively engaged every day on this issue and provide updates on progress nearly every day .
There are some questions I have , and perhaps these open questions might be the source of discomfort among many on the left .
For example , are the dispersants the government is using the same as the ones BP is using ?
Well , there is an update regarding that , and it seems pretty clear that they are not using the same dispersents :
EPA Releases BP ’s Response to Dispersants Directive
The EPA released BP ’s response to its directive on dispersants , which required BP to evaluate available , pre-approved dispersants for toxicity and effectiveness and report back to EPA within 24 hours .
EPA will continue to work over the next 48 hours to ensure BP is complying with the directive .
BP ’s response to EPA ’s directive , as well as the directive itself , can be found here .
BP and several of the dispersant manufacturers have claimed some sections of BP ’s response contain confidential business information ( CBI ) .
By law , CBI cannot be immediately made public except with the company 's permission .
EPA challenged these companies to make more information public and , as a result , several portions of the letter can now be made public .
EPA is currently evaluating all legal options to ensure that the remaining redacted information is released to the public .
EPA continues to strongly urge these companies to voluntarily make this information public so Americans can get a full picture of the potential environmental impact of these alternative dispersants .
The numbers above the fold , as a summary , do n't cover that and leave other questions as to how effective the booms are and how much oil is actually in that oily water .
But paging through the details we find an ever expanding wildlife rescue operation in full force :
Fish and Wildlife Operations Continue to Expand Assistant Secretary of Fish and Wildlife and Parks Tom Strickland visited Robert , Port Fourchon and Delta National Wildlife Refuge to oversee wildlife rescue missions and plans .
Fish and Wildlife Service is working to expand their operations further to the west pursuant to reports of the oil spill impacting assets in that direction .
Up to 10 personnel will be based out of Grand Isle and a barge will be moved to Trinity Island .
An additional helicopter has been obtained to assist with wildlife rescue missions .
and , oh , about the effectiveness of those booms :
Wildlife Rescue Flights and Observations Inform Booming Priorities U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service conducted overflights for reconnaissance , wildlife rescue missions and bird survey missions .
One flight near the Biloxi Marsh observed two small islands with nesting colonies of pelicans , gulls , and terns .
In response , a request was submitted to place boom around these two islands .
What support is the government providing for the local people who have been impacted ?
As mentioned above , the government is holding BP accountable :
Property Damage Claims Processed
The administration will continue to hold the relevant companies accountable for repairing the damage and repaying Americans who ’ve suffered a financial loss .
BP continues to process claims via its claims website ( www.bp.com/claims) and its helpline ( 1-800-440-0858 ) .
BP reports that 23,451 claims have been opened , from which $ 27.8 million has been disbursed .
No claims have been denied at this time .
There are more than 420 claims adjusters on the ground .
To file a claim , visit www.bp.com/claims or call BP ’s helpline at 1-800-440-0858 .
Those who have already pursued the BP claims process and are not satisfied with BP ’s resolution , can call the Coast Guard at ( 800 ) 280-7118 .
There are many more details of what is going on at the White House link .
One simply has to read it .
Do n't rely on the MSM to report it .
It 's not very exciting I 'm afraid .
Government responding to a disaster in a timely fashion with intelligent operations .... that 's not the kind of thing that makes headlines or creates outrage .
But they are facts .
The government might be at a loss on how to stop the leak , but that is not stopping them from doing what they can .
The fact is , the Obama Administration is doing quite a bit .
They are n't just sitting around waiting for BP to stop the oil gushing out .
They are actively cleaning it up now and working with BP on solutions to stop it while holding BP accountable for damages and the cost of the cleanup .
And the details are there .
You just gotta click the link .
Update :
First , thanks for the rec-list and the laughs .
Some of the responses are well worth reading for a good laugh .
Secondly , this diary is not a cheerleading thread nor is time to quit sniffing glue as Fishgreese suggests I might be an apologist .
On the contrary , this diary is a response to the many blogs and diaries I 've read on the left recently that say Obama is n't doing anything .
That simply is n't true and if we are to criticize ( I believe there are yet unanswered questions and valid criticisms ) , we should at least be honest .
There is much good being done .
Let 's take the good with the bad , shall we ?
Next , I thought it was clear about the dispersants .
The government is n't using the same dispersants as BP .
Are dispersants a great thing ?
I think not .
Are they better than nothing ?
I suppose that is arguable .
But read the link , everything that is being done .
Booms , controlled burns , both surface and subsurface dispersants , wild - life rescue operations , etc .
The administration is doing many things to protect the environment given what they have to work with .
Finally , as Kitty pointed out , Obama is headed to the gulf region tomorrow :
( Natural News ) Walnuts are a rich plant source of omega - 3s , the fatty acids also found in cold water fish like salmon .
Omega - 3s are known to lower the risk of a host of health problems from depression to heart disease .
Walnuts are also loaded with gamma tocopherol ( a form of vitamin E ) , phytochemicals known as polyphenols , and antioxidants .
Scientists from the University of California - Davis just reported their discovery at the 239th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society ( ACS ) , being held in San Francisco this week .
" Walnuts should be part of a prostate - healthy diet , " Paul Davis , Ph.D. , who headed the study , said in a statement to the media .
" They should be part of a balanced diet that includes lots of fruits and vegetables .
" Approximately 190,000 men in the United States will be diagnosed with prostate cancer this year .
According to the University of California - Davis scientists , research suggests that diet is among the most important factors in influencing a man 's risk for developing prostate cancer .
For example , there 's evidence that eating tomatoes and drinking pomegranate juice may reduce the chance of ever having prostate cancer .
Recently , scientists have found that walnuts could fight cardiovascular disease by reducing levels of endothelin , a substance that increases inflammation in blood vessels .
Because men with prostate cancer are known to have elevated levels of endothelin , the University of California - Davis scientists reasoned that eating walnuts could be beneficial in preventing and / or treating prostate cancer .
Davis and his research team conducted their study on laboratory mice that had been genetically programmed to develop prostate cancer .
One group of the animals ate the equivalent of about 2.5 ounces of walnuts per day in a human diet ( equal to approximately 14 shelled nuts ) for two months .
A control group of mice did not receive any walnuts in their diet .
When the genetically induced prostate cancers developed in the walnut - fed animals , their tumors were only about half as large as those of the control mice .
What 's more , the cancers in the walnut eating rodents also grew 30 percent slower .
So what was going on in the bodies of the mice who ate walnuts ?
The researchers found those mice had lower levels of insulin - like growth factor - 1 .
That 's a crucial finding because high levels of this protein are thought to increase the risk of developing prostate cancer
To further investigate why walnuts had the ability to fight prostate cancer , the researchers used gene chip technology to track changes in gene levels in the animals ' tumors as well as in the livers of the mice .
The results showed eating walnuts had a significantly beneficial effect on both tumor and liver genes that have been shown to be involved in controlling the growth of malignant tumors .
Editor 's note : NaturalNews is opposed to the use of animals in medical experiments that expose them to harm .
We present these findings in protest of the way in which they were acquired .
I was about to say that you can't make this stuff up .
But if you 're Fox News , you can make up absolutely anything that you like .
Check out this glaring headline from the Website The Fox Nation :
If you care to read the story and watch the video associated with this headline , you can find it here .
Now , every single headline and image from that site has full - tilt conservative slant .
But there 's a difference between " slant " and " accusation of violating the territorial integrity of the United States . "
The image associated with the headline is clearly designed to make you think that the entire section of Arizona in red has somehow been ceded to Mexico .
That would be pretty alarming , would n't it !
So what 's the truth behind this ?
I 'll let Media Matters take it from here .
Ari Rabin - Havt , Vice - President for Research and Communications , sent a letter to Fox News demanding a correction of the record :
Dear Mr. Clemente : I am writing to you to demand that you correct a glaring error made both on Fox News and on Fox 's website The Fox Nation .
The Fox Nation used the preposterous headline " Obama Gives Back Major Strip of AZ to Mexico " to trumpet a report about a closure of land in a national wildlife refuge in Arizona .
During that America Live report , guest host Shannon Bream stated : " A massive stretch of Arizona now off limits to Americans .
Critics say the administration is , in effect , giving a major strip of the Southwest back to Mexico . "
But according to Bonnie Swarbrick , who is the public information officer for the Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge in Arizona , the " massive stretch " of land is about five miles square , it 's been closed since 2006 , and it obviously has n't been given back to Mexico .
Swarbrick told Media Matters that the area in the refuge bordering Mexico was " closed in 2006 during the construction of a vehicle barrier . "
Work on the vehicle barrier progressed into the construction of a 12 - foot fence along the part of the refuge that borders Mexico , which is about seven miles long .
The area has been kept closed " to allow the Border Patrol to do their work , " she said .
Swarbrick added that the small strip of land that is closed makes up " less than 0.03 percent " of the refuge and said that the rest of the reserve is still open to the public .
So let 's recap .
In 2006 , the Bush Administration closed off a five - square - mile stretch of the Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge to the public to allow the Border Patrol to improve security .
Owing to mission creep of sorts , this section stayed closed .
And how does
Fox interpret this ?
That President Obama is giving vast stretches of land back to Mexico .
Biased journalism is one thing .
Propaganda , even , is one thing .
This transcends those categories into something else altogether : blatant , intentional , pants - on - fire falsehoods designed to deliberately mislead an audience that is already primed to believe them .
It takes something extraordinary for me to characterize something this way , but this type of conduct is not just irresponsible .
It is inimical to America .
I do n’t own a pair of these but I have heard nothing but great things about them .
If anyone has a set and would like to chime in , please do !

Rapamycin is a bacterial byproduct discovered in the soil of Easter Island .
It extends the lives of animals , and now two independent studies show that it can reverse the symptoms of Alzheimer's .
Is this the drug we 've been waiting for ?
Advertisement
A study published yesterday in the Journal of Biological Chemistry confirmed that mice with Altzheimers showed marked improvement in memory and cognition after being fed a rapamycin - enhanced diet .
This study was released simultaneously with another , in PLoS One , which confirmed the results of the first in a different group of mice .
How does this wonder drug work ?
Physiologist Veronica Galvan , an author on the PLoS study , explained :
Rapamycin treatment lowered levels of amyloid - beta - 42 , a major toxic species of molecules in Alzheimer 's disease .
These molecules , which stick to each other , are suspected to play a key role in the early memory failure of Alzheimer 's . . .
The fact that we are seeing identical results in two vastly different mouse models of Alzheimer 's disease provides robust evidence that rapamycin treatment is effective and is acting by changing a basic pathogenic process of Alzheimer 's that is common to both mouse models .
This suggests that it may be an effective treatment for Alzheimer 's in humans , who also have very diverse genetic makeup and life histories .
Advertisement
Rapamycin has already been approved by the FDA to treat organ rejection in transplant patients .
That means doctors could start prescribing it for the " off label " use of treating Alzheimers tomorrow .
The researchers are still not sure if the drug would reverse the effects of Alzheimers , or simply block them .
But for millions of people suffering the effects of Alzheimers , that question may be moot .
Expect to be hearing more about this drug , and soon .
SWFDecrypt and Flash ' protection '
Now that SWF Decrypt is out there , what should I do to protect my SWF files ?
Use any other ActionScript obfuscator that can rename your classes and variables .
Use any other ActionScript obfuscator that can rename your classes and variables .
SecureSWF and irrFuscator seem to do the job well .
I plan on reversing other commercial solutions that do not rename variables .
I just came across an interesting software : SWFDecrypt , a free SWF decryption software wich will unencrypt SWF files protected by various SWF protection software .
This is usually done by people who want to pirate SWF files , so why is this interesting at all ?
It shows how simple it is to remove the ' protection ' by this software , that it is no protection after all .
The author of SWFDecrypt also tested it with irrFuscator ( written by me ) and SecureSWF , and writes that using these tools , your SWF are safe :
That 's what I always said : Use an obfuscator such as irrFuscator , all other methods are not safe .
The SWFDecrypt website also features a very interesting blog , where the author for example seems to find out that a company creating a popular SWF Decompiler also creates an ' SWF protector ' under another company name .
Interesting business , this SWF decryption industry .
Only one comment :
What are we looking at here ?
I 'm a fairly new hockey fan , and building this visualization helped me get a sense for the history of the championship .
( You know , so I can fake my way through conversations with real hockey fans . )
Just by mousing around for a bit , I can easily see that :
Montreal pretty much consistently dominated up until the 90's .
If you were a fan of ANYONE besides the Islanders or the Oilers in the 80's , you were pretty bummed out .
Ottawa had a HUGE dry spell ( nevermind , they actually disbanded for 66 years ) .
What about ' 28 , '35 and '05 ?
The loser of the 1928 series , and the winner of the 1935 series was the Montreal Maroons .
They do n't show up on the graphic because I did n't have a logo for them .
Oops .
Update : Some awesome guy emailed me the Maroons logo , they 're now included .
In 2005 , there were no Stanley Cup finals , because there was no hockey . :(
2011
Congrats , Boston !
* Neither of main parties could win election now : poll
* Opposition leader Ignatieff has poor personal ratings
OTTAWA , May 18 ( Reuters ) - Canada ’s ruling Conservatives are still slightly ahead of the main opposition Liberal Party , but do not have enough support to win an election now , according to a poll released on Tuesday .
The Harris - Decima survey for the Canadian Press put the Conservatives at 32 percent popular support -- up three points from a poll by the same firm three weeks ago -- while the Liberals were up one point at 28 percent .
The left - leaning New Democrats were down three points at 17 percent .
The Conservatives and Liberals have been locked together for much of the year , with neither party attracting enough support to win even a stable minority government .
The Conservatives , who have been in power since early 2006 , won a strengthened minority in October 2008 .
Their support has remained largely stable , despite a series of controversies .
Harris - Decima pollster Allan Gregg said one reason could be the lackluster performance of Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff , who has largely struggled since taking over the party in December 2008 .
The survey said 26 percent of Canadians had a positive impression of Ignatieff while a full 52 percent had a negative impression .
Prime Minister Stephen Harper was viewed unfavorably by 51 percent while 42 percent approved .
“ Opposition leaders usually do not evoke strong negative feelings , so it ’s very unusual , ” said Gregg .
The Conservatives portray Ignatieff -- a former academic and broadcaster -- as a snob who is out of touch with ordinary voters .
The Harris - Decima survey of 2,007 adults was conducted from May 6 to 16 and is considered accurate to within 2.2 percentage points , 19 times in 20 .

The Biz of Hockey is reporting the New York Rangers may end a 13 - year affiliation with the AHL's Hartford Wolfpack - a club which Blueshirts parent Madison Square Garden founded and has owned since the loss of the Whalers in 1997 - in order to hook up with the disgruntled Rochester Americans , currently partnered with the Panthers .
What a week , eh ?
Just this week , Amerks ownership stopped ever - so - short of vowing to sever ties with the Florida Panthers , stating - among a myriad of reasons - veteran player contracts ( read : AHL lifers ) were not being paid by the Cats per a verbal agreement .
OK , they actually did vow to sever ties .
Can they be blamed ?
Given the inordinately large number of management changes in Sunrise since Florida and Rochester mated in 2005 , it 's tough to clarify who ( Keenan ?
Martin ?
Sexton ?
Heck , Cohen ? ) to nail that charge against .
Presumably it was under JM 's regime , as such a deal would only have been struck in the aftermath of the Buffalo Sabres abandoning the dual - affiliation and going the solo route with the Portland Pirates .
In any case , it 's hardly been news that Amerks fans and ownership have been less than enamoured with the Panthers ' performance in regard to their American Legue stablemate , and finding anyone who believed an extension is forthcoming is an exercise in pain management .
Of course , Cats ' GM Dale Tallon just arrived , but whether he can - or more correctly chooses to - smooth over the crisis is anyone 's guess .
Florida and Rochester are joined at the hip for at the very least one more season .
And what a season that may be : Jacob Markstrom .
Colby Robak .
A.J. Jenks .
Marc Cheverie .
Scott Timmins .
Evgeni Dadonov .
And potentially whomever goes third in June 's Entry Draft .
But I 'm sure the Rangers have a few nice prospects as well ; Slats has always put shrewd drafting ahead of all else .
As for the Rangers , word on the street says they are not happy with their arrangement with the Wolf Pack ( yes ... the club they own ) and are actively pursuing greener pastures .
More on this to come .

Soldiers are seeking treatment for the emotional scars of war , but face a military mental health system that is grossly ill - equipped to serve them .
IRAQ WAR veteran Eric Jasinski , after seeking treatment for his post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , is being punished by the Army .
Jasinski turned himself in to the Army late last year , after having gone absent without leave ( AWOL ) in order to seek help for his PTSD - - help , he told Truthout , that he was not receiving from the Army , even after requesting assistance on multiple occasions .
He was court - martialed and jailed for 25 days for having gone AWOL , during which time he was escorted in shackles to therapy sessions for his PTSD .
After being released from prison , he was informed that he would be given an other - than - honorable discharge , which means he is likely ineligible for full PTSD treatment from Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA ) after he leaves the service .
Jasinski enlisted in the military in 2005 and deployed to Iraq in October 2006 as an intelligence analyst with the U.S. Army .
He collected intelligence in order to put together strike packets -- where air strikes would take place .
Upon his return to the U.S. after his tour , Jasinski was suffering from severe PTSD due to what he did and saw in Iraq , along with remorse and guilt for what he knows contributed to the loss of life in Iraq .
" What I saw and what I did in Iraq caused my PTSD , " the 23 - year - old Jasinski said during a phone interview .
" Also , I lost a good friend in Iraq , and I went through a divorce -- she left right before I deployed -- and my grandmother passed away when I was over there , so it was all super rough on me . "
Upon returning home in December 2007 , Jasinski tried to get treatment via the military .
He was self - medicating by drinking heavily , and an overburdened military mental health counselor sent him to see a civilian doctor , who diagnosed him with severe PTSD .
" I went to get help , but I had an eight - hour wait to see one of five doctors , " Jasinski explained .
" But after several attempts , finally , I got a periodic checkup , and I told that counselor what was happening , and he said they 'd help me ...
But I ended up getting a letter that instructed me to go see a civilian doctor , and she diagnosed me with PTSD .
Then , I was taking the medications and they were helping , because I thought I was to get out of the Army in February 2009 when my contract expired . "
As the date approached , Jasinski was stop - lossed ( an involuntary extension of his contract ) , an event that he said " pushed me over the edge " because he was told he was to be sent to Iraq within a month .
DURING HIS pre-deployment processing , " They gave me a 90 - day supply of meds to get me over to Iraq , and I saw a counselor during that period , and I told him , ' I do n't know what I 'm going to do if I go back to Iraq . ' "
" He asked if I was suicidal , " Jasinski explained , " and I said , ' Not right now , I 'm not planning on going home and blowing my brains out . '
He said , ' Well , you 're good to go then . '
And he sent me on my way .
I knew at that moment , when they finalized my paperwork for Iraq , that there was no way I could go back with my untreated PTSD .
I needed more help . "
Jasinski went AWOL , where he remained out of service until December 11 , 2009 , when he returned to turn himself in to authorities at Fort Hood , in Killeen , Texas .
" He has heavy - duty PTSD and never would have gone AWOL if he'd gotten the help he needed from the military , " James Branum , Jasinski 's civilian lawyer , told Truthout .
" This case highlights the need of the military to provide better mental health care for its soldiers . "
Branum , who is also co-chair of the Military Law Task Force , told Truthout in December , " Our hope is that his unit wo n't court - martial him , but put him in a warrior transition unit where they will evaluate him to either treat him or give him a medical discharge .
He'd be safe there , and eventually , they 'd give him a medical discharge because his PTSD symptoms are so severe . "
But the Army scheduled a summary court - martial for March 31 .
At it , Jasinski was sentenced to 30 days in the Bell County Jail in Texas .
Laura Barrett , Jasinski's mother , told the Temple Herald Telegram , " This has been a total outrage .
I cannot believe my son who is diagnosed with PTSD from his deployment to Iraq would be sent to jail . "
Branum submitted a clemency request asking that Jasinski be released on mental health grounds , or that he be transferred to the psych ward at Darnall Army Medical Center to complete his sentence .
The Army did not respond .
Branum said , " We , as Americans , need to see how combat vets are treated today .
Eric is in jail because he has PTSD and was denied the care he needed .
His ' desertion ' was an act of desperation , the act of a soldier who had no other options . "
Jasinski wrote a letter from the Bell County Jail that said the following :
When I am taken out of jail back to Fort Hood for any appointments , I am led around in handcuffs and ankle shackles in front of crowds of soldiers ... which is overwhelming on my mind .
My guilt from treating prisoners in Iraq sub - human , and I did things to them and watched my unit do cruel actions against prisoners , so being humiliated like that forces me to fall into the dark spiral of guilt .
I now know what it feels like to have no rights and have people stare and judge based on your shackles , and I feel even more like a monster because I used to do this to Iraqi people .
Even worse is the fact that this boils down to the military failing to treat my PTSD , but I am being punished for it ... I feel as if I am being a threat to others or myself and still the Army mental health professional blow me off , just like in 2009 , when I felt like I had no choice but to go AWOL , since I received a five - minute mental evaluation and was stop - lossed despite my PTSD , and was told that they could do nothing for me .
The insufficient mental evaluation from a doctor I had never seen before , combined with the insufficient actions by the doctor on April 9 , show the Army is not trying to make progress .
Jasinski was released from jail on April 24 , having served 25 days of a 30 - day sentence .
He has since been informed he will receive an other - than - honorable discharge , which means he will not have full health benefits with the VA , and thus little to no assistance from the military for treating his PTSD .
ACCORDING TO the Army , every year from 2006 onward has seen a record number of reported and confirmed suicides .
A 2008 Rand Corporation report revealed that at least 300,000 veterans returning from both wars had been diagnosed with severe depression or PTSD .
Jasinski's case is representative of a growing number of soldiers returning from the occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan who are going AWOL when they are unable to get proper mental health care treatment from the military for their PTSD .
Jasinski's experience with the military has inspired him to offer advice for other soldiers who need PTSD treatment but are not receiving it .
When asked what he feels the military needs to do in order to rectify this problem , he said , " A total overhaul of the mental health sector in the military is needed ... we had nine psychiatrists at our center , and that 's simply not enough staff .
They 're going to get burned out after seeing 50 soldiers each in one day .
We need an overhaul of the entire system , and more good psychiatrists , not those just coming for a job , but good , experienced mental health professionals need to be involved . "
Chuck Luther , who served 12 years in the military , is a veteran of two deployments to Iraq , where he was a reconnaissance scout in the 1st Cavalry Division .
The former sergeant was based at Fort Hood , Texas , where he lives today .
Luther told Truthout in November that the military tried to discharge him without assisting him with his PTSD , instead diagnosing him with " personality disorder . "
In response , Luther went on to found and direct " The Soldier 's Advocacy Group of Disposable Warriors . "
" The way things are set up right now in the military is that if a soldier gets a chance to go to mental health , which is something military commanders tend to try to prevent from happening in the first place , but if soldiers go , psychologists and psychiatrists address and diagnose their PTSD and write it up , but this does not mean that they will get treatment , " Luther explained to Truthout .
At the time , he described a situation very similar to that of Jasinski's .
" The doctors then send it to command , but that does n't mean the soldiers will get treatment , " said Luther .
" The soldier can push it up to the commander , but the commander can deny it and that 's as high as it gets .
Soldiers are listed as not being able to serve by a military doctor , but they are nonetheless medicated and sent out into combat anyway . "
" The military is trying to get everybody these ' other - than - honorable discharges ' or diagnosing them with ' personality disorder ' so they do n't have to take care of them after they discharge , " Aaron Hughes , an Iraq War vet , told Truthout .
Hughes , a national organizer for the group Iraq Veterans Against the War , said that Jasinski was already involved in the paperwork process required by the military for him to receive a medical discharge .
" This was underway when he went to jail , " Hughes added , " He would do his time for going AWOL , then get a medical discharge .
Instead , they are switching this mid-stream and giving him an ' other - than - honorable ' discharge , which means he gets no benefits .
My main concern is that he did his time and did everything he was supposed to do , and they are still not living up to their side of the bargain . "

While he was engaged in this work , Manion warned his superiors of the extent and complexity of the systemic problems , and he was deeply worried about the possibility of these leading to violence on the base and within surrounding communities .
" If not more Fort Hoods , Camp Liberties , soldier fratricide , spousal homicide , we 'll see it individually in suicides , alcohol abuse , domestic violence , family dysfunction , in formerly fine young men coming back and saying , as I 've heard so many times , ' I 'm not cut out for society .
I can't stand people .
I ca n't tolerate commotion .
I need to live in the woods , ' " Manion explained to Truthout .
" That 's what we 're going to have .
Broken , not contributing , not functional members of society .
It infuriates me -- what they are doing to these guys , because it 's so ineptly run by a system that values rank and power more than anything else -- so we 're stuck throwing money into a fragmented system of inept clinics and the crisis goes on . "
" It 's not just that we 're going to have an immensity of people coming back , but the system itself is thwarting their effective treatment , " Manion said .
Jasinski told Truthout that his previous commander , who he referred to as Captain Floer , told his mother that Jasinski was " faking my PTSD symptoms , " since " the job he held [ in Iraq ] was behind a computer . "
While in jail , Jasinski was denied access to his regular therapy sessions .
He was taken periodically to other sessions , but he told Truthout , " the mental health center on Fort Hood told me I had to wait for more help . "
At a later session at the same center , Jasinski said , " I was told upon my follow - up visit that my suicidal ideations were all in my head and was sent on my way . "
" Again the military is casting its soldiers aside , and shows no mercy for soldiers or their families , " Jasinski told Truthout , " I do not want their money , but I want them to at least acknowledge and act upon the problems in order to repair the broken system .
I want them to take action instead of worrying about public relations . "

For a long time I ’ve wanted a simple , double - clickable executable for Incanter , and now thanks to Alan Dipert ’s swingrepl library I have it .
I have made an executable jar file , called incanter .jar , that launches a swingrepl , that includes Incanter and all of its dependencies , when double - clicked or started with the following command
java - jar incanter.jar
Note :
Make sure to save incanter . jar with the . jar extension to ensure it executes correctly .
I have also used Apple ’s Jar Bundler and SkoobySoft ’s DMG Packager to create a Mac OS X executable that ’s downloadable as a dmg file , Incanter.dmg .
Finally , I used Launch4j to create the Windows executable file ,
Incanter.exe .
To build incanter . jar from source , use script / package in the Incanter distribution on Github , or just use lein uberjar ( lein will call the file incanter - standalone.jar , and will create a non-executable jar called incanter . jar ) .
Long - running BBC comedy Last of the Summer Wine is to be axed after 37 years , the BBC has announced .
The series - which has followed the exploits of Compo , Nora Batty and friends - made its TV debut in 1973 .
Over the years it has featured a host of famous faces including Eric Sykes , Dame Thora Hird and Bill Owen as Compo .
Jay Hunt , controller of BBC
One , said the final series to be shown this summer will be a " fitting farewell " to the well - loved characters .
It will feature Peter Sallis as Norman Clegg alongside several other cast members including Russ Abbot as Hobbo and Brian Murphy , who plays Alvin .
Every single episode of the sitcom has been written by Roy Clarke and produced and directed by Alan J W Bell .
There had been speculation for many years that the show would be retired but it was continually commissioned .
The BBC feels enormously privileged to have played host to its many charms for such a long time Cheryl Taylor , Controller of comedy commissioning
Cheryl Taylor , controller of comedy commissioning , said the decision to end the show was " very tough " .
" It is a testimony to the wit and warmth of the characters that Roy Clarke originally created that this amazing series has endured over several decades , " she said .
" The BBC feels enormously privileged to have played host to its many charms for such a long time and we very much respect the affection in which it is held .
" It is very tough to have to call time on such a cherished institution but we are very sincere in our gratitude for , and admiration of Last Of The Summer Wine .
It is the undisputed champion of long - running comedy series . "
BBC
One will celebrate the end of the long - running series with special editions of Countryfile and Songs Of Praise .
Both will come from Holmfirth , the village in Yorkshire where the series has been filmed since it began in 1973 .
Ms Hunt added : " I am delighted some of the channel 's other heritage brands will be helping to say goodbye in style . "
I am sure that no matter where you are in your career , you desire to create more income for yourself .
For most people , only two options come to mind .
Either they work much harder in their job and hope their boss notices their efforts and gives them a raise of 5 - 10 % , or quit their job and find another company that will pay them 10 - 20 % more .
When I talk about increasing your income , I do n’t just mean by a measly 5 % , 10 % or 20 % , I am talking about massively increasing your income by 50 % , doubling it or even increasing it by three to five times , within 12 months !
Is this possible ?
Yes it is !
And you can achieve this without quitting your job .
How ?
By not just focusing on your single , primary source of income .
The only way to double or triple your income to create for yourself multiple streams of income .
The rich never depend on one stream , but have multiple streams .
What Determines A Person ’s Income ?
Before you can increase your primary source of income , you must first understand what determines a person ’s income .
Why is it that one person is paid $ 3,000 a month while another person is paid $ 30,000 a month ?
Read
Every time I ask this question to people , I get standard answers like , ‘ age , qualifications , experience , luck , title , skill set , specialized knowledge , intelligence and so on . ’
Well , none of this is really true !
A person ’s income is determined by the amount of value he creates multiplied by the time he spends creating that value , multiplied by the scalability factor .
In other words ,
INCOME = VALUE X TIME X SCALABILITY
In other words , in order to increase your income , you must increase the amount of value you create , the time you spend creating value or / and your scalability factor .
Focus on increasing either one and you ca n’t help but increase your income .
When you start to do more high value activities , you will simply be paid more more for the work you do .
That is why a CEO earns more than a middle manager , because the work he does is more valuable to the company .
When you start spending more of the time you have everyday to only focus on high value activities , you will be creating more value overall and increase you income at the same time .
When you scale your value , the amount of wealth you can build is limitless and your wealth can only grow exponentially .
So focus on these three areas and massively increase your income today .
[ Haskell ] ANNOUNCE : hbeanstalk
Hello Haskellers , I 'd like to announce the first release of hbeanstalk , a new library for interfacing with the Beanstalk message / work queue service .
Beanstalk is a simple , fast workqueue service written in C http://kr.github.com/beanstalkd/ , which is often used to facilitate moving time - consuming tasks off a web application server , reducing latency for users .
hbeanstalk is a library that allows Haskell programs to either produce jobs , or consume them .
It 's a perfect way to have Haskell do your heavy lifting .
The entire Beanstalk protocol is implemented , so you can also use hbeanstalk to inspect jobs and gather statistics .
A large number of other languages have clients as well , so using Beanstalk can be a convenient way to cross language barriers .
http://wiki.github.com/kr/beanstalkd/client-libraries
Check it out on Hackage : http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hbeanstalk

Tour Cancellation Statement
Once again it breaks my heart to be the bearer of even more sad news affecting Whitesnake ’s touring schedule for this increasingly challenging year , 2020 . …
This is a portrait of a child moving from grade to grade without learning .
There are thousands more like him , slipping into indifference and insecurity while schools rubber stamp their progress .
When her son talks , Linda listens .
But she knows behaviour – and a mother 's intuition – often speak louder than words .
Linda has listened for years while Josh , 13 , claimed he did n't need extra help in school .
She has listened to teachers shrug off her concerns that he still counts on his fingers and wrestles with writing a book report .
After all , his grades are mostly Bs and Cs .
He 's a well - behaved kid , they tell her , an average student .
But Linda has been watching and worrying since Josh was in Grade 5 , as he struggled with homework night after night in their GTA apartment .
It was around then she realized her son could n't remember passages he read .
" He does much better if you read it aloud to him , " she explains .
Josh brought home decimal problems he had no idea how to solve .
He could n't recall instructions for written assignments .
His mother had to lead him by the hand to get his projects started .
Soon , his report cards noted he was n't participating in class .
His confidence began to slip .
He got easily frustrated and gave up quickly , even while playing hockey .
He woke up at night , sometimes ended up sleeping on the floor of his parents ' bedroom .
Linda knew something was n't right .
" When it 's your child , you just can't ignore it , " she says .
" You have to do something . "
EVERY DAY , in classrooms across the province , children like Josh gnaw their pencils and puzzle over fractions and spelling lists .
Every day , parents like Linda try to figure out if their child 's uphill battles are just part of life 's inevitable bumps or whether it 's time to intervene .
Some children make it clear , even if the message is n't expressed in words .
They may throw tantrums , have trouble falling asleep or not want to get out of bed in the morning .
They may cry over homework or refer to themselves as stupid .
They may disrupt the classroom or get into schoolyard fights .
Or they may quietly disengage without anyone even noticing .
There are myriad and complex reasons , ranging from learning disabilities to mental illnesses .
Maybe they are being bullied or their parents are divorcing .
They may be wired on too much technology , not enough exercise , lack of sleep .
Maybe the teacher does n't have time to cater to a range of learning styles .
The challenge for worried parents like Linda is twofold : in an overburdened system , finding out what exactly is wrong ; then , armed with that knowledge , getting the child the appropriate help .
" There is a great gaping maw of understanding for parents , " says Toronto District School Board trustee Cathy Dandy , who runs an annual workshop for parents seeking help for struggling children .
" The system itself , because of the lack of resources , has become ever more closed .
And , let 's face it , it 's time - consuming work to inform parents and empower them to ask questions . "
Annie Kidder of People for Education says her grassroots advocacy organization fields more calls from parents about special education and how to get help than any other issue .
" It 's because it 's so complex , because it takes a lot of advocacy ... and you have to have some understanding of how the system works . "
Almost 30 years ago , Bill 82 was passed , giving Ontario students with " exceptionalities " – those who learn differently from the majority , whether they have learning disabilities or are gifted – the right to receive special education programs and services in the public school system .
Today , almost 15 per cent of Ontario's 2.1 million public school students receive those services .
That translates to roughly four children in every class of 30 .
The definition of " learning disability , " according to the Learning Disabilities Association of Canada , is a neurological impairment to one or more processes that help a person think , perceive , remember or learn .
It 's estimated one in 10 Canadians has a learning disability .
There are many variations : disabilities may be related to the way people understand and remember what they hear and see ; how they plan and make decisions ; whether they can remember ; whether they can pay attention .
In school , learning disabilities can mean it 's harder for kids to read , express themselves , keep up in math .
According to Ministry of Education statistics from 2006 / 07 , about 29 per cent of students in special ed had a learning disability , 9 per cent were gifted and 8 per cent had a mild intellectual disability .
Other special needs include behavioural problems , autism , and developmental and physical disabilities .
But one - third of students receiving the supports had not been formally " identified " or diagnosed with a condition affecting learning .
The number of students being pushed and pulled along is suggested by statistics revealed in a 2008 report by the Canadian Council on Learning , which found that one - third of Canadian parents have hired tutors to assist their kids .
In the meantime , as a Toronto District School Board survey showed last week , teachers are dealing with a complex student body that includes a range of cultures and languages .
Poverty and its effects on learning are an increasing concern .
There are higher incidences of attention and behavioural problems .
Statistics show roughly one in five Ontario children and youth has a mental health problem and , often , these are concurrent with learning disabilities .
WHERE DOES JOSH fit in this spectrum ?
He is in a boisterous class in a culturally diverse school .
A quiet student amid a collection of squeaky wheels , he is at risk of slipping through the cracks .
For Linda , doing nothing is not an option .
She has allowed us to use her son's story – all names have been changed to protect their privacy – because she hit a roadblock .
She may not know the statistics , but she does understand the perils for kids who feel marginalized at school .
Research from organizations like the learning disabilities association shows students with learning problems who become disillusioned are twice as likely to drop out and are at higher risk of substance abuse , mental health problems and poor employment prospects .
Linda has asked teachers to help .
As a result , Josh received informal supports including weekly school - based tutoring and an after - school math club .
But , still , his mother spends night after night in a Sisyphean challenge , re-explaining homework , encouraging Josh and trying to prevent him from sliding backward .
She was convinced long ago that it was time to take the next step – a formal psycho-educational assessment to try to determine the root of her son 's difficulties .
Is he one of those kids who needs more time to absorb material ?
Is he one of the many children drifting through school unengaged ?
Or does he have a learning problem ?
The psycho-ed assessment is the tool that can provide some answers .
The series of standard academic , cognitive and psychological tests measures intelligence and reasoning skills and diagnoses learning disabilities .
The assessments , administered by trained psychologists or psychological associates , can identify attention problems or mental health issues related to a child 's learning such as anxiety or depression .
A diagnosis requires that other conditions that may affect learning – developmental delays , hearing or vision impairments , the impact of a different cultural background or being taught in a second language – are ruled out .

Students can get help beyond the classroom teacher , including a tailored learning plan , without a formal diagnosis , but assessments are the only way to qualify for many of the heavy - duty services that cost school boards extra money .
This focus on finding children 's deficiencies in order to teach them more effectively concerns some educators .
" We have developed a huge network and system that accentuates the negatives more than the positives , " says Toronto District School Board psychologist Tayyab Rashid .
He says teaching kids to understand the way they learn and build on their assets makes them resilient , self - confident and successful .
The downside of labelling is evident in Josh 's attitude .
He would rather flounder than admit he " does n't get it " or needs extra help .
Like most teens , he just wants to be a normal kid who fits into the way the school system expects him to learn and perform .
Linda knows this but there is n't much choice .
She needs answers for her son , and time is running out .
She will jump at the first opportunity for an assessment .
The good news for her is that assessments are available without a fee through Ontario school boards .
The bad news is , unless a student 's situation is considered urgent , he or she will have to wait .
The wait can be so long that advocates advise those who can afford it to pay for a private test , which costs an average of $ 2,000 .
Linda is a mother of three sons and has a job working with children .
Her husband is a physical labourer .
She is ready to fight like a pit bull for what her middle son needs .
But there is no money for private tutors , special schools or a private psycho-ed assessment .
So Josh has waited .
And waited .
He was in Grade 5 when Linda first asked the school to put him on the wait list for a school board assessment .
She inquired each year ; but other students in worse situations jumped ahead in the queue .
At the beginning of Grade 8 , with high school approaching , Linda discovered he had fallen off the list , which is reviewed each year to prioritize critical cases .
The Ministry of Education does not keep statistics on assessments or wait times because they are administered separately by the province 's 72 school boards .
However , in its 2008 survey of public schools , the advocacy group People for Education reported 36,000 elementary school children and 4,800 high school students were waiting for assessments .
This is despite the widely accepted principle that early identification of learning disabilities or other problems that affect learning is critical to a child 's long - term success .
Delays are n't the only problem .
Judy Kerr , executive director of the learning disabilities association , says the assessment system is flawed because there are no set standards .
The association wants universal screening of kids in primary grades to identify problems and start helping kids early , long before most elementary schools typically start doing full assessments in Grade 2 or 3 .
John McNamara , of the Canadian Association of Educational Psychology , says the current " wait to fail " model is not sustainable .
For many kids , the help comes too late to catch up , says McNamara , also a professor who specializes in learning disabilities at Brock University in St. Catharines .
The system is changing but it 's happening slowly , he says .
Progressive school boards are realizing that intensive intervention in the early years works better for children and will save money down the road .
" Science knows now that if you do it early , you 're changing the way the brain works . "
IT WAS TOO LATE for an early intervention for Josh , but he still needed an assessment and Linda was stymied by red tape .
This is where the Star stepped in .
We were looking for an opportunity to observe the process and write about it but no major school board would allow us to be present .
So , when we found Josh and heard his story , we offered to hire a psychologist with experience , credentials and recommendations to conduct a private assessment .
Linda and the psychologist willingly participated to help shed light on the inner workings of such an important but little understood process .
The Star observed from start to finish and watched the actual testing through observation glass in a separate room .
The day of testing and its aftermath are the subject of stories tomorrow in the Living section and Saturday in Weekend Living .

Angry Manchester
United fans have set off a smoke bomb outside Old Trafford as part of a mass protest against the club 's American owners , the Glazers .
Hundreds of fans congregated outside the ground ahead of the final game of the season against Stoke , chanting and brandishing placards .
The smoke bomb was set off outside the club 's Megastore .
Greater Manchester Police confirmed one smoke bomb had been set off but said there were no injuries or arrests .
Green and gold
The Glazers took over at Old Trafford five years ago .
Critics said the family borrowed money to buy the club and saddled it with massive debts .
Fans have launched a campaign to oust them , many boycotting the traditional red shirts and scarves and instead wearing green and gold , the original colours of Newton Heath , the amateur side which was founded in 1878 and became Manchester United .
Protesters handed out green and gold flags and placards and whistles , which they claimed was to " blow full - time on the Glazer family " , before the game .
Avram Glazer , the co-chairman of Manchester United , had been due to attend the game but was unable to fly because of the ongoing ash cloud disruption .
07-08-2010 : We have added new data and information regarding the Flash Crash .
In order to keep our report in - tact as originally published , please CLICK HERE for all new Flash Crash related information from Nanex .
On the afternoon of May 6 , 2010 the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( DJIA ) dropped approximately 600 points ( 5.7 % ) , and then quickly recovered .
Other Major Market Indexes dropped by similar amounts .
We have read numerous articles attempting to explain this event including the SEC report " Preliminary Findings Regarding the Market Events of May 6 , 2010 " dated May 18 , 2010 .
Our report assumes the reader is familiar with the SEC report .
Our business is supplying a real - time data feed comprising trade and quote data for all US equity , option , and futures exchanges .
We have archived this data since 2004 and have created and used numerous tools to help us sift through the enormous dataset : approximately 2.5 trillion quotes and trades as of June 2010 .
May 6th , had approximately 7.6 billion trade , quote , level 2 , and depth records .
We generated over 4,500 datasets and over 1,200 charts before uncovering what we believe precipitated the swift 600 point drop beginning at 14:42:46 and ending at 14:47:02 .
The following are the results of our findings .
VIL HEVE PENSJONSALDEREN : Økonomiprofessor Steinar Strøm . Foto : AFTENPOSTEN
- Pensjonsalderen bør være 75 år
Pensjonsalderen i Norge bør heves til 75 år , mener professor i samfunnsøkonomi Steinar Strøm ved Universitetet i Tromsø .
Oppdatert 27 . mai 2010
Artikkelen er over ti år gammel
- Dagens 75 - åringer er ikke hva de en gang var .
Jeg er 68 for eksempel , og hadde jeg ikke vært forkjølet skulle jeg utmerket godt klart å løpe et halvmaraton , sier en hostende Strøm til Klassekampen .
Strøm mener pensjonsalderen bør heves til 75 år for å finansiere velferdsstaten etter eldrebølgen .
Andre forslag han mener kan bidra til å finansiere velferdsstaten er å la flere gå over fra deltid til heltid , og at flere uføre begynner å jobbe .
Videre mener han at en løsning kan være å bruke mer oljepenger , importere mer utenlandsk arbeidskraft , øke skattene og effektivisere offentlig sektor .

Får jobbe til hun er 70
Imidlertid har ikke alle tiltakene like stor effekt , mener Strøm .
Han har minst tiltro til forslag som import av utenlandsk arbeidskraft og økt bruk av oljepenger , og han har liten tro på at det er betydelige effektivitetsgevinster å hente ved å privatisere helse - og omsorgstjenester .
Men han er mer åpen for å øke skattene og mener dette er den beste løsningen kombinert med å heve den generelle pensjonsalderen .
Populismen i det norske politiske systemet vil imidlertid gjøre det vanskelig å sette i gang kraftige grep som dette , frykter han .

Melbourne 's near - upset of Collingwood in a pulsating AFL match at the MCG was " totally predictable " to Magpies coach Mick Malthouse .
With seconds left , a desperate spoil from Steele Sidebottom stopped Ricky Petterd from taking a juggled mark in the goalsquare and Collingwood held on to win 12.14 ( 86 ) to 12.13 ( 85 ) .
The Demons were shattered when the final siren sounded and they had the look of a team that had just lost the grand final .
Petterd , probably best afield with four goals , repeatedly smashed the ground in frustration .
Most people would not have expected such a tight match , given the Magpies opened their season last weekend with a resounding win over the Western Bulldogs and the Demons were so poor in the first half against Hawthorn .
David Rosenberg 's favorite leading indicator , the Economic Cycle Research Institute ( ECRI ) Leading Index , fell to 123.2 in the week ended June 4 , down from 124 the week before , a - 3.5 % annualized contraction : the first time this has gone negative in over a year .
This is the lowest level since July 31 , 2009 , when it was at 122.4 , as the chart below demonstrates .
What is more troubling is a historical comparison to the dark days of the 1970 's recession .
While the amplitude of the recent pick up has been unprecedented , from - 30 to +30 , it is only mirrored by the - 20 to +20 jump seen in 1971 - 1973 .
However , as can also be seen below , the ensuing crash following the first spike , was the worst one in the past 35 years .
If history is any predictor , does the ECRI Leading Indicator index anticipate a comparable collapse in the economy to what was seen in late 2008 ?
Seldom has the policy conflict between recovery and reform been presented as starkly as in the last two weeks .
On the one hand , there is last week ’s congressional agreement on a historic reshaping of the financial regulatory system — which brings stronger consumer protections , sharper oversight of mega - banks and risk - oriented behavior , new constraints on mortgage terms and closer scrutiny of credit rating agencies and insurance companies .
On the other , there ’s the failure of Congress ( thanks to the threat of a Republican filibuster in the Senate ) to extend unemployment coverage for more than 1 million Americans and to provide about $ 24 billion in Medicaid assistance for state budgets .
That places as many as 900,000 public - and private - sector jobs , not to mention crucial services for destitute residents , at risk .
Not helping matters was the noise coming from last weekend ’s G - 20 summit of developed countries in Toronto about the need to cut fiscal deficits by 2013 .
Plainly , while reform is beginning to move ahead , economic recovery is still very much at risk .
The main threat comes from short - sighted policymakers who , despite an abundance of evidence that growth remains dependent on continued fiscal stimulus , have become unduly enamored of austerity instead .
There ’s no question that the stimulus already in the system has pulled the world economy back from the brink .
“ We ’re in a very different place than we were a year ago , ” Lawrence H. Summers , director of President Obama ’s National Economic Council , said last week in a conversation in his West Wing office with a group of us from The Times .
“ A year ago the question was about a free fall , it was about depression .
Today the questions are about the pace of recovery .
That ’s a much better kind of question to hear . ”
He added : “ We ’ve begun the process of turnaround .
The challenge going forward is to maintain and accelerate momentum . ”
It ’s important to note that the momentum of which he spoke is fragile in the extreme .
Gross domestic product is rising , but the annual growth rate in the first quarter of this year , 2.7 % , is slower than that of the previous quarter ( 5.6 % ) .
It ’s also slower than the rate needed for job growth to keep pace with population growth ( 3 % ) or the 5 % needed to bring down the unemployment rate , which is 9.7 % .
The economy has added jobs since the beginning of the year , but employment in May was still below the level of May 2009 .
How important is government stimulus ?
The modest job growth this year incorporates a large component of government hiring — the increase of 431,000 in nonfarm employment in May , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , included 411,000 temporary workers hired for the 2010 census .
And although home prices have stabilized in much of the country , new - home sales collapsed by 33 % in May , following the April 30 expiration of a federal tax credit for home purchasers .
It ’s not as though the economy did n’t face enough crosswinds already .
Long - term unemployment has become “ a particularly disturbing feature of this recession , ” Summers says .
“ There is evidence that people who have been out of work for a year tend to have a difficult time returning and often drop out of the labor force , ” he says .
“ That is going to cast a shadow for some significant interval . ”
Nor has there been a reversal in the trend toward increasing income inequality in the United States .
In 1979 , the top 1 % of U.S. households earned eight times as much as the middle 20 % and 23 times as much as the bottom fifth ; by 2005 , the Congressional Budget Office found , the upper crust touched 21 times as much as the middle class and 70 times as much as the bottom .
This phenomenon “ has a broadly corrosive social impact in terms of our not being one America , ” said Summers , echoing the economist Benjamin M. Friedman , who observed in 2006 that the 1950s and ‘ 60s , when median family income doubled , brought us such progressive social developments as the civil rights movement .
Over the succeeding decades the social fabric has frayed , Friedman wrote .
Public opinion has turned sharply against immigration and affirmative action , and attacks on welfare recipients display “ a vindictive spirit that was highly uncharacteristic of the United States in the postwar era . ”
Things may be headed downward from here .
The death last week of a $ 100 - billion jobs and economic relief bill will place unimaginable strain on state and local budgets , provoking cuts that may well undo all the progress that was made under last year ’s $ 787 - billion stimulus package .
That package , according to an analysis by the California Budget Project , provided $ 85 billion in funds for California alone .
It helped lawmakers in Sacramento close the last budget gap by increasing federal funding for Medi-Cal — relieving pressure on the state budget while restricting cuts in eligibility , thereby safeguarding coverage for many low - income Californians .
Yet Congress ’ action pulls the rug out from the residents of California and other states .
The Washington - based Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found that 33 states and the District of Columbia had enacted budgets incorporating , directly or indirectly , money they expected from the bill .
That does n’t include California , where Gov. Schwarzenegger said earlier this year his 2010 - 11 budget proposal assumed an inflow of $ 1.8 billion in Medicaid / Medi-Cal funding — which has been , for now , extinguished .
The state budget reductions , wage cuts , furloughs and layoffs that will be made necessary by Congress ’ dereliction will drive up unemployment , erode consumer demand and intensify doubts about the strength of the recovery .
What is the source of the deficit panic that ’s fueling the pushback on economic stimulus ?
It ’s certainly not the public ’s conviction that government assistance is no longer needed .
It ’s hard to identify a widespread perception that the economy has turned up , although Summers argues that such perception always lags behind reality .
“ Recoveries are more like rheostats than light switches , ” he said .
“ People are gradually getting the sense of improvement .
But it wo n’t feel like everything is better all of a sudden .
It will take time . ”
Is it bond investors fearful that deficit spending will drive up long - term interest rates , harming their portfolios , as the economist Paul Krugman posits ?
Or is it someone ’s Machiavellian effort to prove the correctness of Keynesian economics , which supports heavy government stimulus in periods when the private sector withdraws from investment , by imposing anti-Keynesian stimulus cuts while they ’re still needed ?
John Maynard Keynes , it should be noted , was unafraid of government deficits .
“ At the present time , all governments have large deficits , ” he wrote in 1931 , as his biographer Robert Skidelsky observed recently .
“ They are nature ’s remedy for preventing business losses from being ... so great as to bring production altogether to a standstill . ”
A few years later , Franklin D. Roosevelt bowed to his era ’s deficit hawks and cut back on federal programs to bring the federal budget more into balance .
He got the recession of 1937 for his pains .
The deficit - cutting craze of the modern day threatens another such double dip .
Its promoters say they ’re out to protect long - term economic prospects , but without a short - term recovery there may not be a long term to protect .
If they get their way , we may not feel the consequences of their error before it ’s too late to fix .

By By Chris Hogg Aug 13 , 2008 in Business According to a government study released yesterday , the majority of U.S. and foreign companies doing business in America avoid paying federal income tax .
The companies might pull in trillions of dollars worth of sales , but they do n't pay out .
Digital Journal --
The
In that same time period , about 57 per cent of foreign - controlled corporations ( FCCs ) and 42 per cent of U.S. - controlled corporations ( USCCs ) reported no tax liability in two or more years ; and 34 per cent of FCCs and 24 per cent of USCCs reported no tax liability for at least half the study period , or four or more years .
In 2005 , almost 67 per cent of 1.9 million American corporations paid no federal income tax .
The report says corporations can legally avoid paying tax if they have no income , or no net income after expenses .
Most companies that avoided paying tax in 2005 had more deductions than income .
The report does not name any corporations , but says 3,500 were considered large companies with at least $ 250 million in assets .
About one - quarter of the largest U.S. companies paid no federal income tax in 2005 , despite the fact they pulled in $ 1.1 trillion in gross revenue .
From 1998 to 2005 , sales in the U.S. accounted for $ 2.5 trillion in revenue .
The U.S. budget deficit is projected to hit a record $ 486 billion next year and lawmakers are " It ’s shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country .
The tax system that allows this wholesale tax avoidance is an embarrassment and unfair to hardworking Americans who pay their fair share of taxes . "
The 37 - page report ( opens in PDF ) , Update : Aug 18 , 2008 According to ... while it is true that 60 percent to 70 percent of companies in the study paid no tax in a given year , there was a big qualification .
The study focused on an Internal Revenue Service tax database that included millions and millions of companies .
The vast majority of firms in the study were tiny mom- and - pop enterprises .
Why did the tiny mom-and - pop enterprises pay no taxes ?
Because they did n't make any money !
The study reported that was the reason about 80 percent of the firms in the sample avoided taxes in a given year Hassett continues : Democratic politicians misused and misrepresented the results of this modest GAO study to bash America 's corporations and call for sweeping ``reforms . ''
If they will do so in response to this minor document , one can only conclude that they will do so on the flimsiest of excuses .
Leaders of the Democratic Party are so eager to portray American business as villainous that they will twist and distort facts in order justify even more punitive taxes than we already have .
Digital Journal --
The Government Accountability Office in the U.S. says 57 per cent of all U.S. companies operating in the country , and 72 per cent of all foreign businesses doing business in America , paid no federal income tax for at least one year between 1998 and 2005 .
In that same time period , about 57 per cent of foreign - controlled corporations ( FCCs ) and 42 per cent of U.S. - controlled corporations ( USCCs ) reported no tax liability in two or more years ; and 34 per cent of FCCs and 24 per cent of USCCs reported no tax liability for at least half the study period , or four or more years .

The U.S. budget deficit is projected to hit a record $ 486 billion next year and lawmakers are reportedly looking to close these tax holes to generate more revenue .
According to Tax - News.com , U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan ( D - N.D ) said : The 37 - page report ( opens in PDF ) , can be found here According to an opinion article in Bloomberg News , this study is deceiving and plays right into the hands of Democrats wishing to blame America 's money problems on businesses .

School bans pupils under 15 from wearing skirts ... to save girls from attracting unwanted attention
A school has banned pupils from wearing skirts , claiming that girls were sneakily raising their hemlines by several inches after setting off from home .
Girls aged up to 16 at St Aidan 's CE High School in Harrogate , North Yorkshire , will have to wear trousers from September .
Only from Year 11 will skirts be permitted - and they will be strictly limited to a length of no more than three inches above the knee .
The school is to insist on girls wearing trousers amid concerns pupils could be placing themselves at risk by wearing skirts too short ( posed by models )
Dress code : St Aidan 's CE High School , Harrogate , is changing its uniform to stop female pupils from wearing skirts
Some pupils and parents branded the ban heavy - handed .
But yesterday the school defended the policy , saying a majority of its girls were putting themselves ' at risk ' by wearing excessively short skirts .
A statement on its website read : ' Very young children , and even more disturbingly , special needs children are clearly wholly unaware of the signals they are giving out .
Safety conscious :
St Aidan 's head Dennis Richards says the first duty of care in any school is child safety
' Parents who have come in have been astonished to see the difference between the length their daughter may wear her skirt as she leaves home and what has happened by the time she is walking the corridors of the school .
' It does not need much imagination to understand where and in what situation the children are placing themselves " at risk " .
' The first duty of care in any school is to keep the children safe . '
The mixed school with almost 2,000 pupils is regularly one of the strongest - performing comprehensives in the country at GCSE , with 89 per cent last year getting five or more good grades , compared with under 50 per cent nationally .
Girls will be told to wear black trousers : jeans , cords or cotton drill material are not accepted , nor are midriff - displaying , ' hipster - style ' trousers .
Developers building applications on top of Java App Engine can use the familiar java .
net interface for making off - network calls .
For simple requests , this should be more than sufficient .
The low - level API , however , provides one feature not available in java.net : asynchronous URLFetch .
The low - level URLFetch API
So what does the low - level API look like ?
Something like this :
import java.io.IOException ; import java.net .
URL ; import java.util .
List ; import com.google.appengine.api.urlfetch.HTTPHeader ; import com.google.appengine.api.urlfetch.HTTPResponse ; import com.google.appengine.api.urlfetch.URLFetchService ; import com.google.appengine.api.urlfetch.URLFetchServiceFactory ; URLFetchService fetcher = URLFetchServiceFactory.getURLFetchService( ) ; try { URL url = new URL ( " http://someurl.com " ) ; HTTPResponse response = fetcher.fetch( url ) ; byte [ ] content = response.getContent ( ) ; // if redirects are followed , this returns the final URL we are redirected to URL final Url = response.getFinalUrl( ) ; // 200 , 404 , 500 , etc int responseCode = response.getResponseCode ( ) ; List headers = response.getHeaders ( ) ; for ( HTTPHeader header : headers ) { String headerName = header.getName ( ) ; String headerValue = header.getValue( ) ; } } catch ( IOException e ) { // new URL throws MalformedUrlException , which is impossible for us here }
The full Javadocs are here .
So it ’s a bit different than the standard java .
net interface , where we ’d get back a reader and iterate line by line on the response .
We ’re protected from a heap overflow because URLFetch is limited to 1 mb responses .
Asynchronous vs. Synchronous requests
Using java .net has the advantage of portability – you could build a standard fetcher that will work in any JVM environment , even those outside of App Engine .
The tradeoff , of course , is that App Engine specific features wo n’t be present .
The one killer feature of App Engine ’s low - level API that is n’t present in java .
net is asynchronous URLFetch .
What is asynchronous fetch ?
Let ’s make an analogy :
Let ’s pretend you , like me at home , are on DSL and have a pretty pathetic downstream speed , and decide to check out a link sharing site like Digg .
You browse to the front page and decide to open up every single link .
You can do this synchronously or asynchronously .
Synchronously
Synchronously , you click link # 1 .
Now you look at this page .
When you are done looking at this page , you hit the back button and click link # 2 .
Repeat until you have seen all the pages .
Now , again , you are on DSL , so not only do you spend time reading each link , before you read each destination page , you have to wait for the page to load .
This can take a significant portion of your time .
The total amount of time you sit in front of your computer is thus :
N = number of links L = loading time per page R = reading time per page N * ( L + R )
( Yes , before I wrote this equation , I thought that by including some mathematical formulas in my blog post would make me look smarter , but as it turns out the equation is something comprehensible by 8 year olds internationally / American public high school students )
Asynchronously
Using a tabbed browser , you control - click every single link on the page to open them in new tabs .
Now before you go look at any of the pages , you decide to go to the kitchen and make a grilled cheese sandwich .
When you are done with the sandwich , you come back to your computer sit down , enjoying your nice , toasty sandwich while you read articles about Ron Paul and look at funny pictures of cats .
How much time are you spending ?
N = number of links S = loading time for the slowest loading page R = reading time per page G = time to make a grilled cheese sandwich
MAX (( N * R + G ) , ( N * R + S ) )
Which takes longer , your DSL , or the time it takes you to make a grilled cheese sandwich ?
The point that I ’m making here is that you can save time by parallelizing things .
No , I know it ’s not a perfect analogy , as downloading N pages in parallel consumes the same crappy DSL connection , but you get what I am trying to say .
Hopefully .
And maybe you are also in the mood for some cheese .
Asynchrous URLFetch in App Engine
So what would the URLFetch above look like asynchronously ?
Probably something like this :
import java.io.IOException ; import java.net .
URL ; import java.util .
List ; import java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException ; import java.util.concurrent .
Future ; import com.google.appengine.api.urlfetch.HTTPHeader ; import com.google.appengine.api.urlfetch.HTTPResponse ; import com.google.appengine.api.urlfetch.URLFetchService ; import com.google.appengine.api.urlfetch.URLFetchServiceFactory ; protected void makeAsyncRequest ( ) { URLFetchService fetcher = URLFetchServiceFactory.getURLFetchService( ) ; try { URL url = new URL ( " http://someurl.com " ) ; Future future = fetcher.fetchAsync(url ) ; //
Other stuff can happen here !
HTTPResponse response = future.get ( ) ; byte [ ] content = response.getContent ( ) ; URL finalUrl = response.getFinalUrl( ) ; int responseCode = response.getResponseCode ( ) ; List headers = response.getHeaders ( ) ; for ( HTTPHeader header : headers ) { String headerName = header.getName ( ) ; String headerValue = header.getValue( ) ; } } catch ( IOException e ) { // new URL throws MalformedUrlException , which is impossible for us here } catch ( InterruptedException e ) { //
Exception from using java.concurrent .
Future } catch ( ExecutionException e ) { // Exception from using java.concurrent .
Future e.printStackTrace ( ) ; } }
This looks pretty similar – EXCEPT : fetchAsync does n’t return an HTTPResponse .
It returns a Future .
What is a future ?
java.concurrent .
Future
From the Javadocs :
“ A Future represents the result of an asynchronous computation .
Methods are provided to check if the computation is complete , to wait for its completion , and to retrieve the result of the computation .
The result can only be retrieved using method get when the computation has completed , blocking if necessary until it is ready .
Cancellation is performed by thecancel method .
Additional methods are provided to determine if the task completed normally or was cancelled . ”
Future
What does this mean in English ?
It means that the Future object is NOT the response of the HTTP call .
We ca n’t get the response until we call the get ( ) method .
Between when we call fetchAsync ( ) and get , we can do other stuff : datastore operations , insert things into the Task Queue , heck , we can even do more URLFetch operations .
When we finally DO call get ( ) , one of two things happens :
We ’ve already retrieved the URL .
Return an HTTPResponse object
We ’re still retrieving the URL .
Block until we are done , then return an HTTPResponse object .
In the best case scenario , the amount of time it takes for us to do other things is equal to the amount of time it takes to do the URLFetch , and we save time .
In the worst case scenario , the maximum amount of time is the time it takes to do the URLFetch or the other operations , whichever takes longer .
The end result is that we lower the amount of time to return a response to the end -user .
Twitter Example
So let ’s build a servlet that retrieves my tweets .
Just for giggles , let ’s do it 20 times and see what the performance difference is .
We ’ll make it so that if we pass a URL parameter , async=true ( or anything , for simplicity ) , we do the same operation using fetchAsync .
The code is below :
package com.ikai.urlfetchdemo ; import java.io.IOException ; import java.io .
PrintWriter ; import java.net .
URL ; import java.util.ArrayList ; import java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException ; import java.util.concurrent .
Future ; import javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet ; import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest ; import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse ; import com.google.appengine.api.urlfetch.HTTPResponse ; import com.google.appengine.api.urlfetch.URLFetchService ; import com.google.appengine.api.urlfetch.URLFetchServiceFactory ; @ SuppressWarnings ( " serial " ) public class GetTwitterFeedServlet extends HttpServlet { protected static String IKAI_TWITTER_RSS = " http://twitter.com/statuses/user_timeline/14437022.rss " ; public void doGet ( HttpServletRequest req , HttpServletResponse resp ) throws IOException { boolean isSyncRequest = true ; if ( req.getParameter ( " async " ) != null ) { isSyncRequest = false ; } resp.setContentType(" text /html " ) ; PrintWriter out = resp.getWriter ( ) ; out . println ( " < h1 > Twitter feed fetch demo </ h1 > " ) ; long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis( ) ; URLFetchService fetcher = URLFetchServiceFactory.getURLFetchService( ) ; URL url = new URL ( IKAI_TWITTER_RSS ) ; if ( isSyncRequest ) { out.
println ( " < h2 > Synchronous fetch < / h2 > " ) ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < 20 ; i++) { HTTPResponse response = fetcher.fetch( url ) ; printResponse ( out , response ) ; } } else { out.
println ( " < h2 > Asynchronous fetch </ h2 > " ) ; ArrayList < Future <HTTPResponse >> asyncResponses = new ArrayList < Future <HTTPResponse >>( ) ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < 20 ; i++) { Future < HTTPResponse > responseFuture = fetcher.fetchAsync(url ) ; asyncResponses.add(responseFuture ) ; } for ( Future < HTTPResponse > future : asyncResponses ) { HTTPResponse response ; try { response = future.get ( ) ; printResponse ( out , response ) ; } catch ( InterruptedException e ) { //
Guess you would do something here } catch ( ExecutionException e ) { //
Guess you would do something here } } } long totalProcessingTime = System.currentTimeMillis ( ) - startTime ; out. println ( " < p> Total processing time : " + totalProcessingTime + " ms </p > " ) ; } private void printResponse ( PrintWriter out , HTTPResponse response ) { out. println ( " < p > " ) ; out .
println ( " Response : " + new String( response.getContent ( ) ) ) ; out.println ( " < / p > " ) ; } }
As you can see , it ’s a bit more involved to store all the Futures in a list , then to iterate through them .
We ’re also not being too intelligent about iterating through the futures : we ’re assuming first - in - first - out ( FIFO ) with URLFetch , which may or may not be the case in production .
A more optimized case may try to fetch the response from a call we know is faster before fetching from one we know is slower first .
However – empirical testing will show that more often than not , doing things asynchronously is significantly faster for the user than synchronously .
Using Asynchronous URLFetch and HTTP POST
So far , our examples have been focused on read operations .
What if we do n’t care about the response ?
For instance , what if we decide to make an API call that essentially is a “ write ” operation , and can , for the most part , safely assume it will succeed ?
// JavaAsyncUrlFetchDemoServlet.java package com.ikai.urlfetchdemo ; import java.io.
IOException ; import javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet ; import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest ; import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse ; import com.google.appengine.api.urlfetch.URLFetchService ; import com.google.appengine.api.urlfetch.URLFetchServiceFactory ; @ SuppressWarnings ( " serial " ) public class JavaAsyncUrlFetchDemoServlet extends HttpServlet { public void doGet ( HttpServletRequest req , HttpServletResponse resp ) throws IOException { long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis( ) ; URLFetchService fetcher = URLFetchServiceFactory.getURLFetchService( ) ; fetcher.fetchAsync(FetchHelper.makeGuestbookPostRequest(" Async " , " At " + startTime ) ) ; long totalProcessingTime = System.currentTimeMillis ( ) - startTime ; resp.setContentType(" text /html " ) ; resp.getWriter ( ) . println ( " < h1 > Asynchronous fetch demo </ h1 > " ) ; resp.getWriter( ) . println ( " < p > Total processing time : " + totalProcessingTime + " ms </p > " ) ; } }
// FetchHelper.java package com.ikai.urlfetchdemo ; import java.net.MalformedURLException ; import java.net .

POST ) ; String body = " name= " + name + " &content= " + content ; request.setPayload(body.getBytes ( ) ) ; } catch ( MalformedURLException e ) { //
Do nothing } return request ; } }

KDevelop PHP Advancements : Namespaces and Error Recovery
Hi there ,
just a quicky before I head off to bed and go on a short vacation the next few days :
PHP support in KDevelop now has support for the first PHP 5.3 feature , namely namespaces .
I ’m still convinced that the syntax sucks pretty bad in PHP ’s implementation of namespaces but well , my hands are tight and I had to support it .
Anyhow , with PHP master you should n’t get syntax errors anymore when using namespaces , but instead proper code completion , syntax highlighting and context information …
Well , full blown DUChain integration :)
Furthermore I just introduced the first few error recoveries in PHP that should make the situation a bit better when you work on a broken file .
Up until now any parse error resulted in a file with no advanced PHP features at all until you fixed that parse error .
Now it should at least skip parse errors in code segments between braces ( classes , functions , conditionals , namespaces , … ) .
It can be much improved of course , and I ’ll do just that next week .
Bye !
The European Southern Observatory just posted this lovely picture of the moon setting behind the Very Large Telescope observatory in Chile :
[ Click to embiggen . ]
Photographer Gordon Gillet was 14 km ( 8.5 miles ) away from the observatory when he caught the full Moon behind it .
The sky is pink because behind him , the Sun was rising -- as it must be when the full Moon is setting .
But I had to chuckle when I read the description :
Contrary to what one may think , this picture is no montage .
The Moon appears large because it is seen close to the horizon and our perception is deceived by the proximity of references on the ground .
In order to get this spectacular close view , a 500 - mm lens was necessary .
The very long focal length reduces the depth of field making the objects in focus appear as if they were at the same distance .
This effect , combined with the extraordinary quality of this picture , gives the impression that the Moon lies on the VLT platform , just behind the telescopes , even though it is in fact about 30 000 times further away .
The part about the long lens collapsing the perspective is absolutely correct .
That effect has been used for decades in the film industry to make far away things look as close as things much nearer ( like , say , people running along train tracks to escape an oncoming train ) .
When I first read the description , though , I thought they were referencing the Moon Illusion , where the Moon looks huge on the horizon .
Reading it again , I see they are n't ( though it would be easy to think they are ) .
And that 's good , because the Moon Illusion is n't playing into this at all .
I explain how it works in more detail elsewhere ; it 's an illusion caused by the shape of the sky and the way our brains perceive it .
Also , the Moon Illusion is an effect that only happens when we can see large parts of the sky and get a sense of perspective on it ; so it can't be photographed ( or at least I 've never seen it done , and do n't see how it could be ) .
In the case of this picture , it 's all due to the magnification of the lens used .
And it 's a beautiful shot .
If you 're on Twitter , you can follow the ESO and get notified when they post another gorgeous image like this one .
This is part of their Image of the Week series , which is updated every Monday .

Diminished by a lifetime of smoking , rich food , and inactivity that had limited him to a hobble , my father confided to me that he ’d had 75 wonderful years followed by three mediocre ones .
Two months later , he and my healthy mother returned home from an evening out with friends ; he ate a bowl of ice cream and fell over dead at the age of 78 .
A few years later , my mother closed her checking account , left the Midwestern town where she ’d lived for most of her life , and moved to a desert community in Arizona , where she flowered .
She found new friends , switched political parties , hiked in the canyons , and was happy .
One night when she called me , she was a little confused but able to let me know that she ’d rapidly lost 15 pounds and , for the first time I could recall , admitted that something hurt : her abdomen .
Later , after a CT scan and a liver biopsy , an oncologist in Seattle told her that she had metastatic carcinoma of the pancreas .
A frighteningly high serum calcium level caused by the cancer had brought on her confusion ; that problem was corrected , and so she was lucid when she said no to the chemotherapy that might have extended her life by several months .
At 85 , she gathered around her my siblings and me , her brother and sister , and all her grandchildren , and said goodbye .
She died in her sleep a few weeks later .
For both of my parents , death came unobstructed .
This is what all of us wish to have happen : to run up to the edge and fall over .
But it does n’t happen to many people who ignore how the end might come for them .
Although it may be a form of arrogance to attempt the management of one ’s own death , is it better to surrender that management to the arrogance of someone else ?
We know we ca n’t avoid dying , but perhaps we can avoid dying badly .
Dodging a bad death has become more complicated over the past 30 or 40 years .
Before the advent of technological creations that permit vital functions to be sustained so well artificially , medical ethics were less obstructed by abstract definitions of death .
The current generally agreed upon criteria for brain death have simplified some of these confusions , but they have not solved them .
The broad middle ground between our usual health and consciousness as the expected norm on the one hand , and clear death of the brain on the other , lacks certainty .
Doctors and other health - care workers can provide patients and families with probabilities for improvement or recovery , but statistics are hardly what is wanted .
Even after profound injury or the diagnosis of an illness that statistically is nearly certain to be fatal , what people hear is the word nearly .
How do we not allow the death of someone who might be saved ?
How do we avoid the equally intolerable salvation of a clinically dead person ?
Injecting political agendas into these end - of - life complexities only confuses the problem without providing a solution .
Of course we will die , and of course we as a society should ponder the implications of management solutions .
The questions are how , when , and on whose terms we depart .
It is curious that people might be convinced to avoid confronting death while they are healthy , and that society tolerates ad hominem arguments that obstruct rational debate over an authentic problem of ethics in an uncertain world .
Forty years ago , when I was an intern at the University of Chicago Hospitals , we were the local emergency room for everyone on the South Side : bankers , barbers , heroin dealers , professors , prostitutes , real - estate developers , housewives , students .
In those days , most discovery of disease was clinical : listening , looking , feeling , thinking .
One of the most common reasons for admission to the hospital by way of the emergency room was a stroke .
Diagnosis and treatment for a stroke were based on the patient ’s history and a physical exam .
From outside a curtained - off cubicle in the ER , a senior resident might inform the house officer on call , “ Another fascinating case of left middle - cerebral stroke down here . ”
Admitting stroke victims to the ward was not a sought - after duty for the neurology and general internal - medicine residents who divided that chore on alternate days .
The correct diagnosis was usually known by the time the patient reached the ward , but trying to get a complete medical history , do a thorough physical , and attend to the paperwork meant more sleep deprivation for the house staff on the receiving end .
Stroke patients were put to bed on a ward where they either died or recovered enough to go to a nursing home or to rehab .
Along the way , the interns and residents sorted out the patients ’ hypertension , cardiac abnormalities , and diabetes , and the nurses nursed them .
The costs were low because testing was scant , drugs were few , and therapies were limited .
The patients either died or recovered enough to be quickly moved off the acute - care wards .
All that changed with the advent of computers and other new technologies .
Today ’s stroke patient , if he is a big - city resident , is rushed to a tertiary care center and seen within minutes by board - certified neurologists and interventional neuroradiologists .
He is certain to have a CT scan , probably an MRI , and maybe an angiogram .
If he meets certain criteria , he will be given tPA or another clot buster .
The manufacturers of the drugs and hospital equipment , as well as the hospitals , promote the advantages of this kind of care , and it may improve the chances of survival by a few percentage points .
If the patient does survive the stroke and treatment and makes it into the critical care unit ( CCU ) , the bill will already have reached thousands of dollars .
Any seriously ill older person who winds up in a modern CCU immediately yields his autonomy .
Even if the doctors , nurses , and staff caring for him are intelligent , properly educated , humanistically motivated , and correct in the diagnosis , they are manipulated not only by the tyranny of technology but also by the rules established in their hospital .
In addition , regulations of local and state licensing agencies and the federal government dictate the parameters of what the hospital workers do and how they do it , and every action taken is heavily influenced by legal experts committed to their client ’s best interest — values frequently different from the patient’s .
Once an acutely ill patient finds himself in this situation , everything possible will be done to save him ; he is in no position to offer an opinion .
Eventually , after hours or days ( depending on the illness and who is involved in the care ) , the wisdom of continuing treatment may come into question .
But by then the patient will likely have been intubated and placed on a ventilator , a feeding tube may have been inserted , a catheter placed in the bladder , IVs started in peripheral veins or threaded through a major blood vessel near the heart , and monitors attached to record an EKG , arterial blood pressure , temperature , respirations , oxygen saturation , even pressure inside the skull .
Sequential pressure devices will have been wrapped around the legs .
All the digital marvels have alarms , so if one is n’t working properly , an annoying beep , like the sound of a backing truck , will fill the patient ’s room .
Vigilant nurses will add drugs by the dozens to the IV or push them into ports .
Families will hover uncertainly .
Meanwhile , tens and perhaps hundreds of thousands of dollars will have been transferred from one large corporation — an insurer of some kind — to another large corporation — a health care delivery system of some kind .
While the expense of the drugs , manpower , and technology required to make a diagnosis and deliver therapy does sop up resources and thereby deny treatment that might be more fruitful for others , including the 46.3 million Americans who , according to the Census Bureau , have no health insurance , that is n’t the real dilemma of the critical care unit .
The problem is in divining from the outset who will live , who will resume a meaningful life , and who will spend his final days or weeks comatose or in misery .
The last person able to comment is an older patient already critically ill with stroke , trauma , metastatic cancer , organ failure , heart disease , or some combination of all these conditions .
In America , the problem is n’t getting into or out of a CCU ; the predicament is in knowing who should be there in the first place .
Before we become ill , we tend to assume that everything can be treated and treated successfully .
The prelate in Willa Cather ’s Death Comes for the Archbishop was wiser .
Approaching the end , he said to a younger priest , “ I shall not die of a cold , my son .
I shall die of having lived . ”
The best way to avoid unwanted admission to a critical care unit at or near the end of life is to write an advance directive ( a living will or durable power of attorney for health care ) when healthy .
Regrettably , not many people do this and , more regrettably , often the document is not included in the patient ’s chart or it goes unnoticed .
In one large study , only about 7 percent in a cohort of geriatric patients from a large group practice had written advance directives , and of these , slightly more than half of the paperwork made it to the patient ’s chart .
Even then , not many of the staff members knew it was there .
Fewer than half the charts containing the advance directives identified that fact in any way , and in about a third the presence of the documents was not recorded .
So even if an advance directive has been executed , it is up to family and friends of the disabled sick person to make this fact known to the attending medical staff , to make sure the document is properly included in the records , and to be unanimous in agreement with the patient ’s wishes .
The bedside in a CCU is not the place to adjudicate a family argument , for , as Tolstoy put it , “ Every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way . ”
I once cared for an elderly man who had been in good health until a car hit him in a crosswalk .
He had a hemorrhage in his brain that would soon have been fatal had he not wound up being intubated in our emergency room , then transferred to the CCU .
This patient was widowed , had six children , and did have advance directives in his chart .
The large family gathered , except for one son who lived in another state .
After 36 hours an EEG confirmed brain death .
I suggested that recovery was not possible and that we should abide by the patient ’s clear wish that he be allowed to die .
Everyone present sobbed in agreement but wanted to maintain the ventilator until the last brother arrived from out of town .
This brother , they all warned , probably would not agree with them .
Indeed , the sick man ’s youngest son did n’t get along with the rest of the family , and as soon as he walked into the CCU , he began to obstruct his father ’s wishes .
For six days the son demanded we continue treatment , until finally the old man ’s heart slowly stopped on its own .
Medical devices cluttered the dark room , which smelled like coma ( an identifiable odor ) .
Everyone was sad and angry .
Tears and shouts became the epitaph for a thoughtful old man who had made it plain that in such a situation he simply hoped to die .
The things his children remembered about his final hours were the squeak of a ventilator and the slowing beep of the cardiac monitor measuring a heart rate headed for zero .
ER doctors and internists fear making errors of omission much more than errors of commission , and so questions arising from an excess of caution are often asked over and over .
Not long ago , an emergency - room doctor called asking me to look at the MRI of an 80 - year - old woman found collapsed in her bathroom .
She had hemorrhaged into her brainstem — the entirety of that small tightly wound bundle of cells connecting the brain to the spinal cord .
The clot leaped out at me from the computer screen ; it clearly meant death .
Blood had replaced all the vital neurons connecting the patient to her life .
“ She ’s already dead , ” I explained to the doctor on the phone .
“ There is n’t anything to treat . ”
An hour later , our intensivist phoned from the CCU with the same questions .
“ Should n’t we treat her hydrocephalus ? ” he wanted to know .
While it was true that the clot was so huge the patient ’s spinal fluid pathways were obstructed and the hollow center of her brain where spinal fluid is manufactured had grown larger , that was hardly the problem .
Treating it would only delay her heart from stopping .
“ No , ” I replied .
“ She ’s dead .
She should n’t even be in the CCU .
Why do n’t we transfer her to the ward ? ”
At the end of the morning clinic , my pager went off again .
This time it was the internist calling from the ward .
“ What are we going to do about this older woman with the clot in her brainstem ? ” she wondered .
Any older patient admitted through a big - city emergency department these days would be thoroughly evaluated and imaged while they ’re there .
This is the moment for family members and friends to state the person ’s wishes strongly .
Though outcomes ca n’t be predicted with complete accuracy , in many cases the odds at least are very well known .
If there is only a small chance for meaningful recovery , it is best to keep the patient out of critical care units and let him take what comes on the regular ward .
A sick person may still recover there , but only on his own terms .
The ability to retain this control requires advance directives and the agreement of family and friends .
It also requires these people to be present at the hospital and for them to be vigilant .
Many members of the professional staff in large hospitals — residents , fellows , junior attending staff , and some nurses — are young people with great learning but little experience .
They do best when offered direction .
Though accidents will always happen , some personal behaviors also can lead to ruin .
Part of our ability to marginalize death comes from our early experiences in living .
Because chance allows us to get away with a good deal of risky behavior when we are young — smoking , drinking and eating to excess , driving fast — we assume too often that it will always be so .
But statistics catch up with us , and excess increases the odds against us .
To reduce the odds of dying badly , we should avoid living badly , and to do that we have to examine our motivations .
The other side of this same page is the necessity to treat those chronic conditions with proven remedies and not to ignore them .
Diabetes , heart disease , and high blood pressure are illnesses that , while not often curable , can be effectively controlled .
Rather than trying to treat a chronic disease that has already done its damage , controlling it can result in greater longevity and happier lives .
Edith Piaf famously sang , “ Non , je ne regrette rien ” ( No , I regret nothing ) , but most sick , old people are unlikely to feel that way .
Since we are sure to die of having lived , we should prepare for death before the last minute .
Entire corporations are dedicated to teaching people how to retire well .
All of their written materials , Web sites , and seminars begin with the same advice : start planning early .
Should n’t we at least occasionally think about how we want to leave our lives ?
We tend to plot our lives , like we view the course of history , in decades , but our bodies speak to us in their own language and at their own rate .
When I played football in college on Saturday afternoons , I was beaten up and spent most of the next day recovering .
But by Monday it was over , and I was able to swagger back to the gym for practice .
Now that I am nearing retirement , my recoveries are longer — or not at all .
When I get up off the floor , I grunt as I remember my grandfather doing .
My hair is gone , and my beard is white .
These are changes in my physical self that should be accepted .
Flannery O’Connor , who died young of systemic lupus , wrote , “ Sickness before death is a very appropriate thing and I think those who do n’t have it miss one of God ’s mercies . ”
Doctors do n’t cure much ; they only delay things .
As conventional medical treatment has become more technological and less humanistic , some patients seek magic in other disciplines : acupuncture , chiropractic , holistic medicine or naturopathy , faith healing .
These hopeful ideas will all fail too .
In the end , we will die not only because we have lived , but as we have lived .
Sick people acquire no great insights just because they are sick .
If you hope for a miracle , look now , because one is n’t likely to find you when you ’re on a ventilator in the CCU .
Because we understand the metaphor of conflict so well , we are easily sold on the idea that we must resolutely fight against our afflictions ( although there was once an article in The Onion titled “ Man Loses Cowardly Battle With Cancer ” ) .
And there is a place to contest an abnormal metabolism , a mutation , a trauma , or an infection .
But there is also a place to surrender .
When the organs have failed , when the mind has dissolved , when the body that has faithfully housed us for our lifetime has abandoned us , what ’s wrong with giving up ?
While the technical and cost potential of bio-products to compete with petroleum grows , can they match its giant scale ?
Mark Bünger explains why massively ramping up output will be the biggest challenge for bioenergy .
Petroleum - based products such as fuels and plastics are vilified for their economic and environmental drawbacks .
Businesses , scientists and governments are urgently seeking a reliable supply of affordable fuels and industrial materials , and a reduction in the amount of carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere , and are looking to bio - based products to deliver them .
However , even as they seek to mitigate its drawbacks , they want to match oil ’s primary benefit – the availability of a large quantity of versatile , valuable material .
To date , most biofuels and biomaterials developers have focused on lab - and demo - scale studies to improve performance and reduce cost so they can compete with petroleum products , and those goals are coming within sight .
But in order to truly replace petroleum - based fuels and materials , they would need to reach petroleum parity , meaning that they were competitive on physical properties , cost , and scale .
When investigating whether bio - based products can match or beat petroleum on these three measures , Lux Research reached a number of key findings .
Viable Bio-Based Alternatives Already Exist
Bio - based alternatives exist that can substitute for 92 % of petroleum ’s products .
Today , biomaterials and biofuels replace just 0.2 % of petroleum products such as gasoline , diesel , and polyethylene .
But technology exists to manufacture thousands of petroleum - based products from biomass .
In principle , many more of the fuels and materials we derive from petroleum today could be replaced by bio - based alternatives like biopolypropylene , biobutanol , and biocrude .
Below : Companies such as DuPont are developing biobutanol processes
For example , starch - based plastics often do n’t wholly stack up to those made using petrochemicals , but bio - based molecules that are identical to petroleum - derived monomers can simply be dropped into existing processes and products , boosting the substitution potential of bio - based plastics .
Processing of bioethanol to ethylene , and thence to more complicated derivatives , allows for biologically derived versions of workhorse materials such as polyethylene ( PE ) , polyvinyl chloride ( PVC ) , and polyamides ( PAs ) .
DSM recently launched castor - oil - derived EcoPaXX , a high - performance engineering plastic with a melting point of 250 °C that can replace PA410 .
Synthetic biology start - ups like Draths , Elevance , and Segetis are using biomass to produce molecules like benzene , olefins , and levulinic acid that can lead to bio - based replacements for industrial chemical mainstays like phthalates , solvents , and nylon .
Unlike bioethanol , which can be blended with gasoline only up to 10 % , biobutanol is chemically compatible and energy - dense enough to potentially replace gasoline .
Start - ups ButylFuel , Tetravitae , and Gevo are developing biobutanol processes , as is a DuPont–BP joint venture .
Dozens of companies such as PetroAlgae and Australia ’s CSIRO Forest Biosciences are starting to produce renewable diesel and ‘ biocrude ’ from algae and bacteria that are direct substitutes for petroleum fuels ; Solazyme has even won a contract to supply 20,000 gallons of SolaDiesel to the US Navy .
If biomaterials and biofuels reach their maximum substitution potential with today ’s technology , they could replace 4.8 trillion litres of petroleum annually , or 92 % of the total .
In theory , of course , new technologies yet to be developed could produce biologically - based replacements for all petroleum , which is itself derived from biomass .
Cost Parity Achievable Within Five Years
Lux ’s next key conclusion was that biofuels and biomaterials will be reach cost parity with petroleum over the next three to five years .
The cost of biologically - derived alternatives to petroleum products , without subsidies , ranges from 125 % of the petroleum equivalent and upward for most fuels and plastics , even at industrial scale .
For example , cane bioethanol can be made profitably at US $ 1.25 per gallon of gasoline equivalent , thanks to the plant yield in rainy parts of Brazil .
Corn bioethanol in the US , on the other hand , is reeling from low oil prices and plants are closing .
Based on US Congressional Budget Office estimates , with corn currently costing $ 3.70 per bushel , bioethanol costs $ 4.11 per gallon of gasoline equivalent ; subsidies and co-product sales lower this to about $ 1.52 / gal .
First - generation ( cane and corn ) bioethanol producers include Cosan , POET , ADM , Cargill , Aventine , Pacific Ethanol , and VeraSun ; the latter three , like many other first - generation biofuel producers , are currently bankrupt and looking to be acquired ( by Valero in VeraSun ’s case ) .
Second - generation , or cellulosic , bioethanol currently costs about $ 6 per gallon to produce ( including capital and logistics costs ) , and one ton of dry biomass will yield around 50 gallons .
Petroleum - derived plastics consume only about 18 % of petroleum produced , but these higher - value materials provide a disproportionate amount of the revenue compared to fuels – for example , $ 1.50 / kg for ethylene , compared to an equivalent of $ 0.34 / kg for gasoline at $ 1/gal .
While small - scale producers have cranked out bioethylene for $ 25/ kg , several large projects are underway to produce bioethylene and biopropylene on an industrial scale , starting from bioethanol derived from Brazilian sugarcane .
For example , Solvay Indupa ‘s factory in Santo Andre , Brazil is expected to be fully operational in 2010 , with an expected annual capacity of 60,000 tons of bioethylene , 360,000 tons of PVC , 360,000 tons of vinyl chloride , and 235,000 tons of caustic soda .
Braskem already has a pilot plant , and expects to open an industrial facility by 2011 with a capacity of 200,000 tons per year .
Dow Chemical and Crystalsev have a new facility , also planned to open by 2011 , with a capacity of 350,000 tons per year , while Industrial Biotechnology and Cosan have announced a plant on the US Gulf coast that will import bioethanol from Brazil and should produce at least 200,000 tons of ethylene per year .
However , even at industrial scale , bioethylene is projected to cost approximately $ 4/kg – a 270 % mark - up on its petroleum - based equivalent .
Despite these apparently high costs , process improvements and economies of scale mean that biofuel and biomaterial costs are on a glidepath to intercept petroleum costs within the next three to five years .
Confronting the Challenges of Scale
The biggest challenge facing bio - based alternatives to oil is scale ; they must be available in a meaningful fraction of the vast quantities produced by today ’s $ 250 billion petroleum industry to make an economic and environmental impact , and much larger scale is needed to help drive down costs .
Waste biomass from crops and forests could provide a significant fraction of future fuel .
To date , most biofuels have been derived from corn in the US , or from sugarcane in Brazil , but these crops ca n’t be grown in arid regions or poor soil , so their scale is limited .
Looking at all biomass , the US government ’s ‘ Billion - ton Study ’ found that the US produces 1.3 billion tons of biomass suitable for conversion to biofuels .
Notably , the main sources of feedstock were not purpose - grown crops , but 316 million dry tons of residue from forestlands and 534 million dry tons of crop residues and other waste .
In our estimates of global land use potential and yield , we found maximum available biomass actually exceeds oil equivalents , overwhelmingly due to the potential of waste biomass .
Biomass from new crops requires unsustainable land - use changes and water resources .
A hectare of soybeans will yield 1.5 tons of dry biomass that can be converted into 200 kg of plastic or 197 litres of diesel .
Some plant growers are attempting to refine oily crops to be higher - yield , or to extract oils from non -food plants like jatropha on non-arable land , but unfortunately these plants tend to require as much as 1000 litres of irrigated water per litre of fuel , which could strain water resources as badly , or worse than , simply sticking with current biomass mix .
While policymakers or developers might choose this unsustainable path , more likely future biofuels and biomaterials will need to be derived from biomass sources that demand little or no net water additions or major changes in land use .
Doing otherwise would more than eliminate the environmental benefits that were the reason for biofuels and biomaterials in the first place .
Algae cultivated on land also requires far too much water .
At the same time , a burgeoning algae industry is working on industrial methods to take advantage of algae ’s prolific growth for use as a bio - based source of fuels and materials , driving yields up from 5 tons to as much as 15 tons per acre per year .
However , not even leading algal producer Martek has got beyond test batches of feedstocks for fuels or chemicals today .
Moreover , covering vast areas of land with algae growing in water faces the same water - use conflict as irrigated crops , noted above , suggesting algae - based alternatives will have to be limited to small scale or to algae harvested from open water .
If biomaterials and fuels utilize the maximum potential available biomass , with no food substitution , they could replace 21 trillion litres of petroleum annually – 447 % of the total .
In the best case scenario , biofeedstocks reach just 3 % of petroleum ’s share in 2020 .
So while biofuels and biomaterials are an insignificant competitor to petroleum products today , it ’s at least theoretically possible that could change .
Technical performance of biomaterials is potentially good enough to substitute for a large percentage of petroleum .
Costs , while still high , are declining , while oil prices have resumed their upward climb .
And there ’s theoretically more than enough biomass feedstock available to meet fuel and material demand .
Clearly , scale remains the key problem to solve :
To make a meaningful dent in petroleum use , bio - based alternatives need biomass feedstock – a lot more of it than they can get today .
We looked at global availability and economics for major feedstock classes , and estimated how much of them could be accessible by typically - sized biorefineries ( with a 15 km to 50 km input radius ) in 2020 .
Looking to 2020 , what part of then - current demand of 40 billion barrels will come from bio - based matter and energy ?
Crops Will Pose Expansion Challenges
Crops like soy , cane , and corn are highly restricted to cultivatable land areas , which occupy about 10 % of the nearly 2 billion ha needed to fully replace petroleum .
Since the land and the plants were originally developed to their effective maximum potential to provide food , significant expansion of this space almost inevitably means a reduction in food availability , which is politically and economically unfeasible .
There are marginal expansions where , for example , grazing land can be cut back as livestock herds shrink , but these do not meaningfully change the overall picture .
Nevertheless , aggressive government policies around the world should drive an approximate doubling of biofuel supplies from crops like soy , cane , and corn from 464 million barrels today to 977 million barrels in 2020 .
Above : Algae offers potential opportunities but challenges of scale
To wring more from uncultivated land , researchers have explored the use of non-food crops like miscanthus and jatropha that can grow on land unsuitable for food .
However , even as the Chinese and Indian governments in particular dedicated vast swathes of land to growing these potential fuel plants , scientists discovered in field tests that the yields are vastly lower than predicted , unless huge quantities of water were applied to the fields – an option that ’s simply unsustainable .
While companies such as Ceres , Agrivida , and Mendel Biotechnologies are working to improve the yield of food and non-food crops like miscanthus with the aid of genetic engineering techniques , slow adoption by conservative farmers means that the additional impact of these crops is minimal .
Even assuming that some of the grand projects do proceed , we estimate non-food crops will expand to just 107 million barrels annually by 2020 , up from immeasurably small lab quantities today .
Investment Costs and Scale an Issue for Algae
Algae multiply prodigiously , doubling their weight in as little as 12 hours if given enough carbon dioxide , water , and sunlight .
Their tendency to proliferate has spurred developers like Solix and AB2E to construct vast artificial ponds and enclosed photobioreactors , where waste CO 2 from coal plants , advanced light - catching geometries , and light sources like Bionavitas ’ maximize their growth potential .
Credible analyses show that in the right conditions , algae raised in a photobioreactor could produce 20,000 gallons of diesel fuel per year per acre , beating any other feedstock by one or two orders of magnitude .
The dealbreaker , however , is in the vast capital investment these photobioreactors require – from $ 20 / m2 to $ 100 / m2 , or $ 200,000 / ha to $ 1 million / ha – adding $ 100 to the cost of a barrel of fuel feedstock .
These costs are not readily amenable to improvement through scientific breakthroughs , and are at best likely to decline 10 % over the next 10 years .
Based on the horrendous capital outlays , we believe that closed - system algae are unlikely to contribute measurably to biofuel supply at all .
Companies like Kai Biotechnologies grow algae in open water , where capital costs are negligible , nutrients and sunlight plentiful , and microorganisms literally feel right at home .
Given an optimal set of circumstances , open - water breeders might learn within 10 years to cultivate and process algae as productively as photobioreactors today ( in addition to solving known problems like contamination and dewatering ) .
At those rates , an area of 325,000 ha would economically produce about 2.6 million gallons annually .
Since scale is the issue , developers should consider other companies farming the oceans .
For example , Ocean Tech is farming macroalgae ( kelp ) , while Algae Systems , StatoilHydro , and Algasol are growing algae in inexpensive , extruded plastic bags in the ocean , where water , sun , and surface area are abundant .
Nonetheless , the likely contribution to total world fuel supply is minimal , at 60,000 barrels annually .
While purpose - grown feedstocks have no hope of significantly changing the petroleum picture , their residues as well as the tracts of land not currently cultivated at all can be more effectively harvested to gather biomass .
The US ‘ Billion Ton ’ study found 1.3 billion tons of forest and agricultural waste biomass available ; extrapolating to global figures and using updated conversion ratios , we find roughly 7 billion tons , or about 7 billion BOE .
By 2020 , at most 1 billion BOE of this will be economically accessible by nearby biorefineries .
Municipal solid waste could potentially add another 102 million barrels annually by 2020 , and firms such as Enerkem and Fulcrum are pursuing this by offsetting the $ 30 a ton it costs to landfill municipal solid water , benefitting from negative raw material costs as producers will pay to have their waste taken away .
Confronting the Sobering Reality
It was a car race ‘ game–turned - reality ' show when a seven - year - old boy lead police in a ‘ need for speed ' fashion in Weber County , Utah .
Responding to reports of a ‘ child driving recklessly ' , police have indicated that the rugrat ran a stop sign before his apprehension .
The boy stole the car keys and escaped in his father 's white Dodge Intrepid in an attempt to avoid going to church on a Sunday morning .
He ran a stop sign and almost hit another driver before leading officers in a low - speed car chase .
He managed to escape the officers , made his way home and ran to hide inside the house .
His skills as a driver were under the testing time when a group of police officers started chasing him only to add to their frustration .
Fortunately , no one was hurt but the little boy can't be prosecuted since he is too young .
The officers tried fruitlessly to stop the child , who reached speeds of about 40 mph , before he stopped in a driveway and ran into his house .
Under questioning by his father , the kid said he did n't want to go to church .
Police , unable to arrest the child due to his age , had rather urged the dad to keep his keys out of reach .
Federal border agents have begun flying unmanned Predator B aerial drones along the border between Texas and Mexico this week , The Hill reports .
The newspaper .
quoting congressional sources , says U.S. Customs and Border Protection made the first flight from Arizona to New Mexico to near El Paso .
Drones are already in use along the border with Canada and in the New Mexico and Arizona border areas .
The new flights extend coverage to Texas , The Economist reports .
Sen . Kay Bailey Hutchison , R - Texas , is working with the FAA to approve drone patrols along the entire Texas border by the end of summer , The Hill says .

ANGLE’S ‘SECOND AMENDMENT REMEDIES ’….
Of all the issues with Sharron Angle , the extremist Republican Senate candidate in Nevada , perhaps the most frightening is her willingness to talk about armed insurrection against the United States government .
Her policy positions make her appear nutty , but this portion of her rhetorical repertoire makes her appear dangerous .
Given that Angle has spoken publicly about the possibility more than once , the Las Vegas Review - Journal , a conservative paper , asked the Senate candidate to explain what she means when she talks about “ Second Amendment remedies ” to political disputes .
Angle seemed annoyed by the question .
“ I ca n’t believe people are even asking that , ” Angle said in the brief interview .
“ I ’m very much a proponent of the Second Amendment and the Constitution .
But what we have to focus on here is a movement , a movement that ’s about retiring Harry Reid ” by voting him out of office . ”
This vague and unhelpful answer came the same day Angle literally ran away from a journalist asking the same question .
This wo n’t do .
A candidate for the U.S. Senate , who has already won her party ’s nomination , has talked openly about the possibility of the armed overthrow of the government .
Asked to clarify , she either flees from journalists , or gives a non-answer .
It ’s incumbent on all candidates to explain their beliefs to voters , but in this case , Angle ’s extremism makes the responsibility all the more acute .
Jon Chait explained , “ There ’s been a lot of wild , loose rhetoric on the right since Obama took office — wilder and more mainstream than the equivalent on the left under George W. Bush — but Angle is really taking things dangerously far .
The protection of the law is not enough to ensure the survival of a democracy .
Democracies rely upon certain social and cultural norms in order to survive .
An important one is a basic respect for the democratic process and a refusal to hint about the idea of actual armed rebellion .
Angle did not quite advocate armed rebellion , but she did clearly egg it on it in a way that melds prediction with encouragement … .
The alarming thing is not so much what Angle said but how relatively little a ripple it has made … .
It really seems like a dangerous milestone is the darkening mood of the American right . ”
Angle wo n’t be able to literally run from this indefinitely .
Will We See Lindsey Strutt ’s Vagina Soon ?
Maybe I ’m wrong but ever since Lindsey Strutt launched her official website it seems like she is posing more and more naked .
She keeps finding ways to cover her vagina but I would n’t be surprised if we get to see her 100 % nude very soon .
Just check out last two pics from this set of Lindsey in a pink bra and panties .
That is basically half a vagina showing so whats the point ?
Not to mention all the camel toe shots leading up to them .
Soon enough we will get to see the full thing and I for one am looking forward to it !

I might give the phenomenon a pass if it turned out that , once they were older , little girls who play - acted at sexy were more comfortable in their skins or more confident in their sexual relationships , if they asked more of their partners or enjoyed greater pleasure .
But evidence is to the contrary .
In his book , “ The Triple Bind : Saving Our Teenage Girls From Today ’s Pressures , ” Stephen Hinshaw , chairman of the psychology department at the University of California , Berkeley , explains that sexualizing little girls — whether through images , music or play — actually undermines healthy sexuality rather than promoting it .
Those bootylicious grade - schoolers in the dance troupe presumably do n’t understand the meaning of their motions ( and thank goodness for it ) , but , precisely because of that , they do n’t connect — and may never learn to connect — sexy attitude to erotic feelings .
That ongoing confusion between desirability and desire may help explain another trend giving parents agita : the number of teenage girls — 22 percent according to a 2008 survey by the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy — who have electronically sent or posted nude or seminude photos of themselves .
I have to admit that part of me is impressed by their bravado .
Maybe , rather than cause for alarm , this was a sign of progress — indication that girls were taking charge of their sexuality , transcending the double standard .
Yet you have to wonder :
Just because they ’re flaunting it , are they feeling it ?

I find myself improbably nostalgic for the late 1970s , when I came of age .
In many ways , it was a time when girls were less free than they are today : fewer of us competed on the sports field , raised our hands during math class or graduated from college .
No one spoke the word “ vagina , ” whether in a monologue or not .
And there was that Farrah flip to contend with .
Yet in that oh - so - brief window between the advent of the pill and the fear of AIDS , when abortion was both legal and accessible to teenagers , there was — at least for some of us — a kind of Our Bodies , Ourselves optimism about sex .
Young women felt an imperative , a political duty , to understand their desire and responses , to explore their own pleasure , to recognize sexuality as something rising from within .
And young men — at least some of them — seemed eager to take the journey with us , to rewrite the rules of masculinity so they would prize mutuality over conquest .
That notion now seems as quaint as a one - piece swimsuit on a 5 - year - old .
Sexual entitlement , according to Deborah Tolman , a professor at Hunter College and author of “ Dilemmas of Desire : Teenage Girls Talk About Sexuality , ” has instead become the latest performance , something girls act out rather than experience .
“ By the time they are teenagers , ” she said , “ the girls I talk to respond to questions about how their bodies feel — questions about sexuality or desire — by talking about how their bodies look .
They will say something like , ‘ I felt like I looked good . ’
Looking good is not a feeling . ”
Lippi ’s indecision hindered Italy ’s World Cup progression
Marcelo Lippi came into this World Cup with a series of systems and nearly all appeared at some point in the group stages , not due to flexibility within the team , but more out of desperation and trying something ‘ different ’ .
Italy went through qualification with Andrea Pirlo playing behind the strikers but Pirlo ’s injury cut these plans short , there was also talk beforehand about Lippi playing a 4 - 3 - 3 or 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 system .
It seems that Lippi did not really know what their best system was , for in all three group games , he changed the system in the second half .
In qualification Lippi used a 4 - 3 - 1 - 2 system in the latter stages to squeeze through and qualify first .
With Andrea Pirlo playing in the ‘ hole ’ , this system had to be scrapped when he got injured as they had no direct replacement in the squad .
Lippi made some strange decisions over the three games , he seemed intent on playing a 4 - 3 - 3 system and the only game he did not start with it was against New Zealand , where interestingly , he opted to start with a 4 - 4 - 2 .
A three - man defence was built to deal effectively when playing against a 4 - 4 - 2 and it was not until the second - half that Lippi swapped things around .
In the second - half Lippi changed it so New Zealand ’s back - three had a man each to deal with , giving runners from midfield the opportunity to exploit the space produced from the movement by the three - strikers .
It was through staunch New Zealand defending that kept Italy from scoring a second , the same type of defending that has been shown throughout the tournament .
Lippi would probably have regrets have over starting with two up - front , especially when it was well - known that New Zealand would start with their 5 - 3 - 2 system and playing a 4 - 4 - 2 would be playing into the Kiwi ’s hands .
Against Paraguay
In this poor game Italy opted for a 4 - 3 - 3 with Iaquinta wide on the left and Pepe on the right .
Iaquinta actually only received eight passes when he was on the left .
The forwards were very isolated and the first - half and the passing was not helped by Claudio Marchisio and his lacklustre passing ( 63 % ) .
The failure to make inroads in the game caused Lippi to change system again to a 4 - 4 - 2 .
Admittedly , Italy did improve in the second - half , especially with the introduction of Camaronesi , who added some much needed running from deep .
His runs made the Paraguay wary of implementing a high line as he could run beyond the defence , allowing Italy more time on the ball and allowed them to keep possession easier .
Against Slovakia
In the first half , Lippi set up Italy in a 4 - 3 - 3 , similar to the formation started with against Paraguay but instead of Iaquinta playing in an unnatural position on the left , Di Natale replaced him and was more comfortable and was more influential in the game .
Out of the attacking players on the pitch , he was the player who was most passed to .
Slovakia were dominant in midfield by playing five in midfield in a 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 , the first time they had played this formation in the World Cup .
It worked wonders as Hamšík , who got two assists was often the extra man and his creation and ability to keep possession helped Slovakia control Italy ’s midfield .
In the second half , Lippi reverted to a 4 - 4 - 2 with the wingers pushed high up the pitch .
The system change did not really make any difference to the lack of cohesion and penetration showed by Italy in the first - half until the last fifteen minutes .
Italy seemingly panicked and realised that they could go out of the World Cup and they played with more fluidity and less touches .
The introduction of Pirlo also helped .
He looked for the right pass and saw passes that Montolivio is incapable of producing consistently .
Pirlo ’s omission from the first two and half games cannot be understated enough .
He is the focal point of the Italian team and his composure on the ball helps give direction to the Italian possession .
However , what would have helped Italy in this World Cup would have been a preferred system .
In all three games Lippi changed at half - time or early in the second half , indicating the team did not have a comfortable system where they knew what to do and where teammates were .
Without a recognised system , a team is not able to create ‘ linkages ’ between the team .
These are what I see as the way in which once a system has been chosen , players should play in accordance to this strategic plan .
These linkages are the understanding and connections between players that manifest in formations , without a clear direction , the understanding of how to implement a tactical plan loses its penetration and the chances of success .
Lippi’s call for Gattuso in their final game is indicative of a manager who , after resigning after winning the World Cup in 2006 and then returning , harking back to the heroes of that era and feeling an emotional connection to them when in truth , better options may have been available to him .
Frankly , Marcelo Lippi did not come prepared to this World Cup , the lack of clear direction and plan evident in his constant system changes is indicative of indecision and lack of confidence in his team .
The poor attacking options available as well as disastrous defending combined with indecision from the manager culminated in Italy being knocked out , bottom of the group , in possibly the easiest group of the World Cup .
WASHINGTON  The Justice Department has decided that federal prosecutors should enforce criminal provisions in the Violence Against Women
Act in cases involving gay and lesbian relationships , a newly disclosed memorandum shows .
In a seven - page legal analysis , David J. Barron , the acting assistant attorney general of the Justice Department ’s Office of Legal Counsel , concluded that federal prosecutors may use the law in cases of interstate stalking and domestic violence regardless of whether the victim or the defendant is a man or a woman .
“ The text , relevant case law and legislative history all support the conclusion ” that the law ’s criminal provisions “ apply when the offender and the victim are the same sex , ” Mr. Barron wrote .
The memorandum was addressed to the acting deputy attorney general , Gary Grindler , who had apparently asked the Office of Legal Counsel to consider the question .
The document was posted on the Justice Department ’s Web site on Wednesday .

Scotland
In a rural field close to the Suffolk coast , a pig farmer has been trying to warn off the UK 's largest bird of prey with a poster campaign .
In red and black letters , the message on the billboard is clear : " Say No To Sea Eagles Here . "
Now , it seems , his wish may have come true .
The sea eagle , or white - tailed eagle , is a rare and protected bird with a wingspan of up to 8ft ( 2.5 m ) .
It was hunted to extinction in the British Isles , but over the last 30 years it has been re-introduced successfully in parts of Scotland .
Delighted
For several years , Natural England , and the RSPB , have been planning to do the same in East Anglia , with Suffolk 's wetland coast identified as the best location .
The sea eagle project was expected to last five years and to cost £ 600,000 , but its whole future is now in doubt .
This bird would have killed a lot of our pigs , jeopardised our income , and jeopardised our business in total .
Jimmy Butler , Pig farmer
Natural England has announced the withdrawal of its financial support .
It said it could no longer afford the long - term commitment .
In the breeding area of his open - air pig farm , with young pigs chasing each other through the mud , Jimmy Butler said he was delighted at the news .
" It 's an absolute total relief to us .
This was madness in the first place , " he said .
" This bird would have killed a lot of our pigs , jeopardised our income , and jeopardised our business in total .
We are so relieved we can now just get on with keeping pigs . "
The big fear for pig farmers was not that sea eagles could have eaten their animals , but that they would have caused panic as they flew overhead , causing breeding sows to crush their young .
On a nearby poultry farm , Chris Ford had similar concerns about his free - range hens .
" We try to keep the hens as stress - free as we can , " he said .
" If I had a sea eagle come over here with an 8ft wingspan , the hens would be so easily panicked .
" They would lay fewer eggs , and if they got spooked they would all pile into the shed at once , on top of each other , and kill each other .
Sea eagle facts Image caption
The sea eagle is the UK 's largest bird of prey Sea eagles are scavengers and feed on carrion
White - tailed sea eagles are the fourth largest eagles in the world .
Their preferred habitat is rocky coasts
" It 's very good news that Natural England has listened to us . "
But Natural England insists that local opposition has nothing to do with its decision to stop funding the sea eagle project .
Natural England 's chief scientist , Tom Tew , said the decision was purely financial .
" We 're not bowing to opposition , " he said .
" We have listened to farmers and landowners and they have entirely legitimate concerns , but all of the research shows that their concerns are either unfounded , or could be overcome .
" Today 's decision is about the current economic climate , and the need to focus ruthlessly on our existing commitments . "
The RSPB said it was disappointed at losing its partner in the re-introduction project , but that it was still committed to bringing the sea eagle back to English skies .
A spokesman said the project was postponed rather than cancelled , and that the charity would now be looking at alternative ways of funding a re-introduction scheme , in Suffolk or in a different part of England .
Nevertheless , Suffolk 's " No " campaigners will undoubtedly see the project being put on hold as a victory against what they say is a dangerous bird of prey .
FDA WANTS TO CONTROL EVERYTHING YOUR FAMILY EATS
By Doreen Hannes
May 8 , 2010
NewsWithViews.com
The Farm to Consumer Legal Defense Fund ( FTCLDF ) has achieved a tremendous coup in their suit against the FDA regarding the FDA 's abuses over transport of privately owned fresh ( unpasteurized ) milk .
In a brief the FDA filed requesting that the case against them be dismissed for lack of standing , the FDA has shown that they truly think we cannot decide what we want to eat or drink without their permission .
It 's amazing .
One would think that we could not have possibly lived prior to the formation of the FDA just over one hundred years ago .
The legal brief by the FDA actually has the audacity to proclaim in the table of contents such things as :
There is No Right to Consume or Feed Children Any Particular Food ( pg25 )
There is No Generalized Right to Bodily and Physical Health . ( pg26 )
There is No Fundamental Right to Freedom of Contract ( pg 27 )
FDA ’s Regulations Rationally Advance The Agency ’s Public Health Mission ( pg27 )
Let 's have a look at the first citation above … ( emphasis added ) beginning on page 25 …
…… there is no “ deeply rooted ” historical tradition of unfettered access to food of all kinds … .
To the contrary , society ’s long history of food regulation stretches back to the dietary laws of biblical times … .
Modern food safety regulation in the United States has its roots in the early food laws of the American colonies , which themselves incorporated “ the tradition of food regulation established in England . ” …( - citing a Virginia statute passed in 1873 , that “ made it an offense . . . [ to ] knowingly , sell , supply , or bring to be manufactured . . . milk from which any cream has been taken ; or milk commonly known as skimmed milk ” ) .
Comprehensive federal regulation of the food supply has been in effect at least since Congress enacted the Pure Food and Drugs Act of 1906 , and was strengthened by the passage of the FDCA in 1938 .
Thus , plaintiffs ’ claim to a fundamental privacy interest in obtaining “ foods of their own choice ” for themselves and their families is without merit .
If this were n't so horribly serious it would be hilarious .
The FDA is fighting a case that builds on the desire and right to consume fresh ( unpasteurized ) milk , which the FDA maintains is a lethally dangerous practice , by citing a law that prohibits any change of the nature of fresh milk !
But wait , there 's more …. we have n't begun to scratch the surface yet :
There is No Generalized Right to Bodily and Physical Health .
Plaintiffs ’ assertion of a “ fundamental right to their own bodily and physical health , which includes what foods they do and do not choose to consume for themselves and their families ” is similarly unavailing because plaintiffs do not have a fundamental right to obtain any food they wish .
( Emphasis added )
I almost can not believe they were so overt in their complete and total disregard for the most fundamental human right of all , yet their own words convict them .
If you cannot decide what food you wish to eat , you certainly cannot even entertain the idea that you are free !
The FDA has seemingly vaunted itself to the level of parenthood over the entire nation simply by being created via an act of Congress .
Like a parent telling a four year old , " Eat it !
It 's good for you ! "
Right ….. Never mind the fact that the FDA has refused to do any real testing on genetically modified foods , or that they say aspartame is fine for you to drink when it becomes toxic at 85 degrees .
Do n't even mention that they have refused to regulate nanofoods ( smaller than a molecule technologic creations ) that your body cannot assimilate .
Yet since you do n't have any " generalized right to bodily and physical health " they can allow you to be poisoned with the continued blessing of Congress .
And the likely passage of new powers to be given to the FDA will surely be helpful in giving us all " food safety " and healthful food .
Right .
Sorry , my sarcasm should be palpable .
Advertisement
According to the FDA , you do n't have a right to bodily and physical health by deciding what you want to eat or do n't want to eat .
They know better than you , even better than God Almighty and do n't you forget it .
Just wait until they have expanded powers under S510 and HR2749 .
They will almost certainly extrapolate that authority to do home refrigerator checks on whomever they want .
In their final sentence under this section of the FDA 's motion to dismiss , they really hit it out of the park :
Finally , even if such a right did exist , it would not render FDA ’s regulations unconstitutional because prohibiting the interstate sale and distribution of unpasteurized milk promotes “ bodily and physical health . ”
So you do n't have a right to it and they are promoting your non-right by their illustrious actions …
… Please .
There are a myriad of studies attesting to the healthful benefits of fresh milk .
Yes , there are concerns associated with it as well , and people should do the best they can to become educated on the subject before making a decision for themselves , but this hyperbolic ' public good ' claim is farcical at the least .
Particularly when the FDA has so miserably failed in their charge to inspect processing facilities and imports .
A recent Office of the Inspector General ( OIG ) report revealed that the FDA has inspected less than 25 % of the facilities they are charged with inspecting in five years .
They inspect LESS than 1 % of imports and allow the aforementioned biotech and nanotech foods to enter the food supply without the slightest flinch on their part .
All the while they proclaim they are performing a public good .
The final affront to all that is decent in this FDA legal brief follows :
There is No Fundamental Right to Freedom of Contract
In arguing that FDA ’s regulations violate substantive due process because they interfere with plaintiffs ’ “ contract rights ” by “ restricting the use of an agent to accomplish what the principal herself ought to be free to do , ” plaintiffs ask this Court to resuscitate long - dead , Lochner - era jurisprudence .
See Ferguson v. Skrupa , 372 U.S. 726 , 729 ( 1963 )
( “ There was a time when the Due Process Clause was used by this Court to strike down laws which were thought . . . incompatible with some particular economic or social philosophy , ” but that doctrine “ has long since been discarded ) .
Plaintiffs anachronistic invitation should be rejected .
The excerpt above has deeper implications than one might realize at a glance .
In my estimation it has a terrific amount to do with many of the obtuse rulings the state and federal courts have delivered .
We are being told that we do not have the right to make agreements .
Evidently , all agreements have been made for us by our superiors .
Historically , the only people without the right to contract are minors , felons and slaves .
Obviously , we can not be minors because we can never reach the age of majority wherein we are free to decide what we eat for ourselves .
So we are either felons or slaves .
Which category we have been relegated to is open for discussion , but we certainly are not free .
To boldly state that we have no right to freedom of contract is an astonishing , and revealing , admission .
To boldly state any one of the cites above is astonishing .
We have no right to decide what we eat or do n't eat , we have no right to bodily and physical health , we have no right to contract , and the FDA is ' rational ' .
So saith the FDA …. in Case 5:10 - cv-04018-MWB , Document 11 - 1 filed on 04/26/10 .

The FDA believes that we are too stupid to swallow .
Yet we are supposed to swallow that they are interested in securing a safe food supply for us , and that the FDA needs more power to regulate food on farms and we should give it to them by passing S510 or HR2749 .
They 'll take care of us …you betcha .

SAINT
LOUIS , April 20 , 2010 -- The final four spots have been filled for the 2010 U.S. Championship , which is set for May 13 - 25 at the Chess Club and Scholastic Center of Saint Louis ( CCSCSL ) .
The 24 - player field was finalized today with the four , official wildcard selections : GM Alexander Stripunsky ( NJ ) , GM Vinay Bhat ( CA ) and IMs Irina Krush ( NY ) and Sam Shankland ( CA ) .
This year 's championship will feature a purse of more than $ 170,000 , the largest per-capita prize fund in the tournament 's history .
" Our four wildcards represent many aspects that are important to the Chess Club and Scholastic Center of Saint Louis , " said CCSCSL Executive Director Tony Rich .
" By nurturing America 's top juniors and women and inviting the top contenders , we have created an incredibly strong and dynamic field for this year 's championship . "
GM Alexander Stripunsky , 39 , missed out on qualifying by rating for the 2010 U.S. Championship by a single point .
On the February 2010 rating list used to invite rating qualifiers , he was rated 2615 , right behind CCSCSL GM in - residence Ben Finegold , who was rated 2616 .
Last year , he also missed out by just one spot on the rating list .
Stripunsky has an excellent record in U.S. Championships .
In 2005 , he was runner - up and lost in a playoff to reigning champion GM Hikaru Nakamura .
In 2006 , he had another strong run and finished in third place .
Stripunsky also just tied for first in the Philadelphia Open .
GM Vinay
Bhat may be the strongest eligible American who has never played in a U.S. Championship .
The 25 - year - old lives in the Bay Area and has been a chess professional ever since receiving the Samford Scholarship in 2008 .
Bhat maintains a blog , " An Unemployed Fellow , " where he gives insightful analysis on his recent games and thoughts on the tournament circuit ( vbhat.wordpress.com ) .
Samford Scholar and IM Irina Krush is a renowned team player .
She led the 2008 bronze medal Olympic team in Dresden , Germany , and was part of the 2004 silver medal Olympic team in Mallorca , Spain .
Krush , 26 , hails from Brooklyn , NY , where she manages the New York Knights U.S. Chess League team .
She is also a two - time U.S. Women 's Champion and will be the only woman in this year 's mixed event .
Krush plans to play in the 2010 U.S. Women 's Championship , set for Saint Louis from July 9 - 19 .
IM Sam Shankland , 18 , is the top rated player under 21 who was not already slated to play in the U.S. Championship .
GMs Robert Hess , Aleksandr Lenderman and Ray Robson qualified by rating and winning the U.S. Junior , respectively .
Shankland won a gold medal for the U.S. at the 2008 World Youth Championship in Vietnam .
He currently has two grandmaster norms , and is ardently searching for his third , which will qualify him for the title .
The incoming Brandeis University freshman called the U.S. Championship his " dream tournament for the year . "
He maintains a blog ( samshankland.blogspot.com ) and website ( www.samshankland.com).
Another recent addition to the U.S. Championship field is IM Levon Altounian of Arizona , who bested competitors from all over the country by winning the ICC Tournament of State Champions .
Altounian wrote a story on Chess Life Online http://main.uschess.org/content/view/10313/141/
about his quest to qualification .
" It is very exciting to play at the U.S. Championship , the most important event of the year , " Altounian said .
" I am very proud to be a part of this elite group . "
The complete list of players includes the following :
The defending U.S. Champion : GM Hikaru Nakamura

Please do not worry .
Please do not fret about that one thing you always fret about , or that other thing , or even that third thing that might have something to do with erupting oil , dead pelicans and that sickening feeling in your gut that Something is Very Wrong Indeed .
I come bearing fabulous news .
There is no longer any need to concern yourself with pesky trifles like love , a mortgage , child rearing , planting a garden , dreams , money , shoes , wristwatches , parking spaces , mysterious rashes , foreign policy , baseball , bridge tolls or generally caring about much of anything in particular .
I am delighted to report it will all be over soon .
If not sooner .
It 's true .
And it 's a good thing , too , because I was just reading up on six of the worst - case scenarios resulting from the BP spill , all sorts of horrors and tragedies , abuses and unspeakables , from dire seafood shortages to horrifying ecosystem destruction , wildlife mutilation to all the years and decades before the gulf region will be anywhere near recovered .
These scenarios all were , in a word , bleak .
They were , in three more , thoroughly f--ing depressing .
They were also , whoops , from about two months ago .
So I clicked around and quickly found another , far more recent worst - case scenario article , and boy , were its scenarios worse indeed .
So awful that they effectively made the earlier batch seem meek and laughable and even sort of quaint .
So it 's come to this .
Every day in the media , a sort of deranged , comical footrace to figure out which worst - case scenario is really the worst , because every day comes a new stat , prediction , photo , possibility for abject horror we had n't even conceptualized yet because , well , we 've never exactly been here before , not at this scale .
How bad can it all get , really ?
No one has a clue .
Joy !
But I 'm not at all worried .
Because the fact is , almost none of those worst - case scenarios will actually come to pass .
Do you know why ?
Because there are two or three even worse worst - case scenarios that easily trump any you might be reading about anywhere .
Ultra , mega , super worst - case scenarios that make all the rest seem like a little splotch on your pretty new iPhone 4 .
So , just what are these supermegaworst - case scenarios ?
They all have one thing in common :
Each one of them , all by itself , spells the end of modern life as we know it .
Utter annihilation .
The End . I am so not kidding .
OK , maybe a little .
But only until we all die .
After that , not kidding at all .
BP Will Kill Us All Scenario # 1 : Everyone knows that , early on in the spill , BP was thoughtful enough to pump millions of gallons of a horrible chemical dispersant called Corexit 9500 into the gusher , a violently toxic compound so notoriously lethal it's been banned for years by the European union .
Obama &
Co finally caught on to BP 's tactic and told them to knock it off .
Too late .
Obscure Russian scientists tell us Corexit 's deadly compounds are now breaking up and evaporating into North American rainclouds , which will shortly begin raining down complete toxic hell on us all , poisoning all crops , babies , cats , Christians , Starbucks baristas and none - too - bright redneck videographers -- though it will somehow magically spare the really good jazz clubs in Louisiana and that one guy who scored the goal for the USA in the World Cup , because he 's a freakin ' hero .
These scientists say the toxic rain could be so poisonous , it will destroy the entire food chain and plunge North America into chaos , rendering the entire region unlivable , with any straggling survivors crawling desperately up to Canada , where they will be promptly made into slave labor to build hockey arenas and drink lager and fade into the woods .
Does that sound dubious ?
Totally implausible ?
Fine .
No problem .
For there is another , even better backup apocalypse scenario , even more melodramatic and wickedly cinematic , and therefore much more likely to come to pass .
BP Will Kill Us All Scenario # 2 : Apparently , deep in the ocean floor , just beneath the gushing oil , lives a massive bubble of methane gas the size of ... oh , let 's just say Texas .
Maybe Oklahoma .
South Carolina .
Someplace gassy and slightly rancid and always ready to explode at the poke of a big phallic stick .
This is the drama :
All our mucking around on the ocean floor could trigger a methane explosion so gargantuan , it will cause a tsunami .
Not just any tsunami , mind you , but a " supersonic tsunami " so ultra- awesomely massive it will effortlessly wipe out the much of the gulf coast states , killing millions and completely destabilizing the nation and inducing zombie riots in the streets as everyone wails over the loss of Florida .
Or , you know , not .
So there you have it .
Toxic rain and supersonic tsunamis , the end of North America as we know it .
Done .
Finished .
Certainly , one of those two scenarios is guaranteed to come to pass , right ?
Maybe , if we 're really lucky , even both ?
All right , fine .
In the off - off chance that invisible Russian scientists and nutball doomsayers are wrong ( impossible ! ) , well , there is one more glorious mega scenario to consider .
There is a backup to the backup to the backup .
Hey , we 're Americans .
When it comes to dorky apocalyptic visions , we got you covered .
Here is your grand finale : A new survey says that a disturbingly large percentage of Americans -- 40 percent , to be exact -- actually believe Jesus will return by 2050 , likely riding on the back of a flaming asteroid ( 30 percent think one will hit us by then ) , waving a cowboy hat and yodeling as he careens toward our hapless blue dot of inequity , pain and lousy AT&T reception .
Jesus will then crash land in Texas , wink at Dubya and Sarah Palin , and then sweep up all the True Believers in their beige Dodge minivans just as the earth shudders and implodes , just like one of those swirling black holes in " Star Trek . "
How cool will that be ?
Answer :
It will be very cool indeed .
It is so cool , in fact , it totally wipes out the need to care much about anything at all .
See how easy ?
Now , who wants pie ?

In this lecture Steven Wolfram presents his Wolfram Alpha creation .
Wolfram Alpha is an answer engine developed by Wolfram Research .
It is an online service that answers factual queries directly by computing the answer from structured data , rather than providing a list of documents or web pages that might contain the answer as a search engine would .
The code - breaking work at Bletchley Park , which helped save Britain from Nazi Germany , qualifies as one of the greatest stories of World War II , and the misunderstood genius , Alan Turing , stands at the center of this tale .
Perhaps no one understands
Turing 's role during this period -- and his larger impact on mathematics and computing -- like B. Jack Copeland .
In this lecture , Copeland contends that Turing should be celebrated as the father of artificial intelligence .

UK oil giant BP has released video taken by a remote - controlled camera showing oil and gas gushing out of one of the ruptured pipes nearly 1.5 km underwater in the Gulf of Mexico .
The 30 - second clip posted on the US Coast Guard website gives the public a first look at the source of the massive oil spill now spreading across the US coast .
The footage shot on May 11 shows the larger of two leaks on the riser of BP 's Deepwater Horizon drilling platform , which exploded on April 20 , spewing million litres of oil into the sea .

FOR a group dedicated to the health and well - being of children to advocate the cutting of girls ' genitals seems inconceivable .
But the American Academy of Paediatrics ( AAP ) , in a review of its policy on the practice known as female circumcision , did tentatively ask if , in order to avoid the most dangerous behaviour , doctors should be allowed to perform some kind of “ ritual cut ” in the clitoral skin .
The academy likened it to ear - piercing and said that it might satisfy the cultural requirements of people wedded to the practice .
After a chorus of condemnation the AAP swiftly released a new statement , anxiously stressing that it does not endorse “ clitoral nicks ” .
Judith Palfrey , the group 's president , says there is absolutely no case for it and that doctors must oppose all forms of genital cutting on girls .
The academy 's British and Australian counterparts , and the UN , have voiced a similar position .
Cutting girls ' genitals is still common in 28 mostly African countries and among their migrants abroad .
The World Health Organisation ( WHO ) estimates that 100 m - 140 m women have been subject to the practice and thinks that some 3 m girls are at risk each year of one of four forms of cutting , ranging from the symbolic to life - ruining .
In countries such as Somalia , Egypt and Guinea , over 95 % of women have undergone some version of it .
Some see it as a matter of hygiene , others as a rite of passage into womanhood .
Its Muslim , Christian and animist defenders all cite religious grounds .
Where the practice is a prerequisite for marriage , economic factors play a role too .
Attempts to stamp out the practice have gathered pace since the 1980s .
Now 18 African countries have banned it , although laws are patchily observed .
Nawal El Saadawi , an Egyptian who suffered mutilation and has campaigned against it for more than 50 years , says that education is needed , not just prohibition .
A mixed approach probably works best .
Burkina Faso has a hotline to the police for girls who feel they are in danger .
Tasaru Ntomonok Initiative , a group in the Narok district in Kenya , has a safe house for girls fleeing their families .
Maendeleo ya Wanawake Organisation , a Kenyan women 's NGO , offers “ circumcision through words ” , an alternative rite of passage without the bloodshed .
A bigger trend is medicalisation .
In the past the procedure was typically performed by a local woman using anything from a razor blade to a piece of broken glass , sometimes even using battery acid to stop the bleeding .
More families now ask doctors to carry out the cut , in the hope that this will make it safer .
A study in Kenya in 2000 showed that using sterile razors , anti-tetanus shots and antibiotics cut the risk of immediate complications by 70 % .
Such thinking led to the debate in America about whether using doctors was the lesser of two evils .
But campaigners against cutting say the use of professionals undermines efforts to end the practice , as making it safer may encourage more parents to inflict it on their daughters .
The unkindest cut
Ayaan Hirsi Ali , a public intellectual from Somalia who renounced Islam and now lives in America , is entirely against the practice , even the symbolic form .
She argues that “ the motive for cutting off a girl 's clitoris is to reduce her sexuality ” .
Most Western countries ban it : in Britain , where around 66,000 women have undergone some form of cutting and some 33,000 girls are thought to be at risk , it is also a crime to take a British resident abroad in order to cut her .
American campaigners want a similar law .
The idea that a legalised symbolic cut would be the lesser of two evils is not new : it was discussed and rejected in Germany and the Netherlands , for example .
A hospital in Seattle , the Harborview Medical Centre , considered it in response to requests from local Somali women , who wanted an alternative to the extreme versions of the practice ( which can involve forcing the almost complete closure of the vagina with scar tissue ) .
The suggestion brought a storm of abuse .
Dena Davis , a law and ethics professor at Cleveland State University and the legal consultant on the AAP 's policy review , says that she personally favours considering a symbolic cut , because of the potential for harm reduction .
She cites Indonesia , where cutting has died out , according to the WHO , but a ritual form persists , involving a symbolic scratch of the clitoris .
The weakest point for the critics of cutting girls ' genitals is that it is still so prevalent where boys are concerned .
No laws exist against male circumcision in any Western country .
No records are kept of circumcisions performed outside of hospitals and there is no regulation of ritual practitioners .
The AAP took a neutral stance on male circumcision when it last considered the practice in 1999 .
The policy is up for review in the next year or so .
Supporters of it may note that male circumcision is unlikely to lead to , or provide cover for , the extreme mutilation that happens too often with female cutting .
Many also believe that male circumcision is helpful in slowing the spread of HIV / AIDS .
Ms Davis argues that in America at least , it is not acceptable to criminalise all female genital cutting while adopting a relaxed stance to the male sort .
She suspects that by allowing male circumcision while forbidding even a symbolic cut on girls , Western countries show respect for only those religious and cultural practices with which they are already comfortable .
Saudis scramble to contain leak pointing to al - Qaeda contacts in Iraq
May 24 , 2010 by intelNews
By JOSEPH FITSANAKIS | intelNews.org |
A series of unconfirmed reports from Iraq indicate that the Saudi monarchy has initiated a frantic probe into the leak of a secret document allegedly pointing to close links between Saudi intelligence and al - Qaeda activities in Iraq .
The leaked government document was published last Thursday by the independent Iraqi news agency Buratha , whose editors allegedly acquired it “ from a source ” .
The document appears to contain references to considerable support provided by Saudi intelligence services to militant Iraqi groups associated with al - Qaeda .
According to Buratha , the alleged support has been mostly in the form of cash , but also through significant amounts of weapons and explosives .
The alleged leak is bound to inflame the discussion about Saudi Arabia ’s purported material support for Sunni paramilitary groups in Iraq ( with tacit US consent ) , which serve Riyadh ’s broader aim of buffering the rise of Sunni militancy in the country .
Buratha further alleges that Saudi King Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz has ordered an extensive probe into the leak , which has so far involved the detaining or interrogation of several dozen Saudi intelligence officers .
The Saudi monarch has also severely reprimanded Saudi National Security Council secretary general Bandar Bin Sultan Bin Abdul Aziz ( a close personal friend of former CIA director George Tenet ) , and may soon fire him , Buratha reports .
Sign Language Study Shows Multiple Brain Regions Wired for Language
A new study from the University of Rochester finds that there is no single advanced area of the human brain that gives it language capabilities above and beyond those of any other animal species .
Instead , humans rely on several regions of the brain , each designed to accomplish different primitive tasks , in order to make sense of a sentence .
Depending on the type of grammar used in forming a given sentence , the brain will activate a certain set of regions to process it , like a carpenter digging through a toolbox to pick a group of tools to accomplish the various basic components that comprise a complex task .
" We 're using and adapting the machinery we already have in our brains , " said study coauthor Aaron Newman .
" Obviously we 're doing something different [ from other animals ] , because we 're able to learn language unlike any other species .
But it 's not because some little black box evolved specially in our brain that does only language , and nothing else . "
The team of brain and cognitive scientists � comprised of Newman ( now at Dalhousie University after beginning the work as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Rochester ) , Elissa Newport ( University of Rochester ) , Ted Supalla ( University of Rochester ) , Daphne Bavelier ( University of Rochester ) , and Peter Hauser ( Rochester Institute of Technology ) - published their findings in the latest edition of the journal Proceedings of the National Academies of Science .
To determine whether different brain regions were used to decipher sentences with different types of grammar , the scientists turned to American Sign Language for a rare quality it has .
Some languages ( English , for example ) rely on the order of words in a sentence to convey the relationships between the sentence elements .
When an English speaker hears the sentence " Sally greets Bob , " it 's clear from the word order that Sally is the subject doing the greeting and Bob is the object being greeted , not vice versa .
Other languages ( Spanish , for example ) rely on inflections , such as suffixes tacked on to the ends of words , to convey subject - object relationships , and the word order can be interchangeable .
American Sign Language has the helpful characteristic that subject - object relationships can be expressed in either of the two ways � using word order or inflection .
Either a signer can sign the word " Sally " followed by the words " greets " and " Bob " ( a construction in which word order dictates meaning ) , or the signer can use physical inflections such as moving hands through space or signing on one side of the body to convey the relationship between elements .
For the study , the team formed 24 sentences and expressed each of those sentences using both methods .
Videos of the sentences being signed were then played for the subjects of the experiment , native signers who were lying on their backs in MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) machines with coils around their heads to monitor which areas of the brain were activated when processing the different types of sentences .
The study found that there are , in fact , distinct regions of the brain that are used to process the two types of sentences : those in which word order determined the relationships between the sentence elements , and those in which inflection was providing the information .
In fact , Newman said , in trying to understand different types of grammar , humans draw on regions of the brain that are designed to accomplish primitive tasks that relate to the type of sentence they are trying to interpret .
For instance , a word order sentence draws on parts of the frontal cortex that give humans the ability to put information into sequences , while an inflectional sentence draws on parts of the temporal lobe that specialize in dividing information into its constituent parts , the study demonstrated .
" These results show that people really ought to think of language and the brain in a different way , in terms of how the brain capitalizes on some perhaps preexisting computational structures to interpret language , " Newport said .
Aside from providing perspective on how language abilities might have evolved in humans , the scientists ' findings could perhaps eventually find applications in medicine , according to Newport .
For instance , it could prove valuable in assessing how best to teach language to a person with brain damage in certain areas but not others , such as a stroke victim .
Image caption Jackson was due to play 50 dates at London's 02
Michael Jackson 's estate has made more than $ 1bn ( £ 677 m ) since his death a year ago , according to estimates by trade paper Billboard .
The magazine says Jackson 's album sales have generated about $ 383 m ( £ 259 m ) , while revenue from the film This Is It has hit nearly $ 400 m ( £ 271 m ) .
Profits from publishing rights , licensing and touring are also included in the total .
A new recording contract is estimated to have made $ 31 m ( £ 21 m ) so far .
The Sony Music Entertainment deal will see 10 albums of the late singer 's music released over the next seven years , including one of previously unreleased material .
The estate is guaranteed between $ 200 m ( £ 135 m ) and $ 250 m ( £ 169.5 m ) for the deal but Billboard believes approximately $ 31 m ( £ 21 m ) of this will have been paid in the last 12 months .
Publishing profits
Despite the This Is
It tour never getting off the ground , revenue from tickets retained by fans as souvenirs and not refunded brought in about $ 6.5 m ( £ 4.4 m ) , with merchandise raking in $ 5 m ( £ 3.4 m ) , although concert promoter AEG has a cut of these profits .
Jackson 's music publishing company , Mijac , currently has a value of around $ 150 m ( £ 102 m ) , according to Billboard .
The magazine said Mijac could have generated as much as $ 50 m ( £ 33.9 m ) in the last year .
Jackson 's estate also owns half of music publishing company , Sony / ATV .
Barry Massarsky of Massarsky Consulting estimated that Jackson 's share of Sony / ATV 's revenue is $ 80 m ( £ 54.3 m ) a year .
Other profits have come from DVD sales and rentals , downloads , royalties and ringtones .
Jackson died on 25 June last year at the age of 50 .

Man , I have never gone this long without posting something .
Yes , there 's been a lot going on and since I 'm now freelancing and back living in the western hemisphere , my schedule is all out of whack .
But I 'm ready to get back to my normal blog schedule and writing about what 's been going on in advertising and design .
I will say this though - lately , I 've been pretty bored with everything that I 've been seeing .
Anyone else feel this way ?
But this caught my attention and is anything but boring .
Imagine yourself as a major sponsor of the biggest and most successful Formula One racing team .
Your identity and brand is intertwined with the race team and to some extent Formula One itself .
You are in negotiations to financially sponsor this race team for the next five years and are willing to pay about $ 1 billion to do so .
Unfortunately for you , the European Union is set to pass a ban on cigarette advertising and your company manufactures and globally markets cigarettes .
The law goes something like this : The Tobacco Advertising Directive : Passed by the European Parliament and Council in 2003 ( see:IP/02/1788 ) , the Directive bans tobacco advertising in the print media , on radio and over the internet .
It also prohibits tobacco sponsorship of cross - border cultural and sporting events .
The best I can tell is that this went into effect in 2005 .
Right around the same time as your contract negotiations .
Obviously , Formula
One qualifies as a cross - border cultural and sporting event , but you go forward with your sponsorship anyway .
And you state that the race team 's Ferraris would simply not carry your brand 's logo where there was this ban in place .
Got all that ?
This is exactly what has been happening with Marlboro .
They 've spent a ton of money to sponsor Ferrari's Formula
One team without being able to brand the cars under this sponsorship .
Basically , the Ferrari 's appear to have no major sponsorship when raced in the EU .
End of story ?
Not exactly .
In January , Ferrari presented the new Scuderia Marlboro F1 single - seater .
( Ferrari is the only Formula One team with a tobacco brand in its formal title , Scuderia Ferrari Marlboro . )
At first glance the car is void of major sponsorship per the rules and has gone relatively unnoticed over the last four months .
Now , however , 4 races into the year , the EU portion of the Formula One season is about to begin in Spain and the car 's livery is in the spotlight due to the team 's unique solution to the ban on advertsing .
The 2010 Ferrari Scuderia ( Marlboro ) F1 , innocent top view :
The livery ( paint job ) features a predominately red car with a number of associate sponsor logos ; Shell Gasoline , Ferrari itself , Bridgestone and a few others .
The most striking aspect of this design and the subject of this article is a red , black and white barcode - like design on the canopy of the vehicle , as well as on the uniforms of drivers Fernando Alonso and Felipa Massa .
Up close it just looks like a cool aesthetic touch but from a distance ( and possibly even more clearly when moving 200 mph ) it appears to resemble the packaging of a certain cigarette manufacturer .
Can you guess which one ?
The 2010 Ferrari Scuderia ( Marlboro ) F1 , side view :
Another Larger View ( click for expanded version ) :
The EU authorities are not amused .
According to the Times ( UK ) , " Yesterday a spokesman for the European Public Health Commissioner said he thought that Marlboro ’s approach constituted potential subliminal marketing .
He urged the Spanish and British governments to ascertain whether the world ’s second - biggest tobacco company might be in breach of the law . "
Now , I think they may have their terms incorrect .
I do n't think it 's technically a subliminal thing at all .
It 's more like an optical illusion , but it's hard to deny the intent of the manufacturue and racing team to skirt the law for the upcoming Spanish Grand Prix and for this summer 's British Grand Prix .
The Barcode Design on Team Firesuits and Uniforms :
This quote comes from the Times as well : John Britton , a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians and director of its tobacco advisory group , said : “ The bar code looks like the bottom half of a packet of Marlboro cigarettes .
I was stunned when I saw it .
This is pushing at the limits ... "
But true to form , Marlboro is denying these claims .
Philip Morris said : “ We are confident that our relationship with Ferrari does not violate the UK 2002 Tobacco Advertising and Promotion Act .
The Formula One Grand Prix in the UK does not involve any race cars , team apparel , equipment or track signage carrying tobacco product branding .
The same is true for all other Formula One races across the world . ”
The Ferrari Scuderia ( Marlboro ) F1 Team Logo Featuring Barcode :
Let me say two things .
First , this is the most insanely creative design solution that I 've seen in a long , long time .
It 's nothing short of genius .
Second , it further demonstrates how desperate tobacco companies are to market their product in an increasingly legislated environment .
This ingenius design only underscores what we think about these companies and although I love the design approach and problem solving , it 's easy to see the intent here was to find a loophole in the law .
In other words : to be sneaky .
And this has been something in the works over time .
Check out the 2006 car below , followed by 2007 and then compare that to this year 's car .
It 's as if Marlboro has been trying to use a more innocent barcode design early on and then tweak it over time so there would be a precedent for the barcode as an team logo — even if it began to resemble the Marlboro packaging .
Have I said the word genius yet ?
Or do I mean evil ?
The Pre-Legislation Ferrari Marlboro Livery , circa 2005 :
The Early Barcode Ferrari Marlboro Livery , circa 2007 :
Detail shot of the 2010 Barcode Design :
It will be intersting to see how this little drama develops .
Obviously this involves a lot of money , large corporations , even larger government entities and a deadline of a few days .
And best of all maybe , it involves design and what does and does not constitute a brand 's logo .
Stay tuned .
I promise to update this as soon as I get more information .
See a little exploration / comparison of the barcode design and Marlboro combination mark .
It 's amazing how far away the two pieces are yet so close .

There 's a cold wind blowing on the hopes of wind - energy advocates in Western North Carolina , thanks to a pending bill in the N.C. General Assembly .
As early as May 12 , state legislators will take up Senate Bill 1068 when they reconvene in the short session .
The bill — which would establish a regulatory system for wind - energy farms — has stirred fierce debate between advocates and opponents of wind energy in the mountains of North Carolina , partly because of a controversial part of the bill that amends the 1983 ridge law to allow windmills only if they power a single residence .
In its initial form , Senate Bill 1068 was widely accepted as a comprehensive and robust piece of legislation designed to create a permitting process for wind farms in North Carolina .
It underwent significant changes in committee , and after much debate and political pressure from Western North Carolina Democrats Sens.
Martin Nesbitt , John Snow and Joe Sam Queen , the augmented bill passed the state Senate in the final days of the 2009 session .
As currently written , the bill functions as a de facto ban on commercial and community - scale wind turbines on windy North Carolina ridges .
It would amend the Mountain Ridge Protection Act of 1983 to allow only windmills that are 100 feet tall or shorter and aimed at generating electricity for a single residence .
( Utility - scale wind turbines have towers that are about 164 feet tall or higher , according to the American Wind Energy Association 's Web site . )
For some , the idea of a series of massive turbines silhouetted against the horizon is the epitome of green energy overstepping its purpose .
But others argue that the alternative to wind energy is the continued reliance upon mountaintop - removal coal , of which North Carolina is the No. 1 consumer .
Austin Hall , a wind - energy advocate and organizer for the nonprofit Appalachian Voices , tells Xpress , " We , as North Carolinians , have a moral imperative to develop our own resources .
" Our neighbors … in West Virginia are suffering unbelievable circumstances because of our energy consumption , " Hall continues .
" It 's just very hard for me to hear the issue of the viewshed argument when I have seen a 10,000 - acre strip mine , and I 've seen valleys filled in with mining waste , and I 've seen poisoned well water , and damage from blasting at people 's homes , and kids who are sick from drinking poisoned water . …
By banning wind energy , we 're effectively saying , ' It 's OK to destroy the mountains of West Virginia , just do n't put a windmill on top of mine . ' "
But for Cynthia Wadsworth — founder of the Mountain Ridge Protection Act Alliance — the possible encroachment of industry into her beloved mountains is problematic at best .
Commercial wind - development causes significant damage in environmentally sensitive places — a side effect that may not be worth the energy produced , she says .
" It 's not uncommon for [ contractors ] to blast through the topographical features on mountain ridges to provide a clear , level place for the turbines , " Wadsworth says .
" Clearing wide access corridors — 50 to 100 feet wide — for miles along the crests of forested mountain ridges is necessary for the cranes and trucks needed to erect these 40 - story , wind skyscrapers …
The concrete base needed to support just one of these massive structures may require 20 truckloads of cement .
Substations and miles of transmission lines are also necessary .
The resulting forest fragmentation has a negative effect on many animal species .
Does this sound green ? "
But Hall counters that by carefully locating turbines — " those places that we consider to be off - limits to wind - energy development : places like public land , fragile ecosystems , spruce forests , and [ other ] environmentally sensitive areas " — it 's possible to develop about 750 megawatts of wind - energy potential .
That 's nearly equal to what the proposed addition to Duke Energy 's Cliffside coal - fired plant in Rutherford County will produce , he explains .
" Essentially , we could take the need for [ that new ] coal - fired power plant off the table if we developed just a fraction of our wind resource in the mountains of North Carolina , " Hall argues .
" We 're not talking about putting wind turbines on the Blue Ridge Parkway , Grandfather Mountain or in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park .
Nobody wants that , " says Avram Friedman , executive director and co-founder of the Canary Coalition , a clean - air - advocacy organization in Western North Carolina .
" But , " Friedman continues , " there are dozens of appropriate ridge tops on privately owned lands and on multiple - use public lands that already have roads and power lines crossing nearby .
Some are dotted with cell towers , television - and radio - broadcasting antennas .
There is no reason not to use this safe , clean , relatively inexpensive energy technology in these locations , especially if it 's part of the solution to replacing coal , which is devastating the mountain landscape , wildlife , vegetation and human health . "
But Tonya Bottomley , a supporter of the ridge law and founding member of Keepers of the Blue Ridge says the negative effects of wind energy far outweigh the positives .
" There are many well - intentioned environmental groups that claim that commercial wind development will shut down coal plants and significantly reduce CO2 emissions .
Where 's the proof ?
With 100,000 wind turbines worldwide , there should be data to support those claims , " Bottomley says in an e-mail response to Xpress .
" The wind industry has powerful lobbyists in Washington , D.C. , placing intense pressure on our politicians . …
If [ they ] are successful , hundreds of thousands of massive turbines will dominate our landscapes while doing virtually nothing to solve the problems of fossil - fuel dependency , " Bottomley writes .
" The tax breaks and subsidies make wind very profitable .
I support alternative energy , but we need to be rational .
Let 's not destroy the environment in an effort to save it . "
For politicians , it 's a tough call .
Rep. Cullie Tarleton of Blowing Rock says : " I believe wind energy has to be a part of our renewable - energy portfolio , but I also support the ridge law .
[ Those ] are not mutually exclusive goals .
There are many places in the west where community - scale turbines can be placed .
" In addition , one of the things all of us as consumers must realize and do a better job of is conserving energy just as we should practice effective water conservation measures .
We simply consume too much and we need to do a much better job of conserving . "
Until then , Hall , Friedman and other wind - energy advocates say allowing wind - energy projects in WNC is one way that we can begin to limit our reliance on coal , end mountaintop - removal mining , reduce CO2 emissions and , in the process , create jobs .
" Most people in this part of the state want to see the rapid development of renewable resources and a phasing out of coal , " Friedman says .
" The future of our economy is in making homes , businesses and industry more energy efficient as we develop wind , solar , geothermal , ocean - wave and tidal technologies . "
Hall says more than 20 percent of our total energy could be generated from wind energy in the state .
" Madison County is losing family farms rapidly , " Hall points out .
" We 're losing land to other types of development when we could be keeping the land in the family , while responsibly developing a wind - energy resource and providing clean energy and conserving land . "
But for Bottomley and Wadsworth , the extensive environmental impact necessary for wind development on ridges does not justify the amount of energy wind turbines can produce .
They argue the ridge law should continue to protect North Carolina 's highest ridges from industrial development .
The N.C. General Assembly will decide .

Eric Crews is a freelance writer and video producer based in Western North Carolina .
Ah well , today marks a month since the official GSoC coding period started .
Brief intro : I ’m working on implementing automatic tagging of faces for digiKam , with face detection and recognition .
For that , I ’ve been working on a library named libface that does the detection and training / recognition .
At some point , it was deemed necessary to make a Qt wrapper for libface , so that Qt / KDE programs could easily use it .
This has been now ( almost ) done , and the resulting library is named libkface .
libkface will be put somewhere in kdegraphics / libs as soon as the API freeze is over ( I think ) , and will be usable not only by digiKam , but also by other programs like KPhotoAlbum .
We ’re also going to keep the lib ( k ) face database in a shared directory , so that all programs that may use it can share the same training data .
That way , a user migrating from digiKam to KPhotoAlbum ( hypothetical , with face recog ) would not have to retrain libkface with his entire collection .
In branches / extragear / graphics / digikam / libkface / test / gui / , I have made ( with help from Alex ) a simple GUI for playing with libkface :
It has a few buttons for the usual operations .
Mind you , this is NOT going to be the way digiKam will present it ’s interface to you , so do n’t be afraid : D. With my last commit , I have added support in libface for “ tunable accuracy ” for face detection .
Look at the slider above the photo – you can set the accuracy of detection on a Five - point scale .
1 gives you very low accuracy , but insanely high speed .
Setting the accuracy to 5 gives you very high accuracy , but very low speed .
From what I ’ve observed :
Accuracy of 1 : ~0.8 seconds .
Accuracy of 2 : ~ 2.1 seconds
Accuracy of 3 : ~ 4 seconds
Accuracy of 4 : ~ 7 seconds
Accuracy of 5 : ~13-15 seconds
The default accuracy is kept as 3 .
This is a slight improvement from when I blogged about it last time .
A nice use - case for this is – if you have a weak / slow computer , you can set the accuracy to 2 .
1 is waaay too less , only for waaay slow computers , but in that case you probably should n’t be using face detection anyway .
My laptop is n’t exactly powerful , and 3 works best .
For those of you with newer laptops , you can go for 4 .
5 is for those who have obscenely large amounts of processing power .
In the screenshot above , the red frame and the nice little black rectangle you can see is the embryo of the tagging widget I ’m making .
You can edit the name and all .
In the next few days , I ’ll be adding Tick / Cross buttons near the text , and making the face rectangle resizable .
In all , this week was quite productive , and I must also thank Marcel ( patches , code review ) , Gilles ( Porting libkface from qmake to CMake ) , and Alex ( CMake porting and some code ) for their help .
Just after the announcement of the new iPhone 4 at WWDC , Apple announced the release of Safari 5 for Windows and Mac. Unlike Safari 4 — which focused primarily on cosmetic improvements like the Top Sites page and the ill - fated top tabs — this release brings a big focus on standards compatibility , speed improvements , a new Apple - vetted extensions system , the ability to switch between Google , Yahoo , and Bing for default search , and a new feature that Apple calls Safari Reader .
Apple ’s new Nitro JavaScript Engine runs JavaScript up to 30 percent faster than Safari 4 .
We ’ve covered the Nitro engine in the past , which was originally called the less marketable name of Squirrel Fish Extreme .
Nitro , or some variant of it , is currently suspected to be in use in Mobile Safari .
Apple now uses DNS prefetching to speed up page loads ; Google ’s Chrome browser has incorporated this optimization for a while now .
On complex sites , there can be tens to hundreds of different resources located on different web domains ( like arstechnica.com , cdn.arstechnica.net and so on ) .
Everytime you load a page , a request needs to be made to your DNS servers to get those site ’s IP address .
There is , of course , network latency inherent in every one of those requests , and they can add up .
What Safari 5 will do now is look ahead to links you might click and begin pre-resolving those domains ' IPs .
When you do eventually click on one of those links , the browser will have already figured out the IP addresses it needs and can begin grabbing the data .
Apple has also improved how previously visited pages are cached , claiming that return visits to those pages will see improved loading times .
Reader and HTML5
Apple bills Safari's new Reader feature as a way to read articles on the web in a “ new , scrollable view without any additional content or clutter . ”
This shows shades of a very popular online bookmarklet called Readability , developed by Arc90 , as opposed to an Instapaper - like service , which uploads the content of an article to a third - party server for reading on different devices at a later date .
Safari 5 contains heuristics that will detect if a webpage contains an article and it will present a " Reader button " in the Smart Address field .
Clicking that button will remove all webpage content , ads and all , and leave only the meat of the article .
From that point there will be options to enlarge the text , print the article , or email the contents .
Another interesting tidbit is that Safari Reader will stitch together multipage articles in this same manner , much to some sites ' chagrin .
What 's cool about Apple 's implementation is that once a user clicks the " Reader " button , Safari begins downloading every page of an article in the background and begins stitching them together .
It does a full , real , request on every single page .
The publication sees all the pageviews on every page and even ad frames get downloaded for each pageview , which could quell some publisher worries .
Safari 5 's Reader feature use on a multi-page Ars article .
Another huge part of Safari 5 is the mainstream availably of a large number of HTML5 features .
Previously , many of these features have been available on nightly builds of Webkit — which are essentially Safari 4 wrapped around cutting - edge builds of Apple ’s web rendering engine .
With the release of Safari 5 , Apple is rolling out support for full - screen video and closed - captioning on HTML5 video , Geolocation , sectioning elements , draggable attribute , forms validation , Ruby , AJAX History , EventSource , and WebSockets .
I should just pause here and tell you that as a web developer , this previous paragraph made me giddy with delight .
A number of these APIs and abilities are available here and there in Chrome and Firefox and they ’ve been sorely missing from Safari .
Secure extensions
Probably one of the least expected — but coolest — parts of Safari 5 is the announcement that the application will support secure and signed extensions that run in the browser .
Without seeing any of the documentation for the developer program ( which we will detail when we get our hands on it ) , we ca n’t speculate too much on how deeply one might hook into Safari .
What we do know is that Apple has created a new “ Safari Developer Program , ” in which individual developers can enroll for free .
Developers can then write extensions that are completely sandboxed from the main browser process ( and presumably from other extensions ) for security and stability reasons .
Apple is following the lead of Firefox ’s JetPack project and Chrome ’s extension system by letting developers write their browser extensions in HTML5 , CSS , and JavaScript as opposed to something more complex like Objective - C .
In a break with the competition , though , it seems that Apple is requiring that all Safari Extensions go through the Apple Developer Program .
The extensions will be cryptographically signed by Apple , and the browser will check to make sure that the extensions are signed properly before they can be used .
Creating a new Safari Extension .
Within Safari 5 is a tool called Extension Builder , which is apparently where developers will be able to perform the actual development of the extensions , as well as package and install them .
It ’s not yet clear how the distribution of these applications will take place .
The existence of the Safari Developer Program and the requirement that all extensions must be signed by Apple before they go into the wild might indicate that Apple will exercise tight control over the market for these extensions and not allow them to be side - loaded into Safari ( much like iPhone apps ) .
Update : After playing with Safari 5's extension builder , it does indeed look like you can just download extensions from the web or a developers website and load them into Safari .
At the Safari state of the union talk at WWDC , Panic 's Cabel Sasser demoed what we believe is the first Safari Extension — a website annotation tool .
Cabel details how they made the extension and their thoughts on the process on their blog .
Finally , we did notice that by default , extension support is disabled in Safari 5 .
Bits and bobs
In addition to all the above , Apple has also updated the way it completes website addresses when you start typing in the Smart Address Field .
In Safari 4 , matches were only made against the URL of the sites in your history or bookmarks .
Furthermore those matches we done against the beginning of the URL .
That is , if you were to start typing ' t - e - c - h - n - i - c - a ' into the Safari 4 address bar , you might not see matches for arstechnica.com .
In Safari 5 , matches are displayed when your text appears anywhere in the URL .
In addition the page 's titles will be searched to give even better matches .
If you want to run the new version , you must be running Mac OS X 10.5.8 or later if you ’re on Leopard , or 10.6.2 or later if you ’re on Snow Leopard .
Windows users need Windows XP SP2 or higher to run Safari 5 .
Chicago - spotting at the Cineplex BACKGROUND NOISE : I definitely do n’t watch Chicago movies like a normal person .
High Fidelity ’s John Cusack wondering what hole in the CTA ’s space - time continuum enabled him to board the Purple Line at Wilson
At some point during any Chicago movie ( “ Top 40 Movies Filmed in Chicago ” ) , it happens .
You ’re losing yourself in the story , digging deeper into the popcorn , when suddenly . . . you recognize a location on the screen .
You blurt it out to your spouse before your spouse is able to blurt it to you .
I call this the Hey Game , as in “ Hey ! That ’s McCormick Place ! ” or “ Hey !
It ’s the corner of Milwaukee and Damen . ”
If you happen to be in a city theatre , you may hear others playing throughout the room ; no matter how cool we pretend to be , we ’re still psyched to see our hometown on the big screen .
No wonder Ferris had to sprint home .
He ran all the way from some place with palm trees .
For some , this may be a fun little diversion , but for one obsessive subculture — that proud , infuriating phylum of Chicago know - it - alls of which I am a member — the Hey Game is not a game at all .
It is a challenge and a distraction , a curse that renders Chicago films impossible to enjoy .
Take The Dark Knight .
I hear it ’s a good movie and that Batman saves Chicago / Gotham from annihilation .
I would n’t know , because I was so busy scanning each scene for locational clues and continuity errors , that I did n’t realize Harvey Dent and Two - Face were the same person .
You may see High Fidelity on our top 40 list and think , Oh , yeah , funny movie , great soundtrack .
All I remember is seeing John Cusack ’s character on the Purple Line and wondering why a guy whose whole life was in Wicker Park would be riding the Purple Line .
( “ Is his mom in Evanston ?
Is he taking classes at Northwestern ? ” )
After waiting 20 minutes for an explanation that never came , it was too late :
The movie was ruined .
You think I ’m a freak ?
No , I ’m a mild case .
One Hey - Gamer
I know , as if driven by a preternatural compulsion , calls out screen locations like a robot ( “ Daley Center . . . Navy Pier . . .
Hilton Towers . . . ” ) , often with creepy specificity ( “ LaSalle Street bridge , facing south ” [ Road to Perdition ] ) .
When the world onscreen diverges from the Chicago she knows , and the characters do something geo­graphically impossible , like leave Hyde Park and head south on North Lake Shore Drive ( When Harry Met Sally ) , you can almost hear the pop of her brain collapsing on itself .
Another friend remains fixated on a scene from a 1996 dud called Chain Reaction , where bad guys chase the atomic energy researchers played by Keanu Reeves and Rachel Weisz through the Field Museum and , suddenly , through the Museum of Science and Industry seven miles south , before miraculously ending up back outside the Field .
( As if any of this were less plausible than Keanu Reeves as a nuclear scientist . )
Batman Begins has cars going the wrong way on the Franklin Street Bridge and digitally added buildings — someone activate the Bat Signal !
Who cares ?
It ’s just a movie , you say .
Why do you weirdoes torture yourselves when you could be taking a two - hour break from life ?
I do it because I am a petty man who loves nothing more than unearthing a cinematic blunder to get all pissy and self - righteous about , like the Canada Post mail truck in My Big Fat Greek Wedding .
At heart , I want to see the Chicago I love onscreen , not some Hollywoodized pseudo - Chicago where palm trees line “ Northbrook ” ( Ferris Bueller ’s Day Off ) and “ Aurora ” has mountains ( Wayne ’s World ) .
Careless locational gaffes like these are civic affronts that say , We do n’t care enough about your town to get it right .
So the next time you ’re about to advise some chatterbox in a movie theatre to shut up , remember :
He may be trying to protect your city .
Like Batman .
Or so I ’ve been told .

JFK : Analysis of a Shooting by Orlando Martin is a monumental contribution to the JFK literature .
I think most people have serious doubts that Oswald killed Kennedy , but after reading this book , you will know beyond any doubt that it was physically impossible for Oswald to have done it .
Mr. Martin , a retired military officer of 20 years service , was a Drill Instructor and Sharpshooter , with a rating of “ Expert ” ( the highest ) .
He specialized in long - range sniper and combat assault rifles .
The gist of the book is that by examining the Zapruder film , the ballistics evidence , and the medical evidence , it can be determined , beyond all doubt , that 3 gunmen fired a total of 5 shots at the motorcade in Dealey Plaza .
The first shot , which missed completely and grazed a bystander , can be traced back to a low elevation in the Dallas Tex Building .
The second and fourth shots were taken from high atop the Dallas Criminal Court Building , while the third and fifth shots were taken from the Grassy Knoll .
Different weapons and caliber of bullets were used in these shootings .
No shots were taken from the Texas School Book Depository , where Oswald allegedly was .
Delving deeper , the first shot zipped over Kennedy ’s head , missing him completely , and struck a curb 400 feet away .
Martin reasons that the shooter may have missed because the road ( Elm Street ) dipped down .
And , he points out that J. Edgar Hoover admitted afterwards , in writing , that the first bullet was not copper - jacketed , which means that it could not have been a standard 6.5 mm Carcano bullet , like those allegedly used by Oswald .
Also , the low impact point of the first bullet ( the curb ) proves that it was shot from a low vantage point , not from a 6th floor .
If Oswald had taken the shot from his angle , it would have meant that he mis-aimed by a distance greater than that of a football field .
It ’s preposterous !
Martin also notes that Oswald ’s best opportunity to shoot Kennedy was when the limo was on Houston Street before it turned onto Elm .
He would have had a straight approaching head shot , with the vehicle slowing down and Kennedy getting closer to him and with no visual obstructions .
Towards Elm Street , there was a big oak tree obstructing his view .
So , why did he wait ?
Of course , Martin does not think Oswald shot at Kennedy at all .
JFK .
Analysis of a Sho ... Martin , Orlando Best Price : $ 14.42 Buy New null ( as of 05:45 EST - Details )
Shots 2 and 3 struck almost simultaneously , within a time frame of less than 1/10 of a second .
Martin insists that could only have happened with assistance from a “ Spotter ” who was on the street and in radio communication with the shooters .
Somebody had to have said , “ Now . ”
And both shots missed their intended target : Kennedy ’s head .
Shot 2 went through his back and out his chest before entering Connally .
Shot 3 went through his neck ( as attested to by Parkland Hospital doctors who described an entrance wound in his neck ) .
Of course , the Warren Commission claimed afterwards that a single “ magic bullet ” from the rear inflicted all 7 wounds in the two men before falling out , practically unmarred , from Connally ’s thigh at Parkland Hospital .
( The bullet was found intact even though large fragments of it were left behind in Connally .
I guess in this case , the whole was greater than the sum of its parts . )
Note that it was future - Senator Arlen Specter who came up with the single bullet theory .
However , Martin points out that the bullet had a downward trajectory of 45 degrees , and it would have had to travel upward in Kennedy ’s body to reach the supposed exit point in his neck .
In other words , before getting to any of the incredible “ zags ” that followed , the very first “ zig ” of the magic bullet was utterly impossible .
In reality , that bullet went straight through Kennedy without deflecting .
So , how did it go up when it was angling down ?
And did you know that , inadvertently , the magic bullet got “ cleaned ” before it could be examined for microscopic tissue traces from Kennedy or Connally ?
How convenient .
The third shot arose from the Grassy Knoll , and it was definitely not a Carcano bullet because it did n’t exit .
The Parkland doctors who found the entry wound in his neck searched for an exit wound but did not find one .
Martin says it must have been a small caliber bullet .
One of the Parkland doctors performed a tracheotomy on Kennedy which obliterated the small round bullet hole , converting it into a long surgical gash .
The fourth shot struck Connally in his right wrist and then fragments of it entered his left thigh in multiple places .
But , it was the fifth bullet that definitively killed Kennedy .
The fifth bullet exploded upon impacting the right side of Kennedy ’s head forward of his temple .
Ballistics prove that it was taken from the Grassy Knoll .
Not only did Kennedy ’s head explode , but the bullet itself exploded and disintegrated right on the surface of his head .
In the Zapruder film , you can clearly see this highly localized and concentrated explosion .
The bullet did not bore through his head as a solid projectile .
The blowout of Kennedy ’s head in back was caused by a vast number of minute fragments  not an intact bullet .
Why did n’t the fifth bullet travel through Kennedy ’s head intact ?
Martin says it ’s because it was not a high - powered , large caliber , copper - jacketed bullet .
Martin is convinced that it was a medium caliber , soft - core bullet that was deliberately modified : center - tapped and drilled out at its base to remove some of the lead .
This made the bullet faster and more prone to disintegration upon impact , which is what they wanted .
A large caliber , copper - jacketed bullet , like a Carcano , would have gone right through Kennedy ’s head and straight into Jackie .
And apparently , the order had been given not to harm a hair on Jackie ’s head .
Martin emphasizes that Bullet Trajectory Analysis was never performed after Kennedy ’s assassination , not by the Secret Service which did the first investigation , and not by the FBI , which did the second .
Finally , in May 1964 , a bullet trajectory test was done by order of the Warren Commission , but Martin explains why it was terribly flawed : it addressed only the second bullet ; it addressed only the point of impact , not the angle of entry or the trajectory through the bodies of Kennedy and Connally .
When you look at the complete trajectory , you realize that the bullet had a left - to - right orientation .
Oswald was to the right of Kennedy , so any bullet he might have fired would have , by necessity , had a right - to - left orientation .
But , the investigators concluded that Oswald did it simply because it was possible to see the impact point through the scope of Oswald ’s rifle from the 6th - floor window of the Book Depository  except when the oak tree obstructed the view .
In other words , their bullet trajectory test was a complete farce .
Martin delves extensively into the mishandling of the medical evidence , including the apparent kidnapping of Kennedy ’s body .
When his body was removed from Parkland Hospital , Kennedy was in an ornate bronze casket and he had on all of his clothes .
But when he arrived Bethesda , Maryland for the autopsy , he was in a cheap casket , a body bag , and he was naked .
Martin speculates at length about how Kennedy ’s body was likely altered .
He reveals that the mortician ’s craft was perfected by the Military .
They ’ve developed artful and adroit methods to hide and camouflage even the most grotesque battle wounds so that the loved ones of combat soldiers wo n’t be appalled upon seeing the body .
And Martin says these techniques are good enough to fool even the best autopsy doctors .
Ultimately , Kennedy ’s whole brain was stolen , and it is still missing to this day .
Orlando Martin thinks it is important , for the integrity of the country , that the truth come out about what really happened to President Kennedy , but he is not interested in seeing any criminal prosecutions take place .
I strongly disagree .
Although most of the perpetrators , and perhaps all the major ones , are dead , some of the culprits may still be living .
And for the dead ones , even if they ca n’t be prosecuted , they can be forever scorned and vilified , the many honors and tributes paid to them retracted .
Let them go down in history for being the monstrous criminals that they were .
When I speak to people in my personal life about the Kennedy assassination and this book , I find that many of them have the attitude : “ it was a long time ago ; there is nothing that can be done now ; it does n’t matter any more ; it wo n’t change anything , so just drop it . "
I say the Kennedy assassination still matters , and not just for the sake of bringing the perpetrators to justice .
It matters because the process by which the truth was debased , the lies concocted , the history fabricated , the fable sewn , the official story forced down our throats , amounts to one of the greatest mindwashings and indoctrinations to ever take place .
Orlando Martin shows us that the official story about JFK is n’t just wrong ; it ’s fanciful , ludicrous , ridiculous , and absurd .
That it continues to be accepted as fact in all the institutions of polite society demonstrates that America has sunk into a never - ending Twilight Zone where up is down , black is white , and truth is whatever the official organs of information say it is .
When are Americans going to wake up and start doing some critical thinking ?
I say let them start with the Kennedy assassination .
It ’s as good a place as any to snap out of the trance we ’ve been in .

LimeWire was found liable of copyright infringement Tuesday in a decision that threatens to financially devastate the New York company behind the file sharing application .
In a 4 - year - old case brought by The Recording Industry Association of America , U.S. District Judge Kimba M. Wood ruled that LimeWire 's users commit a " substantial amount of copyright infringement " ( .pdf ) and that the Lime Group , the company behind the application , " has not taken meaningful steps to mitigate infringement . "
The RIAA was seeking up to $ 150,000 per copyright violation , though the final damages in the lawsuit have not yet been determined .
The lawsuit claimed at least 93 percent of LimeWire 's file sharing traffic was unauthorized copyright material .
Limewire claims " 50 million unique monthly users . "
Its website says its " software is downloaded hundreds of thousands of times every day and boasts millions of active users at any given moment . "
It was the first case targeting a file sharing software maker following the 2005 Grokster decision , in which the U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for lawsuits targeting companies that induced or encouraged file sharing piracy .
Before the RIAA filed suit , the record label 's trade group urged LimeWire to license its material or shut down .
" LimeWire is one of the largest remaining commercial peer - to - peer services , " Mitch Bainwol , the RIAA 's chairman , said in a statement .
" Unlike other P2P services that negotiated licenses , imposed filters or otherwise chose to discontinue their illegal conduct following the Supreme Court 's decision in the Grokster case , LimeWire instead thumbed its nose at the law and creators . "
George Searle , LimeWire 's chief executive , said in a statement that the company " remains committed to developing innovative products and services for the end - user and to working with the entire music industry , including the major labels , to achieve this mission . "
Searle was not immediately available for comment .
Judge Wood scheduled a June 1 hearing to determine how to proceed .

A broad dearth in game quality has negatively affected the U.S. video game industry revenues significantly more than the country 's recession , according to Nintendo CEO Satoru Iwata , who believes his company 's 3DS can inject new experiences into the market .
" My belief is we should not blame the bad economy for the cause of slow sales of video games , " Iwata said in a VentureBeat interview .
" The slow sales must be due to the lack of great software that everyone wants to buy . " " This is not the problem of Nintendo alone , but the entire video game industry , " he added , echoing a sentiment similar to one expressed by Nintendo design chief Shigeru Miyamoto earlier this year .
According to Iwata , modern video game consumers wear out new gameplay concepts much faster than they used to , putting more pressure on developers to innovate . " [ This year 's ] titles might have been big hits three years ago .
But now this year , they are not selling that much , " he explained .
" People get tired of games more quickly than they did before .
" With the launch of the Nintendo 3DS , which can display 3D graphics without the need for special glasses , Iwata thinks Nintendo will have a fresher palette from which to paint .
" We recognize [ the 3DS ' solution ] will not be eternally appealing , " the exec acknowledged .
" However , it 's not a shallow concept that can be forgotten as a momentary fad .
" As for his competitors ' attempts to innovate on the hardware front , Iwata was unsurprisingly skeptical , at least publicly .
" Asking consumers to pay more for additional hardware is not ideal , " he said .
" If I were one of the developers for Kinect or Move , I would wonder if Microsoft or Sony would have a large enough installed base of this accessory to justify investment in a game . "

Cowboy Bebop , “ Jupiter Jazz ” ( video – part 1 , part 2 ) | episode guide ( part 1 , part 2 )
“ There is nothing in this world to believe in . ” – Vicious
1 . These two episodes are haunting , beautiful , and present some of the deepest characters I ’ve ever seen on television .
I ca n’t think of a better introduction to anime .
There ’s excellent dialogue , plot twists that provide layers and not simply suspense , and a gorgeous fight scene between flying vehicles : every time they circle , the air is filled with that much more tension .
2 . We have dreams , and then there are the people we work with every day .
It does n’t look like we even have vocabulary for describing the problem which arises from these two things .
But that problem drives every single element of the story here .
Faye leaves the ship , taking all the money from the safe and its coolant .
With the ship literally boiling hot , tempers flare .
When Spike hears that Julia might be in the vicinity , he runs off on his own after being very curt to Jet , who does n’t do his best to keep a terribly level head about things .
Faye later seems to accept Gren ’s analysis of her leaving : she was scared she ’d be abandoned , so she left first .
And Spike and Julia are very much a couple , despite their distance .
The question “ What is home ? ” is right in front of us , but leaving Jet alone on the ship broke is a massive injustice , no matter how much fear one feels or hopes one has .
Still , “ home ” is n’t as simple as “ the people we work with every day : ” dreams matter too .
Which brings us to the character whose story this really is : Gren .
Once a partner of Vicious , like Spike , he was betrayed by Vicious and subjected to medical experimentation while in prison that caused him to grow breasts and have other hormonal changes .
The ability to have “ home ” in the sense Spike wishes is n’t there .
And playing saxophone for a living in a seedy bar where only fugitives visit may be almost as bad as prison ; the ability to wander like Faye is n’t there when one has a bounty on one ’s head .
3 . Gren was a warrior , a comrade - in - arms of Vicious .
While there are many characters in the Bebop universe who bring up questions of sacrifice – Rocco from “ Waltz for Venus ” gladly gives up everything for his sister , and Vincent from the movie raises all sorts of issues – Gren ’s question might be the most pertinent .
In terms of “ dreams ” and “ working with people every day , ” Vicious gives a crude but effective answer of sorts .
Why believe anything when one can take power , and let others sit deluded with notions of honor or duty ?
Vicious seems to transcend the problem , even as he appears petty and barbaric throughout the story .
Lin , ordered to accompany him by the Red Dragon , takes a bullet for him and saves him from Gren.
Vicious ’ explanation that Lin was only protecting the honor of the Red Dragon – an explanation Spike does n’t buy – makes perfect sense when first heard .
Vicious can’t account for sacrifice , but that flaw in his logic does not seem like much of a flaw when our usual scheme is “ work hard , achieve something . ”
One has to see Lin as the old Gren to understand whether or not Vicious is correct .
Gren confesses that he trusted Vicious , believed in Vicious .
They fought together , and Gren says he even looked up to Vicious .
Gren could not believe he would be betrayed so badly .
Does that mean Lin is a fool for protecting Vicious on behalf of a crime syndicate ?
We know that Spike had and has friends who are mobsters ( including Lin ) , and that not every gangster is as nihilistic or murderous as Vicious .
And in a world much like the Wild West , the crime syndicates might be the best chance for law and order in some areas .
Lin acts honorably but seemingly mindlessly .
He shoots Spike with a tranquilizer bullet , perhaps remembering some kinship the two had .
He gets in the way of every confrontation Vicious has , acting as a guardian of sorts .
Perhaps Lin understands “ home ” as something that watches over one , and his notion of honor and duty to a crime syndicate is based on that .
We ca n’t read too much into Lin , we do n’t see enough of his motivation .
We do know that he seems to resemble Gren in a way , in that he fights with Vicious but keeps his humanity in the fighting .
We also know Spike thinks Lin died for Vicious , and that there is probably a principle to association which Vicious is blind to .
Given that Spike worked in the same circles as Vicious and Lin , we have to take his opinion seriously .
( In fact , perhaps one reason Spike gets into fairly fierce arguments with Jet is that Spike can’t ever come entirely clean about his past to a former cop . )
4 . But what is it about association that itself has a principle ?
Lin and the old Gren ca n’t articulate the question , let alone an answer .
And Spike is still searching a bit too hard for Julia : his first question to a dying Gren is about Julia .
He needs to see blood coughed up in order to realize Gren ’s condition .
The new Gren sets up the drug deal with Vicious purposely just to ask Vicious why he was betrayed .
There ’s revenge involved , of course , but the question is very real for Gren .
His last wish is to be placed in his ship and sent toward Titan , where he and Vicious fought together .
Gren ’s whole concern is whether fraternity is real .
He gets two answers : one from Lin , which we have discussed , and one from Spike .
Spike saves Gren from one of Vicious ’ missiles , and even while in a stupor about Julia , breaks off chasing Vicious in order to tend to Gren .
Association seems to be about making caring for others a habit .
It is n’t ironic , but necessary , that given Gren ’s concerns he is sent off by a stranger whom he already knows .
“ Home ” finds itself rooted in association .
Lin ’s thoughtlessness about the Red Dragon may not be sensible , but it makes perfect sense .
Gren ’s final gesture seems to be a realization of this answer .
There is much for Spike , Jet and Faye to realize about him .
For obvious reasons they can’t and should n’t join crime syndicates .
But there is something about their relationship that is less than mercenary , and not entirely contingent .
Dreams are n’t always had , and association is the surer thing .
When people are open about believing in each other , honor , fraternity and even love make a lot more sense .

( CNN ) --
An unusual movie promotion stunt threatened to turn deadly Tuesday when a World War II - era biplane flipped over while landing near the nation 's capital .
Nobody was hurt , though one of the main runways at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport was closed for roughly an hour after the crash , an airport spokeswoman said .
The plane was righted by a crane .
The 1943 Stearman , a popular training aircraft during the war , was one of nine flying to Reagan National from Virginia 's Manassas Regional Airport to help promote the movie " Legends of Flight , " a film meant to provide a window into " a century of aviation trial and error , " according to its Web site .
The two - seat , open - cockpit plane " took a back - end bounce , " as it landed , movie executive producer Doug Freeman told CNN .
" The pilot and passenger got out unhurt " and later relaxed over a cup of coffee .
The pilot was identified as Michael Truschel of Nokesville , Virginia -- located near Manassas .
The accident occurred at the end of a roughly 20 - minute flight under clear skies and light winds .
" It looked like ( Michael ) was up on the main gear , and then the nose went down and the tail went up , " said pilot Dave Brown , who was directly behind Truschel 's aircraft .
" I sidestepped ( Truschel ) and landed right behind him , " Brown told CNN .
Air traffic controllers directed the other planes to land on another runway .
Brown told CNN that " by the time it happened , ( Truschel ) was going really slowly , so when it flipped over on its nose it just went on over on its top wing . "
The main body of the overturned plane remained high enough off the ground for Truschel and his passenger to release their harnesses and then climb out .
" It shows how rigid Boeing made the plane , " Brown noted .
" They were built as trainers for cadets who flipped them like this quite often . "
Brown said there was damage to the tail , a wing and the prop of Truschel 's plane .
The Vatican on Monday issued an unprecedented rebuke of a top cardinal who had accused the retired Vatican No. 2 of blocking clerical sex abuse investigations , publicly dressing down a man who had been praised for his criticism of church abuse cover-ups .
The silencing of Cardinal Christoph Schoenborn , the archbishop of Vienna and long considered a papal contender , drew heated criticism from clerical abuse victims .
They said the Vatican should be honoring Schoenborn , not publicly humiliating him , for his calls for greater transparency and demands for a crackdown on priests who rape and sodomize children .
Schoenborn has also called for an open discussion of priestly celibacy , views that the Vatican said he " clarified " on Monday during an audience with the pope .
As it admonished Schoenborn , the Vatican appeared caught on the defensive on two other fronts in the sex abuse scandal :
It remained locked in a diplomatic tiff with Belgium over the raid on church offices last week , during which police detained bishops and even opened a crypt in search of church abuse documents .
And it bristled at a U.S. Supreme Court decision to let a sex abuse lawsuit in Oregon naming the Holy See go forward .
Schoenborn had accused the former Vatican secretary of state , Cardinal Angelo Sodano , in April of blocking a church investigation into the late Austrian Cardinal Hans Hermann Groer , who was accused by victims in 1995 of abusing boys at a seminary - a scandal that rocked the Austrian church and cost Groer his job .
The Vatican said Monday that only the pope can level such accusations against a cardinal .
" With his words , Benedict professes concern for victims .
But by his actions , Benedict shows concern for his colleagues , " said David Clohessy , executive director of SNAP , the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests .
In Washington on Monday , the Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal from the Vatican in which it argued that the abuse lawsuit should be dismissed based on sovereign immunity .
The Vatican is accused of conspiring with U.S. church officials to transfer a priest from city to city despite repeated accusations that the clergyman sexually abused young people .
Lower federal courts ruled in the case that there could be an exception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act , which generally shields sovereign states - including the Vatican - from lawsuits .
A judge found there was enough of a connection between the Holy See and the priest for him to be considered a Vatican employee under Oregon law , and that ruling was upheld by the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals .

It 's about time the U.S. Supreme Court stepped in on the matter of violent video games .
The justices agreed on Monday to rule on whether the government should ban the sale of violent games to minors and fine stores $ 1,000 each time they fail to comply .
At issue is a California law , passed in 2005 but struck down by lower courts , that defines violent games as works that depict " killing , maiming , dismembering , or sexually assaulting an image of a human being , " in a way that 's offensive , appeals to morbid interests , and otherwise lacks artistic merit .
So basically , the government would play tastemaker and decide what 's offensive and what 's artistic , what should be treated like porn , and what should be treated like culture .
If you can't tell , and have n't read our previous coverage , this idea unsettles me .
I have no problem with video game retailers turning down minors who want to buy Grand Theft Auto , but government should not be at the helm .
Video games have a system of self - regulation that 's among the best in the entertainment industry , not to mention parental controls on consoles .
Supporters of the California law argue that video games need the extra regulation because their interactivity makes them inherently worse for children than movies or other media .
I 'm not going to get into that debate here -- check out this recent article by PC World 's Matt Peckham to get a sense of the back - and - forth -- but the fact that six states have attempted violent game laws , and none have passed muster with their respective courts , shows that judges are n't comfortable making video games an exception to the First Amendment .
I 'm glad the Supreme Court is looking at this , if only as a way to put an end to all the madness .
If the court sides with the games industry -- and I 'll be shocked if it does n't - - it 'll set a precedent for lower courts around the country , and stop the waste of more resources on these misguided laws .

IN SOMEONE ELSE'S SHOES : Mt Victoria cyclist Laura Green tries her hand at bus driving to see what it 's like from a bus driver 's perspective .
Pictured with her is instructor Barry Alofi .
A group of Wellington bus drivers has switched to pedal power to experience what it feels like to jostle for space with a 12 - tonne bus .
Valley Flyer and Go Wellington drivers have complained cyclists are aggressive and try to intimidate them by taking up space in shared lanes .
But yesterday they took part in a workshop aimed at making the roads safer for cyclists by pedalling a few kilometres in their shoes .
Frank Koia , who has driven buses in Lower Hutt and Eastbourne for eight years , said the experience most drivers had with cyclists was not positive .
" It just gets frustrating .
It 's like you 're competing out there . "
Cyclists pressured bus drivers into giving them more space because they were the smaller vehicle , he said .
After a 40 - minute cycle ride around Lower Hutt yesterday , during which he experienced two cars cutting in front on him , he said he had a new respect for cyclists .
Go Wellington driver Sid Hunia said most bus drivers had experienced aggression from cyclists .
" Sometimes cyclists try to intimidate you . "
Laura Green has commuted by bicycle between Mt Victoria and Kelburn for four years , and said bus driver behaviour had improved .
" I 've not been knocked off my bike per se but I have had to jump off in a hurry and jump the kerb . "
She volunteered to help in yesterday 's workshop and tried driving a bus in the company 's yard , saying the experience had opened her eyes to what it was like to drive such a large vehicle .
Greater Wellington regional council spokeswoman Philippa Lagan said the workshop was organised to help make future bus - bicycle encounters safer and friendlier .
In the past five years , 24 incidents involving buses and cyclists had been reported , four of them serious , but Ms Lagan said anecdotally there were also many near misses .
Valley Flyer general manager Matthew Lear said the workshop would help prevent accidents by raising bus drivers ' awareness of what it was like to cycle in the region .
The workshop was put on for 10 bus drivers .
About 400 work for Go Wellington and the Valley Flyer services .
Driver Nick Kelly said Wellington 's narrow roads were often lined with parked cars , and bus drivers ran the risk of running late if they got stuck behind cyclists .

INTRODUCTION
For the Win is my second young adult novel , and , like my 2008 book Little Brother , it is meant to do more than tell a story .
For the Win is a book about economics ( a subject that suddenly got a lot more relevant about halfway through the writing of this book , when the world 's economy slid unceremoniously into the toilet and got stuck there ) , justice , politics , games and labor .
For the Win connects the dots between the way we shop , the way we organize , and the way we play , and why some people are rich , some are poor , and how we seemed to get stuck there .
I hope that readers of this book will be inspired to dig deeper into the subjects of " behavioral economics " ( and related subjects like " neuroeconomics " ) and to start asking hard questions about how we end up with the stuff we own , and what it costs our human brothers and sisters to make those goods , and why we think we need them .
But it 's a poor politics that can only express itself by choosing to buy or not buy something .
Sometimes ( often ! ) , you need to organize to make a difference .
This is the golden age of organizing .
If there 's one thing the Internet 's changed forever , it 's the relative difficulty and cost of getting a bunch of people in the same place , working for the same goal .
That 's not always good ( thugs , bullies , racists and loonies never had it so good ) , but it is fundamentally game - changing .
It 's hard to remember just how difficult this organizing stuff used to be : how hard it was to do something as trivial as getting ten friends to agree on dinner and a movie , let alone getting millions of people together to raise money for a political candidate , get the vote out , protest corruption , or save an endangered and beloved institution .
The net does n't solve the problem of injustice , but it solves the first hard problem of righting wrongs : getting everyone together and keeping them together .
You still have to do the even harder work of risking life , limb , personal fortune , reputation ,
Every wonderful thing in our world has fight in its history .
Our rights , our good fortune , our happiness and all that is sweet was paid for , once upon a time , by principled people who risked everything to change the world for the better .
Those risks are not diminished one iota by the net .
But the rewards are every bit as sweet .
AUDIOBOOK
The good folks at Random House Audio produced a fantastic audio edition of this book .
You can buy it on CD , or you can buy the MP3 version from a variety of online booksellers .
I also sell it myself on my site
Unfortunately , you can't buy this book from the world 's most popular audiobook vendors : Apple 's iTunes and Amazon 's Audible .
That 's because neither store would allow me to sell the audiobook on terms that I believe are fair and just .
Specifically , Apple refused to carry the book unless it had " digital rights management " on it .
This is the technology that locks music to Apple 's devices .
It 's illegal to move DRM - crippled files to devices that Apple has n't blessed , which means that if I encourage you to buy my works through Apple , I lose the ability to choose to continue to sell to you from Apple 's competition at some later date in the future .
That seems like a bad deal for both of us .
To its credit , Audible ( which supplies all of the audiobooks on iTunes ) was willing to sell this book without DRM , but they insisted on including their extremely onerous " end user license agreement , " which also prohibits moving my book to a device that Audible has n't approved .
To make it easy for them , I offered to simply record a little intro that said , " Cory Doctorow and Random House Audio grant you permission to use this book in any way that does not violate copyright law . "
That way , they would n't have to make any changes to their site or the agreements you have to click through to use it .
But Audible refused .
I would n't sell this book through Wal - Mart if they insisted that you could only shelve it on a Wal - Mart bookcase and I wo n't sell it through any online retailer that imposes the same requirement on your virtual bookshelves .
That 's also why you wo n't find my books for sale for the Kindle or iPad stores -- both stores insist on the right to lock you into terms that I believe are unfair and bad for both of us .
I 'm pretty bummed about this .
For the record , I would gladly sell through both Apple and Audible if they'd let me sell it without DRM , and under the world 's shortest EULA ( " Do n't violate copyright law . " )
In the meantime , I thank you in advance for patronizing online audiobook sellers who respect the rights of both authors and audiences .
And I am especially grateful to Random House Audio for backing me in this fight to get a fair deal for all of us .
THE COPYRIGHT THING
The Creative Commons license at the top of this file probably tipped you off to the fact that I 've got some pretty unorthodox views about copyright .
Here 's what I think of it , in a nutshell : a little goes a long way , and more than that is too much .
I like the fact that copyright lets me sell rights to my publishers and film studios and so on .
It 's nice that they can't just take my stuff without permission and get rich on it without cutting me in for a piece of the action .
I 'm in a pretty good position when it comes to negotiating with these companies : I 've got a great agent and a decade 's experience with copyright law and licensing ( including a stint as a delegate at WIPO , the UN agency that makes the world 's copyright treaties ) .
What 's more , there 's just not that many of these negotiations -- even if I sell fifty or a hundred different editions of For the Win ( which would put it in top millionth of a percentile for fiction ) , that 's still only a hundred negotiations , which I could just about manage .
I hate the fact that fans who want to do what readers have always done are expected to play in the same system as all these hotshot agents and lawyers .
It 's just stupid to say that an elementary school classroom should have to talk to a lawyer at a giant global publisher before they put on a play based on one of my books .
It 's ridiculous to say that people who want to " loan " their electronic copy of my book to a friend need to get a license to do so .
Loaning books has been around longer than any publisher on Earth , and it's a fine thing .
Copyright laws are increasingly passed without democratic debate or scrutiny .
In Great Britain , where I live , Parliament has just passed the Digital Economy Act , a complex copyright law that allows corporate giants to disconnect whole families from the Internet if anyone in the house is accused ( without proof ) of copyright infringement ; it also creates a " Great Firewall of Britain " that is used to censor any site that record companies and movie studios do n't like .
This law was passed without any serious public debate in Parliament , rushed through using a dirty process through which our elected representatives betrayed the public to give a huge , gift - wrapped present to their corporate pals .
It gets worse : around the world , rich countries like the US , the EU and Canada have been negotiating a secret copyright treaty called " The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement " ( ACTA ) that has all the problems that the Digital Economy Act had and then some .
The plan is to agree to this in secret , without public debate , and then force the world 's poorest countries to sign up for it by refusing to allow them to sell goods to rich countries unless the do .
In America , the plan is to pass it without Congressional debate , using the executive power of the President .
Though this began under Bush , the Obama administration has pursued it with great enthusiasm .
So if you 're not violating copyright law right now , you will be soon .
And the penalties are about to get a lot worse .
As someone who relies on copyright to earn my living , this makes me sick .
If the big entertainment companies set out to destroy copyright 's mission , they could n't do any better than they 're doing now .
So , basically , screw that .
Or , as the singer , Wobbly and union organizer Woody Guthrie so eloquently put it :
" This song is Copyrighted in U.S. , under Seal of Copyright # 154085 , for a period of 28 years , and anybody caught singin ' it without our permission , will be mighty good friends of ourn , cause we do n't give a dern .
Publish it .
Write it .
Sing it .
Swing to it .
Yodel it .
We wrote it , that 's all we wanted to do . "
DONATIONS AND A WORD TO TEACHERS AND LIBRARIANS
Every time I put a book online for free , I get emails from readers who want to send me donations for the book .
I appreciate their generous spirit , but I 'm not interested in cash donations , because my publishers are really important to me .
They contribute immeasurably to the book , improving it , introducing it to audiences I could never reach , helping me do more with my work .
I have no desire to cut them out of the loop .
But there has to be some good way to turn that generosity to good use , and I think I 've found it .
Here 's the deal : there are lots of teachers and librarians who'd love to get hard - copies of this book into their kids ' hands , but do n't have the budget for it ( teachers in the US spend around $ 1,200 out of pocket each on classroom supplies that their budgets wo n't stretch to cover , which is why I sponsor a classroom at Ivanhoe Elementary in my old neighborhood in Los Angeles ; you can adopt a class yourself here ) .
There are generous people who want to send some cash my way to thank me for the free ebooks .
I 'm proposing that we put them together .
If you 're a teacher or librarian and you want a free copy of For the Win , email freeftwbook@gmail.com with your name and the name and address of your school .
It 'll be posted to http://craphound.com/ftw/donate/ by my fantastic helper , Olga Nunes , so that potential donors can see it .
If you enjoyed the electronic edition of For the Win and you want to donate something to say thanks , go to http://craphound.com/ftw/donate/ and find a teacher or librarian you want to support .
Then go to Amazon , BN.com , or your favorite electronic bookseller and order a copy to the classroom , then email a copy of the receipt ( feel free to delete your address and other personal info first ! ) to freeftwbook@gmail.com so that Olga can mark that copy as sent .
If you do n't want to be publicly acknowledged for your generosity , let us know and we 'll keep you anonymous , otherwise we 'll thank you on the donate page .
I 've done this with three of my titles now , and gotten more than a thousand books into the hands of readers through your generosity .
I am more grateful than words can express for this -- one of my readers called it " paying your debts forward with instant gratification . "
That 's a heck of a thing , is n't it ?
ABOUT THE BOOKSTORE DEDICATIONS
Many scenes in this file have been dedicated to bookstores : stores that I love , stores that have helped me discover books that opened my mind , stores that have helped my career along .
The stores did n't pay me anything for this -- I have n't even told them about it -- but it seems like the right thing to do .
After all , I 'm hoping that you 'll read this ebook and decide to buy the paper book , so it only makes sense to suggest a few places you can pick it up !
Dedication :
For Poesy : Live as though it were the early days of a better nation .
Part I : The gamers and their games , the workers at their work
This scene is dedicated to BakkaPhoenix Books in Toronto , Canada .
Bakka is the oldest science fiction bookstore in the world , and it made me the mutant I am today .
I wandered in for the first time around the age of 10 and asked for some recommendations .
Tanya Huff ( yes , the Tanya Huff , but she was n't a famous writer back then ! ) took me back into the used section and pressed a copy of H. Beam Piper 's " Little Fuzzy " into my hands , and changed my life forever .
By the time I was 18 , I was working at Bakka -- I took over from Tanya when she retired to write full time -- and I learned life - long lessons about how and why people buy books .
I think every writer should work at a bookstore ( and plenty of writers have worked at Bakka over the years !
For the 30th anniversary of the store , they put together an anthology of stories by Bakka writers that included work by Michelle Sagara ( AKA Michelle West ) , Tanya Huff , Nalo Hopkinson , Tara Tallan -- and me ! )
BakkaPhoenix Books : 697 Queen Street West , Toronto ON Canada M6J1E6 , +1 416 963 9993
There were eight monitors on his desk , arranged in two ranks of four , the top row supported on a shelf he'd bought from an old lady scrap dealer in front of the Dongmen market .
She 'd also sold him the monitors , shaking her head at his idiocy : at a time when everyone wanted giant , 30 " screens , why did he want this collection of dinky little 9 " displays ?
So they 'd all fit on his desk .
Not many people could play eight simultaneous games of Svartalfaheim Warriors .
For one thing , Coca Cola ( who owned the game ) , had devoted a lot of programmer time to preventing you from playing more than one game on a single PC , so you had to somehow get eight PCs onto one desk , with eight keyboards and eight mice on the desk , too , and room enough for your dumplings and an ashtray and a stack of Indian comic books and that stupid war - axe that Ping gave him and his notebooks and his sketchbook and his laptop and --
It was a crowded desk .
And it was noisy .
He 'd set up eight pairs of cheap speakers , each glued to the appropriate monitor , turned down low to the normal hum of Svartalfaheim -- the clash of axes , the roar of ice - giants , the eldritch music of black elves ( which sounded a lot like the demo programs on the electric keyboards his mother had spent half her life manufacturing ) .
Now they were all making casino noise , pay off noises , as his raiding party began to clean up .
The gold rolled into their accounts .
He was playing trolls -- it was trolls versus elves in Svartalfaheim , though there was an expansion module with light elves and some kind of walking tree -- and he'd come through an instanced dungeon that was the underground lair of a minor dark elvish princeling .
The lair was only medium hard , with a lot of crappy little monsters early on , then a bunch of dark elf cannon - fodder to be mown down , some traps , and then the level - boss , a wizard who had to be taken out by the spell - casters in Matthew 's party while the healers healed them and the tanks killed anything that tried to attack them .
So far , so good .
Matthew had run and mapped the dungeon on his second night in - world , a quick reccy that showed that he could expect to do about 400 gold 's worth of business there in about 20 minutes , which made it a pretty poor way to earn a living .
But Matthew kept very good notes , and among his notes was the fact that the very last set of guards had dropped some mareridtbane , which was part of the powerful Living Nightmare spell in the new expansion module .
There were players all over Germany , Switzerland and Denmark who were buying mareridtbane for 800 gold per plant .
His initial reccy had netted him five plants .
That brought the total expected take from the dungeon up to 4,400 gold for 20 minutes , or 13,200 gold per hour -- which , at the day 's exchange , was worth about $ 30 , or 285 Renminbi .
Which was -- he thought for a second -- more than 71 bowls of dumplings .
Jackpot .
His hands flew over the mice , taking direct control over the squad .
He 'd work out the optimal path through the dungeon now , then head out to the Huoda internet cafe and see who he could find to do runs with him at this .
With any luck , they could take -- his eyes rolled up as he thought again -- a million gold out of the dungeon if they could get the whole cafe working on it .
They 'd dump the gold as they went , and by the time Coca Cola 's systems administrators figured out anything was wrong , they'd have pulled almost $ 3000 out of the game .
That was a year 's rent , for one night 's work .
His hands trembled as he flipped open a notebook to a new page and began to take notes with his left hand while his right hand worked the game .
He was just about to close his notebook and head for the cafe -- he needed more dumplings on the way , could he stop for them ?
Could he afford to ?
But he needed to eat .
And coffee .
Lots of coffee -- when the door splintered and smashed against the wall bouncing back before it was kicked open again , admitting the cold fluorescent light from outside into his tiny cave of a room .
Three men entered his room and closed the door behind them , restoring the dark .
One of them found the lightswitch and clicked it a few times without effect , then cursed in Mandarin and punched Matthew in the ear so hard his head spun around on his neck , contriving to bounce off the desk .
The pain was blinding , searing , sudden .
" Light , " one of the men commanded , his voice reaching Matthew through the high - pitched whine of his ringing ear .
Clumsily , he fumbled for the desk - lamp behind the Indian comics , knocked it over , and then one of the men seized it roughly and turned it on , shining it full on Matthew 's face , making him squint his watering eyes .
" You have been warned , " the man who'd hit him said .
Matthew could n't see him , but he did n't need to .
He knew the voice , the unmistakable Wenjhou accent , almost impossible to understand .
" Now , another warning . "
There was a snick of a telescoping baton being unfurled and Matthew flinched and tried to bring his arms up to shield his head before the weapon swung .
But the other two had him by the arms now , and the baton whistled past his ear .
But it did n't smash his cheekbone , nor his collarbone .
Rather , it was the screen before him that smashed , sending tiny , sharp fragments of glass out in a cloud that seemed to expand in slow motion , peppering his face and hands .
Then another screen went .
And another .
And another .
One by one , the man dispassionately smashed all eight screens , letting out little smoker 's grunts as he worked .
Then , with a much bigger , guttier grunt , he took hold of one end of the shelf and tipped it on its edge , sending the smashed monitors on it sliding onto the floor , taking the comics , the clamshell , the ashtray , all of it sliding to the narrow bed that was jammed up against the desk , then onto the floor in a crash as loud as a basketball match in a glass factory .
Matthew felt the hands on his shoulders tighten and he was lifted out of his chair and turned to face the man with the accent , the man who had worked as the supervisor in Mr Wing 's factory , almost always silent .
But when he spoke , they all jumped in their seat , never sure of whether his barely contained rage would break , whether someone would be taken off the factory floor and then returned to the dorm that night , bruised , cut , sometimes crying in the night for parents left behind back in the provinces .
The man 's face was calm now , as though the violence against the machines had scratched the unscratchable itch that made him clench and unclench his fists at all times .
" Matthew , Mr Wing wants you to know that he thinks of you as a wayward son , and bears you no ill will .
You are always welcome in his home .
All you need to do is ask for his forgiveness , and it will be given . "
It was the longest speech Matthew had ever heard the man give , and it was delivered with surprising tenderness , so it was quite a surprise when the man brought his knee up into Matthew 's balls , hard enough that he saw stars .
The hands released him and he slumped to the floor , a strange sound in his ears that he realized after a moment must have been his voice .
He was barely aware of the men moving around his tiny room as he gasped like fish , trying to get air into his lungs , air enough to scream at the incredible , radiant pain in his groin .
But he did hear the horrible electrical noise as they tasered the box that held his computers , eight PCs on eight individual boards , stuck in a dented sheet - metal case he'd bought from the same old lady .
The ozone smell afterwards sent him whirling back to his grandfather 's little flat , the smell of the dust crisping on the heating coil that the old man only turned on when he came to visit .
He did hear them gather up his notebooks and tread heavily on the PC case , and pull the shattered door shut behind them .
The light from the desklamp painted a crazy oval on the ceiling that he stared at for a long time before he got to his feet , whimpering at the pain in his balls .
The night guard was standing at the end of the corridor when he limped out into the night .
He was only a boy , even younger than Matthew -- sixteen , in a uniform that was two sizes too big for his skinny chest , a hat that was always slipping down over his eyes , so he had to look up from under the brim like a boy wearing his father 's hat .
" You OK ? " the boy said .
His eyes were wide , his face pale .
Matthew patted himself down , wincing at the pain in his ear , the shooting stabbing feeling in his neck .
" I think so , " he said .
" You 'll have to pay for the door , " the guard said .
" Thanks , " Matthew said .
" Thanks so much . "
" It 's OK , " the boy said .
" It 's my job . "
Matthew clenched and unclenched his fists and headed out into the Shenzhen night , limping down the stairs and into the neon glow .
It was nearly midnight , but Jiabin Road was still throbbing with music , food and hawkers and touts , old ladies chasing foreigners down the street , tugging at their sleeves and offering them " beautiful young girls " in English .
He did n't know where he was going , so he just walked , fast , fast as he could , trying to walk off the pain and the enormity of his loss .
The computers in his room had n't cost much to build , but he had n't had much to begin with .
They 'd been nearly everything he owned , save for his comics , a few clothes -- and the war - axe .
Oh , the war - axe .
That was an entertaining vision , picking it up and swinging it over his head like a dark elf , the whistle of its blade slicing the air , the meaty thunk as it hit the men .
He knew it was ridiculous .
He had n't been in a fight since he was ten years old .
He 'd been a vegetarian until last year !
He was n't going to hit anyone with a war axe .
It was as useless as his smashed computers .
Gradually , he slowed his pace .
He was out of the central area around the train station now , in the outer ring of the town center , where it was dark and as quiet as it ever got .
He leaned against the steel shutters over a grocery market and put his hands on his thighs and let his sore head droop .
Matthew 's father had been unusual among their friends -- a Cantonese who succeeded in the new Shenzhen .
When Premier Deng changed the rules so that the Pearl River Delta became the world 's factory , his family 's ancestral province had filled overnight with people from the provinces .
They'd " jumped into the sea " -- left safe government factory jobs to seek their fortune here on the south Chinese coast -- and everything had changed for Matthew 's family .
His grandfather , a Christian minister who'd been sent to a labor camp during the Cultural Revolution -- had never made the adjustment , a problem that struck many of the native Cantonese , who seemed to stand still as the outsiders raced past them to become rich and powerful .
But not Matthew 's father .
The old man had started off as a driver for a shoe - factory boss -- learning to drive on the job , nearly cracking up the car more than once , though the owner did n't seem to mind .
After all , he'd never ridden in a car before he'd made it big in Shenzhen .
But he got his break one day when the pattern - maker was too sick to work and all production ceased while the girls who worked on the line argued about the best way to cut the leather for a new order that had come in .
Matthew 's father loved to tell this story .
He'd heard the argument go back and forth for a day as the line jerked along slowly , and he'd sat on his chair and thought , and thought , and then he'd stood up and closed his eyes and pictured the calm ocean until the thunder of his heartbeat slowed to a normal beat .
Then he'd walked into the owner 's office and said , " Boss , I can show you how to cut those hides . "
It was no easy task .
The hides were all slightly different shapes -- cows were n't identical , after all -- and parts of them were higher grade than others .
The shoe itself , an Italian men's loafer , needed six different pieces for each side , and only some of them were visible .
The parts that were inside the shoe did n't need to come from the finest leather , but the parts outside did .
All this Matthew 's father had absorbed while sitting in his chair and listening to the arguments .
He 'd always loved to draw , always had a good head for space and design .
And before his boss could throw him out of the office , he 'd plucked up his courage and seized a pen off the desk and rooted a crumpled cigarette package out of the trash -- expensive foreign cigarettes , affected by all the factory owners as a show of wealth -- torn it open and drawn a neat cowhide , and quickly shown how the shoes could be fit to the hide with a minimum of wastage , a design that would get ten pairs of shoes per hide .
" Ten ? " the boss said .
" Ten , " Matthew 's father said , proudly .
He knew that the most that Master Yu , the regular cutter , ever got out of a hide was nine .
" Eleven , if you use a big hide , or if you 're making small shoes . "
" You can cut this ? "
Now , before that day , Matthew 's father had never cut a hide in his life , had no idea how to slice the supple leather that came back from the tanner .
But that morning he 'd risen two hours early , before anyone else was awake , and he'd taken his leather jacket , a graduation present from his own father that he'd owned and treasured for ten years , and he'd taken the sharpest knife in the kitchen , and he'd sliced the jacket to ribbons , practicing until he could make the knife slice the leather in the same reliable , efficient arcs that his eyes and mind could trace over them .
" I can try , " he said , with modesty .
He was nervous about his boldness .
His boss was n't a nice man , and he'd fired many employees for insubordination .
If he fired Matthew 's father , he would be out a job and a jacket .
And the rent was due , and the family had no savings .
The boss looked at him , looked at the sketch .
" OK , you try . "
And that was the day that Matthew 's father stopped being Driver Fong and became Master Fong , the junior cutter at the Infinite Quality Shoe Factory .
Less than a year later , he was the head cutter , and the family thrived .
Matthew had heard this story so many times growing up that he could recite it word - for - word with his father .
It was more than a story : it was the family legend , more important than any of the history he 'd learned in school .
As stories went , it was a good one , but Matthew was determined that his own life would have an even better story still .
Matthew would not be the second Master Fong .
He would be Boss Fong , the first -- a man with his own factory , his own fortune .
And like his father , Matthew had a gift .
Like his father , Matthew could look at a certain kind of problem and see the solution .
And the problems Matthew could solve involved killing monsters and harvesting their gold and prestige items , better and more efficiently than anyone else he'd ever met or heard of .
Matthew was a gold farmer , but not just one of those guys who found themselves being approached by an Internet cafe owner and offered seven or eight RMB to keep right on playing , turning over all the gold they won to the boss , who 'd sell it on by some mysterious process .
Matthew was Master Fong , the gold farmer who could run a dungeon once and tell you exactly the right way to run it again to get the maximum gold in the minimum time .
Where a normal farmer might make 50 gold in an hour , Matthew could make 500 .
And if you watched Matthew play , you could do it too .
Mr Wing had quickly noticed Matthew 's talent .
Mr Wing did n't like games , did n't care about the legends of Iceland or England or India or Japan .
But Mr Wing understood how to make boys work .
He displayed their day 's take on big boards at both ends of his factory , treated the top performers to lavish meals and baijiu parties in private rooms at his karaoke club where there were beautiful girls .
Matthew remembered these evenings through a bleary haze : a girl on either side of him on a sofa , pressed against him , their perfume in his nose , refilling his glass as Mr Wing toasted him for a hero , extolling his achievements .
The girls oohed and aahed and pressed harder against him .
Mr Wing always laughed at him the next day , because he'd pass out before he could go with one of the girls into an even more private room .
Mr Wing made sure all the other boys knew about this failing , made sure that they teased " Master Fong " about his inability to hold his liquor , his shyness around girls .
And Matthew saw exactly what Boss Wing was doing : setting Matthew up as a hero , above his friends , then making sure that his friends knew that he was n't that much of a hero , that he could be toppled .
And so they all farmed gold harder , for longer hours , eating dumplings at their computers and shouting at each other over their screens late into the night and the cigarette haze .
The hours had stretched into days , the days had stretched into months , and one day Matthew woke up in the dorm room filled with farts and snores and the smell of 20 young men in a too - small room , and realized that he'd had enough of working for Boss Wing .
That was when he decided that he would become his own man .
That was when he set out to be Boss Fong .

This scene is dedicated to Amazon.com , the largest Internet bookseller in the world .
Amazon is amazing -- a " store " where you can get practically any book ever published ( along with practically everything else , from laptops to cheese - graters ) , where they 've elevated recommendations to a high art , where they allow customers to directly communicate with each other , where they are constantly inventing new and better ways of connecting books with readers .
Amazon has always treated me like gold -- the founder , Jeff Bezos , even posted a reader - review for my first novel ! -- and I shop there like crazy ( looking at my spreadsheets , it appears that I buy something from Amazon approximately every six days ) .
Amazon's in the process of reinventing what it means to be a bookstore in the twenty - first century and I can't think of a better group of people to be facing down that thorny set of problems .
Amazon
Wei -Dong Rosenbaum woke one minute before his alarm rang , the glowing numbers showing 12:59 .
1 AM in Los Angeles , 6 PM in China , and it was time to go raiding .
He wiped the sleep out of his eyes and climbed out of his narrow bed -- his mom still put his goddamned Spongebob sheets on it , so he 'd drawn beards and horns and cigarettes on all the faces in permanent marker -- and crossed silently to his school - bag and retrieved his laptop , then felt around on his desk for the little Bluetooth earwig , screwing it into his ear .
He made a pile of pillows against the headboard and sat cross - legged against them , lifting the lid and firing up his gamespy , looking for his buds , all the way over there in Shenzhen .
As the screen filled with names and the games they could be found in , he smiled to himself .
It was time to play .
Three clicks later and he was in Savage Wonderland , spawning on his clockwork horse with his sword in his hand , amid the garden of talking , hissing flowers , ready to do battle .
And there were his boys , riding up alongside of him , their clockwork mounts snorting and champing for battle .
" Ni hao ! " he said into his headset , in as loud a whisper as he dared .
His father had a bladder problem and he got up all night long and never slept very deeply .
Wei -Dong could n't afford that .
If his parents caught him at it one more time , they 'd take away his computer .
They 'd ground him .
They 'd send him to a military academy where they shaved your head and you got beaten up in the shower because it built character .
He 'd been treated to all these threats and more , and they 'd made an impression on him .
Not enough of an impression to get him to stop playing games in the middle of the night , of course .
" Ni hao ! " he said again .
There was laughter , distant and flanged by network churn .
" Hello , Leonard , " Ping said .
" You are learning your Chinese well , I see . "
Ping still called him Leonard , but at least he was talking in Mandarin to him now , which was a big improvement .
The guys normally liked to practice their English on him , which meant he could n't practice his Chinese on them .
" I practice , " he said .
They laughed again and he knew that he 'd gotten something wrong .
The intonation .
He was always getting it wrong .
He 'd say , " I 'll go aggro those demons and you buff the cleric , " and it would come out , " I am a bowl of noodles , I have beautiful eyelashes . "
But he was getting better .
By the time he got to China , he'd have it nailed .
" Are we raiding ? " he said .
" Yes ! " Ping said , and the others agreed .
" We just need to wait for the gweilo . "
Wei -Dong loved that he was n't the gweilo anymore .
Gweilo meant " foreign devil , " and technically , he qualified .
But he was one of the raiders now , and the gweilos were the paying customers who shelled out good dollars or euros or rupees or pounds to play alongside of them .
Here was the gweilo now .
You could tell because he frequently steered his horse off the path and into the writhing grasp of the living plants , having to stop over and over to hack away their grasping vines .
After watching this show for a minute or two , he rode out and cast a protection spell around them both , and the vines sizzled on the glowing red bubble that surrounded them both .
" Thanks , " the gweilo said .
" No problem , " he said .
" Woah , you speak English ? "
The gweilo had a strong New Jersey accent .
" A little , " Wei -Dong said , with a smile .
Better than you , dummy , he thought .
" OK , let 's do this thing , " the gweilo said , and the rest of the party caught up with them .
The gweilo had paid them to raid an instance of The Walrus 's Garden , a pretty hard underwater dungeon that had some really good drops in it -- ingredients for potions , some pretty good weapons , and , of course , lots of gold .
There were a couple prestige items that dropped there , albeit rarely -- you could get a vorpal blade and helmet if you were very lucky .
The deal was , the gweilo paid them to run the instance with him , and he could just hang back and let the raiders do all the heavy lifting , but he'd come forward to deal the coup de grace to any big bosses they beat down , so he'd get the experience points .
He got to keep the gold , the weapons , the prestige items , all of it -- and all for the low , low cost of $ 75 .
The raiders got the cash , the gweilo got to level up fast and pick up a ton of treasure .
Wei -Dong often wondered what kind of person would pay strangers to help them get ahead in a game ?
The usual reason that gweilos gave for hiring raiders was that they wanted to play with their friends , and their friends were all more advanced than them .
But Wei -Dong had joined games after his friends and being the noob in his little group , he'd just asked his buds to take him raiding with them , twinking him until his character was up to their level .
So if this gweilo had so many pals in this game that he wanted to level up to meet them , why could n't he get them to power - level his character up with them ?
Why was he paying the raiders ?
Wei -Dong suspected that it was because the guy had no friends .
" Goddamn would you look at that ? "
It was at least the tenth time the guy had said it in ten minutes as they rode to the seashore .
This time it was the tea-party , a perpetual melee that was a blur of cutlery whistling through the air , savage chairs roaming in packs , chasing luckless players who happened to aggro them , and a crazy - hard puzzle in which you had to collect and arrange the crockery just so , stunning each piece so that it would n't crawl away before you were done with it .
It was pretty cool , Wei -Dong had to admit ( he 'd solved the puzzle in two days of hard play , and gotten the teapot for his trouble , which he could use to summon genies in moments of dire need ) .
But the gweilo was acting like he'd never seen computer graphics , ever .
They rode on , chattering in Chinese on a private channel .
Mostly , it was too fast for Wei -Dong to follow , but he caught the gist of it .
They were talking about work -- the raids they had set up for the rest of the night , the boss and his stupid rules , the money and what they 'd do with it .
Girls .
They were always talking about girls .
At last they were at the seaside , and Wei-Dong cast the Red Queen 's Air Pocket , using up the last of his oyster shells to do so .
They all dismounted , flapping their gills comically as they sloshed into the water ( " Goddamn , " breathed the gweilo ) .
The Walrus 's Garden was a tricky raid , because it was different every time you ran it , the terrain regenerating for each party .
As the spellcaster , Wei -Dong 's job was to keep the lights on and the air flowing so that no matter what came , they 'd see it in time to prepare and vanquish it .
First came the octopuses , rising from the bottom with a puff of sand , sailing through the water toward them .
Lu , the tank , positioned himself between the party and the octopuses , and , after thrashing around and firing a couple of missiles at them to aggro them , went totally still as , one after another , they wrapped themselves around him , crushing him with their long tentacles , their faces crazed masks of pure malevolence .
Once they were all engrossed in the tank , the rest of the party swarmed them , the four of them drawing their edged weapons with a watery clang and going to work in a writhing knot .
Wei -Dong kept a close eye on the tank 's health and cast his healing spells as needed .
As each octopus was reduced to near death , the raiders pulled away and Wei-Dong hissed into his mic , " Finish him ! "
The gweilo fumbled around for the first two beasts , but by the end , he was moving efficiently to dispatch them .
" That was sick , " the gweilo said .
" Totally badass !
How'd that guy absorb all that damage , anyway ? "
" He 's a tank , " Wei -Dong said .
" Fighter class , heavy armor .
Lots of buffs .
And I was keeping up the healing spells the whole time . "
" I 'm fighter class , are n't I ? "
You do n't know ?
This guy had a lot more money than brains , that was for sure .
" I just started playing .
I 'm not much of a gamer .
But you know , all my friends --"
I know , Wei -Dong thought .
All the cool kids you knew were doing it , so you decided you had to keep up with them .
You do n't have any friends -- yet .
But you think you will , if you play .
" Sure , " he said .
" Just stick close , you 're doing fine .
You 'll be leveled up by breakfast time . "
That was another mark against the gweilo : he had the money to pay for a power - levelling session with their raiding guild , but he was n't willing to pay the premium to do it in a decent American timezone .
That was good news for the rest of the guild , sure -- it saved them having to find somewhere to do the run during daylight hours in China , when the Internet cafes were filled with straights -- but it meant that Wei-Dong had to be up in the middle of the night and then drag his butt around school all the next day .
Not that it was n't worth it .
Now they were into the crags and caves of the garden , dodging the eels and giant lobsters that surged out of their holes as they passed .
Wei -Dong found some more oyster shells and surreptitiously picked them up .
Technically , they were the gweilo's to have first refusal over , but they were needed if he was going to keep on casting the Air Pocket , which he might have to do if they kept up at this slow pace .
And the gweilo did n't notice , anyway .
" You 're not in China , are you ? " the gweilo asked .
" Not exactly , " he said , looking out the window at the sky over Orange County , the most boring ZIP code in California .
" Where are you guys ? "
" They 're in China .
Where I live , you can see the Disneyland fireworks show every night . "
" Goddamn , " the gweilo said .
" Ain't you got better things to do than help some idiot level up in the middle of the night ? "
" I guess I do n't , " he said .
Mixed in behind were the guys laughing and catcalling in Chinese on their channel .
He grinned to hear them .
" I mean , hell , I can see why someone in China 'd do a crappy job for a rotten 75 bucks , but if you 're in America , dude , you should have some pride , get some real work ! "
" And why would someone in China want to do a crappy job ? "
The guys were listening in now .
They did n't have great English , but they spoke enough to get by .
" You know , it 's China .
There 's billions of 'em .
Poor as dirt and ignorant .
I do n't blame 'em .
You can't blame 'em .
It 's not their fault .
But hell , once you get out of China and get to America , you should act like an American .
We do n't do that kind of work . "
" What makes you think I ' got out of China ' ? "
" Did n't you ? "
" I was born here .
My parents were born here .
Their parents were born here .
Their parents came here from Russia . "
" I did n't know they had Chinese in Russia . "
Wei -Dong laughed .
" I 'm not Chinese , dude . "
" You are n't ?
Well , goddamn then , I 'm sorry .
I figured you were .
What are you , then , the boss or something ? "
Wei -Dong closed his eyes and counted to ten .
When he opened them again , the carpenters had swum out of the wrecked galleon before them , their T - squares and saws at the ready .
They moved by building wooden boxes and gates around themselves , which acted as barricades , and they worked fast .
On the land , you could burn their timbers , but that did n't work under the sea .
Once they had you boxed in , they drove long nails through boards around you .
It was a grisly , slow way to die .
Of course , they had the gweilo surrounded in a flash , and they all had to pile on to fight them free .
Xiang summoned his familiar , a boar , and Wei-Dong spelled it its own air bubble and it set to work , tearing up the planks with its tusks .
When at last the carpenters managed to kill it , it turned into a baby and floated , lifeless , to the ocean 's surface , accompanied by a ghostly weeping .
Savage Wonderland looked like it was all laughs , but it was really grim when you got down to it , and the puzzles were hard and the big bosses were really hard .
Speaking of bosses : they put down the last of the carpenters and as they did , a swirling current disturbed the sea-bottom , kicking up sand that settled slowly , revealing the vorpal blade and armor , encrusted in barnacles .
And the gweilo gave a whoop and a holler and dove for it clumsily , as they all shouted at once for him to stop , to wait , and then --
And then he triggered the trap that they all knew was there .
And then there was trouble .
The Jabberwock did indeed have eyes of flame , and it did make a " burbling " sound , just like it said in the poem .
But the Jabberwock did a lot more than give you dirty looks and belch .
The Jabberwock was mean , it soaked up a lot of damage , and it gave as good as it got .
It was fast , too , faster than the carpenters , so one minute you could be behind it and then it would do a barrel roll -- its tail like a whip , cracking and knocking back anything that got in its way -- and it would be facing you , rearing up with its spindly claws splayed , its narrow chest heaving .
The jaws that bite , the claws that catch -- and once they 'd caught you , the Jabberwock would beat you against the hardest surface in reach , doing insane damage while you squirmed to get free .
And the burbling ?
Not so much like burping , really : more like the sound of meat going through a grinder , a nasty sound .
A bloody sound .
The first time Wei-Dong had managed to kill a Jabberwock -- after a weekend 's continuous play -- he 'd crashed hard and had nightmares about that sound .
" Nice going , jackass , " Wei -Dong said as he hammered on his keyboard , trying to get all his spells up and running without getting disemboweled by the nightmare beast before them .
It had Lu and was beating the everloving piss out of him , but that was OK , it was just Lu , his job was to get beaten up .
Wei -Dong cast his healing spells at Lu while he swam back as fast as he could .
" Now , that 's not nice , " the gweilo said .
" How the hell was I supposed to know --"
" You were n't .
You did n't know .
You do n't know .
That 's the point .
That 's why you hired us .
Now we 're going to use up all our spells and potions fighting this thing --" he broke off for a second and hit some more keys " -- and it 's going to take days to get it all back , just because you could n't wait at the back like you were supposed to . "
" I do n't have to take this , " the gweilo said .
" I'm a customer , dammit . "
" You want to be a dead customer , buddy ? " Wei -Dong said .
He 'd barely had any time to talk with his guildies on the whole raid , he'd been stuck talking to this dumb English speaker .
Now the guy was mouthing off to him .
It made him want to throw his computer against the wall .
See what being nice gets you ?
If the gweilo replied , Wei -Dong did n't hear it , because the Jabberwock was really pouring on the heat .
He was out of potions and healing spells and Lu was n't going to last much longer .
Oh , crap .
It had Ping in its other claw now , and it was worrying at his armor with a long fang , trying to peel him like a grape .
He tabbed over to his voice - chat controller and dialled up the Chinese channel to full , tuning out the gweilo .
It was a chaos of fast , profane dialect , slangy Chinese that mixed in curse - words from Japanese comics and Indian movies .
The boys were all hollering , too fast for him to get more than the sense of things .
There was Ping , though , calling for him .
" Leonard !
Healing ! "
" I 'm out ! " he said , hating how this was all going .
" I 'm totally empty .
Used it all up on Lu ! "
" That 's it , then , " Ping said .
" We 're dead . "
They all howled with disappointment .
In spite of himself , Wei -Dong grinned .
" You think he 'll reschedule , or are we going to have to give him his money back ? "
Wei -Dong did n't know , but he had a feeling that this goober was n't going to be very cooperative if they told him that he'd gotten up in the middle of the night for nothing .
Even if it was his fault .
He sucked in some whistling breaths through his nose and tried to calm down .
It was almost 2 AM now .
In the house around him , all was silent .
A car revved its engine somewhere far away , but the night was so quiet the sound carried into his bedroom .
" OK , " he said .
" OK , let me do something about this . "
Every game had a couple of BFGs , Big Friendly Guns ( or at least some kind of Big Gun ) , that were nearly impossible to get and nearly impossible to resist .
In Savage Wonderland , they were also nearly impossible to re-load : the rare monster blunderbuss that you had to spend months gathering parts for fired huge loads of sharpened cutlery from the Tea Party , and just collecting enough for a single load took eight or nine hours of gameplay .
Impossible to get -- impossible to load .
Practically no one had one .
But Wei -Dong did .
Ignoring the shouting in his headset , he backed off to the edge of the blunderbuss 's range and began to arm it , a laborious process of dumping all that cutlery into the muzzle .
" Get in front of it , " he said .
" In front of it , now ! "
His guildies could see what he was doing now and they were whooping triumphantly , arraying their toons around its front , occupying its attention , clearing his line of fire .
All he needed was one ... more ... second .
He pulled the trigger .
There was a snap and a hiss as the powder in the pan began to burn .
The sound made the Jabberwock turn its head on its long , serpentine neck .
It regarded him with its burning eyes and it dropped Ping and Lu to the oceanbed .
The powder in the pan flared -- and died .
Misfire !
Ohcrapohcrapohcrap , he muttered , hammering , hammering on the re-arm sequence , his fingers a blur on the mouse - buttons .
" Crapcrapcrapcrap . "
The Jabberwock smiled , and made that wet meaty sound again .
Burble burble , little boy , I 'm coming for you .
It was the sound from his nightmare , the sound of his dream of heroism dying .
The sound of a waste of a day 's worth of ammo and a night 's worth of play .
He was a dead man .
The Jabberwock did one of those whipping , rippling barrel - rolls that were its trademark .
The currents buffeted him , sending him rocking from side to side .
He corrected , overcorrected , corrected again , hit the re-arm button , the fire button , the re-arm button , the fire button --
The Jabberwock was facing him now .
It reared back , flexing its claws , clicking its jaws together .
In a second it would be on him , it would open him from crotch to throat and eat his guts , any second now --
Crash !
The sound of the blunderbuss was like an explosion in a pots - and - pans drawer , a million metallic clangs and bangs as the sea was sliced by a rapidly expanding cone of lethal , screaming metal tableware .
The Jabberwock dissolved , ripped into a slowly rising mushroom of meat and claws and leathery scales .
The left side of its head ripped toward him and bounced off him , settling in the sand .
The water turned pink , then red , and the death - screech of the Jabberwock seemed to carom off the water and lap back over him again and again .
It was a fantastic sound .
His guildies were going nuts , seven thousand miles away , screaming his name , and not Leonard , but Wei-Dong , chanting it in their Internet Cafe off Jiabin Road in Shenzhen .
Wei -Dong was grinning ferociously in his bedroom , basking in it .
And when the water cleared , there again were the vorpal blade and helmet in their crust of barnacles , sitting innocently on the ocean floor .
The gweilo -- the gweilo , he 'd forgotten all about the gweilo ! -- moved clumsily toward it .
" I do n't think so , " said Ping , in pretty good English .
His toon moved so fast that the gweilo probably did n't even see him coming .
Ping 's sword went snicker - snack , and the gweilo's head fell to the sand , a dumb , betrayed expression on its face .
" What the --"
Wei -Dong dropped him from the chat .
" That 's your treasure , brother , " Ping said .
" You earned it . "
" But the money --"
" We can make the money tomorrow night .
That was killer , dude ! "
It was one of Ping 's favorite English phrases , and it was the highest praise in their guild .
And now he had a vorpal blade and helmet .
It was a good night .
They surfaced and paddled to shore and conjured up their mounts again and rode back to the guild - hall , chatting all the way , dispatching the occasional minor beast without much fuss .
The guys were n't too put out at being 75 bucks ' poorer than they 'd expected .
They were players first , business people second .
And that had been fun .
And now it was 2:30 and he'd have to be up for school in four hours , and at this rate , he was going to be lying awake for a long time .
" OK , I 'm going to go guys , " he said , in his best Chinese .
They bade him farewell , and the chat channel went dead .
In the sudden silence of his room , he could hear his pulse pounding in his ears .
And another sound -- a tread on the floor outside his door .
A hand on the doorknob --
Crapcrapcrap
He manged to get the lid of the laptop down and his covers pulled up before the door opened , but he was still holding the machine under the sheets , and his father 's glare from the doorway told him that he was n't fooling anyone .
Wordlessly , still glaring , his father crossed the room and delicately removed the earwig from Wei -Dong 's ear .
It glowed telltale blue , blinking , looking for the laptop that was now sleeping under Wei-Dong 's artistically redecorated Spongebob sheets .
" Dad --" he began .
" Leonard , it 's 2:30 in the morning .
I 'm not going to discuss this with you right now .
But we 're going to talk about it in the morning .
And you 're going to have a long , long time to think about it afterward . "
He yanked back the sheet and took the laptop out of Wei -Dong 's now - limp hand .
" Dad ! " he said , as his father turned and left the room , but his father gave no indication he'd heard before he pulled the bedroom door firmly and authoritatively shut .

Mala missed the birdcalls .
When they 'd lived in the village , there 'd been birdsong every morning , breaking the perfect peace of the night to let them know that the sun was rising and the day was beginning .
That was when she 'd been a little girl .
Here in Mumbai , there were some sickly rooster calls at dawn , but they were nearly drowned out by the neverending trafficsong : the horns , the engines revving , the calls late in the night .
In the village , there 'd been the birdcalls , the silence , and peace , times when everyone was n't always watching .
In Mumbai , there was nothing but the people , the people everywhere , so that every breath you breathed tasted of the mouth that had exhaled it before you got it .
She and her mother and her brother slept together in a tiny room over Mr Kunal 's plastic - recycling factory in Dharavi , the huge squatter 's slum at the north end of the city .
During the day , the room was used to sort plastic into a dozen tubs -- the plastic coming from an endless procession of huge rice - sacks that were filled at the shipyards .
The ships went to America and Europe and Asia filled with goods made in India and came back filled with garbage , plastic that the pickers of Dharavi sorted , cleaned , melted and reformed into pellets and shipped to the factories so that they could be turned into manufactured goods and shipped back to America , Europe and Asia .
When they 'd arrived at Dharavi , Mala had found it terrifying : the narrow shacks growing up to blot out the sky , the dirt lanes between them with gutters running in iridescent blue and red from the dye - shops , the choking always - smell of burning plastic , the roar of motorbikes racing between the buildings .
And the eyes , eyes from every window and roof , all watching them as ammaji led her and her little brother to the factory of Mr Kunal , where they were to live now and forevermore .
But barely a year had gone by and the smell had disappeared .
The eyes had become friendly .
She could hop from one lane to another with perfect confidence , never getting lost on her way to do the marketing or to attend the afternoon classes at the little school - room over the restaurant .
The sorting work had been boring , but never hard , and there was always food , and there were other girls to play with , and ammaji had made friends who helped them out .
Piece by piece , she 'd become a Dharavi girl , and now she looked on the newcomers with a mixture of generosity and pity .
And the work -- well , the work had gotten a lot better , just lately .
It started when she was in the games - cafe with Yasmin , stealing an hour after lessons to spend a few Rupees of the money she 'd saved from her pay - packet ( almost all of it went to the family , of course , but ammaji sometimes let her keep some back and advised her to spend it on a treat at the cornershop ) .
Yasmin had never played Zombie Mecha , but of course they'd both seen the movies at the little filmi house on the road that separated the Muslim and the Hindu sections of Dharavi .
Mala loved Zombie Mecha , and she was good at it , too .
She preferred the PvP servers where players could hunt other players , trying to topple their giant mecha-suits so that the zombies around them could swarm over it , crack open its cockpit cowl and feast on the av within .
Most of the girls at the game cafe came in and played little games with cute animals and trading for hearts and jewels .
But for Mala , the action was in the awesome carnage of the multiplayer war games .
It only took a few minutes to get Yasmin through the basics of piloting her little squadron and then she could get down to tactics .
That was it , that was what none of the other players seemed to understand : tactics were everything .
They treated the game like it was a random chaos of screeching rockets and explosions , a confusion to be waded into and survived , as best as you could .
But for Mala , the confusion was something that happened to other people .
For Mala , the explosions and camera - shake and the screech of the zombies were just minor details , to be noted among the Big Picture , the armies arrayed on the battlefield in her mind .
On that battlefield , the massed forces took on a density and a color that showed where their strengths and weaknesses were , how they were joined to each other and how pushing on this one , over here , would topple that one over there .
You could face down your enemies head on , rockets against rockets , guns against guns , and then the winner would be the luckier one , or the one with the most ammo , or the one with the best shields .
But if you were smart , you did n't have to be lucky , or tougher .
Mala liked to lob rockets and grenades over the opposing armies , to their left and right , creating box - canyons of rubble and debris that blocked their escape .
Meanwhile , a few of her harriers would be off in the weeds aggroing huge herds of zombies , getting them really mad , gathering them up until they were like locusts , blotting out the ground in all directions , leading them ever closer to that box canyon .
Just before they 'd come into view , her frontal force would peel off , running away in a seeming act of cowardice .
Her enemies would be buoyed up by false confidence and give chase -- until they saw the harriers coming straight for them , with an unstoppable , torrential pestilence of zombies hot on their heels .
Most times , they were too shocked to do anything , not even fire at the harriers as they ran straight for their lines and through them , into the one escape left behind in the box - canyon , blowing the crack shut as they left .
Then it was just a matter of waiting for the zombies to overwhelm and devour your opponents , while you snickered and ate a sweet and drank a little tea from the urn by the cashier 's counter .
The sounds of the zombies rending the armies of her enemies and gnawing their bones was particularly satisfying .
Yasmin had been distracted by the zombies , the disgusting entrails , the shining rockets .
But she 'd seen , oh yes , she 'd seen how Mala 's strategies were able to demolish much larger opposing armies and she got over her squeamishness .
And so on they played , drawing an audience : first the hooting derisive boys ( who fell silent when they watched the armies fall before her , and who started to call her " General Robotwalla " without even a hint of mockery ) , and then the girls , shy at first , peeking over the boys ' shoulders , then shoving forward and cheering and beating their fists on the walls and stamping their feet for each dramatic victory .
It was n't cheap , though .
Mala 's carefully hoarded store of Rupees shrank , buffered somewhat by a few coins from other players who paid her a little here and there to teach them how to really play .
She knew she could have borrowed the money , or let some boy spend it on her -- there was already fierce competition for the right to go over the road to the drinkswalla and buy her a masala Coke , a fizzing , foaming spicy explosion of Coke and masala spice and crushed ice that soothed the rawness at the back of her throat that had been her constant companion since they 'd come to Dharavi .
But nice girls from the village did n't let boys buy them things .
Boys wanted something in return .
She knew that , knew it from the movies and from the life around her .
She knew what happened to girls who let boys take care of their needs .
There was always a reckoning .
When the strange man first approached her , she thought about nice girls and boys and what they expected , and she would n't talk to him or meet his eye .
She did n't know what he wanted , but he was n't going to get it from her .
So when he got up from his chair by the cashier as she came into the cafe , rose and crossed to intercept her with his smart linen suit and good shoes and short , neatly oiled hair , and small moustache , she 'd stepped around him , stepped past him , pretended she did n't hear him say , " Excuse me , miss , " and " Miss ?
Miss ?
Please , just a moment of your time . "
But Mrs Dibyendu , the owner of the cafe , shouted at her , " Mala , you listen to this man , you listen to what he has to say to you .
You do n't be rude in my shop , no you do n't ! "
And because Mrs Dibyendu was also from a village , and because her mother had said that Mala could play games but only in Mrs Dibyendu 's cafe , Mrs Dibyendu being the sort of person you could trust not to allow improper doings , or drugs , or violence , or criminality , Mala stopped and turned to the man , silent , expecting .
" Ah , " he said .
" Thank you . "
He nodded to Mrs Dibyendu .
" Thank you . "
He turned back to her , and to the army of boys and girls who'd gathered around her , her army , the ones who called her General Robotwallah and meant it .
" I hear that you are a very good player , " he said .
Mala waggled her chin back and forth , half - closing her eyes , letting her chin say , Yes , I 'm a good player , and I 'm good enough that I do n't need to boast about it .
" Is she a good player ? "
Mala turned to her army , who had the discipline to remain silent until she gave them the nod .
She waggled her chin at them : go on .
And they erupted in an enthused babble , extolling the virtues of their General Robotwallah , the epic battles they 'd fought and won against impossible odds .
" I have some work for good players . "
Mala had heard rumors of this .
" You represent a league ? "
The man smiled a little smile and shook his head .
He smelled of citrusy cologne and betel , a sweet combination of smells she 'd never smelled before .
" No , not a league .
You know that in the game , there are players who do n't play for fun ?
Players who play to make money ? "
" The kind of money you 're offering to us ? "
His chin waggled and he chuckled .
" No , not exactly .
There are players who play to build up game - money , which they sell on to other players who are too lazy to do the playing for themselves . "
Mala thought about this for a moment .
The containers went out of India filled with goods and came back filled with garbage for Dharavi .
Somewhere out there , in the America of the filmi shows , there was a world of people with unimaginable wealth .
" We 'll do it , " she said .
" I 've already got more credits than I can spend .
How much do they pay for them ? "
Again , the chuckle .
" Actually , " he said , then stopped .
Her army was absolutely silent now , hanging on his every word .
From the machines came the soft crashing of the wars , taking place in the world inside the network , all day and all night long .
" Actually , that 's not exactly it .
We want you and your friends to destroy them , kill their avs , take their fortunes . "
Mala thought for another instant , puzzled .
Who would want to kill these other players ?
" You 're a rival ? "
The man waggled his chin .
Maybe yes , maybe no .
She thought some more .
" You work for the game ! " she said .
" You work for the game and you do n't want --"
" Who I work for is n't important , " the man said , holding up his fingers .
He wore a wedding ring on one hand , and two gold rings on the other .
He was missing the top joints on three of his fingers , she saw .
That was common in the village , where farmers were always getting caught in the machines .
Here was a man from a village , a man who'd come to Mumbai and become a man in a neat suit with a neat mustache and gold rings glinting on what remained of his fingers .
Here was the reason her mother had brought them to Dharavi , the reason for the sore throat and the burning eyes and the endless work over the plastic - sorting tubs .
" What 's important is that we would pay you and your friends --"
" My army , " she said , interrupting him without thinking .
For a moment his eyes flashed dangerously and she sensed that he was about to slap her , but she stood her ground .
She 'd been slapped plenty before .
He snorted once through his nose , then went on .
" Yes , Mala , your army .
We would pay you to destroy these players .
You'd be told what sort of mecha they were piloting , what their player - names were , and you 'd have to root them out and destroy them .
You 'd keep all their wealth , and you 'd get Rupees , too . "
" How much ? "
He made a pained expression , like he had a little gas .
" Perhaps we should discuss that in private , later ?
With your mother present ? "
Mala noticed that he did n't say , " Your parents , " but rather , " Your mother . "
Mrs Dibyendu and he had been talking , then .
He knew about Mala , and she did n't know about him .
She was just a girl from the village , after all , and this was the world , where she was still trying to understand it all .
She was a general , but she was also a girl from the village .
General Girl From the Village .
So he'd come that night to Mr Kunal 's factory , and Mala 's mother had fed him thali and papadams from the women 's papadam collective , and they 'd boiled chai in the electric kettle and the man had pretended that his fine clothes and gold belonged here , and had squatted back on his heels like a man in the village , his hairy ankles peeking out over his socks .
No one Mala knew wore socks .
" Mr Banerjee , " ammaji said , " I do n't understand this , but I know Mrs Dibyendu .
If she says you can be trusted ... "
She trailed off , because really , she did n't know Mrs Dibyendu .
In Dharavi , there were many hazards for a young girl .
Ammaji would fret over them endlessly while she brushed out Mala 's hair at night , all the ways a girl could find herself ruined or hurt here .
But the money .
" A lakh of rupees every month , " he said .
" Plus a bonus .
Of course , she 'll have to pay her ' army ' --" he 'd given Mala a little chin waggle at that , see , I remember " -- out of that .
But how much would be up to her . "
" These children would n't have any money if it was n't for my Mala ! " ammaji said , affronted at their imaginary grasping hands .
" They 're only playing a game !
They should be glad just to play with her ! "
Ammaji had been furious when she discovered that Mala had been playing at the cafe all these afternoons .
She thought that Mala only played once in a while , not with every rupee and moment she had spare .
But when the man -- Mr Banerjee -- had mentioned her talent and the money it could earn for the family , suddenly ammaji had become her daughter 's business manager .
Mala saw that Mr Banerjee had known this would happen and wondered what else Mrs Dibyendu had told him about their family .
" Ammaji , " she said , quietly , keeping her eyes down in the way they did in the village .
" They 're my army , and they need paying if they play well .
Otherwise they wo n't be my army for long . "
Ammaji looked hard at her .
Beside them , Mala 's little brother Gopal took advantage of their distraction to sneak the last bit of eggplant off Mala 's plate .
Mala noticed , but pretended she had n't , and concentrated on keeping her eyes down .
Ammaji said , " Now , Mala , I know you want to be good to your friends , but you have to think of your family first .
We will find a fair way to compensate them -- maybe we could prepare a weekly feast for them here , using some of the money .
I 'm sure they could all use a good meal . "
Mala did n't like to disagree with her mother , and she 'd never done so in front of strangers , but --
But this was her army , and she was their general .
She knew what made them tick , and they 'd heard Mr Banerjee announce that she would be paid in cash for their services .
They believed in fairness .
They would n't work for food while she worked for a lakh ( a lakh -- 100,000 rupees !
The whole family lived on 200 rupees a day ! ) of cash .
" Ammaji , " she said , " it would n't be right or fair . "
It occurred to Mala that Mr Banerjee had mentioned the money in front of the army .
He could have been more discreet .
Perhaps it was deliberate .
" And they 'd know it .
I can't earn this money for the family on my own , Ammaji . "
Her mother closed her eyes and breathed through her nose , a sign that she was trying to keep hold of her temper .
If Mr Banerjee had n't been present , Mala was sure she would have gotten a proper beating , the kind she 'd gotten from her father before he left them , when she was a naughty little girl in the village .
But if Mr Banerjee was n't here , she would n't have to talk back to her mother , either .
" I 'm sorry for this , Mr Banerjee , " Ammaji said , not looking at Mala .
" Girls of this age , they become rebellious -- impossible . "
Mala thought about a future in which instead of being General Robotwallah , she had to devote her life to begging and bullying her army into playing with her so that she could keep all the money they made for her family , while their families went hungry and their mothers demanded that they come home straight from school .
When Mr Banerjee mentioned his gigantic sum , it had conjured up a vision of untold wealth , a real house , lovely clothes for all of them , Ammaji free to spend her afternoons cooking for the family and resting out of the heat , a life away from Dharavi and the smoke and the stinging eyes and sore throats .
" I think your little girl is right , " Mr Banerjee said , with quiet authority , and Mala 's entire family stared at him , speechless .
An adult , taking Mala 's side over her mother ?
" She is a very good leader , from what I can see .
If she says her people need paying , I believe that she is correct . "
He wiped at his mouth with a handkerchief .
" With all due respect , of course .
I would n't dream of telling you how to raise your children , of course . "
" Of course ... "
Ammaji said , as if in a dream .
Her eyes were downcast , her shoulders slumped .
To be spoken to this way , in her own home , by a stranger , in front of her children !
Mala felt terrible .
Her poor mother .
And it was all Mr Banerjee 's fault : he 'd mentioned the money in front of her army , and then he'd brought her mother to this point --
" I will find a way to get them to fight without payment , Ammaji --"
But she was cut short by her mother 's hand , coming up , palm out to her .
" Quiet , daughter , " she said .
" If this man , this gentleman , says you know what you 're doing , well , then I can't contradict him , can I ?
I 'm just a simple woman from the village .
I do n't understand these things .
You must do what this gentleman says , of course . "
Mr Banerjee stood and smoothed his suit back into place with the palms of his hands .
Mala saw that he'd gotten some chana on his shirt and lapel , and that made her feel better somehow , like he was a mortal and not some terrible force of nature who'd come to destroy their little lives .
He made a little namaste at Ammaji , hands pressed together at his chest , a small hint of a bow .
" Good night , Mrs Vajpayee .
That was a lovely supper .
Thank you . " he said .
" Good night , General Robotwallah .
I will come to the cafe tomorrow at three o'clock to talk more about your missions .
Good night , Gopal , " he said , and her brother looked up at him , guiltily , eggplant still poking out of the corner of his mouth .
Mala thought that Ammaji might slap her once the man had left , but they all went to bed together without another word , and Mala snuggled up to her mother the same as she did every night , stroking her long hair .
It had been shining and black when they left the village , but a year later , it was shot through with grey and it felt wiry .
Ammaji's hand caught hers and stilled it , the callouses on her fingers rough .
" Sleep , daughter , " she murmured .
" You have an important job , now .
You need your sleep . "
The next morning , they avoided one another 's eyes , and things were hard for a week , until she brought home her first pay - packet , folded carefully in the sole of her shoe .
Her army had carved through the enemy forces like the butcher 's cleaver parting heads from chickens .
There had been a large bonus in their pay - packet , and even after she 'd paid Mrs Dibyendu and bought everyone masala Coke at the Hotel Hajj next door , and paid the army their wages , there was almost 2,000 rupees left , and she took Ammaji into the smallest sorting room in the loft of the factory , up the ladder .
Ammaji's eyes lit up when she saw the money , and she 'd kissed Mala on the forehead and taken her in the longest , fiercest hug of their lives together .
And now it was all wonderful between them .
Ammaji had begun to look for a place for them further towards the middle of Dharavi , the old part where the tin and scrap buildings had been gradually replaced with brick ones , where the potters ' kilns smoked a clean woodsmoke instead of the dirty , scratchy plastic smoke near Mr Kunal 's factory .
Mala had new school - clothes , new shoes , and so did Gopal , and Ammaji had new brushes for her hair and a new sari that she wore after her work - day was through , looking pretty and young , the way Mala remembered her from the village .
And the battles were glorious .
She entered the cafe out of the melting , dusty sun of late day and stood in the doorway .
Her army was already assembled , practicing on their machines , passing gupshup in the shadows of the dark , noisy room , or making wet eyes at one another through the dim .
She barely had time to grin and then hide the grin before they noticed her and climbed to their feet , standing straight and proud , saluting her .
She did n't know which one of them had begun the saluting business .
It had started as a joke , but now it was serious .
They vibrated at attention , all eyes on her .
They had on better clothes , they looked well - fed .
General Robotwallah was leading her army to victory and prosperity .
" Let 's play , " she said .
In her pocket , her handphone had the latest message from Mr Banerjee with the location of the day 's target .
Yasmin was at her usual place , at Mala 's right hand , and at her left sat Fulmala , who had a bad limp from a leg that she 'd broken and that had n't healed right .
But Fulmala was smart and fast , and she grasped the tactics better than anyone in the cafe except Mala herself .
And Yasmin , well , Yasmin could make the boys behave , which was a major accomplishment , since left to their own they liked to squabble and one - up each other , in a reckless spiral that always ended badly .
But Yasmin could talk to them in a way that was stern like an older sister , and they 'd fall into line .
Mala had her army , her lieutenants , and her mission .
She had her machine , the fastest one in the cafe , with a bigger monitor than any of the others , and she was ready to go to war .
She touched up her displays , rolled her head from side to side , and led her army to battle again .

This scene is dedicated to Barnes and Noble , a US national chain of bookstores .
As America 's mom-and - pop bookstores were vanishing , Barnes and Noble started to build these gigantic temples to reading all across the land .
Stocking tens of thousands of titles ( the mall bookstores and grocery - store spinner racks had stocked a small fraction of that ) and keeping long hours that were convenient to families , working people and others potential readers , the B&N stores kept the careers of many writers afloat , stocking titles that smaller stores could n't possibly afford to keep on their limited shelves .
B&N has always had strong community outreach programs , and I 've done some of my best - attended , best - organized signings at B &N stores , including the great events at the ( sadly departed ) B&N in Union Square , New York , where the mega - signing after the Nebula Awards took place , and the B&N in Chicago that hosted the event after the Nebs a few years later .
Best of all is that B&N's " geeky " buyers really Get
It when it comes to science fiction , comics and manga , games and similar titles .
They 're passionate and knowledgeable about the field and it shows in the excellent selection on display at the stores .
Barnes and Noble , nationwide
Gold .
It 's all about gold .
But not regular gold , the sort of thing you dig out of the ground .
That stuff was for the last century .
There 's not enough of it , for one thing : all the gold ever dug out of the ground in the history of the world would only amount to a cube whose sides were the length of a tennis court .
And curiously , there 's also too much of it : all the certificates of gold ownership issued into the world add up to a cube twice that size .
Some of those certificates do n't amount to anything -- and no one knows which ones .
No one has independently audited Fort Knox since 1956 FCK .
For all we know , it 's empty , the gold smuggled out and sold , put in a vault , sold as certificates , then stolen again and put into another vault , used as the basis for more certificates .
Not regular gold .
Virtual gold .
Call it what you want : in one game it 's called " Credits , " in another , " Volcano Bucks . "
There are groats , Disney Dollars , cowries , moolah , and Fool 's Gold , and a million other kinds of gold out there .
Unlike real gold , there 's no vault of reserves backing the certificates .
Unlike money , there 's no government involved in their issue .
Virtual gold is issued by companies .
Game companies .
Game companies who declare , " So many gold pieces can buy this piece of armor , " or " So many credits can buy this space ship " or " So much Jools can buy this zeppelin . "
And because they say it , it is true .
Countries and their banks have to mess around with the ugly business of convincing citizens to believe what they say : the government may say , " This social security check will provide for all your needs in a month , " but that does n't mean that the merchants who supply those needs will agree .
Companies do n't have this problem .
When Coca Cola says that 76 groats will buy you one dwarvish axe in Svartalfaheim Warriors , that 's it : the price of an axe is 76 groats .
Do n't like it ?
Go play somewhere else .
Virtual money is n't backed by gold or governments : it 's backed by fun .
So long as a game is fun , players somewhere will want to buy into it , because as fun as the game is , it 's always more fun if you 're one of the haves , with all the awesome armor and killer weapons , than if you 're some lowly noob have - not with a dagger , fighting your way up to your first sword .
But where there 's money to be spent , there 's money to be made .
For some players , the most fun game of all is the game that carves them out a slice of the pie .
Not all the action belongs to the giant companies up on their tall offices and the games they make .
Plenty of us can get in on the action from down below , where the grubby little people are .
Of course , this makes the companies bonkers .
They 're big daddy , they know what 's best for their worlds .
They are in control .
They design the levels and the difficulty to make it all perfectly balanced .
They design the puzzles .
They decree that light elves can't talk to dark elves , that players on Russian servers can't hop onto the Chinese servers , that it would take the average player 32 hours to attain the Von Klausewitz drive and 48 hours to earn the Order of the Armored Penguin .
If you do n't like it , you 're supposed to leave : you 're not supposed to just buy your way out of it .
Or if you do , you should have the decency to buy it from them .
And here 's a little something they wo n't tell you , these Gods of the Virtual : they can't control it .
Kids , crooks , and weirdos all over the world have riddled their safe little terrarrium worlds with tunnels leading to the great outdoors .
There are multiple , competing interworld exchanges : want to swap out your Zombie Mecha wealth for a fully loaded spaceship and a crew of jolly space - pirates to crew it ?
Ten different gangs want your business -- they 'll fix you right up with someone else 's spaceship and take your mecha , arms and ammo into inventory for the next person who wants to immigrate to Zombie Mecha from some other magical world .
And the Gods are powerless to stop it .
For every barrier they put up , there are hundreds of smart , motivated players of the Big Game who will knock it down .
You'd think it'd be impossible , would n't you ?
After all , these are n't mere games of cops and robbers , played out in real cities filled with real people .
They do n't need an all - points bulletin to find a fugitive at large : every person in the world is in the database , and they own the database .
They do n't need a search warrant to find the contraband hiding under your floorboards : the floorboards , the contraband , the house and you are all in the database -- and they own the database .
It should be impossible , but it is n't , and here 's why : the biggest sellers of gold and treasure , levels and experience in the worlds are the game companies themselves .
Oh , they do n't call it power - levelling and gold - farming -- they package it with prettier , more palatable names , like " accelerated progress bonus pack " and " All Together Now ( TM ) " and lots of other redonkulous names that do n't fool anyone .
But the Gods are n't happy with merely turning a buck on players who are too lazy to work their way up through the game .
They 've got a much , much weirder game in play .
They sell gold to people who do n't even play the game .
That 's right : if you 're a bigshot finance guy and you 're looking for somewhere to stash a million bucks where it will do some good , you can buy a million dollars ' worth of virtual gold , hang onto it as the game grows and becomes more and more fun , as the value of the gold rises and rises , and then you can sell it back for real money through the official in - game banks , pocketing a chunky profit for your trouble .
So while you 're piloting your mecha , swinging your axe or commanding your space fleet , there 's a group of weird old grownups in suits in fancy offices all over the world watching your play eagerly , trying to figure out if the value of in - game gold is going to go up or down .
When a game starts to suck , everyone rushes to sell out their holdings , getting rid of the gold as fast as they can before its value it obliterated by bored gamers switching to a competing service .
And when the game gets more fun , well , that 's an even bigger frenzy , as the bidding wars kick up to high gear , every banker in the world trying to buy the same gold for the same world .
Is it any wonder that eight of the 20 largest economies in the world are in virtual countries ?
And is it any wonder that playing has become such a serious business ?

This scene is dedicated to Secret Headquarters in Los Angeles , my drop - dead all - time favorite comic store in the world .
It 's small and selective about what it stocks , and every time I walk in , I walk out with three or four collections I 'd never heard of under my arm .
It 's like the owners , Dave and David , have the uncanny ability to predict exactly what I 'm looking for , and they lay it out for me seconds before I walk into the store .
I discovered about three quarters of my favorite comics by wandering into SHQ , grabbing something interesting , sinking into one of the comfy chairs , and finding myself transported to another world .
When my second story - collection , OVERCLOCKED , came out , they worked with local illustrator Martin Cenreda to do a free mini-comic based on Printcrime , the first story in the book .
I left LA about a year ago , and of all the things I miss about it , Secret Headquarters is right at the top of the list .
Secret Headquarters : 3817 W. Sunset Boulevard , Los Angeles , CA 90026 +1 323 666 2228
Matthew stood outside the door of the Internet cafe , breathing deeply .
On the walk over , he 'd managed to calm down a little , but as he drew closer , he became more and more convinced that Boss Wing 's boys would be waiting for him there , and all his friends would be curled up on the ground , beaten unconscious .
He 'd brought four of the best players with him out of Boss Wing 's factory , and he knew that Boss Wing was n't happy about that at all .
He was hyperventilating , his head swimming .
He still hurt .
It felt like he had a soccer ball - sized red sun of pain burning in his underwear and one of the things he wanted most and least to do was to find a private spot to have a look in there .
There was a bathroom in the cafe , so that was that , it was time to go inside .
He walked up the four flights of stairs painfully , passing under the gigantic murals from gamespace , avoiding the plastic plants on each landing that reeked of piss from players who did n't want to wait for the bathroom .
From the third floor up , he was enveloped in the familiar cloud of body odor , cigarette smoke and cursing that told him he was on his way to his true home .
In the doorway , he paused and peered around , looking for any sign of Boss Wing 's goons , but it was business as usual : rows and rows of tables with PCs on them , a few couples sharing machines , but mostly , it was boys playing , skinny , with their shirts rolled up over their bellies to catch any breeze that might happen through the room .
There were no breezes , just the eddies in the smoke caused by the growl of all those PC fans whining as they sucked particulate - laden smoky air over the superheated motherboards and monster video cards .
He slunk past the sign - in desk , staffed tonight by a new kid , someone else just arrived from the provinces to find his fortune here in bad old Shenzhen .
Matthew wanted to grab the kid and carry him to the city limits , explaining all the way that there was no fortune to be found here anymore , it all belonged to men like Boss Wing .
Go home , he thought at the boy , Go home , this place is done .
His boys were playing at their usual table .
They had made a pyramid from alternating layers of Double Happiness cigarette packs and empty coffee cups .
They looked up as he neared them , smiling and laughing at some joke .
Then they saw the look on his face and they fell silent .
He sat down at a vacant chair and stared at their screens .
They 'd been playing , of course .
They were always playing .
When they worked in Boss Wing 's factory , they 'd pull an 18 hour shift and then they 'd relax by playing some more , running their own characters through the dungeons they 'd been farming all day long .
It 's why Boss Wing had such an easy time recruiting for his factory : the pitch was seductive .
" Get paid to play ! "
But it was n't the same when you worked for someone else .
He tried to find the words to start and could n't .
" Matthew ? "
It was Yo , the oldest of them .
Yo actually had a family , a wife and a young daughter .
He 'd left Boss Wing 's factory and followed Matthew .
Matthew stared at his hands , took a deep breath , and made a decision : " Sorry , I just had a little fight on the way over here .
I 've got good news , though : I 've got a way to make us all very rich in a very short time . "
And , from memory , Master Fong described the way he'd found into the rich dungeon of Svartalfaheim Warriors .
He commandeered a computer and showed them , showed them how to shave the seconds off the run , where to make sure to stop and grab and pick up .
And then they each took up a machine and went to work .
In time , the ache in his pants faded .
Someone gave him a cigarette , then another .
Someone brought him some dumplings .
Master
Fong ate them without tasting them .
He and his team were at work , and they were making money , and someday soon , they'd have a fortune that would make Boss Wing look like a small - timer .
Sometime during the shift , his phone rang .
It was his mother .
She wanted to wish him a happy birthday .
He had just turned 17 .

Wei -Dong 's game - suspension lasted all of 20 minutes .
That 's how long it took him to fake a migraine , get a study - pass , sneak into the resource center , beat the network filter and log on .
It was getting very late back in China , but that was OK , the boys stayed up late when they were working , and they were glad to have him .
Wei -Dong 's real name was n't Wei -Dong , of course .
His real name was Leonard Rosenbaum .
He 'd chosen Wei-Dong after looking up the meanings of Chinese names and coming up with Strength of the East , which he liked the sound of .
This system for picking names worked well for the Chinese kids he knew -- when their parents immigrated to the States , they 'd just pick some English name and that was it .
Why not ?
Why was it better to pick a name because your grandfather had it than because you liked the sound of it ?
He 'd tried to explain this to his parents , but it did n't make much of an impression on them .
They were cool with him being interested in other cultures , but that did n't mean he could get out of having a Bar - Mitzvah or that they would call him Wei-Dong .
And it did n't mean that they approved of him being up all night with his buds in China , making money .
Wei -Dong knew that this could all be seen as very lame , an outcast kid so desperate to make friends that he abandoned his high school altogether and sucked up to someone in another hemisphere with free labor instead .
But it was n't like that .
Wei -Dong had plenty of friends at Ronald Regan Secondary School .
Plenty of kids thought that China was the most interesting place in the world , loved the movies and the food and the comics and the games .
And there were lots of Chinese kids in school too and while a couple clearly thought he was weird , lots more got it .
After all , most of them were into India the way he was into China , so they had that in common .
And so what if he was skipping a class ?
It was Social Studies , ferchrissakes !
They were supposed to be studying China , but Wei-Dong knew about ten times more about the subject than the teacher did .
As he whispered in Mandarin into his earwig , he thought that this was like an independent study project .
His teachers should be giving him bonus marks .
" Now what ? " he said .
" What 's the mission ? "
" We were thinking of running the Walrus 's Garden a few more times , now that we 've got it fresh in our heads .
Maybe we could pick up another vorpal blade . "
That 's what the guys did when there were n't any paying gweilos -- they went raiding for prestige items .
It was n't the most exciting thing of all , but you never knew what might happen .
" I'm into it , " he said .
He had a free period after this one , then lunch , so technically he could play for three hours solid .
They 'd all be ready to log off and go to bed by then , anyway .
" You 're a good gweilo , you know ? " Wei -Dong knew Ping was kidding .
He did n't care if the guys called him gweilo .
It was n't a racist term , not really , not like " chink " or " slant - eye . "
Just a term of affection .
And as nicknames went , " Foreign ghost " was actually kind of cool .
So they hit the Garden and ran it and they did pretty well , and they went and put the money in the guild bank and went back for more .
Then they did it again .
Somewhere in there , the bell rang .
Somewhere in there , some of his friends came and talked to him and he muted the earwig and said some things back to them , but he did n't really know what he'd said .
Something .
Then , on the third run , the bad thing happened .
They were almost to the shore , and they 'd banished their mounts .
Wei -Dong was prepping the Queen 's Air Pocket , dipping into the monster supply of oyster shells he'd built up on the previous runs .
And out they came , a dozen knights on huge , fearsome black steeds , rising out of the water in unison , rending the air with the angry chorus of their mounts and their battle - cries .
The water fountained up around them and they fell upon Wei-Dong and his guildies .
He shouted something into his earwig , a warning , and all around him in the resource center , kids looked up from their conversations to stare at him .
He 'd become a dervish , hammering away at his keyboard and mousing furiously , his eyes fixed on the screen .
The black riders moved with eerie synchrony .
Either they were monsters -- monsters such as Wei-Dong had never encountered -- or they were the most practiced , cooperative raiding party he 'd ever seen .
He had his vorpal blade out now , and his guildies were all fighting as well .
In his earwig , they cursed in the Chinese dialects of six different provinces .
Under other circumstances , Wei-Dong would have taken notes , but now he was fighting for his life .
Lu had bravely taken the point between the riders and the party , the huge tank standing fast with his mace and broadsword , engaging all twelve of the knights without regard for his own safety .
Wei -Dong poured healing spells on him as he attempted to make his own mark on the riders with the vorpal blade , three times as long as he was .
The vorpal blade could do incredible damage , but it was n't easy to use .
Twice , Wei-Dong accidentally sliced into members of his own party , though not badly -- thank God , or he'd never hear the end of it -- but he could n't get a cut in on the black knights , who were too fast for him .
Then Lu fell , going down on one knee , pierced through the throat by a pike wielded by a rider whose steed 's eyes were the icy blue of the Caterpillar 's mist .
The rider lifted Lu into the air , his feet kicking limply , and another knight beheaded him with a contemptuous swing of his sword .
Lu fell in two pieces to the gritty beach sand and in the earwig , he cursed them , using an expression that Wei-Dong had painstakingly translated into " Screw eight generations of your ancestors . "
With Lu down , the rest of them were practically helpless .
They fought valiantly , coordinating their attacks , pouring on fire from their magic items and best spells , but the black knights were unbeatable .
Before he died , Wei -Dong managed to hit one with the vorpal blade and had the momentary satisfaction of watching the knight stagger and clutch at his chest , but then the fighter closed with him , drawing a pair of short swords that he spun like a magician doing knife tricks .
There was no question of parrying him , and seconds later , Wei-Dong was in the sand , watching the knight 's spiked boot descend on his face , hearing the crunch of his cheekbones and nose shattering under the weight .
Then he was respawning in the distant Lake of Tears , naked and unarmed , and he had to corpse - run to the body of his toon before the bastards got his vorpal blade .
He heard his guildies dying in the earwig , one after another , as he ran , ghostly and ethereal , across the hills and dales of Wonderland .
He reached his corpse just in time to watch the knights loot the body , and the bodies of his teammates .
He rose up again , helpless and unarmed and made flesh by the body of his toon , vulnerable .
One of the knights sent him a chat - request .
He clicked it , silencing the background noises from Shenzhen .
" You farmers are n't welcome here anymore , Comrade , " the voice said .
It had an accent he did n't recognize .
Maybe Russian ?
And the speaker was just a kid !
" We 're patrolling now .
You come back again , we 'll hunt and kill you again , and again , and again .
You understand me , Chinee ? "
Not just a kid : a girl -- a little girl , threatening him from somewhere in the world .
" Who put you in charge , missy ? " he said .
" And what makes you think I'm Chinese , anyway ? "
There was a nasty laugh .
" Missy , huh ?
I 'm in charge because I just kicked your ass , and because I can kick it again , as many times as I need to .
And I do n't care if you 're in China , Vietnam , Indonesia -- it does n't make a difference .
We 'll kill you and all the farmers in Wonderland .
This game is n't farmable anymore .
I 'm done talking to you now . "
And the black knight decapitated him with contemptuous ease .
He flipped back to the guild channel , ready to tell them about what had just happened , his mind reeling , and that 's when he looked up into the face of his father , standing over him , with a look on his face that could curdle milk .
" Get up , Leonard , " he said .
" And come with me . "
He was n't alone .
There was Mr Adams , the vice - principal , and the school 's rent - a - cop , Officer Turner , and the guidance counsellor , Ms Ramirez .
They presented him with the stony faces of Mount Rushmore , faces without a hint of mercy .
His father reached over and took the earwig out of his ear , gently , carefully .
Then , with exactly the same care , he dropped the earwig to the polished concrete floor of the resource centre and brought his heel down on it , the crunch loud in the perfectly silent room .
Leonard stood up .
The room was full of kids pretending not to look at him .
They were all looking at him .
He followed his father into the hallway and as the door swung shut , he heard , unmistakably , the sound of a hundred giggles in unison .
They boxed him in on the walk to the vice - principal 's office , trapping him .
Not that he'd run -- he had nowhere to run to , but it still made him feel claustrophobic .
This was not good .
This was very , very bad .
Here 's how bad it was : " You 're going to send me to military school ? "
" Not military school , " Ms Ramirez said .
She said it with that maddening , patronizing guidance - counsellor tone .
" The Martindale Academy has no military or martial component .
It 's merely a very structured , supervised environment .
They have a fantastic track record in helping students like you concentrate on grades and pull themselves out of academic troubles .
They 've got a beautiful campus in a beautiful location , and Martindale boys go on to fill many important --"
And on and on .
She 'd swallowed the sales brochure like a burrito and now it was rebounding on her .
He tuned her out and looked at his father .
Benny Rosenbaum was n't the sort of person you could read easily .
The people who worked for him at Rosenbaum Shipping and Logistics called him The Wall , because you could n't get anything past him , under him , through him , or over him .
Not that he was a hardcase , but he could n't be swayed by emotional arguments : if you tried to approach him with anything less than fully computerized logic , you might as well forget it .
But there were little tells , little ways you could figure out what the weather was like in old Benny .
That thing he was doing with his watch strap , working at the catch , that was one of them .
So was the little jump in the hinge of his jaw , like he was chewing an invisible wad of gum .
Combine those with the fact that he was away from his wor
HOW TO : Make a list of your files or folders quickly
Ever wanted to send a list of the movies you have to one of your friends ?
Or maybe wanted print a list of MP3 files that you have , Or share a list of albums with your friends on the internet ?
But copying the file or folder names one by one would take so much time , and it is boring !
So here ’s the easy and quick way to do it on Windows and Linux OS …
To make a list of files and folders in a directory simply follow these steps :
Windows
Start
Run
Type “ cmd ” without quotes and hit enter
Now you need to navigate to the directory you wish to print the contents of .
Type the letter of the partition where your folder is e.g. “ D : ” Now you ’re in partition D. Simply use the “ cd ” command to reach the folder you want then enter the following command ..
dir -o -b > list.txt
Now you ’ll find a new file “ list.txt ” created in the directory and has a list of files and folders name in this directory .
Let me explain what this command means ,
You can skip that part if you ’re not interested .
1. dir is the command used to list the contents of a directory
2. -o to sort the files in the list by name .
Use -s to sort them by size and -e to sort them by extension .
3. - b this means you want only the files or folders names without any other infomation .
4. > list.txt
This indicates the name of the new text file you want to the list to be generated into .
In this case the generated file name will be “ list.txt ” and this file will be generated in the directory you ’re creating the list from .
Tips for advanced users :
You can create a batch file “ .bat ” with the command above and save it in your windows folder , Then in Windows Expolorer go to Tools > Folder Options >
Types tab > then click Folder .
Click the Advanced , Then “ New ” like in this image ..
Now when you right - click on directory you should see a new option “ Create File Listing ” .
Piece of cake , Is n’t it ?
Linux
Go to the directory you wish to list the contents of .
If you ’re new to Linux , you will need to learn about the “ cd ” command and the “ ls ” command .
Once in the directory you wish to print the contents of , simply type that command
ls > list.txt
That will print or list the files and folders in the current directory to a new file named “ list. txt ” file .
Good luck .

Last week , I appeared on Judge Andrew Napolitano 's new Fox Business Channel show to discuss estate taxes , green energy , and the BP oil spill .
Here 's that clip ( about 11 minutes long ; go to Reason.tv for downloadable versions of all staff media appearances ) .
As it happens , that very appearance above prompted SF writer J. Neil Schulman at his Rational Review blog to ask , " Am I a libertarian ?
Is Glenn Beck ?
Nick Gillespie ?
Was Ayn Rand or Robert Heinlein ?
Are you ? "
Schulman recounts various moments when he has been spurned by doctrinaire libs who have also gone on to write Ludwig von Mises , Ayn Rand , and Robert Heinlein out of the movement and says , Enough already .
A lifetime of devotion to liberty is n't even close to being enough for many libertarians to think of you as being a member of their little clique .
And I do mean little .
If being a lifetime worker for liberty is n't enough for some people , evolving towards liberty from a mainstream state - approving belief system is likely to have you looked at the way a life - saving transplanted organ is regarded by blindly hostile white corpuscles — with results just as fatal to the body .
It just does n't take much for libertarians to treat you like a Jew trying to join the Episcopalian - run country club .
It might be enough that you express a belief in God , while most radical libertarians are hostile to religion .
Being a believer in limited rather than zero government is another reason for the blackball to be dropped into the bowl .
Think the United States is historically an overall force for good in the world , or have good things to say about the Founding Fathers ?
Get ready for many libertarians to call you a Neocon , no matter how many wars you 've demonstrated against .
And God forbid that you have anything good to say about Israel , Mormons , Jesus Christ , or Country Music .
When the hell did the libertarian movement become more exclusive than the Bohemian Grove ?
Devotees of liberty are facing the strongest push towards totalitarian global statism I 've seen in my lifetime .
The libertarian movement is too small , too fragile , too marginalized already for anyone as potentially decisive to the cause of liberty as Glenn Beck , Ayn Rand , Robert Heinlein — and yes , me , especially now when I 'm working my ass off to produce a movie based on my most popular libertarian - themed novel , Alongside Night — to be treated with adolescent dismissal .
Wise up .
Robust libertarian movements have historically been rerouted back onto the Road to Serfdom by far less .

Christians Terrify Children with Visions of Hell
The United States is made up of 84 % religious folk .
Almost all of them are Christian .
Now the jury is still out on whether or not Catholics are Christians , so you would have to ask the Catholics about that .
Do n’t ask your run of the mill Christian because they will tell you they , the Catholics , are not .
As a matter of fact they will probably tell you that they are Papists , and Mackerel Snappers , and other not so nice things .
The Catholics on the other hand will probably tell you that they are the only true faith and all others are interlopers and have no chance in hell of going to Catholic heaven ; the only real heaven .
That being said one thing many of these Jesus Jumpers have in common is their penchant for abusing children with horror stories of hell and eternal damnation .
This is a form of verbal abuse not dissimilar to the traditionally accepted form of negative expression called child abuse .
I grew up in a Catholic family .
I went to Catholic school for the first 12 years of my young life .
I remember the nuns telling us if we did n’t pray every day we would get stomach cancer and die .
I remember them telling us if we entertained “ indecent ” thoughts we would be taken by the devil in our sleep .
The very idea of masturbation was never mentioned because the horror that would follow would be too terrible to even mention .
That and the fact we were about 8 years old .
I remember waking up at night covered in sweat , after having dreamed that the devil was coming to get me and I did n’t know why , only that the nuns had said he would , for even the slightest transgression .
A friend mailed me this little cartoon the other day and it seemed to fit the occasion quite well .
It is yet another expression of the horror that is perpetrated on the young and innocent by the religious zealots :
Space Weather reports that one of the largest solar prominences in years erupted from the sun 's northwestern limb yesterday , April 13 .
" The massive plasma - filled structure rose up and burst during a ~ 2 hour period around 0900 UT on April 13th . "
Observers in Europe had the best view , and this photo was shot by Jo Dahlmans of Ulestraten , Netherlands , using his Coronado Personal Solar Telescope .
" The eruption hurled a bright coronal mass ejection ( CME , movie ) into space .
The expanding cloud could deliver a glancing blow to Earth 's magnetic field around April 15th .
NOAA forecasters estimate a 35 % chance of polar geomagnetic activity when the CME arrives . "

It will take you no more than an hour ’s drive to reach Hof Marienhöhe , the organic farm 77 kilometres south - east of Berlin .
Upon arrival , the oppressive dreariness of an overcast day lifts to reveal the beauty of another world : a group of about eight cows with startling mahogany coats blink languidly at the shiny , out - of - place Volkswagen Sedan as they block the long driveway to the main farm building .
As the animals are herded away , a field of bright yellow blooms fills the view .
Any visitor would agree that Hof Marienhöhe is breathtakingly beautiful , but its boast of being the oldest continuously - operating Demeter farm in Germany ( it was founded in 1928 ) would probably result in blank stares : while we ’ve all grown tired of hearing about bio , Demeter farming remains an obscure concept for most Berliners .
After Italy and Austria , Germany boasts the third - highest number of organic farms in Europe : 16,476 farms and 734,027 hectares of German land were run according to EU - approved organic standards in 2003 .
Of this , there were 1,327 Demeter - certified farms on more than 53,000 hectares ; Brandenburg alone boasts 25 farms .
The Hof Marienhöhe ’s 100 hectares of usable farmland ( the other half of its 200 total hectares is forest ) make it a relatively midsize operation .
Compared with the amount of land farmed organically , the Demeter slice of the ‘ all - natural ’ pie is a thin one , partly because of the standards required by the German certification organization , Demeter e.V. : it is the most rigorous organic certification in the world .
The Demeter philosophy first took root in the early 1920s .
It sprang from a series of lectures on agricultural practice by Rudolf Steiner , the early 20th century Swiss philosopher / scientist / theologian best known for founding the Waldorf Schools .
These lectures were described in 1923 by one particularly ardent Steiner acolyte as having “ such germinal potency [ … ] that a few sentences or a short paragraph often sufficed to create the foundation for a farmer ’s or scientist ’s whole life - work . ”
Today , there are 16 Demeter member organizations in countries around the world .
Sigmar Goldhammer , one of the directors of the Hof Marienhöhe , generously took it upon himself to show us his farm .
He ’s a middle - aged German with the tanned , weather - worn face and garb ( sturdy boots and a strong windbreaker ) of a man who has spent the last 20 years of his life working those 100 hectares of land .
On our tour , we learn that the farm ’s operations have remained essentially unchanged since its founding by Dr. Erhard Bartsch , a student of Steiner ’s , in 1928 .
The tumults of recent German history have resulted in only minor disruptions for Hof Marionhöhe : the Nazis shut down the farm ’s self - published newsletter in the 1930s , but left the operation of the farm intact throughout World War II .
By using his Austrian citizenship to emigrate – which turned his land into foreign , privately - owned territory , and thus saved it from the collectivization forced upon other East German farms - Bartsch managed to maintain Marienhöhe ’s exceptional structure in the GDR era as well .
Today the farm continues , as it always has , to breed cows for milk and cheese , and pigs for slaughter ; it also grows produce and grain for the consumption of humans and livestock .
The cows ’ milk is made into a wide variety of cheeses at the onsite dairy , and the bakery produces fresh loaves of bread from the farm ’s own oats , barley and wheat .
Alongside these homemade delicacies , a seasonal plethora of fruit and vegetables ( carrots , potatoes , apples , pears , peaches and plums , among others ) , as well as locally - sourced honey , are all sold at the farm store .
“ People come from all over the region for our products - some from as far away as Berlin , ” notes Goldhammer .
The farm also sells its products in various farmers ’ markets in Berlin , and across Brandenburg .
Goldhammer explains the unseasonable blooms and the cows ’ unusual coats : the cows - like all the farm ’s animals - are bred “ from old breeds of livestock that were threatened with extinction ” .
They are healthily fed on hay dried from the farm ’s blooming fields of grass , whose flowers endure the bitter north German winter because of the chemical composition of the soil .
This , in turn , is due to the fields ’ complex fertilization system - in which the cows ’ manure plays an integral role .
This self - contained , interconnected cycle of materials is a key aspect of the Demeter philosophy : its followers see a farm as a “ living organism ” .
And the first priority is nature .
As Goldhammer explains , “ For us , the bottom line is to give back to the land . ”
The simplistic beauty of this self - sustaining system of cultivation is again reflected in the farm ’s communal structure : a total of 35 people reside there – a number that includes everyone from school - age children to retirees as old as 95 .
“ It ’s important for us to be a community , that the people who worked here their whole lives are able to spend their last years here .
There are also lots of children , as well as trainees and interns , ” Goldhammer says .
The core workforce comprises 15 people ; the others are members of its tight - knit community .
When asked why he ’s chosen such a line of work , Goldhammer answers , “ Culture , in the largest sense of the word .
We ’re here to establish a cultural impetus , to shape the cultivation of the land , as well as to cultivate a social culture around that - a more humane culture . ”
This ethos is evident in all aspects of life at Marienhöhe , from the cultivation of the land and animals to the way administrative decisions are made to the economic side of things .
Everything is treated holistically .
“ We want to give future generations this land for them to sustain , which will in turn sustain them . ”
For the farmers at Marienhöhe , their work is also about demonstrating that there ’s a modern way to live off the land , one that goes beyond profit and prejudices .
“ Berliners dismiss all of this as ‘ JWD ’ [ Janz weit draußen , or “ faraway outdoors ” ] .
They have no idea , ” Goldhammer laments .
So , despite the lack of money - the farm is hoping to fund badly - needed repairs to its cow barn with customer donations - he and his colleagues are staying strong .
“ It ’s all about a different culture , a culture we believe in and we want to spread further .
That ’s what is important to me ; that ’s what I want to do . ”
Australia has pulled out of the race to stage the 2018 World Cup and will instead target the 2022 tournament .
" We have been in discussion with FIFA for months and it is that trusting relationship with the leadership of the governing body that has caused us to focus on 2022 and decide to leave the field for 2018 to European contenders , " said Frank Lowy , the head of the Australian football federation ( FFA ) .

The decision was taken after lengthy discussions between the FFA and FIFA .
Australia 's decision to withdraw its candidacy leaves the Holland - Belgium , Spain - Portugal joint bids as well as the United States , England and Russia as the 2018 contenders .
Nokia 's new N8 is the company 's flagship media phone , the first phone with the Symbian ^3 operating system , and it'll probably be the USA 's first 12 - megapixel camera phone when it arrives here later this year .
But in a demo today , I came away as much frustrated as intrigued - because while Nokia can build beautiful hardware , they have n't closed the gap on experiences .
Nokia 's new N8 is the company 's flagship media phone , the first phone with the Symbian ^3 operating system , and it'll probably be the USA 's first 12 - megapixel camera phone when it arrives here later this year .
But in a demo today , I came away as much frustrated as intrigued - because while Nokia can build beautiful hardware , they have n't closed the gap on experiences .
Here 's the difference between hardware and experience .
The N8's hardware plays high - definition " Tron Legacy " trailers in full Dolby surround sound on a high - def TV using an included HDMI adapter .
Bravo !
But when I asked exactly where one could legally get high - def content to play on the phone , Nokia reps hemmed and hawed .
Similarly , while the N8 is one of the first phones to support both AT&T and T - Mobile 's 3G networks , the phone will be available " through the usual N - series channels , " according to a Nokia rep .
That means it wo n't appear on T - Mobile or AT&T store shelves , and it wo n't get the critical carrier subsidies that make phones affordable for consumers .
That 's a pity , as the N8 has a lot going for it from the hardware perspective .
The phone is made of smooth , cool metal and glass , with a sharp 3.5 - inch , 640 - by - 360 capacitive touch screen .
The Symbian^3 OS felt sluggish on the demo unit , but I would n't draw conclusions from that - I was dealing with a prototype .
Front and back cameras make Internet video calling possible - that is , if there 's software for it , which Nokia could n't guarantee .
( There 's that experience problem again . )
The 12 - megapixel camera on the back took somewhat soft photos in the demo I saw , but the huge resolution will make up for many sins .
The camera captures 720p HD video , too .
The phone 's browser has Flash Lite 4 to show many Flash sites , and the free Ovi Maps Navigation GPS program looked good on the big screen .
Unlike on the , it uses AGPS to find your location when it can't see satellites .
A new app called " Web TV " offers up various live , international , streaming TV channels on the phone .
The phone not only connected to an HDTV , it connects to USB drives to copy files to and from the phone .
That 's really neat .
But the big question around the N8 is whether it can match the integrated experiences found on the , and the like .
Apple 's phone will come with one - touch video conferencing and an easy way to buy movies .
HTC's Android phone has an even bigger screen than the N8 and a richer array of apps in the Android Market than you can find in Nokia 's Ovi Store .
Both phones are available from thousands of brick - and - mortar stores around the country , at discounted prices .
We 'll see when we review the Nokia N8 around its launch time , during the third quarter of this year .
Nokia has n't announced a price .
What happens to the people who unwittingly find themselves at the centre of a media scrum ?
From the blogger who inspired a " web hate frenzy " to the Glasgow baggage handler who thwarted a terrorist attack , five people talk about fleeting fame and what happens when the spotlight is turned off
Michelle Dewberry won The Apprentice in 2006 .
She became a fixture in the tabloids after she discussed growing up in care and the violent death of her sister , as well as revealing her relationship with fellow contestant Syed Ahmed
If you want a job , you go to the appointments section of a newspaper , but what I wanted was an experience .
The media attention following The Apprentice took everyone by surprise , so there was no thought of preparing us for it .
When you go on a reality TV show today , contestants expect a certain level of intrusion , but I really had no idea it would be like this .
I was quite naive , but I can't complain .
It opens doors – I can get business meetings with whoever I want , and I wrote my book , Anything is Possible , which I 'd always wanted to do .
I found it difficult at first .
Once , a journalist asked me a question I did n't want to answer , and I said : " Is that really your business ? "
And he replied : " I think you 'll find it 's the nation 's business . "
When I reflect on it , I think he was probably right .
I do n't think celebrities should be able to say they can only be photographed when they 're promoting their perfume line .
You become a brand .
You can't put yourself on a public platform and then try to keep things private .
It 's impossible .
Syed was a fellow contestant , so when I had a relationship with him and then lost his baby , people saw it as a natural extension of the story they 'd seen unfolding on telly .
I had days where the media intrusion was very upsetting .
It did n't make me angry , but it made me quite scared , and having to go through these traumatic things in public increased the feelings 10 - millionfold .
I used to have days where I did n't want to get out of bed , let alone read what the papers were saying about me .
The most difficult thing for me in all of this was that people I felt close to betrayed me , selling stories .
Someone told the papers about my miscarriage .
It broke my heart .
I never found out who it was , but I became suspicious , which led to frictions in my relationships .
I was feeling emotional , but did n't know who I could confide in , and for a long period I could n't trust people .
I still question why people want to be my friend .
While I have lost friendships though , the remaining ones have become stronger as a result .
When my sister passed away just after my 17th birthday , I made a commitment to her memory that I 'd live a life that was enough for two , to do things that were extraordinary .
The baby and the show are intrinsically linked for me , and as a whole the experience ticks the extraordinary box .
It 's made me more balanced , certainly .
Before the show I was a crazy powerhouse .
The baby made me reflect on what 's important .
Now I 'd choose happiness over riches , which sounds so obvious , but it was the opposite of my earlier mentality .
I worked for Sir Alan for four months after the show , but the great thing to come out of it is that I now get paid to inspire people , which is unbelievable .
I 've developed a programme for schools , teaching self - empowerment .
It sounds dead cheesy , but the feeling I get from that is bloody brilliant .
It 's not about blagging free nail varnish , it 's about putting my profile to good use .
And on a business level I 've built an amazing network of people who support and advise me , and I feel really blessed by that .
This morning , crossing the road , I narrowly avoided being hit by a bus , but the chap next to me was knocked down .
It was awful .
But it made me think about how I 'd like to be remembered .
I 'd like someone to go to my family and say I 'd helped them .
Let 's face it : in my life I 've experienced domestic violence , my sister dying , my mum having brain surgery , I 've lived in social care , I 've dropped out of school , been in abusive relationships – and I think : if I can get over that then anyone can .
When things were written about my family and personal life , I eventually came to the realisation that it must have helped people who identified with my situation – that 's my life , and I 'm not ashamed of it .
The Apprentice was part of the pact I made for my sister .
So when there were tragedies , like losing my baby , I had to keep going , in the spotlight .
I would n't wish that on my worst enemy but there was a point to it , a reason .
Life 's too short to be angry .
Cai Yuan and Jian Jun ( JJ ) Xi gained fame and notoriety in 1999 after jumping on Tracey Emin 's Turner Prize - shortlisted My Bed at Tate Britain in London .
One year later , they returned to perform a further work – urinating on Marcel Duchamp 's urinal sculpture .
They continue to collaborate , and are based in Oxford and China .
Cai Yuan recalls what happened
It was pretty much a snap decision for us – we had only planned it two days before .
JJ and I had two motivations : we wanted to produce a work of art and we wanted to publicly criticise the art establishment .
It was our manifesto piece .
I remember the police arriving .
They took us to Belgravia Police Station where we were questioned and checked over by doctors , as the security guards at the Tate had been somewhat heavy - handed with us , and we were told that we might be charged with criminal damage .
The White Cube gallery [ Emin 's dealer ] and the Tate were contacted , and when they decided not to press charges we were released .
I did n't feel relief when we were released – I felt nothing .
Relief had come to me earlier , when we were performing our piece on the bed .
The media attention worked in our favour .
We were approached by several galleries to show our work .
We were also invited to give lectures at art schools such as Goldsmiths .
Tate Modern – which initially banned us – invited us back to show our work and to give talks in 2007 and 2009 .
Our act gave us a name and credibility .
Our work was n't simply a reaction to Tracey 's piece – what we did represented the struggle of a Chinese artist living in Britain .
My life was totally changed by the experience .
It changed my way of thinking and my practice as an artist .
It freed me from my thoughts on the art establishment and from material culture .
As an art student you are taught that becoming a great artist will enable you to sell your work in a gallery .
In reality it 's not true .
The experience also gave me a bigger imagination – now I feel the world is my stage .
I do n't have to worry about whether a museum or a gallery will show my work .
I 'm currently performing my One Man Demo – 100 days of performance at various locations in Oxford – and it 's going very well .
We never heard from Tracey , but I read her reactions in the newspapers and interviews .
I think she regarded us as terrorists .
It made me laugh – I thought her anger revealed more about her somewhat limited understanding of art than anything else .
I am very , very happy with what we did .
And I believe it is our best work to date , but there is always more to come .
The only thing I 'm unhappy about is that our act was not recognised as a piece of art in itself by the public .
To me , art is not about money – I do n't just want to create objects that sell .
Art is a tool to make political statements – in many ways it 's almost shameful to ask for money in return .
John Smeaton , a baggage handler , became an international hero when he helped thwart the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport in June 2007 .
His much repeated quote , " Do n't come to Glasgow – we 'll set aboot you " became an internet phenomenon and that year the accolades he received included the Queen 's Gallantry Medal and being voted third most eligible male in Scotland

Dealing with the media was one of the scariest things that ever happened to me .
I said my piece after the attack and thought that would be the end of it .
I could n't believe what happened – I was on front pages around the world .
There are some things I 'll always hold dearly from that time .
I 've been a Rangers fan since I was knee - high to a grasshopper and the team asked if they could introduce me to the supporters , so I lived that dream of walking out at Ibrox Park and having the whole place shout my name .
I also met Gordon Brown and that made a massive impression on me .
I worked at the airport for six months after the attack and that kept my feet on the ground .
The first day back my mate said : " All right , get your backside over there and lift some bags . "
I knew my place .
In September 2007 I was invited to New York to the 9/11 ceremony , and that opened my eyes to the world .
I met the most inspirational men in my life , and I met my wife , Christy .
All the firefighters who'd been lost , 343 in one day : that humbled me .
That is unimaginable .
While I was there I also went to a Scottish American Society function .
Christy walked in that night in a Scotland top and it was love at first sight for me .
I 'm 33 now , I 'd never even been on holiday during my 20s , and going to America was like walking on to a movie set .
I realised that life 's not just going down the pub and having a fag .
I wanted to try other things .
I went back to college in 2008 so I could further myself .
I studied for a national certificate in fishery studies and absolutely loved it – fish farming is my passion in life .
One morning while I was there I woke up and I did n't feel great .
I 'm asthmatic and I was a heavy smoker and my chest felt tight , so I drove home to Erskine to be with my mum and dad .
That evening I could n't breathe .
I asked my mum to call an ambulance .
The ambulance was there in eight minutes , and they got me to hospital and into intensive care and on to a ventilator .
But I kept getting worse : one lung collapsed and my kidneys were failing .
They managed to stabilise me and I woke from a coma 12 days later .
It made me realise I 'm lucky to be on the planet , and I keep that with me every day .
I did a show at the Edinburgh Festival in 2009 and I also stood as an independent candidate in the Glasgow North East by - election .
It did n't come off , but I learnt an awful lot from it .
I felt if you want to comment on things , if you talk the talk , you should walk the walk .
But I realised I was good at talking and not good at walking .
If I want to have my say I 've got my column in the Scottish Sun for that .
Rachael Fountain , a call - centre employee , found herself in the public eye in 2002 when she sent an email invitation for a " porno " - themed party to friends , accidentally inviting the finance director at American Express , her employer , and was promptly sacked
The day I got sacked , I went on a Brighton online forum to have a whinge about my day .
A local journalist picked up on what I 'd written and asked if he could interview me for a story .
It appeared on the front page of the Argus the next day .
The Evening Standard ran a story that evening , and the day after that I got a phone call from the News of the World , which offered me £ 3,000 for an exclusive .
They put my boyfriend and me up in the Hilton .
Part of the deal I struck with them was to pose for a series of photographs , the first photoshoot I 'd ever done , in my underwear .
It all happened within two days , and was head - turning , to say the least .
I was fine with all the press attention and I learnt a lot from the experience about effectively becoming public property .
The Sunday Sport ran my story , publishing a copy of the invitation in its entirety .
All my personal information , including my mobile phone number , appeared in the paper .
I got quite a few prank phone calls .
When I tried to get in touch with the Sunday Sport for an apology , they were n't interested .
The story in the News of the World was never published , but the photoshoot I did with them , in a way , was the catalyst for my future career choices .
The experience kicked me out of the frying pan , and it turns out the fire was n't so bad .
Within two weeks of losing my job I 'd signed up to a course to become an outdoor - pursuits instructor , and within six months I was qualified to teach survival skills , archery , climbing and kayaking .
After that I fell into promotional work and ended up working for a club in Brighton that wanted to take on Torture Garden , the world 's largest fetish club night .
It was a great experience , working with all the misfits of society , and I became a fetish model , too .
I 'd always wanted to be a dancer , but was never quite sure how to make that leap .
In 2004 I was spotted by some dancers at a festival – I was there as a punter , but they thought I looked amazing and asked if I wanted to be a showgirl , and the next thing I knew I was in a cancan troupe .
From there I moved into what is my real love : burlesque dancing .
My first burlesque performance was in front of an audience of 10,000 in Spain .
Since then I 've travelled the world , and I 'm now living in Chamonix .
I have no regrets about what happened at AmEx .
I remember once that I 'd told my supervisor that I felt like " just a number " .
She laughed at me and said : " Of course you 're just a number – you work in a bloody call centre . "
There 's still lots of things I want to do – I 'd like to travel more , I want to get into theatre production , and I 'd like to get better at knife - throwing – but overall I 'm very happy .
Andrew Carey became a regular on Chris Evans 's Channel 4 talk show TFI Friday , appearing as Andrew the Barman in every episode from 1996 - 2000 .
He was also the landlord of Evans 's local , the Haverstock Arms , in Belsize Park

The Havers is a famous pub in a famous area and famous people used to come in .
I always find out who they are , what they are and if they live locally .
Chris had an effect on the pub from the days when he was a radio presenter on GLR .
He used to finish his show at 1 pm on the Saturday by saying he was going to the Havers if anyone wanted to come in to buy him a pint .
I 'd got friendly with Chris and Danny Baker before TFI , and I used to go and watch the mocks of the show .
It was n't working and they invited a guy in to redesign the set .
They came into the pub with a cardboard box and used one of the tables to look at the set model .
They were chatting away for hours and I served drinks , then Chris says : " We 've got it .
There 's going to be an upstairs bar and we want someone to run it .
Do you want the job ? "
Yes , please .
I never had to physically work the bar ; I controlled it , like a manager .
Andrew the Barman was a break from what I was doing .
Even when I got out of my car at Riverside Studios [ where the show was filmed ] , people would ask for autographs .
I 've been recognised in Spain , France and up and down the UK , and once in New York on St Patrick 's Day I ended up having to pull a pint in a bar off Fifth Avenue because I 'd been spotted .
It was unbelievable how many people recognised me .
Even now , 14 years down the line , they do a double - take .
One of the nicest people I met was Paul McCartney .
They brought some clothes down from the Cavern for me to wear on the show and he autographed my tie .
Michael Hutchence was lovely and Robbie Williams was my idol .
In the end , though , it was five years down the line and I was still behind that blinkin ' bar .
I was getting bored .
I wonder how these boys and girls in Coronation Street do when they 're on there for a bloody lifetime .
I do n't miss the TFI days – as far as I 'm concerned it was great while it lasted , but it had run its course .
We got loads of phone calls when Chris 's friend and the landlord of his new local died in a yachting accident in 2002 – that was a shock : everyone thought it was me .
But I do n't see Chris now he lives down in Surrey , he 's overdue a visit .
I 've had a great life : the pub trade has been good to me and I have done a lot for charity over the years , giving a little back .
I own the Havers now and I 'm hoping my son will take over the business and give father a quieter life .
I hope to retire , but I 've bought a house two doors away , so even if I 'm on a Zimmer frame I 'll be able to make it in .

On Valentine 's Day 2008 , aged 19 , I set off to travel India on my own .
As we refuelled at Dubai airport , I turned my mobile on and it did n't stop beeping and buzzing throughout the entire two - hour stopover .
I was at the centre of an online furore that would be discussed on the BBC and across the international media .
A friend recently gave me an A - board newsagent sign that reads - GAP YEAR BLOGGER SPARKS WEB HATE FRENZY .
It sums up what happened perfectly .
What had sparked that frenzy was a 500 - word blog I wrote for the Guardian travel website .
In the space of 24 hours , it became one of the most controversial and highest hit blogs in the history of e-journalism .
I was pilloried for a number of reasons .
First , I was nineteen , a junior writer on Skins and had written a ' Skinsy ' piece on the wrong platform .
Admittedly , it was cocky and provocative , not a piece of writing I was ever necessarily proud of but getting round the cliché of a middle - class kid heading to India on his gap year was never going to be easy .
Second , someone had discovered my dad had contributed a handful of travel features to the Guardian and this sparked accusations of nepotism , even inciting one person to put my name next to Kim Jong - Il under the ' nepotism ' pages of Wikipedia .
Third , in keeping with British lynching etiquette , class was brought into the equation .
I became the posterboy for the dumb , debauched gap - year culture that my pampered , privileged generation were enjoying .
The internet warriors , whose thread ran long and red on the message board , no doubt claimed victory when my second blog did n't appear the following week .
The Guardian was in fact keen for me to continue and other offers of work flooded in because of the blog 's notoriety .
As soon as I realised the extent of the hate , however , I decided nothing good could come from keeping it going so I bowed out , tail firmly between legs , and tried to get on with travelling India .
It took three months ' travelling to replace the relentless belly - fear that was the legacy of my blog .
Fortunately I was falling in love with India .
Meeting so many people who gave me so much and had so little , together with a clearer picture of the absurdity of the blog aftermath , started clearing my head .
The fact that something I spent an hour or so writing had caused such a controversy alerted me to the darker traits in web culture , and of course , my own naivety .
My dad had an email from a woman with two grown - up children who said she hoped I would die , ( which he only told me about recently ) .
That was as bad as it got .
My decision not to waste days in Internet café's on Google helped take my mind off the hatred for increasingly longer periods each day .
Like most of my generation , I grew up with the web .
For ' screenagers ' it is the tool of choice for information , entertainment and communication .
And perhaps that is part of the problem .
It is the easiest place on earth to be listened to and therefore it is a perfect platform for those who feel cheated to have a voice .
This virtual whirlwind – one that will be stored forever – changed my relationship with the net .
Seeing travellers more engrossed in their Blackberry than the sights and smells of India , or others come alive when ducking into an internet café , took on a deeper meaning .
I felt the crushing force of the Age of Impersonality and disliked having a persona out there that I felt did n't belong to me .
Looking back , India was the best place I could have been to deal with it all .
It was probably harder for my hooked - up friends and family back home .
For a while I hated the internet .
Ironically , on my return to the UK I won a BAFTA for work I wrote for Skins that went out live on that very medium !
The BAFTA feting was as absurd as the blog carnage and somewhere in between I had to find a real perspective on myself .
I was n't the greatest writer in the world but neither was I the worst .
Since the blog and the BAFTA , I have tried to restore some normality in my relationship with the media , engaging with it in different ways .
I needed to take back some control .
There was a part of me that wanted to answer all those critics .
I would go on lengthy rants in my India journal about how I did not go to private school , how I was not wearing skinny bloody jeans in India , how I was not getting the trip paid for by the Guardian or my parents .
But I realised none of these answers mattered .
The mob had written the ' Max Gogarty ' script and it had already aired .
Of course it continues to niggle away at me .
No one wants to be hated .
But I do realise that the impersonality of the internet made me a perfect repository for the loathing of both gap - year culture and indeed the middle classes .
I think that the gap year , or ' gap yah ' as the brilliant YouTube viral has renamed it , is not such a bad thing .
In the flat I share at university , I have a friend who drove from London to Mongolia for charity , another who spent two months in the Israeli army and another who spent the year running a school in Zimbabwe .
I meet a lot of people who got pissed in Thailand too , but even they have some funny stories to tell .
The tales and ideas that circulate our house every night are often thanks to the ' gap yah ' .
A new form of cultural imperialism it may be , but better to travel ethically and sensitively than sit around playing Gears of War all year or shooting down people on the Internet , no ?
Since the blog , I 've gone to university , written a couple of short films , worked with some independent production companies and am trying to write a novel .
I hope that I am pursuing a sensible apprenticeship as a writer and filmmaker .
I have returned to India twice , saving any surplus money for cheap flights back to where I feel happy and productive .
Perhaps the whole thing has stunted my career , made me less proactive and willing to put myself out there .
But I hope it 's made me a stronger person .
My favourite extract from my journal is when , after days of depression , I wrote in an inexplicable moment of elation on a sleeper bus that amongst all the real friendships I had made on the road I felt I had also managed to make friends with myself .
That is without doubt the best outcome of the whole episode .
Perhaps the response from this article will set me back again and no one will hear from me for another two years .
If so , you 'll know where to find me .
Israel 's secretive nuclear activities may undergo unprecedented scrutiny next month , with a key meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency tentatively set to focus on the topic for the first time , according to documents shared Friday with The Associated Press .
A copy of the restricted provisional agenda of the IAEA 's June 7 board meeting lists Israeli nuclear capabilities as the eighth item - the first time that that the agency 's decision - making body is being asked to deal with the issue in its 52 years of existence .
The agenda can still undergo changes in the month before the start of the meeting and a senior diplomat from a board member nation said the item , included on Arab request , could be struck if the U.S. and other Israeli allies mount strong opposition .
He asked for anonymity for discussing a confidential matter .
Even if dropped from the final agenda , however , its inclusion in the May 7 draft made available to The AP is significant , reflecting the success of Islamic nations in giving concerns about Israel 's unacknowledged nuclear arsenal increased prominence .
The 35 - nation IAEA board is the agency 's decision making body and can refer proliferation concerns to the UN Security Council - as it did with Iran in 2006 after Tehran resumed uranium enrichment , a potential pathway to nuclear weapons .
A decision to keep the item would be a slap in the face not only for Israel but also for Washington and its Western allies , which support the Jewish state and view Iran as the greatest nuclear threat to the Middle East .
Iran - and more recently Syria - have been the focus of past board meetings ;
Tehran for its refusal to freeze enrichment and for stonewalling IAEA efforts to probe alleged nuclear weapons experiments , and Damascus for blocking agency experts from revisiting a site struck by Israeli jets on suspicion it was a nearly finished plutonium producing reactor .
Iran and Syria are regular agenda items at board meetings .
Elevating Israel to that status would detract from Western attempts to keep the heat on Tehran and Damascus and split the board even further - developing nations at board meetings are generally supportive of Iran and Syria and hostile to Israel .
That in turn could stifle recent resolve by the world 's five recognized nuclear - weapons powers - the U.S. , Russia , Britain , France and China - to take a more active role in reaching the goal of a nuclear - free Middle East .
Inclusion of the item appeared to be the result of a push by the 18 - nation Arab group of IAEA member nations , which last year successfully lobbied another agency meeting - its annual conference - to pass a resolution directly criticizing Israel and its atomic program .
Unlike the board , the conference cannot make policy .
Still , the result was a setback not only for Israel but also for Washington and other backers of the Jewish state , which had lobbied for 18 years of past practice - debate on the issue without a vote .
A letter to IAEA chief Yukiya Amano by the Arab group that was also shared with the AP urged Amano to report to the board what was known about Israel 's nuclear program by including a list of the information available to the Agency and the information which it can gather from open sources .
The April 23 Arab letter urged Amano to enforce the conference resolution calling on Israel to allow IAEA inspections of its nuclear facilities .
Israel has never said it has nuclear weapons but is universally believed to possess them .
The latest pressure is putting the Jewish state in an uncomfortable position .
It wants the international community to take stern action to prevent Iran from getting atomic weapons but at the same time brushes off calls to come clean about its own nuclear capabilities .
Additionally , Amano , in a letter obtained Wednesday by the AP , has asked foreign ministers of the agency 's 151 member states for proposals on how to persuade Israel to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty .
Egypt has proposed that a Nonproliferation Treaty conference now meeting at UN headquarters in New York back a plan calling for the start of negotiations next year on a Mideast free of nuclear arms .
The U.S. has cautiously supported the idea while saying that implementing it must wait for progress in the Middle East peace process .
Israel also says a comprehensive Middle East peace settlement must come first .
Still , Washington and the four other nuclear weapons countries recognized as such under the Nonproliferation Treaty appear to be ready to move from passive support to a more active role .
In her speech to the UN nuclear conference on Monday , U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said Washington would support practical measures for moving toward that objective .
Washington also has been discussing it with the Israelis , said a Western diplomatic source , who asked for anonymity since he was discussing other countries ' contacts .
Russian arms negotiator Anatoly I. Antonov , speaking on behalf of the five Nonproliferation Treaty nuclear powers , said these nations were committed to full implementation of a Middle East nuclear free zone .
By Patrick Bond , Durban
June 25 , 2010 -- South Africa 's soccer - loving critics have long predicted the problems now growing worse here because of its World Cup hosting duties :
loss of large chunks of government ’s sovereignty to the world soccer body FIFA ;
rapidly worsening income inequality ;
future economic calamities as debt payments come due ;
dramatic increases in greenhouse gas emissions ( more than twice Germany ’s in 2006 ) ; and
humiliation and despondency as the country ’s soccer team Bafana Bafana ( ranked # 90 going into the games ) became the first host to expire before the competition ’s second round .
Soon , it seems , we may also add to this list a problem that terrifies progressives here and everywhere : another dose of xenophobia from both state and society .
The crucial question in coming weeks is whether , instead of offering some kind of resistance from below , as exemplified by the Durban Social Forum network ’s 1000 - strong rally against FIFA on June 16 at City Hall , Durban , will society ’s sore losers adopt right - wing populist sentiments , and frame the foreigner ?
This is not an idle concern , as the FaceBook pages of hip , young Johannesburg gangstas exploded with xenophobic raves after Uruguay beat Bafana last week .
Wrote one young punk , Khavi Mavodze , “ Foreigners leave our country , be warned , xenophobia is our first name . ”
Even the ordinarily defensive African National Congress national executive committee and the South African cabinet have both recently expressed concern about a potential repeat of the May 2008 violence that left 62 people dead and more than a 100,000 displaced .
This at least is progress , for 30 months ago the Africa Peer Review Mechanism panel of eminent persons issued a warning that went unheeded : “ Xenophobia against other Africans is currently on the rise and must be nipped in the bud . ”
The then notoriously out - of - touch president of South Africa , Thabo Mbeki , replied that this was “ simply not true ” , and after the xenophobia calamity began six months later , deputy foreign minister Aziz Pahad called it “ a totally unexpected phenomenon ” -- notwithstanding dozens of prior incidents .
So when current president Jacob Zuma told his party executive in May that the “ branches of the ANC must start working now to deal with the issue of xenophobia ” , it was depressing when another politician combined denialism and stereotyping .
Replying that there “ is no tangible evidence ” , police general Bheki Cele added , a few days later : “ We have observed a trend where foreigners commit crime -- taking advantage of the fact that we have an unacceptable crime level -- to tarnish our credibility and image . ”
Generalisations against " foreigners " as prolific perpetrators of crime are baseless , as no scientific " trend " can be discerned because no reliable data exist to confirm whether immigrant tsotsis ( thugs ) represent a greater ratio of their numbers than indigenous tsotsis .
( We do n’t even know roughly , to the 500 000th , how many immigrants there are in South Africa , because of the porous borders . )
Cele ’s fingerpointing at immigrants for crime is just one of the scapegoat strategies .
The Consortium for Refugees and Migrants in South Africa this week called xenophobia a " credible threat " in part because “ some perpetrators appear to believe they have the tacit support of local political actors ” .
Root causes
In addition to increasing its moral suasion , prosecuting those guilty of xenophobic attacks , resolving local leadership turf battles that have xenophobic powerplays , and establishing emergency response mechanisms , the state has an obligation to address root causes for the social stress which is often expressed as xenophobia : mass unemployment , housing shortages , intense competition in townships among shopkeepers and South Africa ’s regional geopolitical interests , which create more refugees than prosperity .
The state wo n’t tackle these root - cause problems , however , because making substantive progress would probably throw into question class relations and the mode of production itself .
To illustrate , if observers believed ( as did I ) that the replacement of Mbeki with Zuma in September 2008 might mean a change in Pretoria ’s foreign policy so as to end the nurturing of Robert Mugabe ’s Zimbabwe repression , then that was naïve , as Zuma showed in London by lobbying hard for an end to smart sanctions against Mugabe ’s Zimbabwe African National Union - Pariotic Front ( ZANU - PF ) ruling elite a few weeks ago .
South Africa ’s post - apartheid leaders are simply unwilling to reverse a 120 - year - old structural relationship of exploitation , by which Johannesburg - based companies – such as those involved in eastern Zimbabwe ’s bloody Marange diamond fields , controlled by Mugabe ’s army – rip - off the region ’s resources .
Marange is the world ’s largest diamond find since Kimberley , South Africa in 1867 .
How does this work ?
Consider the case of a victim of elite South Africa - Zimbabwe minerals - extraction collusion , the courageous civil society researcher Farai Maguwu ( a former student of mine at Africa University ) .
Maguwu was jailed on June 3 because , according to his ( ordinarily very reliable ) account , a South African named Abbey Chikane set him up for an arrest and maltreatment by Mugabe ’s police .
Chikane is a leading officer of the Kimberley Process , a deal cut exactly a decade ago between industry , government and international civil society watchdogs , meant to halt trade in blood diamonds .
The sign - on by the monopolist DeBeers was crucial , for the formerly South African company ( now London - based ) needed to deal with the growing global diamond glut and to restore some public relations after a gloomy period .
In a hotel room in the eastern Zimbabwe city of Mutare on May 25 , Maguwu provided Chikane information about hundreds of murders at Marange since 2006 , at the hands of Mugabe ’s army .
Instead of using the information to write a critique of Marange , Chikane turned out to be a narc , reporting Maguwu to the Zimbabwe police .
When cops drove up to his modest house the next day , Maguwu went underground .
During the search , the police beat and tortured family members , leading Maguwu to surrender .
After a week in prison , he was hospitalised on June 18 due to maltreatment , and then was denied bail by a pro-Mugabe judge .
` Resource curse ' and collusion with Israel
There ’s a great deal at stake in this story , emblematic of so many aspects of Africa ’s " resource curse " corruption and poverty .
The Zimbabwe army leadership ’s inflow of illicit diamond funding ( via Dubai , where the Kimberley Process is apparently ignored ) represents the prime source for its own embourgeoisement , as well as for waging Zimbabwe ’s next national election campaign .
( Looting state resources is much harder for Mugabe ’s gang since January 2009 , when Zimbabwe lost its currency and with it , the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe ’s money - printing , hyper - inflationary , crony - capitalist patronage . )
Chikane soon issued an official report finding that Marange complies with international diamond trading guidelines , leading this week ’s Kimberley Process meeting in Tel Aviv to deadlock over whether to continue excluding Zimbabwe .
Because of its cutting industry and the threat of boycotts , divestment and sanctions , Israel has become a strong supporter of Zimbabwe ’s , insisting that Marange stones not be labelled blood diamonds .
According to the respected newspaper The Zimbabwean , several South African mining houses will benefit if Chikane ’s whitewash continues , including his cousin Kagiso Chikane ’s African Renaissance Holdings and black tycoon Patrice Matsepe ’s African Rainbow Minerals – with whom his brother Frank Chikane ( formerly a leading anti-apartheid cleric ) works – as well as two financiers supporting Johannesburg diamond miner Reclam : Capital Works and Old Mutual .
Abbey Chikane has , in the process , wrecked the Kimberley Process ’s reputation for monitoring blood diamonds in the same way that Mbeki - Zuma soiled Pretoria ’s when it comes to justice and democracy for wretched Zimbabwe .
The last decade has witnessed a variety of similar betrayals of their people by the South Africa and Zimbabwe elites .
Zimbabwe refugees in South Africa
Given such relationships , it ’s not surprising that the UN High Commissioner for Refugees last week reported that there are 158,200 Zimbabweans currently seeking formal asylum internationally , of whom 90 per cent are in South Africa .
( That ’s more than three times as many as the second - place country , Burma , which was followed by two Washington - backed regimes : Afghanistan and Colombia . )
There are at least a couple million Zimbabweans in South Africa , many illegal as low - waged but often highly skilled workers , who regularly come under intense pressure from the unemployed locals .
A genuine solution to workers ’ plight across the region would include not only a reversal of Pretoria ’s geopolitical approach , but also its macroeconomic policies .
( Statistics South Africa announced last week that another 79,000 jobs were lost in the most recent quarter - year , bringing to nearly a million those shed since the world crisis hit hard in 2008 . )
Home affairs minister Nkosazana Dlamini - Zuma did make some concessions for Zimbabweans , allowing a somewhat longer stay in the country and work permits ( so as to better collect taxes ) , but at the same time radically reduced the inflow from Lesotho to South Africa , even though a large share of Lesotho ’s GDP comes from migrant workers .
Real criminals
If South African police chief Cele was actually serious about foreign criminals he might concentrate a bit more of his force ’s effort on a really dangerous crew : FIFA .
With the possible exception of Wall Street and the City of London , no more larcenous gangs of white - collar thugs are to be found than in Zurich , both in the banks which financed apartheid when no one else would , and at the soccer body ’s temporary hideout south of Johannesburg .
The latter mafia is so self - confident in dealing with General Cele ’s mentally corrupted South African Police Service that on June 18 , FIFA general secretary Jerome Valcke openly bragged how they will spirit away US $ 3.2 billion in pure profit ( 50 % more than the $ 1.8 billion taken from Germany four years ago ) .
FIFA pays no taxes , ignores exchange controls , and is quite likely preparing South Africa for a currency crash in the process .
To ensure the heist is complete , Cele ’s police are obviously on the take , observers confidently conclude -- but not because there ’s evidence of FIFA ’s fabled fraud squad at work .
No , just as debilitating is the above - board commercial , contractual corruption in evidence these past few days .
In the service of the main company providing security at the World Cup games , Stallion -- a firm which should have been banned last year , as promised by labour minister Shepherd Mdladlana , and which in 2001 was responsible for a soccer stampeded in Johannesburg that left more than 40 fans dead -- the police enforced Stallion ’s exploitative low - wage regime , heaving stun grenades and tear gas at hundreds of unpaid workers after a night game in Durban , and even shooting a Cape Town bystander multiple times with rubber bullets in similar confrontations ;
No wonder , because Linda Mti – the former prisons commissioner linked financially to the notorious , privatised Lindela transit camp for arrested immigrants ( as well as a triple arrestee on drunk driving charges ) -- is head of security for FIFA ’s Local Organising Committee ;
Defending that pissy US beer Budweiser , the police were again at FIFA ’s service when they arrested two Dutchwomen during the Holland - Denmark game , because their subtle " ambush marketing " amounted merely to wearing orange dresses with a tiny Bavarian beer logo ;
At a Fan Fest at Durban ’s South Beach , police arrested local environmentalist Alice Thomson for passing out anti-FIFA fliers regarding the June 16 march to City Hall ; and
A man caught with 30 game tickets " and no explanation " got a three - year jail sentence , while hardened criminals roam the streets freely .
Thieving and trademarking the local culture , as well , FIFA and corporate partner Coca - Cola also tried to steal Africa ’s soul by paying Somali singer K’naan to raise spirits with his easy " Wavin ’ Flag " lyrics .
But that wo n’t work , for much more challenging tunes for FIFA to digest have been produced – and are free to download on the internet -- by hip - hop artists Nomadic Wax and DJ Magee ( " World Cup " ) , the Chomsky AllStars ( " The Beautiful Gain " ) and , best of all , Durban ’s own Ewok ( " Shame on the Beautiful Game " ) .
On July 3 , another City Hall rally – this time against xenophobia - will let Durban reproduce a genuine African ubuntu spirit that can withstand Bafana ’s defeat , FIFA ’s profiteering and all the other losses we are suffering .

A Fox affiliate television station is refusing to apologize for accidentally broadcasting a room full of reporters offering very frank assessments of a speech by former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin .
The slip - up happened Friday night as Fox40 in Sacramento was broadcasting live from California State University , Stanislaus .
After the speech concluded , journalists and crew members behind the scenes offered some off - the - cuff assessment of her remarks , with one man saying he felt like he ’d just stepped off a roller coaster .

Another said he could understand why “ the dumbness does n’t come through in sound - bytes . ”
Yet another argued that she ’d not used a complete sentence or even “ made a statement . ”
The station insists their reporter and photographer were not behind the comments — however , they do not offer an apology or name the reporters whose voices were picked up .
Indeed , it ’s possible the error was due to Palin ’s pronounced dislike of the media , as even the Fox crew was turned away from her actual speech , according to their explanation .
Instead of filming the former official up close , they were forced to point their cameras at a screen in a media overflow area at a separate venue .
“ We were faced with two decisions — to not carry a speech of local and national importance due to the low - quality methods we’d be forced to transmit , or to provide a signal by any means necessary , ” the station explained .
“ It was with the public interest in mind that we opted for the latter . ”
They continue : “ the comments overheard were made by reporters assembled from other newspaper and television outlets , and at no time was the voice of our photographer heard on the stream .
It ’s very likely that those reporters and photographers were unaware , or simply forgot , that there was one television station with an open microphone broadcasting to the world . ”

Tammy Bruce , an independent conservative pundit , occasional Fox News analyst and noted Sarah Palin fan , suggested on her blog that the Fox40 cameraman was indeed involved in the exchange , although she admits that the station ’s news director seemed “ thoughtful ” and that she ’d believe his verdict .
“ Unfortunately , there ’s no way to immediately identify the photographers and reporters making commentary following Sarah Palin ’s speech , and it would be inappropriate for FOX40 News and FOX40.com to apologize on their behalf , ” the station concluded in their explanation posted Saturday morning .
This video and audio was captured by Fox40 in Sacramento on Friday , June 25 , 2010 .

Becoming a Psychic Access psychic is not an easy task .
We are highly selective , accepting only the best of the best psychics for our team .
Approximately one in eight applicants make it to the interview stage , and out of that bunch , only one in twenty are hired .
And that s only the beginning .
Every applicants work history is meticulously checked and his / her proficiency with spelling and grammar is scrutinized through the information they provide .
Those who dont measure up to our high standards will not work on our site ; its that simple .
Lastly , our psychics are required to verify their identities by providing us with a copy of a government issued photo ID , so that when you see a photo of them on our site , you can be certain you are getting the real deal .
Integrity is the backbone of our business , and as such , we thoroughly screen our applicants to ensure top - notch quality .
Each prospective psychic is required to perform one or more readings for our hiring staff , consisting of highly trained psychics .
If the reading meets their high standards , the applicant is then interviewed .
The interview process is by no means a simple one and may take anywhere from one to two hours to complete .
Our staff digs deeply to ascertain the level of talent the psychic possesses and they must also judge whether theyd be a good match for Psychic Access .
We demand much from our psychics , keeping in mind the needs of our clients .
We want them to have the opportunity to build meaningful relationships with our psychics that will last .
Did you know that most other psychic sites do not even interview their psychics ?
It s true , they do n't .
They also dont test their abilities or feel out whether theyd work well with their clients .
Typically , the psychic completes a small application and as long as they re breathing and have a pulse , they pretty much get hired .
That is NO way to run a business .
Our psychics also sign two separate contracts and are verbally informed of our " Golden Rules . "
Any psychic breaking those rules is immediately terminated .
Some of our " Golden Rules " are :
Thou shalt not give your email address , phone number , instant message handle , real name , mailing address or any contact information to a customer .
Thou shalt not solicit from any customer their email address , phone number , instant message handle , mailing address or any other contact information .
Thou shalt not perform any outside psychic related work for any customer .
Thou shalt not perform any type of spell work , spell casting or anything spell related .
Thou shalt be polite and courteous at all times to all customers .
If a psychic is willing to violate rules about contacting customers , so they can deal directly with them , what does that say about the psychic ?
They are unscrupulous and cannot be trusted .
Please keep that in mind as you obtain readings from any Internet psychic .
While we have done our very best to ensure our psychics will abide by our rules , there may be one someday who does not .
If this happens to you , please gather as much information as they are willing to provide and then report them to us A.S.A.P .
We will not disclose your name .
Most importantly , NEVER send any money to any psychic working on Psychic Access for any reason .
SCOTUS weakened human rights in this country yesterday .
The Supreme Court retreated from strict enforcement of the famous Miranda decision on Tuesday , ruling that a crime suspect ’s words can be used against him if he fails to clearly invoke his rights and instead , answers a single question after nearly three hours of interrogation .
In the past , the court has said the " burden rests on the government " to show that a crime suspect has " knowingly and intelligently waived " his rights .
But in a 5 - 4 decision Tuesday , the court said the suspect has the duty to invoke his rights .
If he fails to do so , his later words can be used to convict him , the justices said .
The police are " not required to obtain a waiver " of the suspect ’s " right to remain silent before interrogating him , " wrote Justice Anthony M. Kennedy .
In this case , Michigan police had warned the suspect , Van Thompkins , of his rights , including the right to remain silent .
Thompkins said he understood , but he did not tell the officer he wanted to stop the questioning or to speak to a lawyer .
However , he sat in a chair and said nothing for about two hours and 45 minutes .
At that point , the officer asked , " Do you pray to God to forgive you for shooting that boy down ? "
" Yes , " Thompson said , and looked away .
He refused to sign a confession or to speak further , but he was convicted of first - degree murder , based largely on his one - word reply .
The U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals overturned Thompkins ’ conviction on the grounds that the use of the incriminating answer violated his right against self - incrimination under the Miranda decision .
The Supreme Court reversed that ruling and reinstated the conviction .
" A suspect who has received and understood the Miranda warnings , and has not invoked his Miranda rights , waives the right to remain silent by making an uncoerced statement to the police , " Kennedy said .
He was joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Antonin Scalia , Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr.
Speaking for the dissenters , Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the rulings " marks a substantial retreat from the protections against compelled self - incrimination that Miranda v. Arizona has long provided . "
She said the conviction should be overturned because the prosecution had not " carried its burden to show that he waived his right to remain silent . "
Justices John Paul Stevens , Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer joined her dissent …

It 's New York Times wedding pages meets tabloids : Adam Wheeler , a tale - spinning student who managed to lie his way through Harvard and part of a Rhodes scholarship application , has the blogosphere equally delighted and horrified .
Tuesday 's Boston Globe story detailed Wheeler 's stunts , which included faked resumes , recommendations , SAT scores , transcripts , plagiarized papers , and more .
He managed to win grant money and prizes until English professor James Simpson , reviewing Wheeler 's Rhodes scholarship essays in his senior year , smelled a rat .
Now ,
Wheeler 's fakery exposed as he faces criminal charges , the media scavengers are on the prowl .
' Brilliant , Lying , Ivy League Manipulators , ' writes Gawker 's Maureen O'Connor , linking to stories of alleged plagiarist and Harvard alum Kaavya Viswanathan and Wheeler - like Yale imposter Akash Maharaj .
" Is there an alumni club for that ? "
She later adds an update in which she reviews some of the details of his " farcically packed resume . "
That Resume
The one everyone 's talking about was posted by The New Republic , where Wheeler applied for an internship .
" We did not accept him , " reads the statement . "
Click here for a PDF of his rather remarkable two - page resume , in which he claims that ( a ) he 's contracted to write several books ; ( b ) he can speak French , Old English , Classical Armenian , and Old Persian ; and ( c ) he 's in demand on the lecture circuit . "
Lessons " Obviously , everyone should start lying on their college applications now , " writes a tongue - in - cheek Chris Rovzar at New York Magazine , since no one appears to be checking the claims .
Some other takeaways include that fantastical liars should try to " know [ their ] limits , " and that , clearly , " realizing you are about to graduate with a useless English degree can make you do pretty desperate things " -- like " become a blogger , " Rovzar adds .

On Wednesday June 2 , the Portuguese parliament voted by a thin margin to accept the austerity package presented by Socialist ( PS ) Party Prime Minister Jose Socrates .
The “ victory ” for Mr. Socrates , who heads a minority government , was made possible by the support of the Social Democratic Party ( PSD ) , which in spite of its name , is neither socialist nor democratic , but rather is a right - wing party dedicated to scaling back the rights of working people .
The move by the government and legislature parallels measures that are being undertaken in those European Union member countries that have been most heavily impacted by the financial and economic crisis that started in the United States in 2008 but has become greatly intensified in Europe since the start of the massive debt crisis in Greece .
Portugal and Greece are two of the insultingly designated “ PIGS , ” EU countries whose finances are considered most shaky .
The others are Italy , Ireland and Spain .
All these countries are under intense pressure by international monopoly capital , wealthier EU countries such as Germany , and the International Monetary Fund , to balance their budgets by dismantling social welfare programs .
In fact , they are finding out what it is like for the poor countries of Asia , Africa and America .
The vote in parliament approves the general outlines of a series of regressive tax increases ( value added and on income ) and cuts in public services , especially in health care , education and unemployment benefits .
The legislature now has to get into detail on each of these items , and the left , headed by the Communist Party - Greens alliance , is going to make a fight over every one of them .
The Portuguese left fears that the deal worked out by the centrist government and the right - wing PSD may have constitutional implications , as the latter party , with other sectors of the Portuguese right , opposes the existing guarantees of economic and social rights entrenched in the Constitution as a result of the events that followed the overthrow of the Caetano dictatorship in the 1970s .
And in Portugal , the left is able to mobilize large numbers of both public and private sector workers , as well as small farmers and others who will be negatively impacted by the austerity measures .
On Saturday , May 29 , an estimated 300,000 marched in Lisbon to denounce the Socrates government ’s austerity plan .
The entire population of Portugal is only 10.6 million .
The impressive mobilization was spearheaded by the CGPT - IN trade union federation , closely linked to the Portuguese Communist Party .
On Monday , May 31 , Jeronimo de Sousa , secretary - general of the Portuguese Communist Party , speaking at a Party meeting in Setubal , laid out in stark terms what is at stake :
The PS and PSD speak in the name of the national interest , but the national interest is not to be defended against the interests of the majority of the people , nor is it compatible with a policy of capitulation before the big economic interests , the big powers and the neo-liberal objectives and orientations of the Central Bank of Europe , of Brussels , of [ German Chancellor Angela ] Merkel , or the International Monetary Fund .
Rather , de Sousa called for “ a policy of defense and promotion of national production , valuing our national resources , investing in the industrialization of our country , in our agriculture and fisheries , oriented toward creating jobs and fighting against unemployment , and helping our small and medium sized enterprises ” as well as defending the rights of workers and the people .
The entire statement can be read in Portuguese at http://www.pcp.pt.
The call of the Portuguese left and labor movement for the defense of the interests of workers and ordinary people against the demands for more and more sacrifices , demands coming from those who created the crisis and who are themselves willing to sacrifice nothing , closely parallel those heard around the world , including in the United States .
At extremely low temperatures atoms can aggregate into so - called Bose Einstein condensates forming coherent laser - like matter waves .
Due to interactions between the atoms fundamental quantum dynamics emerge and give rise to periodic collapses and revivals of the matter wave field .
A group of scientists led by Professor Immanuel Bloch ( Chair of Experimental Physics at the Ludwig - Maximilians - Universität München ( LMU ) and Director of the Quantum Many Body Systems Division at the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics in Garching ) has now succeeded to take a glance ' behind the scenes ' of atomic interactions revealing the complex structure of these quantum dynamics .
By generating thousands of miniature BECs ordered in an optical lattice the researchers were able to observe a large number of collapse and revival cycles over long periods of time .
The research is published in the journal Nature .
The experimental results imply that the atoms do not only interact pairwise -- as typically assumed -- but also perform exotic collisions involving three , four or more atoms at the same time .
On the one hand , these results have fundamental importance for the understanding of quantum many - body systems .
On the other hand , they pave the way for the generation of new exotic states of matter , based on such multi-body interactions .
The experiment starts by cooling a dilute cloud of hundreds of thousands of atoms to temperatures close to absolute zero , approximately - 273 degrees Celsius .
At these temperatures the atoms form a so - called Bose - Einstein condensate ( BEC ) , a quantum phase in which all particles occupy the same quantum state .
Now an optical lattice is superimposed on the BEC :
This is a kind of artificial crystal made of light with periodically arranged bright and dark areas , generated by the superposition of standing laser light waves from different directions .
This lattice can be viewed as an 'egg carton ' on which the atoms are distributed .
Whereas in a real egg carton each site is either occupied by a single egg or no egg , the number of atoms sitting at each lattice site is determined by the laws of quantum mechanics :
Depending on the lattice height ( i.e. the intensity of the laser beam ) the single lattice sites can be occupied by zero , one , two , three and more atoms at the same time .
The use of those " atom number superposition states " is the key to the novel measurement principle developed by the researchers .
The dynamics of an atom number state can be compared to the dynamics of a swinging pendulum .
As pendulums of different lengths are characterized by different oscillation frequencies , the same applies to the states of different atom numbers .
" However , these frequencies are modified by inter-atomic collisions .
If only pairwise interactions between atoms were present , the pendulums representing the individual atom number states would swing synchronously and their oscillation frequencies would be exact multiples of the pendulum frequency for two interacting atoms , " Sebastian Will , graduate student at the experiment , explains .
Using a tricky experimental set - up the physicists were able to track the evolution of the different superimposed oscillations over time .
Periodically interference patterns became visible and disappeared , again and again .
From their intensity and periodicity the physicists found unambiguous evidence that the frequencies are actually not simple multiples of the two - body case .
" This really caught us by surprise .
We became aware that a more complex mechanism must be at work , " Sebastian Will recalls .
" Due to their ultralow temperature the atoms occupy the energetically lowest possible quantum state at each lattice site .
Nevertheless , Heisenberg 's uncertainty principle allows them to make -- so to speak -- a virtual detour via energetically higher lying quantum states during their collision .
Practically , this mechanism gives rise to exotic collisions , which involve three , four or more atoms at the same time . "
The results reported in this work provide an improved understanding of interactions between microscopic particles .
This may not only be of fundamental scientific interest , but find a direct application in the context of ultracold atoms in optical lattices .
Owing to exceptional experimental controllability , ultracold atoms in optical lattices can form a " quantum simulator " to model condensed matter systems .
Such a quantum simulator is expected to help understand the physics behind superconductivity or quantum magnetism .
Furthermore , as each lattice site represents a miniature laboratory for the generation of exotic quantum states , experimental set - ups using optical lattices may turn out to be the most sensitive probes for observing atomic collisions .
Is Canada ready for a homegrown version of Fox News , that minaret for America First prejudice ?
Is our peaceable dominion parched for a domestic channel of perpetual right - wing complaint ?
Is there money just waiting to be made screeching to the converted ?
Last week , news came that Kory Teneycke , the former attack - dog communications director for Prime Minister Stephen Harper , was heading up a bid by Quebecor Media Inc. for a broadcast licence for an unapologetically conservative news and opinion channel .
Also on the team is Luc Lavoie , a former communications director for prime minister Brian Mulroney and Mulroney ’s spokesman once he left office and all those allegations about cash - stuffed envelopes started to circulate .
Quebecor is a Canadian communication colossus , the owner of the Sun chain of tabloids , the French - language TVA network , the Vidéotron cable and Internet provider , and Canoe.ca , among other holdings .
It does n’t seem the company , headed by Pierre Karl Peladeau , is applying for the broadcast licence out of any ideological ardor .
Rather , profit appears to be the motive : Teneycke has persuaded Peladeau that there is an untapped market in English Canada of worked - up right - wingers willing to pay to be harangued .
The very thought of a Canadian Fox News knock - off is enough to give not - so - worked - up citizens the willies .
There ’s nothing wrong with different media outlets adopting different political perspectives .
It happens as a matter of course , and it ’s perfectly healthy .
The Sun papers from their origins have championed a right - of - centre populism ( deep distrust of the nanny state , unswerving support for the police , and a little comely eye candy for the lads on the factory shop floor ) .
The Globe and Mail is a financially conservative journal that can lean progressive on social issues ( same - sex marriage , decriminalization of marijuana ) .
The Star is openly proud of its liberalism .
No , it ’s not that Fox News in the U.S. is a transmitter tower for conservatism that sets Canadian teeth on edge .
It ’s not even its bombast .
It ’s the channel ’s mean - spirited vindictiveness .
Opposing viewpoints are entertained , if at all , not so that they can be debated but so that they can be debased : brayed at , mocked , vilified .
The channel has the none - too - bright persona of the schoolyard bully , personified by one of its signature blowhards , Bill O’Reilly .
Is this what Mssrs. Teneycke , Lavoie and Peladeau have in mind ?
Me , I ’m not convinced that seed will grow in Canadian soil .
Our hard - right conservatives may be zealous , but they stop just shy of being zealots .
Preston Manning was no Ross Perot , and Tory Keneycke is no Roger Ailes , president of Fox News .
Stephen Harper may be a hyper - controlling monomaniac , but next to Dick Cheney he looks like Lester Pearson .
And you may find Ezra Levant wrong - headed , but he ’s not wrong in the head .
Glenn Beck , with his bug - eyed mixture of paranoia and delusions of grandeur , is a different kettle of fish entirely .
In the U.S. he has a television show and a messianic following .
In Canada , he would be under observation in the Clarke Institute .
But maybe the hysteria is necessary to make money , because heretofore media outlets in Canada devoted to the plaints of the right have always been in the red .
Alberta Report magazine carried the conservative standard for a while in the 1980s and ’90s , then ran on little more than the fumes of oil patch alienation , then folded in 2003 .
The National Post was founded in 1998 by Conrad Black precisely to give voice to a strain of conservatism Black found lamentably lacking in Canadian political culture .
Twelve years later , the paper has yet to turn one thin dime of profit .
Of course , the economics of broadcasting are different .
If Quebecor succeeds in persuading the CRTC to grant it a “ must carry ” licence — ramming the channel down the gullet of cable and satellite providers — its profitability is guaranteed .
If only the CRTC could attach the condition that the channel come with a mandatory counterweight : a Canadian equivalent of Jon Stewart ’s Daily Show and The Colbert Report , a smart , funny nightly satirical flaying of hyperventilated extremism .
Now that would be a welcome addition to the Canadian airwaves .
What plant is distinctly smelly , has several fan - like , serrated leaves , and has been cultivated for centuries for both medicinal and recreational purposes , to the point of spawning an entire subculture ?
Gosh , we do n’t know , but it seems to be growing in the wilds of Union Square Park .
Anyone sensitive to the appearance of different types of plants might notice what appears to be a cluster of marijuana , one large sapling and a few smaller sprouts , in a raised garden in the park .
We sent these photos to Senior Cultivation Editor Danny Danko at High Times ; here 's his expert opinion :
It absolutely is cannabis sativa ( pot , weed , marijuana ) .
It was either a possible accidental sort of thing where a seed was tossed out , but there 's also internet chatter about planting seeds to " overgrow " the government , in as many places a possible , willy - nilly .
These are n't the expensive seeds we talk about in the magazine , but seeds people find in their pot and toss .
It 's kind of a 4/20 thing : a celebration and form of protest from cannabis community .
This could be that or it could be it grew from seeds that were discarded .
It 's doubtful someone expected to harvest it ; it 's likely it 's either accidental or a protest .
We 've even seen some pop up in the median on Park Avenue .
The Parks Dept is usually pretty quick about getting rid of those .
And after reviewing our photos , the science team at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden told us they think it 's marijuana ( Cannabis sativa ) .
However , samples we took seemed to lack the infamous smell , and the nearby herb and vegetable sellers in the Greenmarket , who perhaps might have a knowledge of such matters , were doubtful .
“ It ’s not marijuana , ” said one .
“ Marijuana is a five - leaf plant .
This frond has seven leaves .
It ’s also way too big .
So you may think it ’s marijuana , but it ’s not . ”
After careful deliberation , we 're gonna go with the High Times guy on this .
And the Union Square pot patch is n't the only one spotted in the urban wilds recently .
Ava Chin of City Room noticed a similar plant in Ditmas Park recently , in front of a doctor ’s office .
Convinced by its distinctive appearance , Chin speculated that it could be medical marijuana , but the friend with whom she was walking , an experienced forager , had a more down - to - earth take .
“ Someone probably just tossed a bud into the hedges and the seed took , ” she said .
In researching this story , we looked up plants frequently mistaken for marijuana , and the one that most resembled the plant on Union Square was the Cleome hassleriana , or spider plant .
The Cleome apparently flowers from late spring to early fall ( it ’s late spring - but the Union Square plant lacked flowers ) and can be distinguished from its illegal doppelganger by small thorns on its stem ( we could n’t find any ) .
So perhaps in the near future , Union Square ’s most wily and persistent entrepreneurs — the illegal ones — could have a local source for their stash !
Unless we just narced them out .
We 've asked the Parks Department for a comment ; until we hear back , enjoy this pertinent Parks & Recreation clip :
The Pervaya Eltsovka River consists of two subterranean pieces , an old littered one and a new one – that is still being built .
The old part represents square tunnels , stink and much litter .
Here comes different household rubbish that is dumped by people upstream .
As a result , the collecting header is blocked by congestion of plastic bottles .
Probably nothing good happened to the owner of this passport since it ’s here …
The collecting header ’s construction was resumed some years ago due to development in the place of the streamway .
If it goes on , two parts will join and the litter will be probably removed .
A new collecting header , compared to the old one , is a real beauty .
However it has been flooded to the very ceiling .
If you come there during freshet you may never come out …
The walls are like new , occasionally such constructions with ladders can be seen .
The river is not entirely under the ground yet .
Collecting headers are still being built .
Closer to the exit there is a lot of junk .
Coming out you see this .
About 200 meters away is the next subterranean section probably leading to the Ob river .

Since Monday , if you ’ve paid close attention , you might have noticed a goofy - sounding phrase in your Boston Herald or San Diego Union - Tribune : “ Boocoo Auctions . ”
It comes from a Royal Oak , MI , based company called Ranger Data Technologies and is part of an ambitious plan to take lost advertising revenue back from Craigslist and eBay .
But , as President and COO Tony Marsella puts it , this is no cocktail - napkin dot - com idea .
It comes from seasoned veterans of the newspaper industry .
The CEO , George Willard Sr. , has 41 years in the industry , from his days as a pressman in the early ’60s to his founding of the Mirror chain of Detroit suburban weeklies in the ’90s .
His son , George Willard Jr. , senior vice president of operations , has worked in newspapers for 14 years , and Marsella is a 30 - year veteran of newspaper classified ad sales .
“ So , this is n’t a website that was created by a bunch of software guys in a garage to try and then sell it to the newspaper business , ” Marsella says .
“ One of the reasons that we were able to amass this network of media companies is the fact that we all have a real solid understanding of what the newspaper business is , where it is , and what we thought , and continue to think , are solutions to help newspapers drive more revenue . ”
The “ network ” so far is more than 280 newspapers or broadcast outlets that have licensed more than 6,000 Zip codes from Ranger Data , or about 20 percent of the nation ’s nearly 30,000 Zip codes .
The media sites buy the exclusive rights to Boocoo auction customers in those Zip codes .
The auctions are promoted in the physical newspaper , but the transactions , themselves , happen online .
Transactional revenue from every consumer in that Zip code who purchases an item or service is split between Ranger Data and the newspaper .
Boocoo.com had a soft launch on May 31 with just families , friends , and employees of participating newspapers .
Only they could place items up for bid .
The service launched nationwide on Monday .
Among Boocoo ’s partners are the Cox Newspaper chain — which includes the Atlanta Journal - Constitution , Palm Beach Post , and a number of dailies in Ohio — the San Diego Union - Tribune , Boston Herald , Chicago Sun-Times , and others .
This long reach into local markets , for starters , is why Boocoo believes it has an edge … Next Page »

In other words , total and unprecedented monetary lunacy , as every cental bank , under the orchestration of the Federal Reserve , will throw money at the problem until it goes away , which it wo n't .
As we have long expected , Bernanke is now willing to sacrifice the dollar at any cost to prevent the euro unwind .
This is nothing than a very short - term fix , whose half life will be shorter still than all previous ones .
The race to the currency devaluation bottom is now in its final lap .
And gold is the only alternative to the now imminent collapse of the fiat system : the world had a chance to take writedowns on losses , punish those who took risk and failed , and refused to do so .
There is now no risk left , but it only means that eventually all the risk will come back and lead all capital markets to zero .
The result will be the end of Keynesian economics as we know it .
Do not trade in this broken market , do not hold your money in a bank as they are all now one hour away from a terminal bank run - buy and hold real , FASB mark - to - myth independent assets .
Here is Goldman 's take on the reaction :
In reaction to escalating pressures on Euro area government bond markets this past week , and their broader repercussions on financial stability , European policymakers have announced tonight an impressive set of new policy initiatives , as Erik Nielsen flagged earlier this evening as they began to emerge .
The centerpiece is a EUR 500bn conditional mutual financial support scheme for EU sovereign states , boosted by further assistance from the IMF .
To put this number into perspective , consider that it is slightly higher than Italy ’s 2007 - 09 average gross issuance of public debt and that it could cover Spain ’s and Portugal ’s combined gross borrowing requirements for two - three years .
These conditional contingent liabilities tying EMU sovereigns will not appear under the Maastricht deficit and debt measures .
They require no additional funding - raising , for now .
The fiscal agreement will be subject to closer scrutiny in the days ahead , when more details will be made available .
In particular , the EUR 440bn of bilateral loans will be no doubt at the centre of more political discussions .
But , together with the promise by euro area governments to ‘ take all measures to meet their fiscal targets ’ , such display of fiscal ‘ solidarity ’ and the institution of a fast - track EMU / IMF funding backstop have been instrumental in convincing the ECB to step in , invoking a financial stability role .
In the coming days , the ECB – presumably through the national central banks - will conduct ‘ interventions ’ in those ‘ public and private ’ markets of the euro area it deems ‘ dysfunctional ’ and therefore impairing the transmission of monetary policy .
We provide more details of the measures below , touching also on some of the issues still pending .
Our overall take is positive .
The Eurozone fiscal crisis spread beyond Greece to countries with much better fiscal profiles due to a lack of confidence , in turn amplifying debt roll - over risks and hurting domestic banks .
Short of fiscal federalism , the mutual support plan launched tonight goes to the heart of the matter , and fortifies Eurozone institutions , endowing them more flexibility tools to deal with future crises .
But the true ‘ circuit - breaker ’ when the European markets open tomorrow will no doubt be the ECB ’s unprecedented involvement in the secondary markets .
Banking on the ‘ best practices ’ accumulated over the crisis , the ECB is not saying which securities it will buy , and in what size .
This makes the ‘ announcement effect ’ even more powerful .
The interventions will be over time sterilized ( i.e. , the cash injected will be mopped up ) , limiting the interference with monetary .
In terms of markets , there are clearly a few areas that are more directly linked to tonight ’s announcements and others that have been caught in the general cross -fire .
We would make the following broad observations .
1. EMU peripheral sovereign spreads should tighten back , particularly at the front - end of yield curves .
The move should be reinforced by the further tightening of fiscal policy in Spain and Portugal to be announced later this week , and the ongoing conservative fiscal stance in Italy .
At the 2 - yr maturity , Portugal closed on Friday at 550 bp over Germany , Spain at 237 bp and Italy at 181 bp .
Our relative preference goes at this juncture for Portugal , because of the higher risk premium .
We think spreads should come back to the 250 bp area , and quite possibly further .
In Italy and Spain , spreads should halve ( although we continue to think that Spain will trade weaker than Italy reflecting the two countries ’ relative funding requirements ) .
Meanwhile , German 2 - yr benchmark bonds closed at 76 bp through swaps .
This spread is at least 20 bp too high ( it averaged 50 bp up to March ) , considering that Germany ’s contingent liabilities as a result of these actions have increased .
2 . The impact all this should have on the level of rates is unclear .
The ECB is in the near term injecting more liquidity , and this should keep rates low over the coming months .
Sterilizations will presumably entail a steeper money market than currently is the case .
Against the backdrop of falling risk premium and better growth numbers , as we expressed already in our Bond Snapshot last Friday , our inclination would be to fade the bond rally now .
Among our recommended exposures is a trade to be long 10 - yr UST vs.
Bunds , for a target in the 40 - 50 bp area .
3 . On currencies , the impact on the trade - weighed EUR of a more restrictive fiscal policy and easy monetary stance is unclear .
As the risk premium erodes , the currency may extend gains against the Dollar , returning towards our 1.35 3 - and 6 - mth forecasts ( from Friday ’s 1.27 close ) .
Our main focus in coming days will be on several fundamentally sound opportunities that have been rocked by the generalized de-risking .
Among these , at this stage we highlight PLN , TRY against the EUR , and MXN against the USD , which we added on Friday already as a tactical recommendation .
Asian FX weakened last week on the increasing risk aversion , and should stage a come back .
Earlier tonight , we recommended going long a basket of MYR , PHP and IDR against the JPY .
4 . The story in equity space is similar : Given the higher co-variance between financial and sovereign risk , the main underperformer of late has been the European banking sector .
In the near term , it will probably lead the market bounce .
But tighter fiscal policy in the European periphery will in our view continue to weigh on the local financial institutions .
Our interest goes more towards opportunities where we judge the macro underpinnings to be stronger .
We have been recently stopped out of long positions in US consumer stocks , but that remains an area of interest , for example .
And we have highlighted the merit of ‘ core Europe ’ ( through the German DAX index ) , which we are likely to elaborate on in the coming days .
Unlike during the credit crisis of 2008 , these policy announcements take place against a much more favorable macro backdrop .
Turning to the measures , these involve :
On the fiscal side , the establishment of a ‘ European stabilization mechanism ’ , under the legal umbrella of article 122.2 of the Maastricht Treaty .
This envisages financial assistance from the Union to member states ‘ seriously threatened with severe difficulties caused by exceptional occurrences beyond their control ’ .
The overall ‘ stabilization mechanism ’ , which overall will not require approval by the national parliaments , will revolve around three funding avenues , all operating on a conditional basis ( meaning that the sovereign will have to agree to a fiscal adjustment plan to access the funds , ‘ on terms and conditions similar to the IMF’s ’ ) .
To begin with , the EU Commission will set up and run a permanent ‘ rapid - fire ’ facility funded by the issuance of Eurobonds guaranteed by the single member states .
The framework piggy - backs on the one used for the balance of payment support to non-EU countries , which is also run by the Commission .
The new facility should be endowed with around EUR 60bn , and provide for the quick response that was lacking in the case of Greece .
It is unclear whether the facility will be pre-funded .
The balance - of - payment program is not , and the Commission taps markets upon need .
Whether the guarantees will be ‘ joint and several ’ , like is the case of existing EU Commission bonds , is also unclear .
If so , the issuance may compete with existing EIB and KFW programs , which is less senior .
We plan to flesh out some of these issues when more technical details are available .
Moreover , EMU member states have pledged up to an additional EUR 440bn in bilateral loans to support each other .
As in the case of Greece , we think that they will be allocated along the same proportions as those holding for the ECB ’s capital shares .
The loans will be collected in an SPV ‘ expiring after three years ’ .
It is unclear whether non-EMU countries have signed up ( the UK has not ) .
The disbursement of the loans will require parliamentary approval .
Finally , according to European sources , the IMF will contribute to the deal with an amount up to EUR 250bn , presumably providing assistance in the formulation of the fiscal restructuring plan , as has been the case for Greece .
We would notice that the higher the amount pledged by the IMF , presumably the greater the influence of its main shareholders over the disbursement .
On the monetary side , the ECB has announced it will conduct interventions in the euro area public and private debt securities markets ‘ to ensure depth and liquidity in those market segments which are dysfunctional ’.
The ECB plans to sterilize these purchases .
Further , to support banks , the ECB will conduct 3 - mth fixed rate tenders around the end of this month , when the first 1 - yr LTRO expires , and a 6 - mth operation this Wednesday .
And finally , the ECB will reactivate together with other major central banks temporary but unlimited Dollar swap lines with the Federal Reserve .
Last , but not least :
The first tranche of the joint EMU / IMF 110bn package for Greece will be disbursed in the coming days .
Earlier today , the IMF Board has approved the EUR 30bn Stand - by arrangement with Greece .
Both these news were widely expected .
On May 12 , the European Commission will present proposals on how to improve the governance of the Euro area , including ‘ strengthening ’ the Stability and Growth Pact ( involving a discussion on the introduction of more effective sanctions ) .
This is the natural and necessary complement to a system of fiscal relationships involving greater risk - sharing , and will be the focus of many discussions in the weeks and months to come .

Text messages have been mysteriously altered between sender and recipient in at least 20 cases , prompting a Telecom investigation .
Has something like this happened to you ?
Email news@dompost.co.nz
Salvation Army church leader Steve Molen discovered the glitch last week when he sent a text to 10 people to remind them of an upcoming dinner .
It ended on a lighthearted note with " bring a date or your muma but would prefer it if you bought [ sic ] a youth and plenty of food should be a great night so see you there six o'clock " .
TEXT MIX -UP : What Steve Molen 's wife received .
However , one recipient – his wife Faye – received a message that read " bring a date or your muma but would prefer it if you bought me she setting a bad example for me " .
Mr Molen , of Newtown , contacted Telecom 's call centre and was told he was n't the first to experience the problem .
" [ The call centre worker ] said it was a software fault that adds lines to the last part of people 's texts ... and there had even been swear words added on to some messages .
" I said to him does that mean I could send a text to my boss that inadvertently tells him to eff off ? "
Mr Molen was concerned that people may be unknowingly receiving corrupted texts on a regular basis .
" Telecom has a responsibility to make sure that , if you send a text , it is what ends up being sent . "
Telecom sponsorship and mobile PR manager Rebecca Ingram said the problem was " extremely rare " and the cause was being investigated .
It was " highly unlikely " that offensive words could randomly appear in a corrupted message .
Mobile users were not being hacked , she said .
" Any additional text content is quite randomly appended or is a result of the existing text message being jumbled . "
But Telecommunications Users Association chief executive Ernie Newman was sceptical .
" It does n't seem to me that a random insert into a text message would come out with an intelligible message at the end of it ... it seems to me that somebody must be hacking it . "
Four - second HD TV transmission delay fuels conspiracy theory
ITV bosses blame contractor for goal gaffe
Ice -cool Adrian Chiles apologises to viewers for interruption
A betting scam may have been behind ITV 's embarrassing failure to screen England 's first goal of the World Cup on its high - definition channel .
A car advert interrupted coverage for 1.5 million viewers just before Steven Gerrard scored in Saturday night 's group game against the U.S .
When the action resumed , the England players were already celebrating their fourth - minute lead .

The break in coverage would have paid off for gamblers that took up Paddy Power 's odds of 8 - 1 that an ITV live game would be interrupted .
The fact that HDTV broadcasts are screened four seconds later than conventional TV also fuelled conspiracy theories .
A saboteur could have seen England score on a regular TV channel and then pulled the plug to take advantage of the fact an HD viewer would not have known England were ahead .
Adrian Chiles , who was presenting ITV 's coverage , apologised at half time for the glitch which came three minutes and 26 seconds into the game .
Chiles , who was poached by ITV from the BBC in a multi-million pound deal , said : ' Apologies for those watching in HD , I believe there was some interruption in your coverage . '

The social networking site Twitter was quickly flooded with complaints from irate viewers .
One poster , Sheffield_UK , wrote : ' ITV black out the England goal and spoil the whole evening . '
Another , called Paul - Durand , said : ' ITV HD is a joke .
First England goal of the World Cup , and there was a Hyundai advert on . '
ITV yesterday said it believed human error at Technicolor , an outside company , was to blame .
An ITV spokesman said : ' ITV Sport 's production team in South Africa , who have produced high quality coverage throughout the tournament , were in no way responsible . '
Richard Cross , ITV 's group technology director , said : ' We apologise unreservedly to viewers for the unacceptable interruption to high - definition coverage of the match .

' We met with Technicolor first thing this morning to put in place measures to address the issue and to ensure that Technicolor takes the appropriate action with immediate effect . '
ITV 's technical competence was questioned last year when it failed to show the crucial winning goal at the end of a tense FA Cup tie between Everton and Liverpool .
The channel switched to an automated ad break as eventual finalists Everton scored the winning goal in the 118th minute against their Merseyside rivals .
The former chairman of ITV , Michael Grade , was forced to issue an apology for the ' inexcusable glitch ' and ' unprecedented transmission error ' .
He added : ' We 're still trying to figure out how it happened and there may be a few yellow and red cards following this . '
Of the latest howler , a spokesman for Paddy Power said it had taken around a dozen bets , mainly of £ 5 and £ 10 , on the coverage being interrupted .
He added : ' We did n't think we would have to pay out as soon as the first England match . '
The World Cup was seen as a key test for the HD technology - with broadcasting watchdog Ofcom promising the biggest development in sport coverage since the 1970 World Cup was screened in colour .
ITV is to broadcast 32 live games through the tournament including England 's next game against Algeria at 7.30 pm on Friday .
The BBC will screen the final group game against Slovenia , then it will have the pick of the round of 16 and quarter - final games .
If England reach the semi-final , both channels will show the game and both will show the final .
Technicolor spokesman Suzanne Munton said yesterday : ' This error originated from the London playout centre where Technicolor provides broadcast television playout services on behalf of ITV plc .
' Technicolor deeply regrets this incident and its impact on ITV and its viewers .
Investigations are continuing as a matter of the utmost urgency in order to ensure the issues are addressed with immediate effect . '
England fans were left down - hearted at the team 's capitulation with the thoughts of many now turning to the next game .
Dave Patterson , 50 , from Nottingham , said : ' The atmosphere was fantastic to start with but it dampened a little bit when they scored .
' England were the better team but the goal knocked the stuffing out of them . '
David Yarwood , 24 , from Oxford , said : ' We started brightly but gifted them a goal and it went downhill from there .
' But we never do well at the start .
We never make it easy for ourselves .
' But at the end of the day if we can't beat teams like Algeria and Slovenia we do n't deserve to be here . '
Some of the South Africans supporting England were less impressed with the performance .
One summed it up : ' The atmosphere was good but the football was poor . '
Shadow energy secretary and Labour leadership candidate Ed Miliband got in on the act describing Green 's blunder as the ' unfortunate incident of the American goal ' .
He told Sky News ' Sunday Live : ' I do n't think we should give up hope at all in this World Cup campaign .
In 1966 , we drew our first match , against Uruguay I think it was .
' We have every chance of winning this World Cup and we should be proud of what our team is doing .
We should keep right behind them in this campaign . '
CHICAGO – In a sea of green jerseys hundreds proudly cheered for Mexico here early Friday morning , June 11 , at a local indoor soccer gym as the North American nation competed against South Africa in the much - anticipated opening game of the 2010 World Cup .
In the first half it appeared Mexico had the upper hand controlling the ball most of the period although they failed to score in several close attempts .
However in the second half South Africa came alive and made the first successful drive toward the goal scoring on Mexico .
Some thought the point was unfair .
“ Mexico just got robbed , ” said viewer Marco Hernandez , 35 , who works for a printing shop .
South Africa is the host country so the officials gave the point to the team even though , according to Hernandez , the player who scored was off - sides .
At half time organizers of the viewing party held a contest with guests to see who could shout “ Goooooal ” the loudest and most creatively .
Winners won framed autographed Mexico jerseys .
The bustling rooms were crowded and consisted of mostly Mexican fans , men and women , young and old .
The feeling was high - spirited , loud and exciting .
But when South Africa scored , the rooms fell silent .
But Mexico came back and scored late in the second half .
Neither team was able to execute offensively after that .
Game one of the World Cup ended in a 1 - 1 tie .
“ Growing up soccer was always part of my Mexican culture , ” said Hernandez .
“ It ’s the passion that we share . ”
Many said it ’s great that the World Cup is being played for the first time on African soil .
It ’s a tremendous plus for the sport worldwide and especially for the African nations involved , they said .
Others said soccer is more than just a sport we enjoy : it ’s something we live for .
“ It ’s the biggest tournament in the world next to the Olympics , ” said Miguel Angel Ramirez , a 35 - year - old visual artist .
Africa is “ the cradle of humanity ” and having the games in South Africa will boost its economy and help provide jobs , he said .
A highlight at the event was the special appearance of Pavel Pardo , a soccer legend from Mexico , who helped the team qualify for this year ’s World Cup .
Pardo played in the 2006 games and is an active player with Club America in Mexico City .
The World Cup is an extraordinary opportunity and a great experience for players of the world to compete , said Pardo .
It ’s a time when people can be proud of their country and support their national soccer players .
Pardo said he has confidence Mexico will make it far this year .
“ The World Cup is important for the entire world but it is also especially important for the South African people because it ’s in South Africa , ” said Pardo .
“ Soccer and the World Cup unite people and it unites nations , ” he said .
It ’s a time when countries support international solidarity , anti-racism and community empowerment , he said .
Fans say teams to watch are Argentina , Spain and Brazil .
“ Only 32 teams are worthy of the World Cup and it will come down to one who will have bragging rights for the next four years , ” said Patricia Arreola , 26 , who works for Illinois State University .
Arreola has always loved soccer even before playing goalie for her high school team .
“ Plus soccer usually has a lot of cute guys with nice legs , ” she adds jokingly .
It ’s a simple game that people can easily follow and it ’s perfect for families to watch on Sunday afternoons , said Arreola .
“ The games will also allow South Africa to showcase its rich culture and the beauty of its people , ” she notes .
Jose Cuervo , a popular tequila maker , sponsored the early morning viewing party .
Chi-Town Futbol , a large indoor soccer gym located in the predominantly Mexican community of Pilsen on the city ’s southwest side , hosted the event .
Jeff Welsh , Chi-Town
Futbol owner said the venue was eight years in the making featuring 15 large plasma TVs and one big screen .
He hopes his venue can become the Mexican headquarters for World Cup viewers in Chicago .
The gym runs adult soccer leagues seven nights a week all year round and 95 percent of the customers are Latino , he said .

BP has slowed the flow of oil and gas from a ruptured well into the Gulf of Mexico , a US official told local media .
The company 's " top kill " effort has " stabilised the wellhead " , Coast Guard commander Admiral Thad Allen said .
But he cautioned it was too early to declare success .
This is the first step in BP 's plan to seal the well for good .
Meanwhile , a panel of US scientists said the oil leak was much worse than previously estimated , making it the nation 's worst spill .
US Geological Survey Director Marcia McNutt saidBP ' slows leaking Gulf oil well ' government teams estimated the flow ranges from 12,000 barrels ( 504,000 gallons or 1.9 million litres ) to 25,000 barrels per day .
Up to now , BP had estimated the leak at 5,000 barrels ( 210,000 gallons ) per day , while cautioning that figure was unreliable .
If the new estimates are confirmed , it would mean the leak has far eclipsed the previous worst oil spill in US history - the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster .
Official resigns
Later on Thursday , President Barack Obama is expected to extend a moratorium on deep - water offshore drilling for six months , the White House has said .
The move comes as his administration faces criticism of its handling of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill .
Hours before Mr Obama was due to speak , US officials announced the resignation of the head of the Minerals Management Service ( MMS ) , the US agency which oversees drilling operations .
Elizabeth " Liz " Birnbaum , who had run the MMS since July 2009 , has endured criticism in the weeks since the oil spill over alleged lax oversight of drilling and what President Obama has called an overly cozy relationship with industry .
Eleven workers were killed in the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig on 20 April .
Millions of gallons of oil have poured into the sea since then .
' Low pressure '
Adm Allen told US media the " top kill " procedure , which began on Wednesday , has pumped enough drilling fluid to block some of the oil and gas escaping from the well .
Earlier , he had indicated that all the leaking oil and gas had been stopped , telling National Public Radio that BP engineers had " been able to force mud down and not allow any hydrocarbons to come up . "
An aide to Adm Allen later clarified his statement , saying the procedure had a way to go before it proved successful .
It was the first positive official assessment of BP 's latest attempt to plug the well , after previous efforts failed .
TOP KILL PROCEDURE
Drilling mud pumped from surface
Goes into blowout preventer
If pressure and density sufficient , oil and gas flow stops
Well then filled with cement
What is a ' top kill ' ?
BP shares were up more than 5 % in London trading following the announcement .
BP has not yet commented in detail on the situation , saying merely that its " subsea efforts [ were ] advancing on several fronts " .
The company did not know how long the operation would take , a BP official said .
The top kill attempt , which began on Wednesday , involves pumping heavy drilling fluids into the top of the well to try to halt the oil flow .
If it succeeds , cement would then be injected to seal the well .
The oil leak has already soiled more than 110 km ( 70 miles ) of Louisiana 's coastline , threatening fragile marshlands and putting the Louisiana fishing industry at risk .
US officials warn the coming hurricane season could make things worse .
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) forecasts 14 to 23 named storms , with 8 to 14 developing into hurricanes , making it one of the most active on record .
Firewall audit products are maturing , but the product class is still a relatively young , small market , defined by compliance requirements .
You have a fairly limited choice of vendors , including Tufin Software Technologies , AlgoSec , Secure Passage and Athena Security , which all come with firewall audit pedigrees , and RedSeal Systems and Skybox Security , which are primarily vendors of risk - mitigation tools , and so go beyond firewall audit to feature sophisticated risk - assessment and risk - management capabilities .
Take the time to define your requirements , narrow down your choices and put candidates to the test .
See the companion article Firewall audit tools : features and functions on CSOonline.com
DO look at platform and device coverage .
These products generally support all the major firewall vendors and some others , as well as major network devices , so you should be covered .
Take both present and future needs into account .
For example , you may run a single platform across the organization now , but future acquisitions may run on other vendors ' infrastructures .
These tools should be able to help whether you plan to migrate onto a single platform or continue to manage several while still realizing the efficiencies they promise .
See if the vendor has a software development kit that can allow it to integrate with unsupported platforms .
Check that coverage for network devices is included .
There are a couple of considerations here .
First , it may be important to you to clean up and optimize access control lists on your routers , and second , routers are increasingly featuring more built - in security capabilities .
DON'T overlook scalability .
Those vendors that focus largely on enterprise deployments claim they can scale up to thousands of devices .
Determine what that actually means in terms of management and the ability to perform under stress .
" In addition , the magnitude of environment brings huge demands on technology and methods that can be used , " says the telecommunications company security officer .
" What in a smaller company can be rock solid may not be applicable in a big environment .
You need be cautious about the limitation of technology . "
Choose with growth in mind .
Even if a product scales to your current requirements , how well - suited is it to meet greater demands as the business grows , services are added , acquisitions are integrated and traffic increases ?
DON'T buy more than you need .
Some of these products are aimed at complex , heterogeneous environments with hundreds of firewalls and network devices .
Measure the tool 's capabilities and cost against your environment .
If your firewall environment is relatively simple and static and your traffic is fairly predictable , choose a less - expensive product that you can apply initially for your optimization project and periodically to keep your firewalls under control .
DO put these products to the test once you narrow your choices to those that claim to meet most of your requirements .
" Pick two or three of your favorites and bake them off in real - world situations , " says John Kindervag , senior analyst at Forrester Research .
" The nice thing about firewall - auditing products is that you can test them on a live production environment because they are passive tools . "
Kindervag recommends testing how well they do at finding unused rules , optimizing configurations and so on , then comparing reports .
" Run the results by your firewall guru or bring in one who can say , ' Yes , that 's a good rule change , ' " he says .
You can also determine whether they actually scale and deliver analysis at the speeds they claim and what kind of hardware they 'd require .
DO determine your reporting requirements and evaluate the products ' capabilities accordingly .
Audit reports should come first and foremost for most organizations .
Evaluate the quality of summary reports — are they sufficient to prove that your control policies are , in fact , carried out ?
Also , make sure that you can produce satisfactory reports on demand in response to specific auditor queries .
Some products offer regulation - specific reports , usually for PCI DSS , which may be useful .
Since these are management tools , you 'll want to see useful operational reporting that quickly lets you see what has been done and what needs to be addressed .
Make sure the reports deliver the information you want at the level of detail you need .
For example , rule usage can change over time .
A rule that was optimally placed at first may become a bottleneck as it's hit with more and more traffic , and may need to be moved up in the hierarchy .
Finally , high - level reports can demonstrate overall improvements in efficiency and security , as well as highlight which business units may be lax in properly managing their networks .
DO consider workflow integration .
Most vendors offer complimentary workflow products to integrate their core capabilities with change - management workflow tools , such as ticketing systems .
This may not be important if your organization has a well - defined process and supporting tools , either homegrown or commercial .
But some companies find this capability useful in automating their change - management programs .
DON'T give short shrift to hardware , especially if you are running one of these products in a virtual environment in which resource - sharing may be an issue .
Make sure you have enough CPU and memory muscle to support the product under live conditions , and make provisions for growth as traffic increases .
Alternatively , you could go with one of the three appliance - based solutions Tufin offers in addition to its software .
DO review and refine your policies and procedures before buying and deploying a firewall audit product .
Enterprise IT governance and information security is built on well - defined policies and processes .
Technological tools reduce error , improve efficiency and automate analysis that frustrates manual efforts , but you wo n't get their full benefit if you are simply throwing technology at a problem .
Every organization is different , but here are some basic guidelines :

Arizona 's politicians are teaching the nation that the uproar about immigration is n't about crime or " enforcing federal law , " but about racism and bigotry .
PROTESTS AGAINST
Major League Baseball 's Arizona Diamondbacks are planned for this Saturday at Turner Field in Atlanta and next Monday in Miami when the D - backs play the Florida Marlins .
Both demonstrations are aimed at Arizona 's anti-immigrant Senate Bill 1070 and both look like they will draw serious numbers .
In Atlanta , at a protest designed to call on Major League Baseball to pull the 2011 All - Star Game out of Arizona , nearly 100 people have confirmed that they will attend .
As Phil Aliff , an Iraq war vet and protest organizer , said to me :
We 're protesting at the Diamondbacks game in order to send a clear message to Major League Baseball , the state of Arizona and legislatures across the country that racial profiling and scapegoating is unacceptable .
Everywhere the Diamondbacks go , we should demand that Major League Baseball pull the All - Star Game out of Arizona in order to hit the state where it really hurts ... its wallet .
In Miami , the Florida Immigrant Coalition ( FLIC ) , South Florida Jobs with Justice , SEIU Florida , UNITE HERE Local 355 , the Episcopal Diocese of Southeast Florida , the Rabbinical Association of Greater Miami and South Florida AFL - CIO are all on board .
The protests matter because they allow people to nationalize an issue that far transcends the state of Arizona .
They also shine a light on Diamondbacks CEO Ken Kendrick who while he says through his public relations people that he opposes the bill , continues to support and promote politicians who wear SB 1070 as a badge of honor .
NOW WE have another reason to isolate , expose and protest Ken Kendrick , the Diamondbacks , and the state of Arizona .
Gov. Jan Brewer just signed into law a bill that should curl the toes of anyone with a thread of anti-racist conscience .
Thanks to HB 2281 , the Tucson school district 's academically successful ethnic studies program has been outlawed .
Brewer made this move hours after United Nations Human Rights Commission formally opposed the bill on the basis that any ethnic group has the inherent right to learn their own history .
The Tucson ethnic studies program , which serves 1,500 primarily Mexican students , is an interdisciplinary curriculum that focuses on contributions made by Mexican Americans , African Americans and Native Americans in literature , history and science .
Featured at Socialism Hear Dave Zirin at Socialism 2010 in Chicago and Oakland , speaking on " Here Come Los Suns : Sports and Resistance to Arizona 's SB 1070 . "
Check out the Socialism 2010 Web site for more details .
See you at Socialism !
Destroying the program has long been a pet project of State schools chief Tom Horne , who in the words of the Associated Press " believes the Tucson school district 's Mexican - American studies program teaches Latino students that they are oppressed by white people . "
Well , if students did n't believe it before , they would be forgiven for believing it now .
Ironically , Horne 's crusade was inspired when a Tucson guest speaker , United Farm Workers leader Dolores Huerta , said in a classroom in 2006 that " Republicans hate Mexicans . "
Hard to see how this bill will persuade any students from agreeing with this assessment .
Horne is running for state attorney general , and he clearly sees wedge politics as a path to promotion .
The bill 's chief promoter in the state Senate is Russell Pearce , who in addition to being the sponsor of SB 1070 , has gotten in hot water for hugging neo -Nazis on camera and forwarding e-mails from white supremacist websites .
Pearce said on the Senate floor , " History is one thing .
Misinformation , hateful speech , sedition is not appropriate with my tax dollars . "
No , but ordering police to stop people without just cause and having the state monitor classrooms for " sedition " is , in his twisted mind , appropriate use of public money .
The bill is equally twisted .
HB 2281 bill specifically forbids classes that :
1. Promote the overthrow of the United States government .
2. Promote resentment toward a race or class of people .
3 . Are designed primarily for pupils of a particular ethnic group .
4. Advocate ethnic solidarity instead of the treatment of pupils as individuals .
The first two points are dime - store fear - mongering .
There is zero evidence that " revolution " was being taught in Tucson public schools , and the idea that a child learning about their ethnic heritage " promotes resentment " is another right - wing canard .
It 's the last two points that expose the real goals of this bill : HB 2281 proponents do n't want a growing Mexican population seeing the benefits -- as every ethnic group in the history of the United States has done -- of finding a common political interest .
Political bottom feeders like Tom Horne , intellectual lightweights like Jan Brewer and stone - cold racists like Russell Pearce worship at the altar of ignorance , and want the students of Tucson to do the same .
But through both SB 1070 and HB 2281 , they are actually giving all of us quite the political science lesson .
They are teaching the nation that none of this is about immigration , crime or " enforcing federal law . "
It 's really about , as right - wing radio hero Michael Savage thunders , " Borders , language and culture . "
As a friend of mine , who is a prominent sports radio producer ( and who happens to be white ) said to me , " If anyone does n't think this is about race and the anger toward immigrants is n't about race , they 're living in an alternate universe .
This is about people being afraid that the Mayberry country they were sold is changing , and they do n't like it . "
If Ken Kendrick truly believes that SB 1070 is bad law , if he objects to HB 2281 , he needs stop funding the very politicians who promote it .
Until then , we should protest the D - backs at every opportunity .
The times demand nothing less .

Last week , I wrote up
It was well received , and I ’m a feedback junkie , so I ’m considering making this a regular thing .
I hope you enjoy this as much as I did .
One hint : I shared all of these on Twitter — so if you want to learn this things as I do , it ’s best to follow me there .

1 ) In Hong Kong , they drive on the left .
In China , they drive on the right .
The bridge between them is TOTALLY SCARY .
Someone I follow on Google Reader shared this blog post by Jason Kottke explaining the problem .
But really , the picture sums it up :
Check out the right ( closer ) lane .
Watch as it dips below its starting point , coming just a few feet above the water (! ) .
Marvel as it passes under the previously left lane , and , effectively , flips itself into being the new left .
Gorgeous and horrific at the same time .
Update : Yeah , yeah , it ’s an artist ’s conception .
Still totally scary .
2 ) The New York City subway system accidentally renamed a station stop “ FML . ”
To the Internet generation , FML means something R-rated .
To the Metropolitian Transit Authority ( MTA ) , it means the F line , M line , and L line all stop here — “ here ” being 14th Street and 6th Avenue .
How did this happen ?
Due to service cuts and changes forced by a thinner budget , the MTA cut some lines and renamed others .
The M line now runs down 6th Avenue , and due to coloring conventions , is now orange , like the F .
( It used to be brown . )
The F and M intersect the L — which runs across 14th into Brooklyn — at 6th and 14th .
And F comes before L , so FM lead .
But the MTA is going to break convention after pictures like the one on the right popped up , surrounded by guffaws .
3 ) Planes sometimes run out of gas , requiring diversion to a nearby airport .
I met Michael Maney at the ReadWriteWeb Summit last week and have followed him on Twitter since .
He shared this tweet from Colleen Swanger , who I do n’t know from Adam ( Eve ? ) :
Thanks @delta for running out of gas .
Now my mother and I are going to miss her mother ’s funeral while stuck at LGA when we should be in BDL
The rest of the story :
Seriously @delta how do you run out of gas 75 miles short of your destination ?!?
( @ LaGuardia Airport ( LGA ) w/ 21 others )
Standing outside LGA with 100 others waiting for a bus to Hartford because a @delta plane ran out of gas .
Not kidding .
Or they are lying .
You can read more about the flight here .
The diversion cost passengers six hours — which is ridiculous , given the fact that a bus ride from New York ( where the plane landed ) to Hartford ( intended destination ) should be about half that .
It ’s mind - boggling .
How do you miscalculate the amount of fuel so badly that you end up having to land at an airport about 75 miles away ?
4 ) There ’s a secret , unused subway system underneath City Hall in Manhattan , which you can see if you stay on the downtown 6 one stop past the “ last ” official stop .
Around the turn of the century — the 1900s , that is — the powers that be decided that the Manhattan Main Line , now the 6 subway line in Manhattan , should terminate at City Hall .
The station , given its location and prominence , was designed to be a showcase of sorts .
But in the mid-1940s , longer trains made the station dangerous .
It was one of the least - used stations anyway , serving a mere 600 people a day , due to the proximity of the Brooklyn Bridge station just a few hundred feet away .
On the last day of 1945 , service to City Hall was discontinued , and the station has been closed , frozen in time , since .
But the station is still there , and to a degree , is still used .
The last stop on the downtown 6 is Brooklyn Bridge / City Hall , and the first stop uptown is in the same place .
But the trains need to turn around — and they do so by going through the old City Hall stop .
Which means if you stay on the train , you ’ll go through this station .
Which , apparently , is perfectly allowed .
But no , you ca n’t get out at City Hall .
There are tours of the station , and Ben Kabak of Second Ave .
Sagas was lucky enough to attend one .
He gathered photos in the gallery below :
5 ) Speaking about Manhattan subways : are more Subway “ restaurants ” than subway stations in Manhattan .
I think , for a long time , I always wondered this .
Not explicitly , of course , but subconsciously .
Grub Street has done the heavy lifting and found official counts , and determined that it ’s not particularly close : 171 “ sandwich ” shops to 147 train stops .
Brooklyn represents the city much more positively , with the trains winning , 170 to 70 .
It really is too bad that Manhattan is n’t in a dead heat — that would be reason enough to open the old City Hall stop .
Jan Lehnhardt keynote : simplicity ¶
A quote that ’s in every second keynote or so : simplicity is not when there ’s nothing left to add , but when there ’s nothing left to take away .
Steve Jobs : design is how it works .
In that sense we ’re all designers .
In the end everything is subdivided in layers .
Jan is going to take on a couple of them .
Text : the code you write .
A kid has an attention span of about 2 pages of code .
Your mum or dad about 6 .
The average number of bugs per 1000 lines of code is some 10 - 25 .
Irregardless of programming language .
So : write less code , you ’ll have less bugs .
Jan ’s involved with mustache , a template language .
They figured out that leaving features out made the template language actually better .
When Jan tried porting the template language from ruby to javascript , he was pleasantly surprised that the code was just three or four pages long , so he was able to port it in a weekend or so .
The current ruby version is much faster and more optimized , but the amount of code has skyrocketed .
Jan looked at it and decided he could never port that version .
Algorithms .
His javascript version was slow .
In the end he sped it up a lot by removing one expensive method .
The fastest code is the code you do n’t write .
Architecture .
Yesterday there was a presentation on NoSQL and how to support it in Django .
Someone suggested to add an extra layer to abstract away the differences .
That was quickly shot down : we do n’t want too much .
Data .
He ’s mostly skipping this .
UI .
Less is more .
Less means that it is easier to figure out what to do .
UX ( user experience ) .
Make your users smile .
Delete all the crappy code you ever wrote .
Keep the simple parts .
Clean up your code .
Alan Kay quote : [ for ] any product : simple things should be easy , and hard things should be possible .
Sometimes complexity is needed .
Where do you put it ?
Django ’s ORM is probably pretty complex .
A show of hands : 3 attendants actually work on the ORM .
The rest treats it as a black box .
It is perhaps fine if there ’s complexity inside something others can treat as a black box , assuming that ’s the correct place to place the complexity .
On twitter , @jacobian said I ’m pleased to hear @janl talk about the inherent tension in Django ’s “ perfectionists with deadlines ” slogan .
Too true .
Make the future simple .
" There 's an old saying about those who forget history .

Johnson
Peterson
We are sometimes , I think to our detriment , incapable of forgetting the last thing we 've seen , or imagining a future that does n't closely conform to the recent past .
Like an infant , we catalog what 's directly before us and assume it will ever be thus .
We watch the just - finished NBA Finals and decide we know exactly what 's going to happen in the next game based on the previous game , despite the lack of a consistent pattern .
We watch the Red Sox go 11 - 14 to start the season and declare them out of the AL East race .
We watch Stephen Strasburg post a few good starts and suddenly he 's a 300 - game winner .
( OK , that last one sounds kind of reasonable at the moment . )
More to the point :
We watch Chris Johnson dominate fantasy football in 2009 , and decide it would be stupid and indefensible not to call him the No. 1 overall pick for 2010 .
There 's nothing morally bankrupt about going by what we 've last seen .
Sometimes , it just can lead us toward too - easy answers .
I love Chris Johnson .
I feel like a good portion of my recent reputation as a fantasy " expert " rests on how highly I rated him entering ' 09 , and the degree to which I stuck by him even as he turned in a relatively pedestrian first five games last year ( 468 yards rushing , three total scores ) .
To say that he 's immensely talented is an understatement .
But even disregarding his current contract holdout , I 'm leery about making him the No. 1 overall selection in drafts this summer .
I prefer Adrian Peterson .
I know Peterson has his own blemishes .
His yards - per-carry average has declined from 5.6 to 4.8 to 4.4 in his first three NFL seasons , he lost six fumbles during the '09 regular season , and the Minnesota Vikings ' offensive line may be headed into decline .
And just as you can argue that Johnson 's insane skein of big plays last year might not repeat ( he had seven rushing touchdowns of at least 30 yards ) , it 's also understandable to be concerned that Peterson 's whopping 14 touchdowns from inside an opponent 's 5 will be hard to duplicate .
When making this decision -- Johnson versus Peterson -- I think there are two primary factors we need to consider .
First , is it likelier that a running back repeats a massively big - play - infused season , a la Johnson in '09 , or is it likelier that a running back repeats a high - touchdown season based primarily on short - yardage scores , a la Peterson in '09 ?
Second , there 's the question of Johnson 's usage in '09 .
He led the NFL in carries and in touches from scrimmage , and he 's not a big man .
Is it likely that he gets as many opportunities here in ' 10 ?
Chris Johnson's Big Plays
Those seven touchdown runs of 30 - plus yards that Johnson produced last season tied Jim Brown 's single - season NFL record from 1958 .
( Of course , Brown did it in 12 games . )
There have been only 26 instances in NFL history , dating back to 1940 , in which a running back has even produced as many as four such touchdown runs in a season .
Three of those performances were turned in last season : by Johnson ( seven ) , Jamaal Charles ( four ) and Maurice Jones - Drew ( four ) .
None of other 23 backs managed to rack up more than half the number of long - distance scores the following season .
This is certainly damning evidence to those who contend Johnson will break just as many long touchdowns in ' 10 as he did in '09 :
*- did not play in 1999 because of injury
But it would also be foolish of me to proclaim that the majority of Johnson 's fantasy value last season came from long touchdowns .
Certainly they helped .
In ESPN 's standard fantasy scoring system , Johnson received roughly 86 of his 329 fantasy points ( or 26.1 percent ) on those long scoring runs alone ( if we add together both the yardage points and the points for the touchdowns themselves ) ; in leagues in which bonuses are given for longer scores , that percentage obviously would be higher .
Yet a much greater percentage of Johnson 's NFL - best fantasy point total came from his overall yardage passing and receiving : 2,509 .
Yet I still do n't think we have our arms around just how repeatable ( or unrepeatable ) such a big - play season is for Johnson .
I 'll give another , more anecdotal reason for concern .
For the '09 season , Johnson accrued a whopping 693 rushing yards on carries that went for 30 - plus yards ( both touchdowns and non-touchdowns ) .
That 's about 35 percent of his rushing yardage .
I think it 's fair to say that if those breakaway runs are significantly diminished , CJ2K is coming back to the fantasy pack .
According to the Elias Sports Bureau , Johnson 's 693 such yards were the most in the NFL since 1997 , when Barry Sanders produced 701 rushing yards on carries that went for more than 30 yards .
How did Sanders follow up his incredible big - play season ?
In '98 , he produced just 335 rushing yards of that type .
In fact , the parallels between Sanders circa ' 97 and Johnson circa '09 go further than just the incredible amount of yards gained on big plays :
And check out what Sanders did for a follow - up :
Again , I 'm admitting up front that this is a cherry - picked argument .
Not only am I looking at just one season ( albeit the only vaguely recent season that compares in terms of big - play - heaviness ) , but Sanders was 28 years old in ' 97 , with eight NFL seasons already under his belt , and '98 was actually his final season in pro football ( though he made it through all 16 games , and obviously had a whole bunch of carries ) .
By contrast , Johnson just finished his second NFL season , and will only turn 25 in September .
Still , you 'll have to forgive me for leaning toward the conclusion that there are very few ( if any ) precedents in which we see seasons as big - play - heavy as the one Johnson produced in '09 repeat .
Adrian Peterson 's Vulture Scores
Since 1940 , there have been only 13 instance when a running back has scored 14 or more touchdowns from inside opponents ' 5 - yard line ( including Peterson 's 14 in 2010 ) for a season , and there have also been only 37 instances in which a running back has scored at least 12 such touchdowns .
Clearly , Peterson 's incredible short - TD work last season was no run -of - the - mill phenomenon , either .
His short touchdowns accounted for roughly 87 of his 265 fantasy points ( or 32.8 percent ) .
So I ask :
Is it more or less likely that this type of extraordinary production will go away in ' 10 , compared to Johnson 's long runs ?
Before AP did it , here were the 13 seasons of 14 - plus short scores , and those players ' follow - up efforts :
On average , these running backs saw their short scores level out at eight the following season .
( It 's also worth nothing that if you perform this same exercise with all the rushers who 've scored 12 - plus short scores in a season , you get similar results . )
So just as Johnson 's bailiwick -- the ridiculous ankle - breaking long run -- seems likely to be less common in ' 10 , Peterson 's '09 specialty -- the vulture score -- figures to partly vanish as well .
It 's well within reason to assert that Peterson 's short scores will decline from a whopping 14 to a more reasonable eight .
But what would that leave AP with ?
Since by definition he did n't derive many of his 1,819 yards from scrimmage via the short touchdown run , I do n't think we have to forecast a significant decline in his yardage in ' 10 , the way we do for Johnson .
Fine .
Give Peterson 12 total rushing touchdowns this season , but keep his yardage the same .
And give Johnson a standard decrease in yards and touchdowns , per our earlier discussion .
If we assume similar usage for each player from their stellar ' 09 seasons ( more on that in a moment ) , we 're left with this speculative 2010 comparison :
The advantage is still Johnson's , but the gap is far closer than it was in '09 .
This is already not a no - brainer .
The Curse Of 400 ?
And here 's where Johnson 's '09 usage comes in .
CJ2K had 408 touches from scrimmage last year , which ranks as the 35th - most in a single season in NFL history .
Before Johnson did it last year , there had been 40 seasons of 400 touches or more by a running back .
You 've probably heard about the Curse of 370 , and Tristan Cockcroft has written a fresh piece about it for our draft kit .
But that analysis focuses only on carries ; if you look at that stat , well , Johnson had 358 totes , so you might conclude , " Phew , he barely escaped and he 's good to go . "
But did he ?
Based on the following analysis , I 'm not so sure .
I think we may also be looking at the Curse of 400 : 400 overall touches from scrimmage , runs plus receptions .
Therefore , my final big remaining question is :
How do such high - usage backs ( 400 - plus total touches from scrimmage ) do in their follow - up seasons ?
Well , of those 40 seasons I mentioned , we throw out four , which would tilt the scales unfairly against Johnson : Eric Dickerson ( ' 87 ) did n't play during a work stoppage ; Emmitt Smith ( ' 93 ) held out for a better contract for two games ; Ricky Williams ( ' 04 ) retired ; and Jamal Lewis ( '04 ) was suspended for violating the league 's substance abuse policy .
Of the remaining 36 seasons :
• On average , these 36 rushers had 99 fewer touches than the year before .
• On average , these 36 rushers produced 85 fewer fantasy points than the year before .
• On average , these 36 rushers played in 2.1 fewer games than the year before .
• Five RBs ( 13.9 percent ) had more touches the next season .
• 30 RBs ( 83.3 percent ) had fewer touches the next season .
• One RB ( Curtis Martin in ' 99 ) had exactly the same number of touches the next season .
• Seven RBs ( 19.4 percent ) scored more fantasy points the next season .
• 29 RBs ( 80.6 percent ) scored fewer fantasy points the next season .
Now , I suppose this is n't absolutely shocking .
Even if a player does n't get hurt the year after an extreme - usage season , you can make the argument that his touches are likely to go down simply because they were such anomalies in the first place .
Thus I think the final piece of the puzzle is to see whether 400 really is a " magic " number , or whether players who log between , say , 350 and 399 touches in a season suffer the same decline in their subsequent seasons .
( Remember : Peterson was in that 350 - to - 399 range last year : he had 357 . )
Before last season , there were 122 running back seasons of between 350 and 399 touches .
Throw out 15 of those ( 11 took place in either 1981 or 1986 , meaning the subsequent year had a strike ; Barry Sanders ( ' 98 ) and Tiki Barber ( '06 ) retired before their next seasons ; Lydell Mitchell ( ' 77 ) and Walter Payton ( ' 77 ) did it in a year before the schedule expanded ) .
We 're left with 107 seasons .
Let 's see how much those players declined , compared to the declines we just talked about for the 400 club :
I do n't think there can be any doubt that , on average , players who 've just completed a season with Johnson 's usage pattern do worse than players who've just completed a season with Peterson 's usage pattern .
Let me also say that when you look at these lists of high - usage players , there are very few guys as small as Johnson , who 's generously listed at 5 - foot - 11 and 200 pounds .
I know that many folks like to defend CJ2K by comparing him to Sanders , another guy who made tacklers miss and was relatively small .
But realize this : Sanders never once had a 400 - touch season .
Not once .
So Chris Johnson literally just finished a season in which he was used more than Sanders ever was in his entire career .
That should give us pause , I think .
Conclusions
New York Times National reporter Jodi Rudoren ( formerly Jodi Wilgoren , and therein lies a self - absorbed tale ) has a Saturday front - page story on yet another investigation of a congressman , Rep. Alan Mollohan of West Virginia .
“ As lawmakers have increasingly slipped pet projects into federal spending bills over the past decade , one lawmaker has used his powerful perch on the House Appropriations Committee to funnel $ 250 million into five nonprofit organizations that he set up .
Those actions have prompted a complaint to federal prosecutors that questions whether any of that taxpayer money helped fuel a parallel growth in his personal fortune .
“ The most ambitious effort by the congressman , Alan B. Mollohan , is a glistening glass - and - steel structure with a swimming pool , sauna and spa rising in a former cow pasture in Fairmont , W.Va. , thanks to $ 103 million of taxpayer money he garnered through special spending allocations known as earmarks . ”
Notice anything missing ?
Right .
Although the rumor around D.C. is that Mollohan is a Democrat , Rudoren does n’t inform us of that fact until this casual line in the eighth paragraph : “ The case has led several Republican leaders to call for Mr. Mollohan 's removal from the House ethics committee , where he is the senior Democrat . ”
Contrast that with how readily Carl Hulse reported the Republican status of Rep. Randy Cunningham in one of the first stories on the now - jailed congressman ’s legal woes , from July 15 , 2005 : “ Under investigation for a real estate deal and his ties to a military contractor , Representative Randy Cunningham , an eight - term Republican , announced Thursday that he would not seek re-election next year in his district in the San Diego area . ”
And John Broder ’s November 29 , 2005 lead left no doubt as to Cunningham ’s party affiliation .
“ Representative Randy Cunningham , a Republican from San Diego , resigned from Congress on Monday , hours after pleading guilty to taking at least $ 2.4 million in bribes to help friends and campaign contributors win military contracts . ”
