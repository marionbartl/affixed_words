( CNN ) --
When Julian Asher listens to an orchestra , he does n't just hear music ; he also sees it .
The sounds of a violin make him see a rich burgundy color , shiny and fluid like a red wine , while a cello's music flows like honey in a golden yellow hue .
Julian Asher , genetics researcher and amateur photographer , can see colors in response to sounds .
Asher , a researcher in the department of genomic medicine at Imperial College London , has a rare condition called synesthesia , a neurological condition in which people experience a mixing of their senses .
People with the condition may see colors and movement in numbers , words or sounds .
As many as 1 percent of people have the most recognizable form of synesthesia , studies say .
Acclaimed Russian - American author Vladimir Nabokov , who wrote " Lolita , " famously had the disorder , as did physicist Richard Feynman and composer Franz Liszt .
" Since a subtle interaction exists between sound and shape , I see q as browner than k , while s is not the light blue of c , but a curious mixture of azure and mother - of - pearl , " Nabokov wrote in his memoir " Speak , Memory . "
Psychologists have known for more than a century that synesthesia runs in families -- Nabokov 's mother and son Dimitri also displayed forms of it -- but the specific genes have not been found .

Now , Asher and colleagues in the United Kingdom have done what they say is the first genetic analysis of synesthesia .
Their findings are published this week in the American Journal of Human Genetics .
Researchers collected DNA from 196 people from 43 families in which there were multiple members with synesthesia .
They looked exclusively at auditory - visual synesthesia , the kind where sound triggers color , which is easier to diagnose than other possible forms .

They expected to find a single gene responsible for synesthesia , but they found that the condition was linked to regions on chromosomes 2 , 5 , 6 , and 12 -- four distinct areas instead of one .
" It means that the genetics of synesthesia are much more complex than we thought , " Asher said .
Brain scans have shown that people with synesthesia seem to have " cross - wiring " between brain regions , said Dr. V.S. Ramachandran , director of the Center for Brain and Cognition at the University of California , San Diego .
" Nobody really had the evidence pinning it down to specific genes in specific chromosomes , and I 'm delighted to hear somebody 's done that , " Ramachandran said .
" Cross - wiring " was shown in a study led by J.A. Nunn at Goldsmiths College , London , which found that the visual areas of the brain were activated in response to sound in people for whom sound triggers color .
Given that a normal infant 's brain has excess connections between brain regions , one hypothesis is that synesthesia results when the genes that " prune " these connections away are mutated , Ramachandran said .
In other words , people with synesthesia may have brain connections that would normally disappear at an early age .
Genes found in the areas of Asher 's study have been connected to other mental disorders .
For example , genes on chromosome 2 have also been linked to autism , Asher said .
The link between synesthesia and autism is controversial and speculative , but one of Asher 's previous case studies suggests a connection .
The man he examined had Asperger 's syndrome -- a mild , high - functioning form of autism -- and also had an extraordinary memory capacity for numbers .
In fact , he memorized 22,000 digits of the number pi .
The man 's process of remembering these numbers is not simple rote recall .
Instead , it is as though he were navigating a landscape , Asher said .
" He says it 's like walking along a path , " Asher said .
The man 's ability to focus intently on a dry subject is associated with Asperger 's , but it's also synesthesia that helps him memorize numbers , Asher said .
In fact , in this sense , synesthesia is a form of photographic memory .
One suggestion is that synesthesia and autism in a single person may make him or her a savant , someone with a singular and extreme intellectual ability .
Children with synesthesia will often show signs of it in school , because it slows down reading for some kids and makes lectures difficult to absorb for others .
As awareness of learning differences grows in schools , more children are coming forward and explaining that they have trouble , leading to more diagnoses , Asher said .
Interventions may include written notes or books on tape for those whose synesthesia interferes with , respectively , listening or reading .
To what extent do children with synesthesia grow up to become artists and poets ?
The connection is controversial , in spite of prominent examples such as Nabokov , Asher said it 's a misconception that most synesthetes go into creative disciplines .
His database of 900 people with the condition does not have a disproportionate number in artistic professions .
In Asher 's own case , nonverbal noises such as a fire alarm or a piece of music will trigger visual sensations .
When he was a child , Asher would go to the symphony with his parents and assumed that the lights went down so that everyone could see the colors better .
" I mean , why else would they do it ? " he said .
" My parents asked something , and I said , ' Oh , they turned the lights off so you could see the colors , ' and they had no idea what I was talking about , and that 's when I realized that they did n't see what I saw , " he said .
He never knew that his condition had a name until he happened to be researching the genetics of perfect pitch , which has been anecdotally linked with synesthesia .
" Even to this day , I 'll run into people who study neuroscience for a living , and they 've never heard of it , " he said .
There are organizations that promote awareness , but still a lot of people do n't know about it , he said .
Green Home
Welcome to greenhomebuilding .com where you can find a wide range of information about sustainable architecture and natural building .
As an example of natural building , the image above is of the earthbag house that served as the home for greenhomebuilding .com and Kelly and Rosana Hart , your hosts , for many years .
The reason for building greener homes is really quite important .
We need to live more lightly on the earth , because the degradation of our environment is compromising not only our survival , but the survival of most other living beings on the planet .
We can no longer ignore the impact we have on the earth 's ecosystems .
The way we live , the choices we make in providing for our needs , will have an enormous influence on the quality of life of those who will follow us .
Now is the time to take responsibility for the consequences of our life styles !
How we build our homes , both in design and choice of materials , is one of the most significant ways that we can affect our future .
Much of the concern boils down to the use of energy .
How much energy is embodied in the building materials themselves , in their transportation and assembling ?
Then once the house is built , how much energy does it consume to keep its inhabitants comfortable ?
Consumption of energy has a direct influence on environmental quality , because of the inherent pollution through greenhouse gasses and other emissions .
Then there is the loss of natural beauty , ecosystems and basic resources associated with the extraction of fossil fuels and building materials .
The combined effect of this is staggering .
Resources for studying how we interact with our environment and ways to improve this relationship can be found within the page about the Environment .
There are some very simple ways to design houses that require very little energy to keep them comfortable .
The list of links under Sustainable Architecture outline thirteen points to keep in mind when designing or remodeling a sustainable house .
Using natural , non-industrial materials , as outlined in the links under Natural building will improve the energy equation when building .
Examining the Vernacular Architecture of other cultures can provide many ideas for beauty , energy efficiency and appropriate use of materials .

Baffled city investigators began calling them “ maple syrup events ” : mysterious waves of sweet - smelling air that periodically wafted over Manhattan , delighting some , troubling others and vanishing as quickly as they had arrived .
After each episode  in 2005 , 2006 and again this year  residents flooded the city ’s 311 information hot line with calls .
The city ’s Department of Environmental Protection dispatched air testers .
But nobody could pinpoint the smell  or its source .
So the aroma was filed away as another vexing urban mystery , never to be solved .
Until now .
The city revealed on Thursday that the culprit was the seeds of fenugreek , a cloverlike plant , which are used to produce fragrances at a factory across the Hudson River in North Bergen , N.J .
It turned out that the city had never given up trying to determine the aroma ’s origin .
It had quietly created a crack maple - syrup team that remained on the case .
The North Bergen factory , owned by a company called Frutarom , used the herbal seeds to manufacture food flavors , releasing a pungent , generally pleasant smell in the process .
Under the right weather conditions  high humidity , no rain  the aroma drifts across the Hudson onto the West Side of Manhattan .
Green Mountain Coffee Getting Some Help From Solar Power
March 2nd , 2009 by Dave Tyler
Green Mountain Coffee Roasters is getting a little greener .
The Waterbury , Vt. , coffee maker is adding 530 solar panels to the roof of its distribution center .
When complete it will be the largest solar installation in Vermont , the company said .
The 100 kilowatt system will only provide a small percentage of the power the coffee company needs , but the real value of the system is demonstrating that solar can work for business in the Northeast , the company said .
“ Renewable energy must be a part of our overall energy strategy , ” Paul Comey , Vice President of Environmental Affairs for Green Mountain Coffee Roasters , Inc. , said in a statement .
“ We
want to show our state and federal governments that solar energy works , and that we need
a policy that provides a broad - reaching structure for renewable energy . ”
The company told a local TV station the project will cost about $ 750,000 , but was made more affordable by a $ 250,000 grant from the state ’s Clean Energy Development Fund and a $ 50,000 grant from Green Mountain Power .
Work will begin in the spring and should be complete by summer .
In January the company reported first quarter earnings that beat expectations and boosted its earning estimates for the full year .
This is the latest in a slew of sustainability efforts from Green Mountain Coffee , which back in 2005 helped bring organic fair trade coffee to McDonald’s .
The company announced last month that it is teaming up with JustMeans.com to hold a contest soliciting the best ideas to combat climate change from nonprofit organizations .
Four winning organizations will each receive a $ 200,000 grant to help execute their ideas .

Given enough notice of a possible collision , the space station can fire thrusters to move out of the way – eight such ‘ avoidance manoeuvres ’ have been made in the past .
But on Thursday , the threat of a collision was discovered too late to move the station , so the crew took shelter in a docked Soyuz spacecraft ( Image : NASA ) Soyuz spacecraft docked to the space station act as lifeboats in case of an emergency ( Image : NASA )
In a rare move , the three crew members of the International Space Station briefly evacuated the station and took shelter in a docked Soyuz spacecraft today due to the threat of a possible collision with a piece of space junk , NASA says .
Advertisement
The agency says the threat has now passed and the crew will return to the station , but the last - minute move highlights how difficult it is to determine the paths of space debris that follow certain kinds of orbits .
Tracking data suggested that the debris , a 13 - centimetre - wide piece of a spent satellite motor called PAM - D ( unrelated to debris from last month ’s satellite crash ) , could come within about 4.5 kilometres of the station at 1239 EDT ( 1639 GMT ) .
That sounds like a safe enough distance , but it was too close for NASA ’s comfort .
That ’s because there was a lot of uncertainty in the measurement due to the elongated orbit of the debris , says Gene Stansbery , NASA ’s orbital debris programme manager .
“ They were n’t confident of that 4.5 - km miss distance , ” he told New Scientist .
And the consequences of a possible collision could have been dire .
If the debris hit a pressurised module in the station , “ it could punch a hole in it ” and cause the module to lose pressurisation critical to the crew ’s survival , Stansbery says .
“ If you had something the size and weight of a nickel coin going at 10 km / s ” – the estimated relative speed between the station and the PAM - D debris – “ then it has the equivalent energy of a small car at 50 miles per hour ( 80 km / h ) , ” he says .
“ Thirteen centimetres is much larger than that . ”
Little warning
The possible collision was only discovered on Wednesday night , Stansbery says – not enough time to move the space station away from the debris .
As a result , at 1140 EDT ( 1540 GMT ) on Thursday , crew members Mike Fincke , Yury Lonchakov and Sandra Magnus were told that they would be taking refuge in the Soyuz , a docked Russian spaceship that could bring the crew back to Earth in case of an emergency on the station .
The three made their way to the Soyuz so they could quickly close the hatches in case the debris damaged the station and they had to undock .
Such evacuations are “ very rare ” , NASA spokesman William Jeffs told New Scientist .
At 1245 EDT ( 1645 GMT ) , NASA says the crew was notified that the threat had passed and told to return to the station .
But the temporary evacuation raises questions about why NASA had such little warning before the potential collision .
Elongated orbit
Stansbery says the orbit of the debris is to blame .
The debris is a weight that was jettisoned into space after it was used to slow the spin of a satellite that launched in 1993 .
He says the debris might have a mass of a couple of kilograms .
The debris travels on a very elongated , or eccentric , orbit around Earth , coming within about 150 km of the planet and venturing as far away as about 4200 km .
Because it comes so close to Earth , it goes through a fairly significant amount of the Earth ’s atmosphere , says Stansbery .
“ How much atmospheric drag it gets is not something that can be predicted very well , ” he says .
“ It ’s hard to predict from one orbit to the next where the object ’s going to be . ”
Moreover , the fact that it travels so far away from Earth also makes it hard to track .
That ’s because ground - based radar dishes essentially see objects within a “ cone ” of a certain size around Earth .
When the object is far away in its orbit , it is harder to detect with radar because it goes outside that cone .
“ It does n’t come within the field of view of radars as often as something in a circular orbit would , ” he says .
“ There are fewer tracking opportunities . ”
News of the debris threat was first reported by NASASpaceflight.com .

In my attempts to fight my own boredom , as an unemployed hacker [ 1 ] , I took on myself to do something : porting Tomboy to C ++.
It is actually not that hard , just a lot of work to do manually because there is over a dozen of thousands of lines of code .
This show me that the door is open to reimplementing Gtk# software ( or parts ) in C++ with not too many problems , making it easy to have them available for C applications .
Nonetheless there are still some challenges :
Garbage collection : I replaced this with a combination of Gtkmm memory management , std::tr1:: shared_ptr<> and stack allocated object .
Seems to be working so far .
I could also be using a garbage collector , but it seems to be unecessary .
String and file path utilities : Boost has string algorithms and Boost .
Filesystem XML : while XML parsing is not a big issue with the various libraries available , APIs have enough difference to make it non-trivial .
I also had to write a convenient wrapper of xmlTextWriter to make my life easier .
Add-ins : I do n't have the support for generic addins as found in Mono .
No big deal , I implemented a factory in a few lines with a couple of macros .
Some core features are actually implemented as add-ins , so I had to do it .
Dynamic loading should n't be too hard .
regex : some of these core feature use regulars expression .
Not a big deal if it was n't for apparently different syntax .
To help all of this , I have implemented a small library ( in the same tree ) called " sharp " aimed at helping port from Gtk# .
In addition to boost , I also make an extensive use of Gtkmm and libxml ++.
* Rights group says Israel violated " laws of war " in Gaza
* Israeli army investigating use of white phosphorus
* Army knew from start civilians at risk , group says
( Adds Israeli comment )
By Adam Entous
JERUSALEM , March 25 ( Reuters ) -
The Israeli army unlawfully fired white phosphorus shells over densely populated areas of the Gaza Strip during its recent offensive , needlessly killing and injuring civilians , Human Rights Watch said on Wednesday .
Citing Israel 's use of white phosphorus as evidence of war crimes , the group said the army knew the munitions threatened the civilian population but " deliberately or recklessly " continued to use them until the final days of the Dec. 27 - Jan. 18 operation " in violation of the laws of war " .
The Human Rights Watch report , one of several issued by international organisations to sharply criticise Israel 's conduct , called on senior military commanders to be held to account , and urged the United States , which supplied the shells , to launch its own investigation .
The Israeli army announced after the war that it would conduct an internal probe .
" We 're checking the claims we received from different NGOs ... of using white phosphorus shells in illegal ways , according to those claims , and this is what we 're investigating , " an Israeli military spokeswoman , Major Avital Leibovich , said .
White phosphorus ignites on contact with oxygen and continues burning at up to 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit ( 816 degrees Celsius ) until none is left or the oxygen supply is cut .
It is often used to produce smoke screens , but can also be used as a weapon , producing extreme burns if it makes contact with skin .
When used in open areas , white phosphorus munitions are permissible under international law .
But Human Rights Watch said Israel " unlawfully " fired them over populated neighbourhoods , killing and wounding civilians and damaging civilian structures , including a school , a market , a humanitarian aid warehouse and a hospital .
" In Gaza , the Israeli military did n't just use white phosphorus in open areas as a screen for its troops , " said senior Human Rights Watch researcher Fred Abrahams .
" It fired white phosphorus repeatedly over densely populated areas , even when its troops were n't in the area and safer smoke shells were available .
As a result , civilians needlessly suffered and died . "
The group gave no precise casualty figures , citing the difficulty of determining in every case which burn injuries were caused by white phosphorous .
SHELLS LANDED IN CIVILIAN AREAS
Human Rights
Watch researchers found spent shells , canister liners , and remnants white phosphorus on city streets , apartment roofs , residential courtyards and at a United Nations school .
The report documented several attacks involving white phosphorus , including one on January 4 that killed five members of Ahmad Abu Halima 's family in northern Gaza , saying it found remnants of the substance at their home .
" I was talking with my father when the shell landed .
It hit directly on my father and cut his head off , " the 22 - year - old said .
The rights ' group said the army knew that white phosphorus threatened civilians , citing an internal medical report about the risk of " serious injury and death when it comes into contact with the skin , is inhaled or is swallowed " .
Israel launched the offensive with the declared aim of halting cross - border rocket fire by militants in the Hamas - ruled territory , home to 1.5 million Palestinians .
Over the 22 days of fighting , 1,417 Palestinians were killed , including 926 civilians , according to the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights .
Israel disputes those figures , and has accused Hamas of putting civilians at risk by using them as " human shields " .
At a briefing on white phosphorus arranged by the Israeli army , retired Lt. Col .
Shane Cohen , an artillery expert , said the munitions are used to create a smoke screen for troops and " would n't be an effective weapon " .
" When we fire , we 're not firing on civilians , " he said .
Retired Lt. Col. David Benjamin , an international law expert , said : " Even if there is room for debate here about the legality of the use of these munitions and the circumstances of the use of these munitions , we 're still far away from any talk about war crimes .
And that is because war crimes deal with grave breaches of international law . "

I spent most of the NYC ComicCon lurching in circles with my mouth half - open , hunting for a copy of Detective Comics # 587 and spending way too much money on plastic bullshit that reminds me of my childhood .
The experience was spectacular .
I have n’t been to a comic book convention since 1991 , in Virginia Beach — the whole enterprise was dusty , pasty and pungent .
Not now , baby .
Now that comics , computers and sci-fi are billion dollar businesses , nerds are out of the basement and blinking in the klieg lights .
Pop culture ’s always been a byproduct of marketing campaigns , but we are now in a golden age of hype and shiny bullshit .
Today ’s thirtysomethings were the target audience back in the ’70s and ’ 80s when Star Wars , Indiana Jones , and other pop mythologies did the first Triple Lindy into the collective consciousness .
Now we ’re just old enough to have kids who get just as pumped about Star Wars as we did , and fetishizing fictional universes is a family affair .
Whenever alien archaeologists unearth whatever temples we leave behind , they ’re gonna think that Spiderman was our God and stormtroopers were some kind of high priests .
Frankly , I ’m thrilled .
Digging through comic boxes and buckets of chipped action figures gets me all stoked and unstuck in time and I get the same sense of wow , cool wonder that I got when my dad took me to see Star Wars for the first time .
But this thing was for everybody .
Really , it was just like the Mermaid Parade except indoors and marginally less sexualized .
The people - watching and the costumes were spectacular and totally worth the admission price .
This is my favorite photo from this weekend ’s NYC ComicCon , but there ’s a lot more after the jump :
When I first passed the guy above , the look on his face was perfect : slack - jawed , lips hanging open with a drool stalagmite beginning to form .
I stopped and started to take his photo , and he instantly began to pose .
I totally forgot my manners and said “ no , no , do what you were doing before , walking around with your mouth all hanging open . ”
What you see here is a sort of halfway pose between the gaping maw and the cocky grin .
It ’s almost impossible to take candid photos at a comic convention .
It ’s a lot like a drag show in that regard .
Everyone ’s put so much effort into drawing attention to themselves that they pose as soon as they see a camera lens .
This is pretty much the single coolest image I saw all day — a unabashed reference to Prince ’s “ Purple Rain , ” but in Batgirl form .
Check out the Adam West - style Batman back in the doorway .
I would really love to have video of this guy ’s helmet getting decorated like this .
This was hands - down the coolest and scariest costume on the premises Saturday .
There ’s another photo for reference in my gallery .
The guy in there is on stilts and wearing this Hulk - style scarecrow robot shell .
If I ’d seen it as an 8 - year - old , I ’d still be wetting my pants .
This is how you know you ’re at a comic convention , Renaissance Faire or something like it , when you see this kind of setup on a table .
There was also a well - stocked open - air corset booth with a sign that said “ ABSOLUTELY no photography ! ”
I saw this one woman lacing herself into a corset , and I have to say that it enhanced her cleavage pretty dramatically .
But because this a comic convention , the enhanced cleavage was in the middle of her back .
This guy was dressed up like a banana with a Watchmen smiley face on it .
No real reason .
You ca n’t see it in the photo , but the banana suit was filthy , like he ’d worn it while sleeping on the subway .
I think this costume was created as a joke , but it ’s the most realistic Spider - Man costume ever , if you think about it .
According to the legend , a teenaged Peter Parker whipped together some Spidey duds real quick one weekend .
It ’s a lot more believable that he made them out of old jammies and bathrobes than whatever super - polymers they dress Tobey Maguire in in the movies .
I especially love the peeling , busted eyepiece .
The best part was seeing folks half in an half out of their costumes at the end of a long day , when the makeup ’s smeary and the suit is saggy and everyone ’s had a long long day .
This trooper ’s so over it right here .
There ’s a lot more photos in this set , if you want to see more .
Me , I ’m going to rest my legs , eyes and wallet for another year .
Very impressive detail in this model train diorama .
Way better than my childhood toy set !

-- Martin Brodeur
" It 's kind of hard for any athlete to think that he 's going to be able to get a record like that , especially for goaltending .
I think this is what the ultimate record is , I think in my mind with having the most wins .
I never thought that it was going to be possible , but definitely along the way , getting closer and closer , I knew it was going to happen eventually . "
--
As soon as the clock high above the Prudential Center ice struck zero , Martin Brodeur learned what the view from the top really looks like .
It 's exhilarating .
Brodeur 's three Stanley Cup rings and four Vezina trophies would suggest he 's already a Hall of Famer .
But on St. Patrick 's Day with spring in the air in North Jersey , the Devils ' superstar goalie improved upon greatness with a 3 - 2 victory over the Chicago Blackhawks , his 552nd victory in a career that still has a few more years to go .
" It 's kind of hard for any athlete to think that he 's going to be able to get a record like that , especially for goaltending , " an elated Brodeur said in a crowded post - game news conference .
" I think this is what the ultimate record is , I think in my mind with having the most wins .
I never thought that it was going to be possible , but definitely along the way , getting closer and closer , I knew it was going to happen eventually .
" Win No. 552 came over the young Blackhawks .
It came over a rival goalie , Nikolai Khabibulin , who has been one of the few that has gotten the best of Brodeur in his career .
It came nine straight and ( all - but - one ) superb games after returning from an injury that shelved him for more than four months .
" At this stage of his career , " Blackhawks coach Joel Quenneville said of Brodeur , " he 's as good as ever .
" Most important , though , win No. 552 came in front of his adoring father -- who was capturing history through his lens throughout the night -- his children , wife , brothers , closest friends and in front of 17,625 fans who lined Edison Street hours before the game to gobble up the remaining tickets and chanted " Mar-ty , Mar-ty " all night long .
"
It 's been kind of chaotic for me the last few days , but it was an awesome night , a great reception from the fans and my teammates , " Brodeur said .
" Pretty cool , you know .
I thought it was pretty cool in Montreal ( Saturday night ) , and this topped it .
It was awesome .
" Brodeur did n't have much chance to relax Tuesday night .
Even though the Devils took a 2 - 0 lead just 6:01 into the game and scored again to make it 3 - 0 with 3:04 to play in the second period , the Blackhawks did n't stop coming .
Brodeur had to stop 14 shots in the first period and was close to taking a shutout into the second intermission until Cam Barker 's rocket from the point found its way past Brodeur with 2:32 to play in the period .
It was the Hawks 26th shot of the game .
They finished with 32 .
Then , with the clock ticking down toward two minutes remaining in the third , Hawks wing Dustin Byfuglien found the back of the net , putting everybody in the building on edge .
Even Brodeur admitted he was a bit nervous , and that 's totally out of character .
" With 10 minutes left I 'm like , ' All right , this is going to probably happen here , ' and I was kind of looking at the clock , " Brodeur said .
" I was a clock - watcher a little bit , but everything fell when two minutes came and they scored .
' All right , I 've got two minutes to kill . '
So it made it tough a little bit to spend the last few minutes , but we got it done .
" With 8.9 seconds left , Brodeur was looking to his left as John Madden and Jonathan Toews lined up for a faceoff in the near circle .
Khabibulin was on the bench , so this was a 6 - on - 5 advantage for the Hawks , and Toews won the draw .
Troy Brouwer snapped off a 23 - foot shot on goal that Brodeur kicked into the corner as deftly as he has done so many times .
He left no chance for a rebound and the crowd roared as the clock finally drained to all zeroes .
" The last minute … seemed like it took forever , " Devils coach Brent Sutter said .
Brodeur leaped into the air like a little boy and was immediately enveloped by his joyful teammates .
The crowd stood chanting as Brodeur took off his mask , threw on a Devils ' cap and gave the first of many waves .
" It 's finally over , " Brodeur said after being asked to describe that moment .
" I think the road to it was pretty easy to a certain extent .
I did n't have to have the hiccups of losing a couple of games and have it in the back of my mind .
And that was one thing I feared a little bit .
When I heard the buzzer , I was like , ' Wow , it 's over now . '
This is good .
" Actually , the hard part was just about to start .
The ice crew brought him a pair of scissors so he could cut the net off the goal he defended in the first and third periods , but Brodeur looked like he was having a hard time with it , so backup goalie Kevin Weekes skated over to lend a hand .
Brodeur did n't just want a piece of the net , he wanted the whole thing .
That 's what Roy did after he broke Terry Sawchuk 's longtime record of 447 wins in Oct. 18 , 2000 , and this was his turn to do the same as his former idol .
He just could have used some sharper clippers .
" It 's definitely harder than I think , " Brodeur said with a smile when asked about trying to cut the netting off the goal .
" These basketball players , it 's only a little net .
This is a big net .
I had the help of a couple of my teammates .
That was nice of them .
" Captain Jamie Langenbrunner skated over to Brodeur and told him to go take a lap , that the rest of the guys would handle cutting the net .
He took off and went around the ice , waving incessantly as he tried to locate his family in a suite above the Zamboni entrance .
" I 've done it ( take a lap ) with the Stanley Cup on top of my head as a team thing , but that was really on a personal thing and it was pretty cool , " Brodeur said .
" It was definitely a great moment for me .
" Once back inside the dressing room , Brodeur was greeted by his family , including his father , Denis Sr . " Like any good photographer he did n't want to miss taking pictures with me and that winning puck , " Brodeur said .
" That was his main goal after the hug .
" Brodeur left for the showers and emerged 10 minutes later clean and suited up , necktie and all , so he could meet NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman in the hallway for a few congratulatory words .
He did two interviews before making his way to the podium .
He looked like a king walking to his throne .
" A record like this speaks for itself , " Sutter said .
" He 's got the most wins of all time by any goaltender that 's ever played the game . "

This first part aims at explaining how Ruby in the background is not Ruby anymore .
In the next part I ’m going to talk about HOW to bridge some existing C library with your ruby application .
As you might know already , the official ruby interpreter is written in pure C .
This means that whenever you type a ruby instruction , the interpreter will call the corresponding C function for you .
For example , if you do :
arr = Array.new
Ruby will call a C function ( probably rb_ary_new ) and a C structure will be created to hold the content of arr .
When you will try to access arr later in your code , the interpreter will use that same C structure .
On the ruby side of things we say that everything is an object .
On the C side of things we say that everything is a VALUE
You also already know that everything in ruby is an object .
To represent this reality on the C side of things , a custom type ( typedef ) has been created and has been given the name of VALUE .
This type is a pointer ( well , in fact it is not really a pointer but we wo n’t go into this right now ) that can reference any kind of data type .
When C defines something as a VALUE , you know that it is dealing with something that either A ) comes from the ruby side of things , B ) will be returned to the ruby side of things or C ) is usable on the ruby side of things in one way or another .
In all other situations , C is just C and does n’t need the VALUE data type .
When you see C using VALUE , what you are really seeing is ruby from the inside , and ruby from the inside is an ugly beast .
It is not pretty , not elegant , not easy , not cool and honestly not that interesting .
The thing is , it can save you a lot of work if you want to bridge an existing C library into your ruby application instead of having to rewrite the whole thing in plain ruby .
That , in part , is why it can be very useful to know a little bit of ruby ’s ugly side .
Let ’s move on .
We said that VALUE was the C way to represent a ruby object .
If you open one of the source file of the ruby interpreter ( array. c , string.c , etc. ) , you will find that the word VALUE is used everywhere :
VALUE rb_do_stuff( VALUE param1 , VALUE param2 ) { VALUE some_variable ; int x ; //bla bla bla bla return some_variable ; }
Since everything in ruby is an object ( or a VALUE ) , the C functions that are responsible of returning something ready to use on the ruby side of things always have to return a VALUE .
If they would return something else ( int , char , char * , long ) , ruby would complain because it can understand objects and only objects .
A Fixnum is not a int , it is a VALUE .
A Bignum is not a long , it is a VALUE .
A String is not a char * , it is a VALUE , and so on .
VALUE is not really a pointer , you say ?
Ok the following is not really important for the sake of this post but if you ’re curious it will interest you .
I said earlier that VALUE was n’t really a pointer .
Time has come to explain what it is and why .
VALUE is in fact an unsigned long .
There is only one reason why VALUE is an unsigned long and not a pointer : efficiency .
Remember what a pointer is ?
It is a variable that contains an address to some structure in memory .
It is perfect for complex objects like arrays , hashes and custom objects … but it is a bit overkill for more primitive objects like Fixnums , booleans ( TrueClass and FalseClass instances ) and nil ( NilClass instance ) .
Ruby inventor thought that it would be great if in some cases the VALUE object could BE the data instead of POINTING TO the data .
I mean , why having a VALUE that points to a structure that contains an integer that contains the number 1 when you could simply have a VALUE that contains the number 1 ?
So instead of being a pointer , VALUE is an unsigned long that can contain either A ) an address to some structure that contains the data or B ) the data itself ( immediate value ) .
The data in a VALUE is stored in such a way that it is possible to know if it contains an address to some structure in memory or an immediate value .
Ingenious , ai n’t it ?
In my next post , I will try to explain how you can use the ugly side of ruby to bridge an existing C library into your ruby ( or rubyonrails ) application .
It took him twenty years of playing corporate politics and climbing his way up , but Scott had finally made it to the top .
Not the tippy - top , but close .
He was the Director of Applications Management at an international , ten - thousand employee , forty - billion dollar company and was responsible for running a department of a few hundred people .
Long gone were the days of doing anything technical or even supervisory .
Instead , Scott focused on positioning , synergy , mindshare , projection , and everything else you ’d expect to see in Buzzword Bingo .
He also played an important role in the “ $ 100 million initiative to streamline and centralize global processes across key , strategic applications . ”
Or , in other words , build and / or buy a bunch of enterprise software to help the company run better .
One of the first steps for the big technology initiative was the Executive Summit .
It was a three - day meeting in Atlanta that brought together key leaders from the company ’s numerous business units throughout the globe .
The fourteen attendees were handpicked for not only their extensive business knowledge and expertise , but for their technological acumen and experience in implementation similar initiatives within their own units .
It was nothing short of the best of the - best - of - the - best .
The First Day
The Executive Summit was held in a mid-sized meeting run stocked full of coffee and pastries .
When the clock struck eight o’clock on Monday morning , the meeting had officially begun , and that meant only one thing .
It was time for the PowerPoint slides .
“ Sorry gentlemen , ” one of the executives said while fiddling with a laptop , “ I ’m having some technical difficulties hooking this up to the projector . ”
He was going around the table and plugging in one Ethernet cable after another .
“ Maybe try plugging it directly to the overhead , ” someone else mentioned , pointing to the projector mounted on the ceiling .
After realizing he did n’t have the proper cable , the other executives fished through their bags to find one that would connect the two devices .
But when he reached up to plug in the computer , he discovered another problem : the cable was n’t long enough to go from the table to the ceiling .
“ We could try to raise the laptop on a box or something , ” another executive suggested , but quickly retracted after realizing that the only prop tall enough was a chair .
“ Actually , let ’s just call up the electrician . ”
Thirty minutes later , the electrician arrived and assessed the problem .
He then picked up the laptop , carried it the front of the room , and placed it on the podium next to the screen .
The projector immediately came to life when he plugged it in .
Later That Day
After returning from lunch , it was time for another round of PowerPoint slides .
Prior to leaving , the presenter had already set - up his laptop on the podium so that they could dive right in .
Of course , that did n’t quite happen .
“ I think the projector fell asleep , ” he said , “ can someone reach up and turn it off and on ? ”
Although the projector projected its “ boot ” screen on the board , it went black again .
The laptop ’s signal was nowhere to be seen .
“ You need to press FN + F4 , ” someone suggested .
The presenter audibly slammed the keys .
“ Dammit , ” he huffed , “ I thought it was FN + F5 , or maybe CTRL - F5 ? ”
He pounded several different permutations of keys and offered quite a few colorful words , but nothing seemed to do the trick .
It was time once again to summon the electrician .
Within a few minutes , the electrician arrived and assessed the problem .
He picked up the video cable and plugged it into the back of the laptop .
And once again , the projector returned to life .
Locked In
As they were leaving up for the day , one of the executives noticed something rather troubling .
“ We seem to have a problem , ” one of the executives said .
“ My visitor badge wo n’t activate the elevator . ”
Not wanting to activate the stairway alarm or , for that matter , walk down thirty flights of stairs , the executives returned to the conference room and called up the building superintendant .
“ I thought you guys left , ” the super said , confused .
“ I was gonna yell at you for not turning in your visitor badges .
They were deactivated for security reason , you know ?
But I called up every single meeting room to try to find you guy . ”
“ We ’ve been in here all afternoon , ” one of the executives replied , “ the phone must be broken . ”
“ Err , ” the super paused , “ you ’re talking to me from it now , right ? ”
The executive sheepishly acknowledged that fact , but then concluded that it must be the ringer that ’s broken .
He insisted the superintendant call them back and , indeed , the phone did n’t ring .
Either way , no one wanted to work out what the problem was at that hour , so they deferred the solution to the next day .
Thirty minutes into the following morning , the phone still had n’t been fixed .
Wary of being locked in and not having the superintendant respond , they called back the electrician .
Later that morning , the electrician arrived and assessed the problem .
He looked at the phone , slid the “ ringer volume ” dial up , and verified that the ringer still worked .
The Darkness
The following day , after the morning presentation ended , someone made a poignant observation : the meeting room was uncharacteristically dark .
Worse still , when he walked to the switch and flipped it a few times , the lights still would n’t come on .
“ Let me try , ” one of the executives said .
He walked to the wall and flipped the switch a few times himself .
He then tweaked the air conditioning switches and flipped the socket switches .
Still , nothing .
“ No , I do n’t think it works like that , ” another executive said .
He then proceeded to flip the exact same switches in a slightly different order .
To his surprise , it did n’t help .
“ Wait , wait , ” yet another executive interrupted .
With everyone watching , he climbed onto the table and looked closely at the lights .
“ Yes , see , these are n’t instant - on lights ; the self - starter has to heat up , and that could take ten minutes . ”
After fifteen minutes of darkness , the executives did the one thing they knew would work : they called the electrician .
Just before lunch , the electrician arrived and assessed the problem .
He walked over to the light switches , flipped them to the “ on ” position , and then slid the dimmer button to full .
The lights came on instantly .
Despite all the technical difficulties , the Executive Summit went well .
Among other things , it answered the Big Question : twelve executives are definitely not enough to change a light bulb .
McCain ’s lead vice presidential vetter said Friday that Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin “ impressed ” in her interview .
McCain vetter : Palin nailed interview
John McCain ’s lead vice presidential vetter said Friday that Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin “ impressed ” in her interview , knocking the senator ’s most important questions “ out of the park . ”
A.B. Culvahouse , a powerful Washington lawyer and former counsel to President Reagan , told an audience of Republican lawyers that for McCain , selecting a vice president came down to three questions :
Why do you want to be vice president ?
Are you prepared to use nuclear weapons ?
And the CIA has identified Osama bin Laden , but if you take the shot there will be multiple civilian casualties .
Do you take the shot ?

“ She knocked those questions out of the park , ” he said at an event held at the National Press Club by the Republican National Lawyers Association .
“ We came away impressed . ”
Culvahouse said that McCain “ had 26 people on the long list , ” though not all of them seemed like vice presidential material .
“ We all know people with a long list of qualifications ... who , at least in my mind , may not be qualified to be vice president , ” he explained .
Among those on the list , Culvahouse said that McCain was leaning toward tapping his friend Sen. Joe Lieberman ( I - Conn . ) for the ticket , but was advised against it because of thorny ballot access issues .
“ Five states have sore loser statutes , ” he said , “ [ making ] it very difficult for someone who 's not a member of the Republican Party to become the vice presidential nominee if they only switch parties to become a Republican shortly before the convention . ”
Culvahouse conceded that Palin was by no means a safe pick , but said that no member of the field stood out with qualifications comparable to Dick Cheney ’s resume eight years before when former President George W. Bush picked him to be vice president .
“ Dick Cheney may be the only Dick Cheney , ” he said , pointing to the former vice president ’s prior White House experience and service as secretary of defense .
The Republican attorney recalled that after the vetting process McCain asked him for his “ bottom line ” on picking Palin .
“ John , ” Culvahouse said , “ high risk , high reward . ”
“ You should n’t have told me that , ” McCain responded .
“ I ’ve been a risk taker all my life . ”
Silent Hill : Shattered Memories lets you search with your flashlight by pointing the Wii remote .
Image courtesy KonamiSAN FRANCISCO —
The creators of Silent Hill : Shattered Memories want to reinvent the videogame horror experience on Wii .
It 's not just about using the Wiimote as a flashlight so your character focuses on things you 're pointing at , or about making radio noises crackle out of the controller 's speaker , although Shattered Memories does both those things .
Instead , the Konami developers are taking a much more radical approach :
They are re-evaluating all the horror game tropes that earlier Silent Hill games helped establish , and throwing out things that do n't work .
For instance , you wo n't have to worry about getting into awkward combat with shambling zombies in Shattered Memories , which is scheduled for release later this year .
And you wo n't have to run around every room humping every wall and mashing the A button to find hidden secrets .
Everything you need to survive the terror of Silent Hill is at your fingertips .
" Survival horror is a genre that is crying out to be reborn , " said lead designer Sam Barlow at a Konami presentation in San Francisco last week .
Horror games have garnered a reliable niche audience ever since the release of the original Resident Evil in 1996 , but many designers working in the genre seem to sense a certain stagnation .
There 's nothing less scary than predictability , so developers have taken to significantly altering the latest entries in classic horror game franchises .
Like the extensive makeover of Resident Evil 5 , the Wii version of Silent Hill is an attempt to boost the creep - out quotient by tweaking the gameplay at the series ' heart .
The original Silent Hill , released on the PlayStation in 1999 , helped define the nascent horror genre .
It told the story of Harry Mason , a man trapped and looking for his young daughter in the haunted town of Silent Hill .
The game spawned five sequels and a 2006 feature film .
Like the movie , Shattered Memories is a retelling of that first story in the series .
It is developed by U.K. - based Climax , with some input from the original Japanese development team .
While the upcoming game will also be released on PlayStation 2 and PSP , it began life as a Wii project .
Nintendo's casual - gaming dynamo machine is the lead development platform , said Konami producer Tomm Hulett at a recent game preview event .
" It made sense to put Silent Hill on the Wii , " he says .
" Apart from the controls making sense , the philosophy behind the Wii of interacting directly with the games worked well with the idea of reimagining survival horror . "
Walking around and pointing at objects with Harry 's flashlight is enough to explore all the hidden details of each room , Hulett says : " I can just look at objects , I can zoom in on them .
If Harry has an insightful comment to make , he just makes it . "
Use the Wiimote to light up creepy environments in the upcoming Silent Hill : Shattered Memories .
Image courtesy KonamiHarry 's mobile phone is one of his most important tools .
He can use it to call phone numbers that he sees scattered across Silent Hill , take pictures of odd - looking scenes to reveal past events , and ... well , probably a lot of other stuff that the developers do n't want to talk about yet .
In keeping with the theme of remaking the horror game genre , Shattered Memories wo n't include much combat .
" A lot of survival - horror games are based on rules established in the zombie genre , " says Barlow .
" So you have lots of slow , dumb enemies walking around and you beat on them with a pipe .
If you look at horror movies , slasher flicks or psychological thrillers , and see what counts as action in those movies , people are going to start having an idea of where we 're going .
" We 're getting away from the action - horror trend , where it 's about the guns you have , and collecting ammo , and shooting monsters , and focusing on the survival aspects . "
Konami is also moving away from puzzles that can confound players and keys located far from the doors they open , a gameplay mechanism with no real benefit other than making players backtrack .
" In Shattered Memories , when I come to a locked door , a television I have to turn on , whatever it is , I can stop and think — ' Look around , what am I missing in this area ? '
I 'm never going to have to run back to the grocery store two blocks away to find an egg or something ridiculous , " says Hulett .
Instead , says Barlow , puzzles are about " giving the player something to grab hold of ... interacting in a meaningful , physical way . "
The one example Konami showed of how this will work was very simple — a key was hidden in a soda can , and the player had to pick up the can with the Wii remote and turn it upside - down to dump the key out .
From what Barlow and Hulett have described thus far , you 'd think Shattered Memories ' improvements are largely based on streamlining the experience , making horror games more straightforward and less frustrating .
But there 's something else they 're doing with the design that , depending on how it is implemented , could either be a clever gimmick or a real game - changer .
They call it the " psych profile . "
" The way that ( most ) games deal with interactivity can be quite simple and dull , " says Barlow .
" You 're the big barbarian hero , do you want to save the maiden or not ?
Do you want to be good or evil ?
It 's slightly childish .
The idea behind the psych profile is that the game is constantly monitoring what the player is doing , and it creates a very deep set of data around that , and every element of the game is changed and varied . "
Barlow and Hulett would n't talk , at this early stage , about what sorts of things might change due to how you play the game , or what kind of data the game collects about you as you play .
In the trailer that Konami showed , a character flashed between two very different physical appearances — that could be one of the things that changes .
The psych profile also sounds slightly sneaky .
You wo n't necessarily know that things have changed based on your gameplay style , says Hulett : " When you go online and talk about it with your friends , they would n't know what you were talking about . "
" We 're trying to play on subconscious things .
Pick up on things that you do n't know you 're giving away , " says Barlow .
Silent Hill : Shattered Memories will be available in the fourth quarter of 2009 .

Peter Singer is on a crusade to convince Americans that they can play a vital role in ending world poverty , without undue sacrifice .
The Princeton bioethics professor 's latest book , " The Life You Can Save , " offers a stark indictment of extreme economic disparity in a world where 10 million children under the age of 5 die each year from starvation and treatable illnesses .
Americans are generous with their time and money , but little of it is directed at helping those outside US borders .
Among industrialized nations , the United States ranks near the bottom in the proportion of national income given as foreign aid .
Like a veteran debater , Singer weighs the reasons why people do not give more , cites examples of noble generosity , and offers a voluntary plan that could raise $ 510 billion to combat poverty .
One of Singer 's favorite examples of American excess is bottled water , which has become a staple in many households .
Meanwhile , millions of people do not have access to clean water , sanitation , medical care , and enough food to maintain health .
Some people balk because they think the scale of extreme poverty is so great that small donations would not make a difference , or they are more likely to help the needy closer to home , or they wonder what happens to their donations .
Singer agrees that strong oversight is essential to determine which programs actually advance the goal of reducing poverty .
For guidance , various websites such as Charity Navigator and GiveWell evaluate charities on their transparency and effectiveness .
The book cites inspiring case histories of extraordinary giving , such as the work of Paul Farmer , the Harvard - trained physician who founded Boston - based Partners in Health to provide medical care to the poor in Haiti and other Third World nations .
Another example is the 50 % League , whose members agree to donate either half of their wealth or half of their income to charity .
Singer suggests a sliding voluntary donation scale , beginning at 1 percent for those making up to $ 105,000 a year , and ending at 33 percent for income above $ 10.7 million .
Under his plan someone earning $ 100,000 would pledge to give $ 1,000 .
If everyone went along , the plan would raise half a trillion dollars yearly in the United States alone .
One of Singer 's most intriguing proposals involves the so - called opt - out system .
Employers would announce their intention to deduct 1 percent of an employee 's salary to fight world poverty unless the employee opted out of the plan .
The book encourages readers to ask their employers to institute the practice .
Singer surely courts controversy when he suggests that philanthropy for the arts and cultural activities is " morally dubious " in the face of dire poverty .
He notes that New York 's Metropolitan Museum of Art paid $ 45 million for a painting , an amount that could have restored the sight of 900,000 people needing cataract surgery , a procedure that costs a mere $ 50 per person .
Singer is not new to controversy .
He has written 20 books , including " Animal Liberation " -- his 1975 manifesto asserting that animals have rights , too .
It is fair to note that this latest book comes in the middle of the worst economic recession in recent memory , which undoubtedly will crimp charitable donations .
Singer has created a website , TheLifeYouCanSave.com , which invites people to pledge to give the minimum amounts he has suggested to reduce world poverty .
Where to give ?
Singer has suggestions , including Boston - based Oxfam America .
Many readers who finish this tightly written and well - argued book are likely to get out their checkbooks .

Protecting areas underneath your siding walls
Use drop clothes in order to properly cover the ground along the painting area or the perimeter of your home .
If you ’ve been in the same situation before , then you know how hard it is to clean spills or drips on porous concrete surfaces .
While you do n’t necessarily need to consider taping the drop clothes , you could get a few bricks and rocks in order to weigh them down .
With a large gust of wind , you should n’t be surprised if the drop cloths gets stuck to your wet paint and forces you to do all that hard work all over again .
As for the drop cloths , you should always go with cloth .
Using plastic is not a good idea , since the paint will not be absorbed and all you ’re going to end up with is a slippery mess .
Just make sure to use high quality painter ’s tape for taping along the top edge of window and door frames .
In terms of width , it needs to have a minimum width of two inches .
Tip : Painter ’s tape is a much better choice compared to masking tape because the latter dries out too fast and removing it is going to be very hard .
Once the painter ’s tape has been applied to the baseboard , get a credit card or maybe a putty knife in order to pass over it and ensure adhesion is good .
By doing so , you ’ll ensure that there is no way for the paint to get underneath the tape .
Also , while the paint is still wet , make sure to remove the tape .
You can check some painter ’s tape reviews here – http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/home-products/painters-tape-reviews/
On railings , mailboxes and lighting fixtures , if you ’re going to paint any area above them , consider protecting them by taping a plastic bag over them .
Using pressure washer for paint removal
If you plan on using pressure washers in order to get rid of the dirt on the exterior surfaces of your home , you should exercise great care .
If you ’re not careful with how you use them , you may end up not only gouging wood , but also injuring yourself .
That is why it ’s recommended that you consider stating with the lower pressure settings and then follow the manufacturer ’s instructions .
Also , consider hand washing around doors and windows and only use the washer on siding .
Be careful when painting from a ladder
When you ’re tackling projects like this one , you should keep in mind that safety is the number one most important thing to consider .
If you fall off a ladder , then this could result in some serious injury .
To avoid such situations , you should never reach too far from the current position of your ladder or lean over .
If you do have to reach a certain spot to paint it properly , you should get off the ladder first and then move it .
There are various types of ladders available on the market from very basic wooden ones that you can get for a few bucks to some fancy Little Giant ones .
If you have extra money to burn you can get a telescopic ladder ( that seams to be an honest review ) for around $ 100.00 up to a few hundred which depends on its brand , size , and ratings .
These are little tricky to operate and you should definitely read the instruction before climbing one of them .
One more thing : ascending to the top rung is in no way recommended and that ’s because when you ’re at the top , the ladder will not have the same stability as when you ’re in the middle for instance .
Even if something does fall , do n’t try to catch it , since you may lose your balance and fall .
Old paint removal and wall preparation
Any flaking paint should be removed by making use of a scraper and while you ’re at it , be sure to wear goggles so you do n’t get paint chips into your eyes .
All the surfaces should be washed with water and a TSP solution and then rinse them with water and leave them to dry .
TSP is an All Purpose Heavy Duty Cleaner , more about it here – https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trisodium_phosphate
Now if you have bare woodwork , it ’s recommended that you use an oil or latex based specialty primer that ’s formulated to block protect against stains .
When it comes to glossy painted surfaces , you should prime them in such a way that you promote adhesion of the top coat .
To prime such surfaces , you can use one of 3 methods , including :
TSP to wash the surface by following the manufacturer ’s instructions .
Use water to rinse everything properly and let it to dry thoroughly .
180 grit sand paper to scuff the surface .
An oil or latex based primer that ’s specially made for glossy surface adhesion .
Debris Cleanup
Make sure that you get rid of any dust and dirt by using a power washer .
When it comes to cleaning eaves and corners though , nothing can bear hand washing .
Oh , do n’t forget that where the siding touches the ground , that ’s where a lot of dirt hides .
Clean it properly .
Protecting plants
If there are any flowers or grass around the house , you should know that they can end up getting painted .
To proven that , bend them away and use a drop cloth to cover them properly .
If there ’s dirt on the siding , brush it away .
Taking care of your pets
During the painting process you should make sure to keep the pets locked up .
While you work , someone should take care of the kids so they do n’t run into trouble .
Cleaning And Drying Surfaces
Use a regular sponge mop and move from top to bottom in order to clean the walls well using water and a TSP solution , all while following the instructions recommended by the manufacturer .
After that , rinse well and allow them to dry .
Note :
If you do n’t know where to get TSP , you should know that you can easily find it in the paint department near the solvents .
The reason this is very much recommended compared to other types of cleaners out there is because it ’s an all purpose cleaner that ’s also not abrasive and can be used on all types of surfaces .
Since it ’s a concentrate , it ’s a lot stronger than other kinds of cleansers .
Because of that , you should protect your skin and eyes from splashes and make sure that it does n’t end up on your grass , bushes and flowers in large quantities .
Prime the Walls
If you want the results to look like the job has been completed by a real professional , then you definitely need to prime the walls .
Plaster , patching compound , drywall and bare wood all need primer in order to properly seal the surface .
If you prime your surfaces properly , you wo n’t have to use too much topcoat and the color is going to lay rich on the final layer .
Lets start with the facts .
Nintendo is a giant , evil corporation that is hellbent on ruining videogames , the world , and everything .
The only things standing in their way are a local , " Mom and Pop " software developer called Microsoft , and a plucky , underdog electronics producer named Sony .
For a while , Sony had just barely fended Nintendo off with something called the PS2 , but lately it 's been Microsoft leading the struggle to keep Nintendo at bay .
With the record breaking sales of Halo 3 , a game universally accepted as the most wonderful thing ever made , Microsoft had proven that no matter how many battles Nintendo may champion , the " good guys " were still winning the war .
That 's all over now .
Via a combination of highly effective viral marketing , and insults used to humiliate the consumer into submission , Nintendo has convinced the world to buy a game that it does n't want ; a game that forces the player to become more aware of their own bodies by making them move their arms and their legs .
Some people call that " exer - gaming " .
I call it blasphemy .
By selling over 6 million units in the United States , Nintendo has official stolen videogames from " us " ( 13 - 24 year old males who are too sexy to even move ) and given in to " them " ( women , children , and old people , many of whom are not sexy at all ) .
That 's right everybody , the latest NPD numbers show that as of February 2009 , Wii Fit has outsold Halo 3 in the United States .
There are now more people in our country using videogames to fake - hula hoop than people using them to fake - murder their friends .
Game over , man .
Game over .

Comment Oracle becoming a storage supplier through buying Sun - who would have thought it and what does it mean for Sun 's storage products ?
There 's long been a contradiction in Sun 's storage array strategy .
How can it push the open storage idea and simultaneously sell storage arrays with what amounts to proprietary controller hardware and software ?
If Sun carried through on its open storage vision , then in the long term , the arrays it OEM 's from Hitachi Data Systems and others would be toast .
With Oracle buying
Sun the Ellison - run enterprise 's stated storage idea is to focus on open storage and systems .
Oracle has long had a very successful strategy of commoditising everything in the hardware - to - operating system stack underneath its own software products , so that it could charge high margins for its software , but also put forward a low - cost total Oracle DBMS and app system , compared to other DBMS vendors with proprietary and / or higher - priced hardware .
Think Big Blue and HP .
Now Oracle has its hands on a whole swathe of storage HW and SW , much of which is in a mess due to the contradiction between Sun 's give - it - away - free open source SW strategy and its proprietary HW running proprietary software .
General server , storage and software supplier or not ?
So far , Oracle has sold things that integrate and support its database and application SW crown jewels .
With Sun it is now in the general server , storage and software businesses .
Does it want to be ?
Will it continue to be ?
We do n't know .
Apart from general intentions of investing in Sun and growing its revenues , all we know is what the announcement singles out , such as a focus on Open Storage .
Let 's assume Oracle is not in the general server / storage / SW supply business .
Then we might assume that , as a working principle , Oracle will look at the Sun storage collection and focus on anything that can further its commoditise - everything - below - the - Oracle - SW - layer strategy .
If other Sun products are in secure niche markets , do n't cannibalise existing Oracle products , and represent an upsell opportunity for Oracle , then they should survive .
Everything else , unless it can be adopted for use as a competition stopper that does n't harm Oracle 's own product revenues , will be toast .
So ... Sun's Open Storage 7000 product with a freely available Solaris + DTrace + ZFS + lots more SW stack should survive , and be embraced avidly by Oracle .
The run of the mill Sun storage arrays , from the OEM'd HDS USP -V downwards , face strategic oblivion .
The mainframe StorageTek tape libraries represent a relatively secure mainframe niche with recurring revenues , a good customer base , and upsell opportunities .
Expect this to continue .
Ditto the mid-term future of StorageTek 's proprietary tape format , but its longer term future depends on the combined Oracle / Sun organisation 's view of the trend to more and more disk - based protection .
The hybrid storage / server products , like the X4500 Thumper , are being used by Sun to sell against Oracle data warehousing and business intelligence products .
They could be bundled with Oracle 's own products and survive , but the partner support for currently competing software , such as GreenPlumb , could be scaled down .
The Sun virtual tape library strategy may well continue , with a combined mainframe and open server VTL product being developed , as Sun is trying to do at the moment .
The MySQL database represents Oracle DMBS competition , but if Oracle could position it as a low - end stopper supporting its own database and not cannibalising its sales , then it could survive .
Equally it might just be left to languish .

Pakistani authorities ordered inquiries Friday into a video showing the public flogging of a screaming woman in a northwestern valley where officials have yielded to Taliban demands for Islamic law .
A militant spokesman defended the punishment , fueling a furor that cast more doubt on a creaking peace deal in the Swat valley that U.S. officials fear has created another haven for allies of al - Qaida .
Officials vowed to introduce impose Islamic law , or Shariah , in Swat in February to halt 18 months of terror and bloody fighting between militants and security forces that killed hundreds of people .
Shariah has not yet formally been introduced and provincial officials say that , in any case , they would not condone such whippings or the harsh brand of Islamic law practiced under Afghanistan 's former Taliban rule .
But the video provided a reminder of how hardliners in control of much of valley intrepret Islamic strictures .
Though it was unclear when and where the video was shot , it was believed to have been taken with a mobile phone in the Swat valley .
It was broadcast widely Friday on Dunya TV and other Pakistani television stations .
The embattled government of Pakistan 's North West Frontier Province struck the deal with a hardline cleric who helped secure a cease - fire .
However , President Asif Ali Zardari's office says he wo n't sign the bill introducing Islamic law there unless he is satisfied that peace has been restored — a prospect that seemed to recede Friday after a sharp outcry by rights groups .
The embattled government of Pakistan 's North West Frontier Province struck the deal with a hardline cleric who helped secure a cease - fire .
However , President Asif Ali Zardari's office says he wo n't sign the bill introducing Islamic law there unless he is satisfied that peace has been restored — a prospect that seemed to recede Friday after a sharp outcry by rights groups .
" It is not a peace accord in Swat , instead it is a surrender by the government of Pakistan , " said Asma Jehangir , head of Pakistan 's main human rights organization .
The flogging " is against all the women of Pakistan . "
Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani said the government remained committed to reconciliation in Swat but warned that it would restart the military operation if its authority was challenged .
The two - minute video , widely aired on local television Friday , shows the woman face down on the ground with two men holding her arms and feet .
Her all - enveloping burqa has been hitched up to expose a pair of pink trousers .
A third man in a black turban with a long beard whips her backside more than a dozen times , causing her to scream repeatedly and shout " Stop it , stop it !
It is painful ! "
A crowd of men watches silently in the background .
It was unclear who ordered the lashing and when it occurred .
Muslim Khan , spokesman for the Swat Taliban , said the militants publicly flogged a woman nine months ago over allegations that she had an illicit relationship with her father - in - law , but he was not sure if the video showed that incident .
He defended the punishment , although he said it should not have been done in public and should have been carried out by a boy who had not yet reached puberty .
Provincial government spokesman Mian Iftikhar Hussein said the incident occurred Jan. 3 — before the peace agreement was signed .
Some regional officials and the Taliban spokesman suggested the release of the video was an attempt to sabotage the agreement .
" The Shariah regulation in no way is going to allow this thing to happen at all , " provincial Law Minister Arshad Abdullah said .
" Let 's not judge our deal by this video . "
A spokesman for Zardari , the widower of slain former leader and women 's rights torch bearer Benazir Bhutto , described the flogging as " barbarism " that should not be tolerated .
spokesman Farhatullah Babar said Zardari had ordered authorities to apprehend those responsible — a near - impossible task in a zone from which the police and moderate tribal leaders have fled in fear .
Pakistan 's recently restored chief justice also opened an inquiry , saying the case represented " a serious violation " of the law and fundamental rights .
Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry , who had been removed by former military ruler Pervez Musharraf in part for pursuing human rights cases , ordered security officials to produce the victim in the Supreme Court in time for a hearing on April 6 .
U.S. officials have criticized Pakistan for striking a series of usually short - lived peace deals with militants , arguing that they give extremists time to regroup and focus on launching cross - border attacks against U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan .
They have expressed concern about the accord in Swat , but are also pressing Pakistan 's army to switch its focus to al - Qaida strongholds closer to the Afghan border .

Lots of addicts in recovery worry that they might relapse if they hang out with old friends , if they lose their job , or if a loved one dies .
I worry I might relapse if an exciting opportunity to get wasted with a celebrity comes along .
Recently , a friend told me an amazing story .
During the summer of 2004 , she had been in Aspen , Colo. , when her pal ’s cell phone rang .
The pal answered the phone , explained the situation to my friend , and said , “ Are you in ? ”
The next thing she knew , she was at a house known to many as Owl Farm .
There , she and a small group of people clustered around a bald man with tinted glasses and a penchant for pills .
It was Hunter S. Thompson .
And , while my friend and a few others smoked pot and drank wine , Thompson actually read to them — excerpts of his own work from original 1970s issues of RollingStone magazine .
Several months after my friend had met him , the great writer died .
“ Huh , ” I said .
After composing myself — I wavered in a kind of stunned jealousy for a few moments —
I became consumed with just one thought : obviously , in that situation , I would have to relapse .
I was and am a Thompson fan .
Perhaps because his addictions and his prose were so entwined and so visceral .
Perhaps because he was writing during a time I always wished I had come of age in .
And so , for several long days , I obsessed over what avenues I might have taken in life to put me in a position to meet Hunter S. Thompson and have him read to me from an original Rolling Stone magazine while at Owl Farm .
I even realized that — ha ! — the night in question was almost a year before I quit drugs and alcohol .
As if the fantasy could now be guilt - free .
As if now , should time travel suddenly exist and should I be able to become my friend for a night , I ’d be good to go .
And I can imagine it so well !
While Thompson tells me about the Vegas articles , he hands me some patented cocktail of substances ; maybe I demur at first , but then he says , “ Every now and then when your life gets complicated and the weasels start closing in , the only cure is to load up on heinous chemicals — and then drive like a bastard from Hollywood to Las Vegas with the music at top volume and at least a pint of ether . ”
More and more , it began to seem prudent to plan for such an evening , not of time travel and body - swapping , but of not - to - be- missed relapse opportunities .
I thought I should make a top - five list , a kind of get - out - of - jail - free card should the chance arise to , say , party and jam with George Clinton and the P - Funk All - Stars .
I would flash my relapse pass to the heavens and say , “ It ’s cool .
I ’m allowed to drink in this situation . ”
But then I realized I had n’t listened to Parliament - Funkadelic since college and I do n’t actually play an instrument , so jamming would just be embarrassing .
Really , Clinton and crew just seem like a fun bunch , but they ’re not actually relapse - worthy .
In fact , the more I tried to create a relapse pass , the more I realized how few potential scenarios excited me .
The truth is that there is no one alive I want to lose my sobriety over .
Who is there ?
Amy Winehouse ?
We could spend the night shooting up while she nursed a pet mouse and I slouched on her tanning bed and waited for dawn .
It just seems like a waste of a trip to London .
Lindsay Lohan ?
We could drink vodka and Red Bull , dance until we sweated out our glitter body lotion , and then drive her Bentley into her beach house .
I ’m exhausted just thinking about that .
While there are plenty of living artists I would love to meet , I can not think of any with whom I would need to have an exotic chemical experience .
Now , if Jack Kerouac passed me “ tea ” and whiskey at a jazz club , Truman Capote offered me a cocktail , or Dorothy Parker ordered a bottle and then asked what I was having — well , those are different stories altogether .
Clearly , I ’ve romanticized drinking with dead writers .
Alas , with my living celebrity relapse dance card still empty , I thought I might plan for a more realistic scenario .
Like nuclear holocaust or asteroids .
So I briefly flirted with including the end of the world on my relapse pass .
But then I remembered that I was not 16 years old , and I would much rather spend time with my husband , dog , and family in my final hours than with a bottle of vodka and a gallon of Ocean Spray cranberry juice .
If anything , I ’d like to be so sober at the end of the world that I can clearly communicate to my loved ones how much they mean to me and be open to receiving that kind of message , too .
I ’m all about soaking up the love .
( Even now , though , I can hear a former version of myself gagging a little and saying , “ Oh , puhlease ! ”
Of course , that ’s the same version of myself who thought that it was just hysterical when I almost burned down my apartment building .
Whoops ! )
But these days , I am mostly out of the habit of thinking about the next raging party .
When I watch a movie with lots of drugs and alcohol , I squirm .
When I see friends drunk , I want to flee , not join in .
These days my fantasies are more likely to be about the single glass of wine with dinner , the cold beer on a hot day , the champagne flute raised in a toast .
And , apparently , anything Hunter S. Thompson hands me .
But there are no get - out - of - jail - free cards for this disease .
There are no relapse passes , because once I take that drink , I do n’t know what ’s going to happen .
Thompson ’s party , after all , ended with a gun in his mouth .
And my experience tells me that as soon as my brain gets a taste of that witch ’s brew , wires will crisscross , sanity will bend , and reason will wither .
Experience tells me that sobriety is n’t something I can slip in and out of without consequence .
So I have to ask myself , what am I willing to lose for this relapse ?
Am I willing to lose my husband ?
My job ?
The small world of good friends and neighbors I have created around me ?
My self - respect when I look in the mirror and realize I have to climb once more from the depths of addiction ?
Relapsing might come easy , but how many recoveries do I have in me ?
That ’s why I ’m giving up on the top five relapse pass — even the time - traveling , body - swapping Hunter S. Thompson relapse fantasy .
Because , when the weasels close in , I am way better equipped to handle them sober .

The ad - serving system profiles the sites people visit online The Home Office has been accused of colluding with online ad firm Phorm on " informal guidance " to the public on whether the company 's service is legal .
E-mails between the ministry and Phorm show the department asking if the firm would be " comforted " by its position .
The messages show Phorm making changes to the guidance sought by the ministry .
Lib Dem Home Affairs spokeswoman Baroness Sue Miller , who has questioned the Home Office about Phorm , said the e-mails were " jaw dropping " .
A Home Office spokesperson said the suggestion of " collusion " was totally unfounded .
" We have repeatedly said since these documents were released a year ago that the Government has not endorsed Phorm or its technology .
" We are committed to protecting the privacy of UK consumers and will ensure any new technology of this sort is applied in an appropriate and transparent manner , in full accordance with the law and with proper regulation from the appropriate authority . "
The e-mail exchanges were released under a Freedom of Information ( FOI )
Act request made by a member of the public and sent to the BBC .
More information
The exchanges between the Home Office and Phorm date back to August 2007 , in which the ministry asks the company for more information about the technology following a request made by Phorm for a view on its technology .
The Home Office has said previously that exchanges were about helping the department understand " public safety considerations and legal obligations " about behavioural advertising in general .
If we agree this , and this becomes our position do you think your clients and their prospective partners will be comforted
Home Office e-mail to Phorm Phorm serves up adverts related to a user 's web browsing history that it monitors by taking a copy of the places they go and search terms they look for .
Adverts related to that history are put on any websites that have signed up to use Phorm .
So far BT has signed up to use the system , and carried out a series of trials , some of which were conducted without the consent of its users , sparking an outcry among privacy advocates .
Phorm believes it is the victim of an orchestrated " smear " campaign
Darren Waters , Technology editor , BBC News website
Read more on the Dot .
Life blog The European Commission has also separately started legal action against the UK over the use of Phorm .
E-mails from legal representatives of Phorm released under the FOI Act show the company repeatedly asking the Home Office if it " has no objection to the marketing and operation of the Phorm product in the UK " .
Advertising platform
The Home Office has previously denied that it has provided " any advice to Phorm directly relating to possible criminal liability for the operation of their advertising platform in the UK " .
However , e-mail exchanges over a series of months between the department and the firm show the Home Office asking the firm what it thinks of the advice it is drawing up in relation to behavioural targeted advertising , and making specific reference to Phorm 's technology .
Anything the Home Office now says about Phorm is completely tainted
Baroness Miller
In an e-mail dated August 2007 , an unnamed Home Office official wrote to Phorm 's legal representative and said : " My personal view accords with yours , that even if it is " interception " , which I am doubtful of , it is lawfully authorised under section 3 by virtue of the user 's consent obtained in signing up to the ISPs terms and conditions . "
In an e-mail dated 22 January 2008 , a Home Office official wrote again to Phorm and said : " I should be grateful if you would review the attached document , and let me know what you think . "
Making deletions
In January 2008 the Home Office thanks Phorm for comments and changes to its draft paper , which show the company making deletions and changes to the document .
The Home Office official wrote to Phorm : " If we agree this , and this becomes our position do you think your clients and their prospective partners will be comforted . "
Baroness Sue Miller , Liberal Democrat spokeswoman on Home Affairs , told BBC News : " My jaw dropped when I saw the Freedom of Information exchanges .
This is untrue and misrepresents the way in which the British legal system works
Phorm chief executive Kent Ertugrul on accusations of collusion " The fact the Home Office asks the very company they are worried is actually falling outside the laws whether the draft interpretation of the law is correct is completely bizarre . "
She added : " I could n't be more surprised [ that ] the very department drawing up policy to protect people 's privacy is being that cynical .
" Anything the Home Office now says about Phorm is completely tainted . "
In a letter to the Guardian responding to an article written by Baroness Miller , Phorm 's chief executive Kent Ertugrul denied there was any " collusion " between the firm and the Home Office .
He wrote : " This is untrue and misrepresents the way in which the British legal system works . "
He said the advice given by the Home Office was " an informed opinion on ISP - based targeted advertising , but in the United Kingdom it is for the courts to decide what is or is not legal , not the Home Office " .
Baroness Miller said she was concerned that the Home Office was " very interested in the technology " for its own purposes .
However , Mr Ertugrul said it was " misleading to invent a link between Phorm 's innovative technology and the Government 's plans for counterterrorism " .
Phorm has consistently defended its technology , saying it offers greater privacy protection than rival systems , and that it could help generate fresh sources of advertising revenue for websites .
The company has also stressed it believes consumers will benefit because they would receive more relevant adverts .
The company has launched a website , which it says is aimed at stopping the " orchestrated smears " against Phorm .
Jim Killock , executive director of privacy campaigners , the Open Rights Group , said : " The Home Office 's job is to uphold the law : not to reinterpret it for commercial interests .
" It 's extraordinary , when you think of the blatant disregard Phorm showed towards UK laws in its secret trials , that this sort of lax attitude should be shown . "

Great footage of fighting giraffes .
gets pretty vicious at times .
Filmed on safari in Tanzania .
These were my worst subjects in Junior High , when we were forced to take them .
I regarded these class periods with dread .
For one thing , I was really bad at them .
I regarded the big machines and power equipment with terror .
To make matters worse , my classmates would exact revenge in shop class for being fed through a system that constantly told them they were lazy , stupid , and bad .
Here was finally something they were good at , something they liked to do , and here was the kid who was actually good at things like math , who was , moreover , young for his grade and small for his age .
It was payback time !
I responded by distancing myself as far as possible from the world of metal and wood .
A deep cultural bias welcomed me into that distancing : the bias against the world of matter in favor of the world of the mind , the world of abstraction , the world of symbol .
It is a reflection of this bias that lawyers have a higher social status than plumbers , and consultants a higher status than engineers who have a higher status than farmers .
In a hundred subtle ways I was told that the truly worthy pursuits , those deserving of my talents , were the pursuits of the mind .
This prejudice is as old as civilization itself , going back to the days when the first chieftains and kings were exempted from farm labor .
Soon it was taboo for the king to sully his hands with ordinary dirt .
Writ large , this is the theme of human separation from , and transcendence of , nature .
In the last decade this trend has reached an absurd extreme in the economy , where the abstract world of finance has trumped the real industrial economy of actual stuff .
In this economy , the status ( and paychecks ) of the manipulators of abstractions have risen above that of people who actually make things .
The bias toward money and away from real production goes back at least to the 1970s , when General Motors CEO Thomas Murphy said , " General Motors is not in the business of making cars .
General Motors is in the business of making money . "
By the year 2000 , it seemed like everyone believed the whole economy could chug along by producing nothing but money .
No wonder the most ambitious of my students at Penn State yearned to be " consultants , " " executives , " or " financial managers , " hoping to garner rich rewards of money and status for working as far as possible from the real world of material things .
In the sciences , the same bias gives highest prestige to mathematics and theoretical physics , while fields like materials science are denigrated with the appellation " applied sciences . "
It is as if the truly great minds work out the theory , leaving lesser minds to simply apply it to the material world .
In religion , the same bias against the material world I adopted after 8th grade shop class appears as the primacy of spirit in contradistinction to matter .
It is deemed appropriate , and for that matter possible , for Church to be separate from State , and for monks and nuns to be cloistered away from the rest of the world to be closer to God .
That it is somehow virtuous to refrain from involvement in the things of the world is , in my new view , a rejection of life itself .
It brings the opposite of what people truly seek when they pursue " spirituality " : joy , love , and connection .
During those years when the anti-matter bias lurked in my unconscious mind , I forever felt like a semi- participant in life , disconnected from the world , disconnected from my own emotions except in periodic , violent breakthroughs of uncontrollable emotional energy .
When eventually I began to see the true dimensions of my predicament , and the vast cultural matrix that reinforced it , I hatched an irrepressible desire to participate more fully in material life , the life of flesh and attachment .
A Tori Amos lyric spoke to me deeply : " Give me life , give me pain , give me my self again . "
" God is not without a sense of irony . "
In a beautiful illustration of the perfection and the irony of the universe , my quest to complete the missing pieces of my incarnation in materiality eventually led me to take a part - time job where I find myself working in a wood and metal shop .
All day I use the very same machines that terrified me at age 13 : drill presses , table saws , routers , welding equipment , and so on .
The outfit I work for , Earth Alchemists , builds low - tech houses following the principles of Christopher Alexander .
I basically love every minute of my job .
I am delighted and grateful to be doing it , to be working with actual pieces of the sacred body of the earth .
Sometimes I marvel at the string of coincidences that gave me this job , as I had no experience , no skills , and near - insurmountable child care issues as a single dad with three children .
It is something of a miracle that , twenty years after graduating in Mathematics and Philosophy from Yale University , I find myself making construction components in an unheated workshop for a laborer 's wage .
I feel profoundly amazed and grateful to have escaped the world of the mind .
Well , that 's a rhetorical exaggeration .
I have not escaped from anything , I have only rejoined parts of reality from which I 'd been alienated before .
I do not find that physical labor has dulled my mental faculties or spiritual discernment .
I do not think I am any less a refined being for my interaction with , to use new age terminology , the densest vibrations we know .
On the contrary , I find that working with materials induces a state of heightened mindfulness .
When I am working in the realm of abstractions , the realm of mind , say writing an essay or building a website , the worst consequence of a momentary lapse of mindfulness is that I delete a file or type in a vagina I did n't intend .
In the shop or construction site , a lapse of mindfulness could mean cutting off my hand — zip ! — with the table saw , or falling off a ladder .
I am living in reality .
My actions have obvious consequences .
There is little room for pretense .
In the world of words , the world of symbols , I can tell all kinds of lies and deny the consequences for a very long time .
People kill each other in the world of abstractions , the world of " collateral damage " and " American interests " and " board feet " and GDP and the sea of labels and data that we manipulate with the magico - religious belief that we are manipulating something real .
We are like the followers of a degenerated shamanic religion whose magical symbols have taken on a life of their own .
That , in fact , is exactly what has happened .
Magical technology involves the manipulation of symbols in order to change reality .
For the duration of the ritual , the symbol IS the reality .
We had such a ritual for New Year's .
" Take a piece of paper and write on it something you are through with .
This paper IS something you are done with .
Now we will burn it . "
If you administer the ritual saying , " This paper represents something you are through with " then the ritual has no power ; it is fake .
Most new age shamanic rituals that I 've seen are similarly fake , because everyone goes into them with the knowledge , " This is just a ritual . "
Shamanic cultures , in their undegenerate state , had no absolute category of ritual , no division of life into the real and not real .
Their rituals were not just rituals .
They were temporary realities .
During that reality , a mask is n't just a mask , it is a god .
If you want to conduct a ritual with power , you must say " A is B . "
" These lentils are your relationship . "
" These tea leaves are your future . "
And when you say it , you must be speaking the truth .
Today we have become lost in our own rituals , which have taken on a life of their own and trapped us within .
A warning about this possibility exists in many magical traditions : magical rituals require humility and caution , else the spirits one has summoned possess the summoner and never leave , living through him toward their own ends .
This is what has happened to us today .
We live in a world of abstractions , symbols that do n't even symbolize anything anymore .
It has happened most significantly with money , which has through many stages ( commodity money , gold - backed money , fiat currency ) lost its representational connection to anything real .
It has also happened with such abstractions as nations ( " America , " " France , " and so on ) which have taken on a life of their own to pursue interests that are often contrary to the real interests of the people we think they represent .
Most insidiously , we have each created a fictitious projection of our selves , a self - representation , and gotten lost within it , pursuing its interests to the detriment of our true interests .
This self - representation is called the ego .
I am not saying that it is a mistake to ever create a self - representation , to ever act a part , even to lose oneself within that part .
On the collective level too , there is a proper role for temporary representational realities like nations .
But what would you say to an actor who has been in a play so long that he thinks he is that character in the play ?
What would you say to a whole acting troupe in this predicament , enacting their characters , eating pretend food and making pretend love while their bodies withered from neglect ?
Such is the state of the human race .
We destroy the real for the sake of abstractions , for the sake of an artificial reality that has long outlived its usefulness .
What indeed would you say to such a troupe , helplessly enacting an absurd and devastating drama for no audience but themselves ?
You might tell them to stop acting , to wake up , but to your consternation they would merely assign you a ready - made role within the play , that of the nut or the buffoon , or the inconsequential philosopher who provides something interesting to think about .
And then consternation would give way to horror as , one day , you discovered that you are indeed playing the role they have assigned : that your words have become just words that you yourself do n't take too seriously , for if you did you could not live in such complicity with the very drama you decry .
Here begins the long journey I have described as the Invisible Path .
Eventually you realize that no drama should or can end before its time , and that at most you can be a humble servant of each person 's awakening from it , when the time has come .
If someone is not ready , then support her in playing her role within it in the most beautiful way you know .
If someone is ready to awaken out of the consensus drama , then offer her a bigger one , a more beautiful more real one .
There are many stories of what is and what can be that do not perpetrate ugliness and violence upon the world .
In our age , we are awakening , at long last , from the ritual dramas that created the world we know .
This is why so many of the little rituals that maintain our society are beginning to take on an air of unreality : filling out a form , writing a check , standing in line .
As this process quickens , many institutions that once seemed so real will disintegrate as well .
Is America real ?
Is " the government " real ?
Is money — bits in computers — real ?
Is Barack Obama the President or is he just a man ?
Is the deed to your house real ?
Is your house or car really " yours " ?
Is a contract real ?
All of these things are real only because we make them real : we agree upon a story , a dramatic script , and play out the roles it assigns .
That is what makes it real , and that is how we have created realities from time immemorial .
Today , many stories are coming to an end ; what was once unquestionably real is no longer , and the ground shifts beneath our feet .
We find that even our selves , our very identity , to be less real than we thought .
Maybe on some deep , metaphysical level , the properties of wood , metal , and concrete are the product of our stories as well , and have no more reality than any other artifact of our collective imagination .
If so , then these are stories whose end is not yet near .
If we have tried to transcend the world of flesh and stone , our transcendence has been premature .
The relationship of the human species to the living world that environs us is plainly immature ; it is in its early adolescence .
We are in the midst of a momentous event , the correlate of a teenager falling in love .
A little child is heedless of the effects his demands have upon his mother : he takes from her by right .
That is what we have done to Mother Earth too .
That stage of our species ' growth is almost over .
As the old stories end and new ones begin , the material world provides an anchor , a foundation , a reference point .
Whether through wood , metal , stone , soil , plants , or animals , our hands , bodies , and senses give us an experience of something undeniably real , something larger than our perception of it .
My own journey has led from a place of disparagement and fear of material reality , to a humble , grateful embrace of it .
The presence of the real strikes me with awe .
It is the same feeling of reverence that we feel when we see a true human being , the real person underneath the projections and masks .
I stand humbled as well toward the masters of the material trades , carpenters and masons and other artists , once objects of my silent contempt .
I am but a tyro , yet proof as well that it is never too late .
We are seeing the unreality of what was only temporarily real to begin with .
The collapse of money , of nations , of marriage , of so many social institutions is part and parcel of this shift in our perceptions and our identity .
No more in the future will we live so completely in the world of abstractions .
No more will we aspire to be like the kings of old , to be consultants and executives whose hands are never soiled by anything real .
Everywhere I go , I meet people who express an irrational desire to grow some of their own food , to build their own houses , to get their hands back in the dirt .
We desire to reunite with the world , to reunite with life .
Our separation from it is killing us .
Unwilling to return , afraid to end the drama of our dominion , we have sought to extend it yet further with technology , perpetuating a kind of half - life .
But now it is time to fall in love with the world .

As recession takes hold , European citizens are starting to ask questions about how they were led into this , the deepest downturn in three - quarters of a century .
The leading Spanish daily El Pais published a very thoughtful article today asking how things had unravelled so quickly and so spectacularly in Spain , previously one of the fastest growing economies in Europe .
These are the same questions that one must ask in the United States , Britain and Ireland regarding their own property bubbles .
And , in view of recent turmoil in Eastern Europe , I suspect answers will be sought there as well .
This first part in a series of articles lays out the statistics of bubble and bust , demonstrating the scale of the bubble in Spain and it also makes a number of suggestion as to how to prevent a recurrence .
You should note that this article points out Spain ’s helplessness due to its lack of control over interest rates as a key impediment to solving the problem .
Below is my translation of the article :
This week , El Pais will begin publishing in the business section a series of reflections by a group of well - known economists about the origins and effects of the crisis in our country as well as specific and well - argued proposals to exit from it quickly and rejuvenated .
Affiliated with universities and research centers in Spain and abroad , their common feature is extensive experience accumulated through research on the characteristics of our economy that make it particularly vulnerable to negative changes in the economic cycle .
Fundación de Estudios de Economía Aplicada ( FEDEA ) served as a vehicle for channeling this initiative coordinated by Antonio Cabrales ( Universidad Carlos III and Fedea ) , Juan José Dolado ( Universidad Carlos III ) , Florentino Felgueroso ( University of Oviedo and Fedea ) and Paul Vázquez ( Universidad Complutense and Feda ) which will result in an eBook .
The property sector , the labor market , financial institutions , fiscal policy , R & D and education are just some of the topics addressed in these articles .
A generation of Spaniards will lose their savings because they have spent to buy homes which are falling in price .
So , in our old age and our children , we can not count on what we hoped for .
And many are so indebted that now they cannot cope with their debts .
Moreover , we specialized in being masons , plumbers , electricians , truck drivers , glaziers , manufacturers of doors , beams , cranes , tile or sinks , gear , selling mortgages , appraisers , registrars and a host of occupations related to construction .
And now that our experience is no longer valid and we must dedicate ourselves to something else .
In addition , the Spanish economic miracle was a mirage , because we were dedicated to building homes that we would not have wanted to build had we knon how little they would be worth in the future .
A house is only valuable as something in which to live .
And if no one wants to do so , then it is not worth anything .
We have purchased flats which are still being constructed or which we visit only a few days a year , not because we were eager to consume housing , but because we thought they were a store of value for the future .
Further , our banks and building societies were dedicated to lending to developers and builders , and many of them now cannot repay the loans , which could lead to bankruptcy for banks and building societies — if they are allowed to go bankrupt .
And municipalities have enjoyed unsustainable revenues due to land reclassification and the waste to which they have become accustomed is over .
There are the cars that we bought , which we actually could not buy because we were not as rich as we thought .
And from there led a complete distortion of the fabric .
Finally , as this kind of unsustainable activity has stopped , the economy has entered recession .
To help understand the very adverse consequences of delirium , it is necessary to review the path house prices have followed in Spain , and their causes , their predictability and what could have been done to prevent it .
Growth in construction sector
The growth of the total construction has been high , 5 % per year in 1996 - 2007 .
Between 1998 and 2007 , the housing stock grew by 5.7 million , nearly 30 % .
In the third quarter of 2007 , construction accounted for 13.3 % of total employment , far above , for example , 6.7 % in Germany or 8.5 % in the UK .
Several factors have stimulated the demand for housing .
They exaggerated the economic expansion ( partly due to real estate boom itself ) and the resulting fall in unemployment and cuts in mortgage interest rates after the integration into the euro , from 11 % in 1995 to 3.5 % in 2003 - 2005 –rates which were often negative after discounting inflation .
Moreover , banking competition has facilitated access and improved conditions of mortgage credit .
It has also increased the number of households , especially due to a massive influx of immigrants , about 4.2 million between 1996 and 2007 .
Finally , the purchase of properties by families not living in Spain has increased by a scale that is hard to calculate .
Supply responded to increased demand , as the data above demonstrates , but could not completely satisfy it , leading to large increases in housing prices : an annual inflation rate of 1 % in 1995 - 1997 came to 18 % in 2003 and 2004 .
On average , between 1995 and 2007 , house price inflation was nearly 10 % annually .
In fact , to the extent that agents have expectations of future increases in housing prices and demand is positively influenced by them , for a time one can see a spiral of growing demand , supply and prices .
Has there been a speculative bubble ?
A bubble is characterized by the presence of a high volume of transactions at prices different from the fundamental economic value .
It is not easy to identify because of the difficulty in calculating the latter value well .
Often , the identification is made retrospectively , after a sudden collapse in prices .
However , in the real estate market , because of low liquidity , the collapse is slower than in the financial markets and is reflected initially more in quantity than price .
In Spain , the sale of homes has plummeted in 2008 .
It is estimated that at the end of the year there were between 650,000 and 1.3 million unsold new homes .
In any case , the revaluation of property in Spain between 1997 and 2007 was 191 % according to The Economist , the second highest in the OECD and higher than in countries where there is no doubt about the existence of a bubble , like the United Kingdom ( 168 % ) or USA ( 85 % ) .
As for the fall , according to INE , in the third quarter of 2007 house prices have risen a further 3.7 % in interannual terms , and the price of previously - owned houses has fallen by 11.4 % , compared to increases of 9.2 % and 7.5 % respectively a year earlier .
The speed and magnitude of these changes point to a bubble .
More rigorously , the key factors mentioned above ( the expansion , interest rates … ) are not explained by price alone .
Available estimates –for example , those from the Research Department of the Bank of Spain — indicate that the observed prices were well above levels justified by economic fundamentals .
This overstatement is estimated at between 8 % and 20 % in 2003 and between 24 % and 35 % in 2004 .
Thus , it seems clear that a significant part of inflation in housing is due to speculative reasons : people bought houses as investments , because they expected them to be revalued .
Furthermore , it was considered a safe investment compared to the risk of financial assets shown by the collapse of the stock exchanges in 2002 .
It is worth noting that a bubble has nothing to do with states of collective optimism or pessimism that can be associated with levels of economic activity , high or low , but are transmitted through a mechanism of self - expectations .
In the case of a bubble , prices do not perform their function as a mechanism for the proper allocation of resources and actual errors .
If the bubble is big and durable , the misallocation of resources from savers , companies and workers can cause extensive destruction of real wealth .
Did we know that there was a bubble ?
Since 2002 , the Bank of Spain has warned about the overvaluation in housing — although it has been too optimistic about the likelihood of being “ consistent with a gradual and orderly decline ” , perhaps because it feared pricking the bubble .
In 2003 , The Economist estimated overvaluation in Spain at 52 % .
In 2004 , the International Monetary Fund stood at 20 % - 30 % .
Among the Spanish economist José García - Montalvo 2003 figures by 28.5 % , stating : “ In short , it is very likely that the Spanish property market is a time bomb waiting to be detonated . ”
However , senior politicians and businessmen refused repeatedly and until recently to admit there was a bubble .
Were the politicians aware of the bubble ?
The PSOE ’s electoral gamble in 2004 spoke of “ a new pattern of growth that is more robust than the current . ”
Its candidate for president of the Government , José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero , said : “ Since we have an economic model based on construction and mortgages , Spanish families are now more indebted than ever in their history . ”
And then the coordinator of PSOE ’s economic program stated : “ The policy of renters which ( … ) prevents people from selling and producing a catastrophic collapse in prices , due to a change in expectations .
Indeed , the then minister of economy of the Partido Popular said : “ The truth is that we are living in a long cycle and low uncertainty .
This is indisputable .
And what is important is that a model is sustainable . ”
Could something have been done to prevent the bubble ?
Tackling a bubble is easier ( technically ) if you have the right tool : interest rates .
It ’s harder if you do not have it , as in Spain , who has left it to the European Central Bank ( which has long kept rates too low for the needs of the Spanish economy ) .
However , we believe that the following measures — designed to really know the level of housing prices and reduce tax distortions that made this type of investment artificially profitable — would have mitigated the bubble :
Improve information on housing prices .
Unlike other countries , in Spain there is no information on actual transaction prices .
Only since 2008 are prices available from the registry and notary – only in index form , not of monetary value ( perhaps due to suspicion about overstatement in written values ) .
Up until then , there are only official in the Ministry of Housing developed from data supplied by companies that priced homes for customers , often in the granting of mortgages .
For obvious reasons , this is not a reliable source .
And the official information policy has been lamentable .
For example , the ministry announced in October 2004 that it was suspending publication of data on housing prices , but later corrected itself .
It then introduced a methodology bias into to the measurement that held prices down .
At present , the ministry does not offer on its website any data prior to 2005 prices !
And at no time sought to make the public aware of the possible overvaluation of housing .
However , it would be possible to have information on the actual value of real estate transactions , for example , collected in one of the household surveys conducted by INE , or to conduct a survey specifically for this and use it to correct the measurement of changes in the price of housing quality .
Reduce the the income tax deduction to shelter , which heavily skews investment decisions of households toward housing over other assets and , together with the law on leases , promotes home ownership ( 81.3 % of households in 2005 ) compared to renting .
In 2002 , 79.7 % of the gross wealth of households was related to real estate , compared to 75.5 % in Italy and 38.4 % in the U.S. .
In 2005 the figure was 80 % .
In 1998 , the Government of Partido Popular reduced the existing high relief , but after that no progress was made .
Increasing the regulatory oversight on real estate companies and transactions .
Recent estimates place in Spain between 2004 and 2005 as having the third - largest black market economy amongst developed economies ( 20.5 % of GDP ) , after Greece and Italy .
This percentage has been reduced by 2.2 points since 2000 .
Probably a large part of the hidden activity is channeled through the housing market .
The Union of Technicians of the Ministry of Finance estimates tax evasion in the property sector at 8.6 billion euros per year ( about 0.8 % of GDP ) .
Why not attempt to stop the bubble ?
First , because the construction sector is labor intensive , which is important in a country with a structurally high unemployment rate .
Secondly , because an increase in the value of housing benefits the average voter , who is the owner of his home .
And thirdly , because the real estate sector generates substantial revenue for the public sector at national , regional and municipal levels .
For example , in 2004 , it accounted for 60 % of the budget ( excluding liabilities and current transfers ) of Valencia and 50 % of Madrid .
The Partido Popular [ People ’s Party ] government was wrong with its law liberalizing the land in 1998 .
It believed that with more land , housing would increaseand house prices would fall .
Big mistake .
Homes were bought and built not because they were cheap , but because they were expensive and one had expectations that they would be even more so in the future .
Thus , the land law threw fuel on the bubble ’s fire , triggering frenetic activity which reclassified thanks to local rulers who saw municipal coffers filled ( if not their own pockets ) .
For their part , the PSOE government ’s attempts to encourage housing and rent and their new land law of 2007 have been completely ineffective .
In reality , it has only prevented us riding the bubble until its last death rattle .
Ultimately , both Governments have failed on one crucial issue : saving their citizens from economic excesses which carried off their savings , their jobs and their prosperity .
It is a failure that must be learned for the future and for making appropriate accountability .

An Interview of E.S. Wynn by Alice James on the subject of Self Publishing
Can you walk me through the general process of self publishing ?
Why did you chose to self publish ?
What were the pros and cons of self publishing ?
Did you find marketing your book difficult or simplistic ?
If , at the time , you had been given the option of publishing with a publishing house or self publishing , what choice would you have made ?
If faced with the same situation now which would you chose ?
Did you like or dislike the control you had over your books in the self publishing process ?
Overall approximately how much did it cost to self publish and did you feel that it was worth the price ?
Sure thing .
It ’s pretty simple , when it comes right down to it .
Basically , there are four major steps– ( 1. ) write the book , ( 2. ) find a printer you can trust who does good work , ( 3. ) purchase an ISBN ( International Serial Barcode Number – provided by Bowker ’s Books in Print ) and ( 4. ) market your book by letting the world know it ’s out there , it ’s available , and getting it listed on all the major sites ( like Barnes and Nobel and Amazon ) .
You ’ll have to call physical book stores on an individual basis to get them to consider carrying your book , and be prepared to meet with resistance , but realize that if you get your book in even one physical book store ( not just online ) you ’re miles ahead of the majority of authors published by publishing houses , many of whom sell their books for nothing more than an expected percentage of royalties only to have the publishing house sit on the novel for a decade or more .
Of course , when you go into a physical bookstore , it seems as if there are literally thousands of books , but consider the percentage of them that are organized into a particular genre ( such as Fantasy or Science Fiction ) , the percentage of that percentage that are written by authors still living , and the even smaller percentage of living authors who are n’t already extremely well known with a best seller or two under their belt .
As a first time author , even going with a publishing house , it ’s unlikely any physical bookstore is going to carry your book unless you call them directly and ask them to .
Of course , as with anything in life , there ’s a lot to watch out for out there when it comes to self - publishing .
Getting into the corrupted , corporate controlled market is exceedingly difficult for even the most avid and well trained of writers , and a lot of people out there eager to make a buck are well aware of that .
If you type “ Self Publishing ” into a google search , you ’ll get thousands of results for agencies that will publish your work for upwards of $ 1000 , which is downright ridiculous if you know how easy it is to get your book self published literally for free .
While I ’m sure there are other services out there that are just as awesome , the best self publishing agency I ’ve run across in my entire history as an author is , without a doubt , a friendly little company called Lulu ( www.lulu.com).
Lulu will publish your work literally for free and give you an awesome deal on printing costs ( with bulk discounts ) meaning your only real cost ( beyond your own stock of books ) is an ISBN and marketing package , which they offer for the much more reasonable price of $ 150 .
( Though I ’ve seen it drop as low as $ 100 . )
This package gives you an ISBN and tells all the major websites that carry books out there ( even internationally ) that your book is now available and ready to be sold , so some of the footwork of self publishing is already handled .
As for the nitty gritty of the process– check out Lulu ’s website , which is fun and easy to use , and even features a publishing wizard that makes the process that much easier .
The biggest motivator for me came in the form of my ideals .
The market as it stands ( at least here in America ) is totally corrupted with corporate politics .
Trash is peddled by agencies that should know better , and is hailed as treasure as it is rubbed in the faces of the masses who buy without blinking .
The little guy , the independent , is so looked down upon , so stigmatized , that anyone who dares to say “ I ’m going to publish my own book ! ” is looked at as a fraud or worse– someone who just ca n’t write .
After all , the idea that has been so ingrained in our minds is that , if you actually knew a thing about writing , you ’d be snapped up in a heartbeat and given a million dollar contract , right ?
If only it were that easy .
The truth is that the only people who get picked up by publishing agencies are people who are already somebody .
Most agents wo n’t even represent you if you ’ve published less than six books .
There is no ground floor for the beginner , and if you try to wade into the midst of a writing group that claims to be the starting point for any career in the industry , you ’ll find that it ’s little more than a cluster of failed writers who have been clawing and scratching for corporate scraps so long that they set upon each other like wolves at even the slightest showing of talent .
That ’s not to say that all writer ’s groups are that bad , but beware , because most are .
The best writing groups are those that are close knit and formed by friends who are honest , but as caring about your success as you are about theirs .
But supporting this farce that the big publishing houses propagate like so much sludge goes against my ethical standards and I simply refuse to support it .
Sure , the utter freedom I enjoy by refusing to sell out on the rights to my creations alone is worth any of the cons that might come with self publishing , but the primary reason for me to self publish was an ethical one .
As an American citizen , and as a citizen of the greater world upon which we all live , I have made it one of my goals to fight to change the way people think about independence and the pioneering spirit of the self published writer , but I ’ll get into that more later .
The pros of self publishing are vast and well worth the extra work required .
Perhaps the most meaningful and most important is the freedom you have over your own material .
When you self publish , you retain all the rights to your work .
It ’s yours , you can do whatever you want with it , market it however you like , and not worry about a big ball - and - chain publishing company ’s concerns about its image as the publisher of your book .
You can be at the forefront of each new format of print media as it comes out and make your book available within days or hours instead of waiting around for months while lawyers debate whether or not it ’s worth investing your particular novel in some new and untested means of getting books to the reader .
As the sole driving force behind Thunderune Publishing , I love having the ability to market Pink Carbide as a PDF both online and on disks that I take with me to signings – there ’s no hassle of lawyers and nervous old men who are afraid of the future , and I can pass on the savings to my customers , selling them CDs for five dollars if they ca n’t afford the price of a printed book at $ 14.95 .
Another great example is that , when Amazon ’s Kindle format came out , I was able to act quickly and make Pink Carbide available within hours of the release , instead of days or weeks later .
The cons of self publishing are pretty basic and not anywhere near as insurmountable as mainstream society might have you believe .
The first , and perhaps easiest to overcome con is marketing .
When you self publish , you become your own publishing house , and you effectively wear every hat that would normally be parted out to hundreds ( or at least dozens ) of employees , which means you have to do all the footwork , all the editing , all the formatting , all the promotion , all the scheduling , and create all the hype that will make people buy your book .
With limited resources , this can seem utterly impossible , but it just takes a little effort .
Remember : Networking is your friend .
Talk to family members and friends , find people and get them talking about your book .
Make friends with other independent writers and trade edits , books and reviews on blogs or Amazon or even on sites like Hubpages .
Remember , the more people talk about your book , the more other people will notice , and it just spreads from there .
The only other con to self publishing that I ’ve run across is the stigma that society has placed on it .
As a self published writer , you ’re going to get a lot of flak from people who assume that refusing to play the game the publishing houses have set up for would - be writers to get lost in is synonymous with failure as a human being .
It ’s not .
Remember :
At the very least , you ’ve had the guts to write a book , to put it out there for people to read , and most of all , to go it alone .
How many other people do you know who can say the same ?
You ’ll find that most of the people who give you flak have been sitting around wasting their time watching hours of TV while you ’ve been dedicating yourself to art , to the betterment of your soul and through that the betterment of humanity as a whole .
As a self published writer , you automatically join the ranks of the elite among pioneers and entrepreneurs , people who have the spirit and strength to cast off the framework and the odds and the corruption and proceed alone into uncharted territory , authors like William Blake , Walt Whitman , James Joyce , Rudyard Kipling , Ezra Pound , and many many others who got their starts by self publishing .
Even Paolini ’s Eragon was originally a self published book before it got picked up by Knopf and later found its way to the silver screen .
Marketing is an ongoing process– sometimes it ’s difficult , and sometimes it ’s simple .
The key , I ’ve found , is getting people to talk about your product .
The more people talk about your book ( as with any other product you ’re trying to market , ) the more people will notice it and consider buying it .
As the sole “ employee ” of Thunderune Publishing , I ’m always on the look out for a new edge , a new place and a new way to get people talking about my books , and though that may sound like a huge and scary process , it really is n’t anything you ca n’t do on the side and in your spare time .
As a full time student , writer , editor , big brother , ranch hand , sword salesman and activist , I still manage to get the word out and manage to sell enough copies to make the whole thing more than just worthwhile – it could almost be called profitable !
If I had received an offer on the rights for Pink Carbide on the day I was about to found Thunderune Publishing , I have to admit , it would have given me pause , but then I did n’t know that much about self publishing when I first started out .
Knowing what I know today , unless the terms had been unusually good ( it ’s not like in movies where you write your first book and someone shoots you a six million dollar contract - a more realistic example can be seen in what happened with Joseph Campbell ’s Hero of a Thousand Faces , the book which inspired George Lucas to write the entire Star Wars saga .
An excited publisher approached Campbell and offered him $ 250 for the rights , $ 250 when the book was half completed and $ 250 on publication , and he accepted immediately , knowing those were more than generous terms . ) perhaps if I had been offered somewhere in the neighborhood of at least $ 10,000 at signing , I might have considered the terms and talked to legal counsel to see what rights , exactly , I would be signing away , but anything less and I probably would have said “ thanks , but no thanks . ”
The industry may seem glamourous , and writing a book may seem like the kind of thing that would set you up for life , but ask any writer who ’s been picked up by a publishing house but not hit best seller status yet , and they ’ll tell you that they ’re not in the writing for the money .
Whether you self publish or not , you do it for the art , a labor of love .
The money you gain is just an added benefit of good promotion and good product accessability .
If I were to be offered the same choice as a first time author with no books under my belt , I would most definitely self publish my first book ( indeed my first three ) again , and barring someone offering me a million dollars up front , I plan to continue to self publish any other novels in the Pink Carbide series as well .
That ’s not to say I wo n’t approach a publisher for some other book or series unrelated to Pink Carbide in the future , some piece of fiction I care much less about , but you can bet that if I do decide to wade into the mire of politics and business that is the collective corporate publishing industry , I ’m going to be approaching small time , independent ( and preferably local ) presses first , even if only for my ethics ’ sake .
To say I love having complete control over my books would be an understatement .
It ’s one of the primary benefits of self publishing !
Most definitely !
The overall cost for self publishing Pink Carbide was worth every penny .
Even when I tabulate up the costs of the ISBN , gas to get to signings , and having a supply of printed stock on hand , I ’ve still spent less than a thousand dollars , and I ’ve made that entire sum back , with a little margin of profit on the side to boot .
Sure , I have n’t sold millions of copies of Pink Carbide yet , but I ’ve sold over 230 books in the past three years , and I ’ve made back every cent I ’ve spent and then some .
Perhaps most satisfying is the fact that even though I might have sold more books overall if I had taken my novel to a major publishing house ( and they had decided it was “ worth publishing ” or even worth releasing , ) I would never have made anywhere near as much money as I have .
All too often , writers who go with Publishing Houses are paid a fraction of a cent for every copy of their novel that sells , and it ’s only the rare author that becomes a J.K. Rowling or a Steven King .
As a self published author , you still have that same shot at the greatness , of being recognized as a best selling author , only you have the added ability of being able to set the price of your product and make anywhere from one cent to ten dollars in royalties alone on each sale of your novel . - - -

The IT Support Department at Stephen S.'s company was divided into two distinct castes : helpdesk admins and system admins .
And the differences between these two groups were many .
The helpdesk admins had rotating shifts and were there 24/7 ( and each was on call 24/7 ) , while the system admins had a solid 9 - 5 and a rotating on - call admin .
The helpdesk admins staff was always on duty , while the system admins would frequently attend catered vendor meetings , leaving the helpdesk admins crew to fight over the remaining scraps .
There was a considerable difference in pay scale .
The helpdesk admins were the low men on the totem pole , while the company bent over backwards to keep the system admins happy , stopping just shy of providing palanquin transportation to and from work ( instead , they had a 50/50 mileage split ) .
The Wee Hours
In the world of IT Support , 4:30 AM meant different things to the different groups .
For system admins , it meant dreamy slumber in their oversized canopy beds ensconced in silk sheets and luxurious pillows .
For Stephen and the other other helpdesk admins working one night , it meant that it was about halfway through the graveyard shift .
Eyes bloodshot , sorting through his email , the support phone rang .
" Help desk , this is Stephen . "
After doing support for so long , he 'd answered his personal phone the same way a few of times .
" Hi Stephen , Brent Thomas from the New York office , " the caller responded , " I seem to have locked myself out of my login .
Can you give me a hand ? "
A simple task befitting his status as a lowly help desk employee .
" Sure , no problem . "
He navigated his way to the user 's account , but strangely , was n't able to reset the account .
Checking one that he'd done a day earlier , the same thing .
Stephen had no access to any accounts .
" Ah , I 'm sorry , there 's a problem on my end .
I 'll have to contact one of our system admins . "
Great , now this guy can't do his work * and *
I 've made myself look like I do n't know what I 'm doing .
By 4:32 in the morning , he was on the phone with the on - call system admin . " ... Hel- hello ? "
The system admin 's tone was as groggy as it was cranky .
" Hi , this is Stephen in desktop support , I have a us — "
" What , you have something you can't figure out ? " A long sigh .
" No , I ca n't reset this user 's password . "
An even longer sigh .
" Stephen , " he said patronizingly , " yesterday we had a big meeting .
To keep up with compliance , all account changes have to be recorded as tickets . "
" Yes , and we 're already doing that . "
Stephen clenched his teeth .
" I 'm calling because I can't acc — "
" FURTHER , " he interrupted loudly , " the right to unlock accounts has been solely reserved to system admins .
Stephen , you just have to do your part , log the ticket , I 'm sure you can handle that . "
" OK , but this user wo n't be able to ... hello ? "
The system admin had hung up .
Stephen slammed the phone down , boiling with rage .
Entering the ticket , he typed as though he was trying to beat the keyboard up , making sure to include a note that he was following the direction of the on - call system admin and could n't reset the account himself .
Stephen was furious that the director had made a decision that sounded good on paper , but he had n't followed all of the logical ramifications .
Calls continued to come in for more account resets as the work day started on the other side of the country – with thousands of users to support , the lockouts start to pile up .
Stephen dutifully recorded each one of them in low - priority tickets ( as was the policy for account unlocks ) and assigned them to the system admins .
With their strict 9 - 5 work schedule , they'd be coming in for the day in a little over four hours .
The problem ?
Password resets were required to be completed in four hours or less , lest they fall outside of SLA compliance .
When that happens , a storm of documentation and process reviews follow to determine why it happened , how it can be prevented from happening again , what disciplinary actions will be taken ( up to and including taking away the system admin 's company - provided jet pack ) , and so on .
Worse still , changes to the domain would n't propagate instantly – the system admins did n't want to force domain updates , and instead waited for the regularly scheduled replication scheduled for every four hours .
Worst case , nine hours of no account reset and a day of work lost for an employee .
The system admins were walking into a trap of their own creation that morning .
Users remained locked out and the tickets unresolved for hours .
Calls poured in and were getting escalated above the system admins , unleashing a torrent of phone calls , emails , and meetings .
Two business days later , the process had changed – the help desk was granted the level of domain administration access required to do the job , and the domain replication schedule was changed to every ninety minutes .
Inter - department emails flew back and forth about SLA compliance and updates to the policy , and management learned that while Stephen may be a lowly support tech , he just might know a thing or two about the process .
He 's still waiting for his palanquin travel budget to be approved , though .
Bullying can be tough on both kids and parents .
Psychologist Evelyn Field talks about her book which details strategies to combat teasing and other problems .
One of the most distressing aspects of modern - day parenting is suspecting or knowing your child is being bullied at school .
The anguish is often intensified by feelings of frustration and powerlessness .
If a child is having difficulty in maths you can send them to a tutor .
If they get head lice , there are numerous treatments at the pharmacy .
If they misbehave , there are strategies to encourage good behaviour .
But how do parents fix a bullying problem ?
How can you control a group of girls in the playground , stopping them from freezing out your daughter and sniggering at her ?
How do you put an end to other boys humiliating your son by pulling down his pants and teasing him about his weight ?
Melbourne psychologist and bullying expert Evelyn Field believes parents can play a vital role in reducing or stopping bullying by helping their children develop social survival skills .
" Life is not always easy , but you can teach a child how to develop social and emotional resilience by providing him or her with simple social survival skills to protect him or herself and deal with difficult , stressful encounters , " she writes in Bully Blocking , a book based on her 30 years ' experience as a school - based psychologist and in private practice .
" Learning these social survival skills is essential for all children .
Bullies also have a right to enjoy a normal social life : they need to learn how to change their behaviours so that they feel socially secure and valued . "
Field has counselled children who have felt powerless , hopeless , scared , angry and depressed , as a result of being bullied .
Like any trauma victim , she says , the bullying target needs empathy , patience and simple activities to move forward .
" It takes time and encouragement for both targets and bullies to transform their attitudes , change their behaviours , and empower themselves , " she says .
Field says bullying is an abuse of power that involves psychological , emotional , social or physical damage .
There are four broad types of bullying : teasing , exclusion , physical bullying and harassment .
Bullying can be a serious problem with serious consequences for the target .
" It can affect children physically , emotionally , academically , and socially , and it erodes their self - esteem , " she says .
" It can also affect their mental health in the future .
There is some research that suggests bullied children are more likely to have emotional difficulties later on and certainly some of them , but not all , are more likely to be bullied in the workplace . "
What can parents do ?
Field says the first step is to monitor your child 's well - being through observation and communication .
Ask yourself whether your child is happy when they are dropped off at school and when they come home .
Are they doing their school work ?
Are they playing with other kids and having fun ?
Are they making arrangements with peers ?
Are they depressed and / or alone ?
" Parents have to go further than ' how was school today ' because then they will get a general answer of ' okay ' or ' fine ' , " she says .
" If they sense any hesitation from the child , the parent should encourage more conversation with questions such as : Who did you play with today ?
What did you do at lunchtime ?
Were people nice to you , were people friendly ?
What 's something bad that happened today and what 's something good ?
And just look at their manner .
It 's not hard to see an unhappy child .
It 's very clear on their face . "
Field says poor communication within families was often the by - product of busy lifestyles .
When you talk to a child , sit down with them , without distractions , and maintain eye contact , she advises .
Do n't ask critical questions in the car on the way home from school , when you can't see their body language .
What 's the next step if you know or suspect there 's a problem ?
Help your child describe his / her bullying experiences , Field says .
Prompt the child with questions such as : What did you do about it ?
Did you tell anyone ?
What did the teacher do ?
What did your friends do about it ?
Can you handle it yourself or do you want some help ?
If the child can't resolve the problem , parents should consider familiarising themselves with strategies for building self - confidence and social skills and discuss them at home with children .
These include making an appointment with the class teacher or school principal to see if the school can help or consulting a professional , such as a psychologist .
" I think it 's really important for parents to remember that children generally do n't want to deal with it because it 's too painful , they want to run away from it , " Field says .
" What I 'd like parents to do with children is to start chatting to them , listening to them , role model certain behaviours , and not to get super stressed .
" To tell their children the message that ' sometimes kids are mean and we 've got to learn how to live and deal with all sorts of people ' .
Teach them basic things such as the importance of eye contact , body language and the right retorts to stop a bully .
" Then teach them how to make more friends and how to be friendly with others . "
In Bully Blocking , Field outlines her six secrets to help children deal with bullying .
One of the strategies mentioned is the use of humour and retorts , or comebacks , to stop a bully in their tracks .
" Most people know that you do n't show your fear or anger to a horse or dog because it will react , " she writes .
" The same applies to dealing with bullies .
" Most bullying begins with words and escalates from there .
The worst form of bullying is teasing .
It can linger in your mind for years and affect your behaviour forever .
" Do n't listen to the mean words , take them seriously or become upset .
Instead , take the nasty bits out of the tease and return it without venom .
Recycle the bully 's verbal garbage by using a retort or a politically correct comeback .
If you do n't fight back physically or verbally , the bully has nothing to push against . "
There are numerous examples of useful retorts in her book but Field expertly demonstrated the use of the comeback line during a TV interview on the subject of bullying .
She was challenged to respond to a tease on air to show how effective humour could be .
" You 're fat , " the journalist said .
Her reply was , " Do n't be ridiculous , I 'm enormous . "
Another of Field 's " secrets " is to develop a social network .
" Children with good social skills have more fun , share their problems , work out solutions and obtain group support for their activities and actions . "
She writes : " When you belong to a tribe , whether it is a sports team , a drama club or the neighbourhood gang , you feel more secure , accepted and respected .
When you have friends , you are happier at school , despite any learning difficulties , physical problems or family stresses , compared to children with a small , insecure or unstable network of friends . "
Parents can help create a " village " of friendships by making social arrangements , entertaining , meeting others - on picnics , camping trips and other bonding activities - getting children to invite friends over to play , or taking other kids out to the movies .
" If you have friends at school you are less likely to be bullied because nobody wants to bully a bunch , " she says .
" They always go for the isolated , which is what happens in the animal world . "
Most bullies are wimps who avoid children with a strong network of assertive friends , she says .

Very fun game but the 2nd to last level is GAH !
INSTANT DEATH WAVES ?!
IN A TOWER DEFENSE GAME !?
Anyway first the review .
A very fun mix of space shooter and tower defense , though your supposed to rely less on your towers since they expire .
Fun , fast paced and strategic but dear god , the 2nd to last level is INSANE .
A whole load of super high hp enemys with devstating lasers and if they touch the base INSTANT GAME OVER ... in a game where dying sends you back to level 1 .
Its particurly annoying how much of the game requires uber concentrations o its easy to mess up if you get distracted .
I guess I 'm too used to my save points being more of a TD player , but a diffaculty setting would be nice .
Though instant death enemies just seem way to OTT , even when I use the shell cannon .
I guess if your good at shooters it might be less of a problem .
Very fun game despite that

Rupert Murdoch ’s Twentieth Century
Fox corporation has admitted to planting political brainwashing within its globally popular TV shows and indeed boasts that it is proud of the fact .
A corporate video currently being showcased on another part of Murdoch ’s media empire , MySpace.com , shows
Fox executives and stars of its universally recognized shows bragging about how they use the platform of hit shows that are broadcast globally to implant messages about the supposed threat of global warming .
This is not the first time Fox have been enthusiastic in propagandizing for the establishment .
In 2003 , Rupert Murdoch himself admitted that the corporation had “ tried ” to help the Bush administration sell the war in Iraq .
The text accompanying the video states , “ In 2006 , News Corp. embarked upon a company wide initiative to reduce the size of its carbon footprint . ”
The means by which this “ initiative ” was carried out is then made clear by a plethora of clips from Fox ’s most popular shows – the Simpsons , King of the Hill , Family Guy , Prison Break – which are all loaded with messages about global warming and the need to do something about it .
“ What could we do on a practical level to start making a difference , ” asks one executive before another answers , “ The biggest thing we ’ve done is inserting messages about the environment into some of our content . ”
In other words , Fox has embarked on a deliberate campaign , which could only have been done with the coordination of the script writers of each program , to force people to accept the pseudo - science of global warming by brainwashing them into accepting it as a reality .
This has been achieved by weaving in messages about climate change and having popular characters in the TV shows embrace specific tenants of the global warming manifesto .
“ The most powerful way we could communicate the commitment on behalf of our company , was to change the practices within the production , as well as work in a message about global warming , about environmental changes , about empowering people to take responsibilities , ” states Fox chairman Dana Walden .
We ’re also treated to the vomit - inducing sight of Kiefer Sutherland , who plays the torture loving Jack Bauer in 24 , sounding about as genuine as a 3 dollar bill reading off a teleprompter about how Fox is committed to reducing its “ carbon footprint ” .
[ efoods ]
This again goes to show that the acceptance of global warming as a reality by the general public is not being accomplished as an organic reaction to scientifically proven threats , but by propagandists artificially piggy - backing the climate mantra on the back of fictional TV shows passively absorbed by people in their millions .
This is key because of the process that people ’s brains undergo when they are watching television .
Political messages implanted in fictional television programs will always enjoy a receptive audience .
According to an Associated Content article , “ Studies have shown that watching television induces low alpha waves in the human brain .
Alpha waves are brainwaves between 8 to 12 HZ .
and are commonly associated with relaxed meditative states as well as brain states associated with suggestibility . ”
Experiments have shown that less than one minute after the viewer begins to watch television , the brain switches from Beta level consciousness , associated with active and logical thought , to Alpha level , which is associated with passive acceptance and suggestibility .
This is why advertisers spend billions a year on commercials as well as product placement within TV shows themselves .
The scale of what Fox is admitting to here is staggering , and the fact that they even boast about what they are doing beggars belief .
As Darryl Mason sardonically comments , “ I never realised just how much I ’d learned about the dire threats of global warming - induced climate change simply by watching immensely , globally popular Murdoch / Fox entertainments like The Simpsons and 24 . ”
Millions of people not just in America but globally are being educated , or should I say re-educated , about the highly complex and highly debatable topic of global warming , not through a reasoned public debate between advocates and skeptics , but through fictional cartoons , comedies and drama shows produced by a monolithic corporation that has its tentacles deeply embedded into the same establishment that is trying to sell global warming in order to introduce a CO2 tax and regulate people ’s lives .

This article is part of the Center for Media & Democracy 's spotlight on front groups and corporate spin .
Conservatives for Patients Rights is a front group organized in 2009 by Richard Scott to fight U.S. president Barack Obama 's proposals for health reform .
According to the Politico news site , Scott has raised $ 20 million to fight health care reform . [ 1 ]
Public relations and advertising
CRC Public Relations -- the conservative PR firm previously known as Creative Response Concepts -- works with Conservatives for Patients Rights .
CRC is the firm " that masterminded the ' Swift boat ' attacks against 2004 Democratic presidential candidate John F. Kerry , " reported the Washington Post . [ 2 ]
Part of the group 's anti-government healthcare campaign is television ads that feature " horror stories " of Canadian and British residents who " allegedly suffered long waits for surgeries , could n't get the drugs they needed , or had to come to the United States for treatment . " [ 2 ]
After the release of the 2007 Michael Moore movie " Sicko , " industry groups including Health Care America and America 's Health Insurance Plans responded with similar scare tactics . [ 3 ] [ 4 ]
Creating the appearance of public momentum against health care reform
WhoRunsGov.com , a blog publication of the Washington Post company , reported that Conservatives for Patients Rights ( CPR ) admits that it has undertaken a concerted effort to get people to turn out to town hall meetings nationally to protest health care reform .
A spokesperson for the group , Brian Burgess , confirmed that CPR has been emailing out " town hall alert " flyers , and schedules of town hall meetings , to its mailing list .
The flier calls the Public Option ( a proposal for a government - sponsored , non-profit health insurance plan ) " Patient Enemy # 1 . " [ 5 ]
These efforts — combined with CPR ’s efforts to enlist Tax Day Tea Party participants , [ 6 ] as reported by Talking Points Memo , offer a glimpse into how anti-reform groups are trying to create a sense of public momentum in their favor . [ 7 ]
Coordinating opposition to health insurance reform
In October 2009 , CNN obtained a memo in which Conservatives for Patients Rights leader Rick Scott urged opponents of reform to " synchronize their strategies " before attacking .
Scott said CPR planned to remain focused on defeating the so - called " public option , " a publicly - funded health insurance plan that would be affordable .
He suggested to the other anti-reform groups that they each choose to focus their fire on " a single specific facet of each plan , " like individual and employer mandates , " massive tax increases " or " deep cuts in Medicare . " [

Background
Maggie Mahar at the Century Foundation 's Health Beat blog reports that Scott previously started the for - profit hospital chain in 1987 that later became the $ 23 billion Columbia / HCA .
He was ousted from this post in 1997 after an FBI investigation of Columbia / HCA that led to 14 felony convictions and $ 1.7 billion in criminal and civil fines for Medicare fraud . [ 9 ]

A Durango High School math teacher was arrested last night on charges of selling methamphetamine and marijuana , Metro Police said .
Jeremy Smart , 29 , was being held at the Clark County Detention Center on $ 46,250 bail on five drug - related charges and a warrant on a bad check charge after being arrested at his home , Metro spokesman Bill Cassell said .
Metro officers and SWAT officers served a search warrant at the home .
A Metro press release said drugs were confiscated during the arrest .
Police would not release any further details about the arrest .
Smart is charged with trafficking in methamphetamine , possession of meth with the intent to sell , possession of a controlled substance with intent to sell , possession of marijuana with intent to sell and conspiracy , as well as a bad check charge .
He has been a teacher in the Clark County School District since 2005 and joined the Durango staff in the fall , Dave Sheehan , spokesman for the School District , said .
He was not a coach , Sheehan said .
Smart was put on administrative leave while police and the School District conduct investigations , Sheehan said , though he could not say whether the leave was paid or unpaid .
Finger pointing , accusations and legal retribution swirl around an apology to Pauline Hanson over nude photos News Limited now admits are not of her .
Hanson made another bid at political life in Saturday 's Queensland election as an independent candidate for the seat of Beaudesert but lost to the Liberal National Party 's Aidan McLindon .
Just one week prior , censored photographs , published in News Limited newspapers last Sunday and broadcast on the Nine and Seven networks , claimed to show a 19 - year - old Ms Hanson posing naked in the 1970s for photographer and then boyfriend Jack Johnson .
April Fool
A joint project by the Metropolitan Police and London 's Westminster Council to put CCTV onto the Internet has received substantial financial backing from Google , The Register has learned .
On completion of the first phase , practically every square inch of Central London - including narrow alleyways , council debating chambers and police interview rooms - will be accessible from anywhere in the world .
" Westminster already operates one of the most sophisticated local council CCTV systems in the world , " said a council spokesman , " but it 's only available in Central London , and because they do n't have access to it , residents do n't derive the full benefit .
Similarly the Met operates a whole range of video systems , but they 're not joined up , and citizens only get to see a fraction of the output every now and again on Crimestoppers . "
Making as much of this generally available as possible , security considerations permitting , is the quid pro quo for Google 's backing .
Westminster will be able to accelerate the deployment of its cameras and expand its state of the art control centre beneath Piccadilly Circus , while Google will be able to add real - time footage of the streets , and more , to its London Street View images .
" The UK 's reaction to Street View was a revelation to us , " said the spokesman .
" Our camera network is a positive force for public safety , but historically people have been suspicious of what they see as intrusive , all - encompassing surveillance .
But Google 's reception was largely positive , nothing like that .
We asked ourselves why , and finally figured out that we were presenting it wrong .
" Basically , it should n't be about surveillance at all , it should be about sharing .
That 's when we got the call from Google - it was almost as if they 'd been listening to our meetings . "
Met video ops chief DS Visconti is more guarded about the police contribution to the system , saying only that some video from police vehicles will initially be available , along with footage from the beats of London 's Community Support Officers , who are to be equipped with helmet cameras as part of a one year pilot study .
These systems have already been used by other UK forces , and while the helmets are not currently web - enabled , Visconti says it might be feasible for second generation units to be used in conjunction with Westminster 's municipal wi-fi network .
" We 're particularly interested in seeing the insides of some of the estates and alleyways the Streetview cameras did n't penetrate , " he says .
" With cameras mounted on the CSOs we 're now able to make sure they actually go there .
We will of course have tactical support teams ready to roll whenever that happens , though . "
Visconti refused to speculate on further developments .
Register sources , however , say that the Met is actively working to add private CCTV systems that it already accesses to the network , and intends to add other " sharing assets " ( as Visconti describes them ) progressively .
It is also liaising with ACPO , the Association of Chief Police Officers , to take the system nationwide , adding motorway cameras and other local council systems .
And , once what is being called " London 2.0 " is fully live , it is thought Channel 4 has an option on producing the world 's largest reality TV series , with the population of one of the planet 's greatest cities as the cast .
" The working title is I 'm a Londoner , Get Me Out of Here , but it 's still early days , " said a source . ®
Want to know what will make you happy ?
Then ask a total stranger -- or so says a new study from Harvard University , which shows that another person 's experience is often more informative than your own best guess .
The study , which appears in the current issue of Science , was led by Daniel Gilbert , professor of psychology at Harvard and author of the 2007 bestseller " Stumbling on Happiness , " along with Matthew Killingsworth and Rebecca Eyre , also of Harvard , and Timothy Wilson of the University of Virginia .
" If you want to know how much you will enjoy an experience , you are better off knowing how much someone else enjoyed it than knowing anything about the experience itself , " says Gilbert .
" Rather than closing our eyes and imagining the future , we should examine the experience of those who have been there . "
Previous research in psychology , neuroscience , and behavioral economics has shown that people have difficulty predicting what they will like and how much they will like it , which leads them to make a wide variety of poor decisions .
Interventions aimed at improving the accuracy with which people imagine future events have been generally unsuccessful .
So rather than trying to improve human imagination , Gilbert and his colleagues sought to eliminate it from the equation by asking people to predict how much they would enjoy a future event about which they knew absolutely nothing -- except how much a total stranger had enjoyed it .
Amazingly enough , those people made extremely accurate predictions .
In one experiment , women predicted how much they would enjoy a " speed date " with a man .
Some women read the man 's personal profile and saw his photograph , and other women learned nothing whatsoever about the man , but did learn how much another woman ( whom they had never met ) had enjoyed dating him .
Women who learned about a previous woman 's experience did a much better job of predicting their own enjoyment of the speed date than did woman who studied the man 's profile and photograph .
Interestingly , both groups of women mistakenly expected the profile and photo to lead to greater accuracy , and after the experiment was over both groups said they would strongly prefer to have the profile and photograph of their next date .
In the second experiment , two groups of participants were asked to predict how they would feel if they received negative personality feedback from a peer .
Some participants were shown a complete written copy of the feedback .
Other were shown nothing , and learned only how a total stranger had felt upon receiving the feedback .
The latter group more accurately predicted their own reactions to the negative feedback .
Once again , participants mistakenly guessed that a written copy of the feedback would be more informative than knowledge of a total stranger 's experience .
" People do not realize what a powerful source of information another person 's experience can be , " says Gilbert , " because they mistakenly believe that everyone is remarkably different from everyone else .
But the fact is that an alien who knew all the likes and dislikes of a single human being would know a great deal about the species .
People believe that the best way to predict how happy they will be in the future is to know what their future holds , but what they should really want to know is how happy those who 've been to the future actually turned out to be . "
Gilbert 's research was funded by the National Science Foundation .
Bravo to Nightzero for creating a photoset that goes beyond a usual cosplay .
Every piece of costume and casting for this shoot looks perfect .
I know how tough it is to organize a video game themed photoshoot with only 1 girl .
Nightzero took it a step further with many people in almost perfect costumes .
Great job !
The UK lost 179 servicemen and women during the campaign that followed the invasion of Iraq on 20 March 2003 .
Many of those who died were killed by roadside bombs or in clashes with insurgents while on patrol .
Others died as a result of accidents , so - called " friendly fire " strikes , suicide or natural causes .
The six - year British military mission came to an end in April 2009 .
The names and details of all the servicemen and women who died are included in the page below .

We have scoured the web for the most unusual , random and downright fascinating printing - related articles out there .
We start with a playful look at the more frivolous side of ink innovation and swiftly move on to some industry advances that could make a real difference to the environment .
Next , we explore how printing is being applied to microelectronics and finish off with a look at a printing application that could change the lives of millions of people in the most dramatic of ways .
Who said printing ’s boring ?
1. Edible Ink
Not a lot of people know this , but if you take a photograph down to the bakery section of your local supermarket , they ’ll print it onto a birthday cake for you .
They do n’t use traditional printer ink because it ’s poisonous , not unlike some of the other artificial additives and flavourings found in a supermarket birthday cake .
They use edible ink , which is non-toxic , but definitely does not count towards your 5 - a - day !
The Californian company Kopykake have created edible ink cartridges ( the ink ’s edible , not the cartridge ) that can be used in your home Canon or Epson printer .
For the non-paper eaters amongst us , they also sell edible Frosting Sheets to print onto .
Kopykake ’s edible ink cartridges will not clog your printer heads and what ’s more , they ’re certified as Kosher .
2. DNA Ink
Great writers never really die ; they live on forever in their work .
Mr Yoshida , President of Tokyo’s Ko-sin Printing , has taken this idea to the next level .
He has created a new type of ink that contains the author ’s genetic footprint , providing an altogether less disturbing alternative to penning a love letter in one ’s own blood .
DNA is extracted painlessly from a human ( or animal ) hair or nail , and then mixed with ordinary ink to create DNA - enriched ink : the ultimate in vanity press .
The DNA does n’t alter the ink ’s appearance , but through scientific analysis it ’s possible to extract genetic information from any material printed in this way .
DNA - enriched ink has already been used to add a personal touch to several self - published autobiographies .
Perhaps in the future , this technology could be used to authenticate genuine works of art , or even store the genetic makeup of endangered species in books and leaflets , so that one day they can be resurrected , post extinction , a la Jurassic Park .
Or perhaps , that ’s a little too far - fetched !
3. Disappearing Ink
The Palo Alto Research Center ( PARC ) created the PC , inkjet printing , Ethernet networking and the mouse , only to have these creations ‘ stolen ’ by other companies .
PARC has now developed a new product , ‘ disappearing ink ‘ , which it believes will prove just as revolutionary .
Let ’s hope they can take all of the credit this time .
Disappearing ink is something of a misnomer : there ’s actually no ink involved in the process .
Instead , paper is coated with photosensitive chemicals that darken when exposed to UV light produced by a special printer .
Whatever is printed onto the page fades away after 24 hours .
If the paper needs to be re-used more quickly , the printer can erase the paper ’s image instantly .
This photosensitive paper can be used an infinite number of times , so long as it does n’t become crumpled or torn , saving energy , money and the environment in the process .
4. Eco Ink
The Big Print , a printing company in Seattle , have become one of the first to trial a new eco friendly type of ink that , unlike traditional petroleum - based inks , is both renewable and biodegradable .
This ‘eco ink ‘ is made from ethyl lactate , which is derived from corn , a renewable resource that is available in abundance in the USA .
The large format printing industry creates massive amounts of waste .
The Big Print alone produce 1 million square feet of material each year .
The use of eco friendly ink is a huge step towards making the industry more sustainable and environmentally friendly .
The Big Print , which currently uses the corn - based ink in 10 % of their printed output , maintains that its use does not affect print quality .
Despite it being more expensive at present , they are investing in new machinery so that they can use even more of the ink in the near future .
5. Nanoink
Californian company , Nanosolar , make solar cells : devices that convert sunlight directly into electricity .
They are currently building the world ’s largest solar cell factory in San Jose , which covers an area of 140,000 square feet .
They have created an ingenious type of ink that makes it possible to print the CIGS ( copper indium gallium selenide ) semiconductor of a high - performance solar cell , making mass production quicker and easier .
The nanoink contains the CIGS semiconductor material , which consists of four elements in exactly the right atomic ratios .
The mix of nanoparticles in the ink locks in these ratios so that they are correct , wherever the ink is deposited .
Rolls of semi-conductors can be printed at a time onto a metal foil substrate .
6. Silver Nanoparticle Ink
A research team at the University of Illinois have developed a new type of silver - based ink , made from silver nanoparticles , which can be used to create microelectrodes that carry signals between circuit elements .
These unique printed microelectrodes can be stretched and bent repeatedly with little change in their electrical properties .
The university team has managed to print silver microelectrodes with minimum widths of just 2 microns .
To produce printed features , the team uses a highly concentrated silver ink that ’s forced out through a tapered cylindrical nozzle attached to a micropositioning stage .
The ink ’s bonded by being heated to a temperature of 150 °C , low enough for flexible , organic substrates to be used .
Because the process uses minimal contact pressure , it can bond silver features onto extremely delicate devices .
7. Gold ‘ Fountain Pen ’ Ink
A Swiss - US research team has devised a method , known as the ‘ fountain pen ‘ , for depositing gold nanoparticle ink stripes as thin as 5 microns .
The stripes are solidified by illumination with an argon laser .
Fascinatingly , the stripes ’ elctrical properties can be customised by changing the laser ’s power and scanning speed , providing an exciting new way of creating miniature resistors and conductive tracks for flexible electronics .
At present , inkjet printing can create stripes no thinner than 50 microns .
The ‘ fountain pen ’ is a pulled glass pipette that ’s placed 2 microns above a glass substrate .
The ink inside contains gold particles ( 2 - 4 nm in diameter ) in toluene , a clear , water - insoluble liquid .
The laser is beamed from underneath the substrate , directly below the pipette , onto the newly printed structure .
8. Bio Ink
Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University in Pennsylvania have used a type of inkjet printer to simultaneously grow different tissues from the stem cells of mice .
The inkjet device shoots various ‘ bio ink ‘ patterns of growth factor proteins onto stem cells .
By using different print heads and patterns , the stem cells can be directed to become different types of tissues .
The team has already managed to grow muscle and bone in the same dish , the first time more than one type of tissue has been grown from a single population of stem cells .
They are now investigating ‘ bio ink ’ patterns that will grow other tissues found in the human body .
The researchers hope that this technology can one - day be used to repair various tissues at the same time .
This will be of particular benefit to those who suffer from joint problems and other conditions that damage cartilage , bone , muscle and fat simultaneously .
Democratic and Republican members of Congress will tomorrow join forces in support of a bill to end the decades - old ban on Americans travelling to Cuba , a move that could mark the beginning of a thaw in Washington - Havana relations .
The changing attitude towards Cuba contrasts with decades of outright hostility towards Castro , who claims he has been the target of CIA assassination attempts .
Two of the sponsors of the bill , the Democrat member of the House from Massachusetts , Bill Delahunt , and Jeff Flake , a Republican House member from Arizona , will introduce it at a press conference on Capitol Hill tomorrow .
The bill is co-sponsored by 118 other House members .
Sarah Stephens , director of the Centre for Democracy in the America , which has been campaigning for normalisation of relations , asked the prospect of Americans on Cuban beaches before the end of the year , said today : " It is within the realms of possibiliity . "
The US has had sanctions , both on travel and trade , in place against Cuba since 1962 , three years after Castro took power .
The US argument was that denying Castro revenue from trade and dollars from tourists would undermine the Communist government .
President George Bush tightened the sanctions , with new restrictions on family travel for Cuban - Americans .
Obama has ordered a review of Cuba policy but in the meantime has de facto reversed the Bush changes by removing funding for enforcing the ban on Cuban - American family travel .
New relations with Cuba are expected to surface later this month when Obama attends the Summit of the Americas in Trinidad .
Americans face a $ 7,000 fine if they travel to Cuba .
Exemptions are made for some journalists and academics who request special permission from the state department .
But some Americans flaunt authorities and go to Cuba via Canada , Mexico and the Bahamas .
There are no direct flights from the US .
About 50,000 Americans travelled legally to Cuba last year and an estimated 25,000 travelled illegally .
Visitors from Canada , including Americans ignoring the law , make up the biggest number of tourists to Cuba , with the British in second place .
A US study predicted about 3 million Americans would visit Cuba each year if the ban was to be lifted .
One of the arguments put forward by members of Congress in favour of lifting the ban is that Americans are free to visit other countries regarded as communist such as China and Vietnam .
Delahunt , in a statement , said : " During his election campaign , now - President Barack Obama pledged to allow unrestricted travel by Cuban - Americans .
He can do this by executive order , with no action needed in Congress .
But for average Americans to exercise their right to travel to Cuba , Congress needs to change the law . "
A bill similar to the House one was announced at a Senate press conference yesterday , and is co-sponsored by 20 members from both the Democratic and Republican parties .
Byron Dorgan , a Democratic senator , said : " I think we 've finally reached a new watermark on this issue .
At some point this is a policy that is no longer justifiable . "
Dorgan claims there is enough support to get the bill through .
Steve Clemons , a director at the New America Foundation , a Washington - based think - tank that favours ending the ban , today predicted that passage through Congress was more likely next year than this .
Mel Martinez , a Republican senator from Florida , where the hard core of anti-Castro Cuban immigrants are based , vowed to oppose it : " This is the time to support pro-democracy activists in Cuba , not provide the Castro regime with a resource windfall . "
In spite of Martinez 's hostility , the younger generation of Cubans in Miami tend to be less hostile than their parents and are keen to visit .
The prospect for an improvement in relations with Cuba has been helped in policy - making circles in Washington by Castro standing down in favour of his brother Raul , who has introduced some reforms .
Vice - president Joe Biden , on a visit to Chile at the weekend , said there were no plans to lift the trade ban .
But campaigners in favour of normalistation predict a gradual process in which the lifting one ban will open the way for a gradual lifting of all .
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , who arrived in the Middle East for her first official visit Monday , expressed doubt that Iran would respond to the Obama administration 's expressions of interest in engaging Tehran on nuclear and other issues , a senior State Department official said .
Clinton was in Egypt 's Sharm el - Sheik to attend an international conference to raise money for the war - torn Gaza Strip , where donors pledged $ 4.4 billion in new funds , according to Egypt 's foreign minister , Ahmed Aboul Gheit .
He added that other nations recommitted themselves to funds they promised in the past but never delivered , bringing the total to $ 5.2 billion in pledges .
Aboul Gheit said the figure is " beyond of our expectations . "
Clinton made the statement on Iran in a private meeting with the foreign minister of the United Arab Emirates , Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan , who had expressed to Clinton a concern among Persian Gulf nations that Obama might make a deal with Iran without full consultation with US allies .
The official who described the exchange spoke on condition of anonymity because the meeting was private .
Clinton told her counterpart that the Obama administration is carefully calculating its moves and will consult fully with Gulf allies .
" We 're under no illusions , " the official quoted Clinton as telling Abdullah .
" Our eyes are wide open on Iran . "
She told the UAE minister , whose country has close historic commercial ties to Iran but is wary of Iranian nuclear ambitions , that she doubts the Iranian government , will respond to US diplomatic initiatives .
Last week Clinton announced that she has appointed veteran diplomat Dennis Ross to be her special adviser on matters related to the Gulf , to include overtures to the Iranians .
On Monday , Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hasan Qashqavi told reporters in Tehran , " We have said many times that a nuclear weapon has no place in Iran 's defense doctrine . "
Clinton also told her UAE counterpart that Iran 's " worst nightmare " is an international community united against Iranian nuclear ambitions , the US official said .
Pushing for peace
Clinton then went on to declare that the Obama administration is committed to pushing intensively to find a way for Israelis and Palestinians to exist peacefully in separate states .
" We can not afford more setbacks or delays or regrets about what might have been , had different decisions been made , " she said
With the Obama administration 's Mideast peace envoy George Mitchell , seated behind her at the aid conference , Clinton said the US president would continue the Bush administration 's focus on seeking a two - state solution that entails Israel and a sovereign Palestinian state co-existing in peace .

She made it clear , however , that Mideast leaders could count on Obama to take a more active approach than did his predecessor .
" It is time to look ahead , " she said , " The United States is committed to a comprehensive peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors , and we will pursue it on many fronts . "
Clinton , who is scheduled to travel to Jerusalem on Tuesday to consult with Israeli government officials , said the United States was pledging $ 900 million to the international aid effort for the Gaza Strip : Some $ 300 million in humanitarian aid for Gaza and $ 600 million in budget and development aid to the Palestinian Authority , in the West Bank .
" We have worked with the Palestinian Authority to install safeguards that will ensure our funding is only used where and for whom it is intended and does not end up in the wrong hands , " Clinton told the conference .
" Our response to today 's crisis in Gaza can not be separated from our broader efforts to achieve a comprehensive peace , " she said .
" Only by acting now can we turn this crisis into an opportunity that moves us closer to our shared goals . "
" By providing humanitarian aid to Gaza we also aim to foster conditions in which a Palestinian state can be fully realized , a state that is a responsible partner , is at peace with Israel and its Arab neighbors and is accountable to its people , " she added .
Clinton also met with Egyptian FM Aboul Gheit , Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak , French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi , and she attended a meeting of the so - called Quartet of international mediators , the US , the European Union , the United Nations and Russia , seeking to forge progress toward peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors .
At that session , Mitchell added that while the situation between Israel and the Palestinians is difficult , he sees opportunity for progress .
He stressed the need to consolidate a ceasefire in Gaza and he forecast that once Israel creates a new governing coalition it will be in position to improve living conditions in the West Bank .

Inspiring future leaders ?
Common Purpose seeks to encourage personal development and making new contacts
Its critics say it is a secret networking organisation at the heart of the establishment , with a hidden agenda and influence .
More than 20,000 people - identified as the next generation of leaders - have attended its courses , but if you are not one of them , you have probably never heard of it .
It is called Common Purpose and prominent supporters include BBC business editor Robert Peston , Assistant Deputy Commissioner Cressida Dick of the Metropolitan Police and numerous top public sector officials .
It 's a not - for - profit organisation which organises training and networking events for high - fliers .
Connections
Its website says : " Common Purpose gives leaders the inspiration , the knowledge and the connections they need to produce real change - in their workplaces and in their communities . "
According to one Common Purpose " graduate " who spoke to the BBC , Common Purpose 's activities seem innocent enough : delegates attend a week - long residential course , where the emphasis is on personal development and making new contacts .
She said delegates were encouraged to identify their strengths and weaknesses and were taken on outings to a psychiatric hospital , a prison , a local tenants ' association and the City .
But former naval officer Brian Gerrish , who leads a campaign against Common Purpose , says : " It 's a secret society for careerists .
The key point is that the networking is done out of sight of the general public .
Critics " If you actually look at the documented evidence as to what Common Purpose is doing , they are clearly not just a training provider .
They are operating a highly political agenda , which is to create new chosen leaders in society . "
The conspiracy theorists think Common Purpose is trying take over the world .
They believe it is shaping people to work to its hidden agenda of promoting a European super - state , forcing diversity on British society , and imposing political correctness .
It 's who you know ...
Common Purpose organisers do not deny trying to identify future leaders , but they say their agenda is merely to open up the potential for success to a more diverse range of people .
And the organisation 's website says : " We are always balanced and owe no historical or other allegiance to any other group . "
People we have spoken to who have been on Common Purpose courses are frankly perplexed at the accusation that it is all about advancing a European super - state .
Helga Henry , an arts manager from Birmingham , has been on a course : " I 'm sort of aware that there 's some controversy and that there are people who believe Common Purpose is fuelled by a pro-EU agenda .
But it certainly was n't apparent in the course I was on . "
Destined for the top ?
But does she think she is part of an elite that will one day be future rulers of the world ?
" That would be lovely , would n't it ? " she laughs .
" If all you had to do is to go on a course to do that , that would be great . "
But there is a bigger question .
Should publically - funded institutions like the police , local authorities and the BBC pay money to a charity to host training courses which are essentially networking opportunities for staff ?
Some of the courses cost as much as £ 5,750 .
A Freedom of Information request by Conservative MP Philip Davies uncovered the fact that the Department for Work and Pensions had spent £ 238,000 sending its people on Common Purpose courses between 2002 and 2007 .
Chatham House rule
And while there is no evidence that Common Purpose has anything to hide , it is not the most open organisation .
Its meetings are held under the Chatham House Rule , which means everything that is said in them is unattributable .
However Common Purpose trustee Andrew Cubie told BBC Radio 5
Live that many organisations chose to hold meetings in this way : " It means that people are very frank .
They talk about their failures more than their successes .
You get a very good learning process .
" This is about learning , it is not about a networking or membership organisation . "
But although anyone can apply to go on a Common Purpose course , attendees are mainly graduate professionals - and those who are not assessed as having future leader potential will not be accepted .
One critic claims to have uncovered a memo which dismissed the idea of having a particular individual on a local advisory group in Suffolk because he was " too Ipswich " .
There is no credible reason to think Common Purpose is about to take over the world .
But as the organisation 's aim is to identify and train the next generation of leaders , the charges of elitism seem difficult to refute .
A selection of readers ' comments : I went on a weeks event 3 - 4 years ago .
It was a very interesting experience , meeting people I would never normally come across - we went to a local prison .
CP provided some very interesting speakers - who showed that there was life outside the interesting confines of my job .
Nothing at all about a European dimension - quite the opposite , the emphasis was local .
Nicholas Johnson , Ottery Saint Mary
The whole philosophy of training of " leaders " is based on an implicit assumption that the rest of us will be " followers " .
Stephen , Australia
I have spoken at a number of very well run Common Purpose events , in various parts of the country , and I do not recognise the somewhat paranoid description an organisation whose sole purpose is to bring together people from different walks of life who are making , or may be required to make , decisions that affect other areas of society .
The ' Common Purpose ' being to encourage them to know and understand the processes by which people ( who they are unlikely to meet in the general course of their lives ) tackle their jobs and absorb their responsibilities .
Possibly my being a member of the Labour Party will be seen as an additional reason to intensify this hapless ' search for malevolence ' !
David Puttnam , London I am a member of CP .
Elitist it is not but it does require people to be involved , open minded and to cooperate rather than confront .
I am retired now but still work for and in my community , as a volunteer bus driver , and through church .
I worked for a charity for the disabled before I retired , does this make me privileged and elitist ?
David Butterfield , Pocklington
Only two things bother me , and neither of them has anything to do with the silly conspiracy theories .
The first is that Government departments that send people on its courses are throwing our money around .
The second is its charitable status .
This is a business like any other , except that it re-invests its profits , and it should be taxed as a business .
Richard Baron , London
It seems entirely positive that leaders from different aspects of society should meet each other and understand each other 's concerns and interests in order to create a more cohesive and stronger community .
C J Oakes , London
It sounds suspiciously like an expensive jolly for men in grey suits to me .
H. Billinghurst , Epsom I am sure that Common Purpose does a lot of " good work " just as the Masons do .
But anyone who denies that this is a potentially bad influence is simply naive .
Do we really want already powerful business and political leaders to have cosy networked relationships with our leading Police Officers ?
Is it not clear that " graduates " of Common Purpose will have a very similar outlook , the opposite of the diversity they purport to encourage ?
Michael Barnes , Milton Keynes
I like thousands of other people from the private , public and voluntary sectors have done a Common Purpose programme .
I did not feel brain washed .
I think it is important that people from different sectors and walks of life mix and get to understand different perspectives .
Zenna Atkins , Portsmouth I went on a common purpose course a few years ago .
We went to a drama studio , a police station and a local college , and the focus was more on teamwork and evaluation of strengths and weaknesses than anything else .
I rather enjoyed it , and never felt pressured or manipulated at all .
Sam , Yorkshire

Polycarbonate water bottles have received plenty of bad press for releasing potentially toxic compounds into unsuspecting drinkers , but there may be another culprit : everyday plastic packaging .
A German study of commercially - available bottled water found contamination by chemicals that mimic natural sex hormones .
When the researchers raised snails in the water , they bred with extreme rapidity — a warning sign that the chemicals were active .
Contamination levels were twice as high in brands packaged in plastic instead of glass , suggesting that plastic was the culprit .
Many additives used to make plastic more durable and elastic are known to have endocrine - disrupting effects in laboratory tests , and the average developed - world body is suffused with these so - called xenohormone residues .
Research suggests that the consequences , though not fully understood , are real : fetal xenohormone exposures have been linked to reduced virility in boys and the early onset of puberty in girls .
The effects may even linger in subsequent generations .
It was n't known , however , whether xenohormones entered human bodies from food - packaging plastics in addition to other already - established sources , including polluted air , personal care products and food additives .
The latest findings , published recently in Environmental Science and Pollution Research , suggest that packaging is at least partly responsible .
" Our findings provide first evidence for a broad contamination of mineral water with xenoestrogens , " write the researchers .
" We may have identified just the tip of the iceberg . " * *

Sarah Palin a hypocrite ?
I 'm shocked .
After spending sigificant time and airspace bashing the earmark process as the running mate of Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz. , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin requested an unspecified number of earmarks in the omnibus spending bill , Jonathan Stein and David Corn report at Mother Jones .
One hundred earmarks worth $ 144 million are headed for Alaska , Taxpayers for Common Sense says .
That works out to $ 209.71 per state resident -- more money , per capita , than any other state .
" We have drastically , drastically reduced our earmark request since I came into office , " Palin told ABC News ' Charles Gibson last year after he pointed out that Alaska received $ 231 per person in earmarks in 2008 .
" The abuse of earmarks , it 's un-American , it 's undemocratic , and it's not going to be accepted in a McCain - Palin administration , " she said .
" Earmark abuse will stop . "
Been down with a horrible flu or something since Sunday–started one antibiotic on Monday and when that was n’t working , my doctor prescribed a different one yesterday .

Seems the ladies of THE VIEW had a nice little discussion about female toys which gave the gacks to Mika Brzezinski on MORNING JOE , much to the amusement of Joe Scarborough and “ guy who is n’t Joe Scarborough ” .

It ’s all publicity , of course , and publicity , as the saying goes , should always be horned in on , and what the heck , I have n’t done a caricature of Barbara Walters in a while –I wanted to do Mika too , but in my sad condition –where my best friend is a roll of paper toys because kleenex just do n’t hold up to my noseblows–a skinny blonde running away was the best I could offer .

Alex Ovechkin Wears Coaches Corner T - Shirt
Total Pro Sports –
The whole Alex Ovechkin situation has officially been blown out of the water .
The debate continued the other night when the Capitals were in Toronto to play the leafs and Ovechkin decided to wear his Don Cherry ’s Coach ’s Corner shirt .
“ It ’s a big number , I think for everybody .
If I get it why ( ca n’t I ) celebrate ? ”
Ovechkin offered before last night ’s 3 - 2 shootout loss to the Leafs .
“ If you win the lottery , a million dollars , you go to the bar and drink a lot .
I scored 50 goals and I just celebrated . ”
Everyone has their own unique way of celebrating , what would you do if you scored 50 goals in a season ?
Just before the Capitals pre-game soccer warm up at around 5:40 pm , Alex Ovechkin came out wearing a “ Coach ’s Corner ” T - shirt , “ Hockey Night in Canada ” shorts and on the back of the shirt , someone had written the word : “ RESPECT . ”
This was a special pre-game uniform OV wore because he was playing the Leafs and his best friend nemesis Don Cherry lives and tapes Coaches Corner in Toronto .
“ It ’s me , you know , I can do what I want and I do n’t think it was a bad thing .
I do n’t want to show them disrespect .
It ’s all about my team and it ’s all about me , ” he said .
“ Some players are just like robots .
They score goals and it ’s like okay , no emotion , nothing .
You have to show emotion if you are an emotional guy .
Show it .
You do n’t have to think about if somebody does n’t like it .
“ I do n’t care if somebody ( does n’t ) like it .
If somebody ( does n’t ) like it , do n’t watch my game , do n’t watch what I ’m doing on the ice . ” [ TorontoStar ]
I wonder what Don Cherry will have to say about Ovechkin wearing the Coaches corner gear come this Saturday Night on “ Coaches Corner ” ?
This whole situation should be dropped , Alex Ovechkin is a rare human being with an amazing talent .
He is great for the game and if the fans are going to watch him and games are getting sold out , then who cares .
Just let OV be OV !!!!
This is why Ovechkin is the best , because he does n’t care what people think about him .

The hog with no hedge :
How a mysterious skin condition made Spud 's spikes fall out
He looks like a cross between a battered children 's toy and a pink potato .
Meet Spud , the spineless hedgehog .
Staff at Tiggywinkles Wildlife Hospital in Buckinghamshire , who have been caring for him since August , are baffled by his condition .
Spineless Spud :
His plight has left the wildlife experts perplexed
Founder Les Stocker said : ' Spud was brought to us last year after someone found him in their garden .
He 's had biopsies and skin tests , but we 've had no answers .
' He seems quite happy and does all the things a hedgehog should .
We 're now appealing for someone to come forward with ideas about what has caused his problem , and suggestions for treatment , whether it 's homeopathy or some other natural treatment . '
Pampered : Spud has to undergo a daily routine of a warm bath , followed by a baby oil massage
How Spud would look if he could get rid of his skin condition
Mr Stocker added : ' We think he's at least three years old , but we do n't know if he was born like this or it was a problem that developed later in life .
' The fear is that in winter it would get too cold for him , so we can't risk releasing him .
' Funnily enough we 've got a bald squirrel in too .
' We call him Smoothie , and we do n't know what his problem is either . '
Staff believe he is still able to grow spines after one was found under the skin - but had to be removed .
Hedgehogs rely on their spines , hollow hairs made stiff with keratin , for insulation and protection as they are the only animals in Britain immune to most predator attacks .
When under extreme stress or during sickness , they can sometimes lose spines and the ability to roll into a tight ball is compromised .
Heroin and cocaine cost Britain billions .
From Cabinet Office , Strategy Unit Drugs Report Phase One : Understanding The Issues ,
12 May 2003 [ 661 Kb PDF ]
Five years ago , a Cabinet Office report estimated a figure of £ 24bn a year - £ 16bn of that from the costs of acquisitive crime by users funding their habit .
But what if those drugs were legal and regulated ?
What if heroin and cocaine were available on prescription or at affordable prices ?
( See my previous post on this debate Legalise Drugs !
From maverick to mainstream . )
Today 's report [ 444 Kb PDF ] by the campaigning Transform Drugs Policy Foundation ( TDPF ) argues that government must look at the current drugs policy with the cold eye of a cost - benefit analyst .
If they did , it is suggested , ministers might save the taxpayer close to £ 11bn a year .
( The figures in the table below relate to England and Wales . )
TDPF admits that the sums are back - of - an - envelope calculations because much of the information is simply not available .
The conclusions involve , they concede , some " heroic assumptions " .
But at the centre of the analysis is the claim that prohibition itself is the root cause of almost all drug - related acquisitive crime .
If government took control from the pushers , dealers and gangsters , they suggest , levels of such crime would be " negligible " .
Even in the " highly unlikely " event that drug use doubled , suggests Transform , a regulated market for cocaine and heroin would see almost £ 7bn of savings in the cost of crime .
A relatively small amount of property crime is directly related to people 's demand for cigarettes or alcohol , it is argued .
Take other drugs away from the criminals , and the greatest driver of property crime in the UK largely disappears .
But what about demand ?
Would n't legalisation , as the Home Office suggests in a statement this morning , " risk a huge increase in consumption with an associated cost to public health " ?
Drugs are controlled because they are harmful .
The law provides an important deterrent to drug use and legalisation would risk a huge increase in consumption with an associated cost to public health .
The legalisation of drugs would not eliminate the crime committed by organised career criminals ; such criminals would simply seek new sources of illicit revenue through crime .
Neither would a regulated market eliminate illicit supplies , as alcohol and tobacco smuggling demonstrate .
Transform accepts that " whilst some pressures towards increased use may occur under a regulatory model , these would be moderated by effective controls on availability , price , and marketing " .
The bottom line , though , is that we do n't know .
We do n't know because government has never done a cost - benefit analysis of its drugs strategy , or conducted an " impact assessment " to ensure that policies are cost - effective .
This , argues Transform , is contrary to Treasury rules which state that
... no policy , programme or project is adopted without first having the answer to these questions :
(1) Are there better ways to achieve this objective ?
(2) Are there better uses for these resources ?
In its statement above , the Home Office explains that the law " provides an important deterrent to drug use " .
But does the law achieve this end ?
In 2002 , Tony Blair was told [ 81 Kb PDF ] by drug policy analysts in Number Ten that " attempts to intervene have not resulted in sustainable disruption to the ( drug supply ) market at any level " .
Last year , a report [ 631 Kb PDF ] from the independent UK Drugs Policy Commission concluded that " law enforcement efforts have had little adverse effect on the availability of illicit drugs in the UK " .
Today 's Home Office statement offers another reason for not considering the legalisation / regulation model .
The legalisation of drugs would not eliminate the crime committed by organised career criminals ; such criminals would simply seek new sources of illicit revenue through crime .
This strikes me as an odd argument , as it implies that it is pointless trying to eliminate any area of criminality because the bad guys would simply go and find something else bad to do .
What this is really about , surely , is a moral and political argument being challenged by a methodical and technical one .
For generations , we have been told that recreational drugs are " wicked " ( although alcohol is omitted from the axis of evil ) , and few in Westminster want to appear " soft " on sin .
It is interesting , however , that the Liberal Democrat Shadow Justice spokesman David Howarth has said this in response to the Transform report :
For far too long , drugs policy has been dictated by what sounds tough rather than what works .
We continue to pursue the same policies , despite the fact that the availability and use of drugs are up , prices are falling and drug - driven crime remains rife .
If the government are sceptical about these figures , then they should come up with their own cost - benefit analysis immediately .
It would be a welcome nod towards evidence - based policy .
Perhaps we are witness to further signs that the debate over prohibition is hotting up .

i first encounter “ teacher and exhorter ” Martha Peace at a Sunday - school hall on the campus of the First Baptist Church of Jonesboro , an 8,000 - person megachurch in this verdant Atlanta suburb .
Spacious enough to host its own congregation , the hall is flanked by embroidered banners bearing shields , birds , and crowns .
The evening ’s emcee , Leanne , a peppy blonde with frosty blue eye shadow , says they represent the virtues of the nearly 120 women who came to see Peace speak as part of the church ’s “ Women of Purpose ” series .
As daughters of the king of kings , Leanne explains , all Christian women wear crowns .
But with that honor comes a mandate to apply their faith at home .
Peace is here to help .
Over the past two decades , the 62 - year - old Georgia native and former nurse has written five books on biblical womanhood , conservative Christianity ’s answer to the women ’s movement .
Among them are The Excellent Wife , now a classic in this burgeoning niche , and Damsels in Distress , a set of biblical solutions to female problems ranging from pms to depression to “ feminist tendencies . ”
It ’s common for a young Christian wife to rebel against home life as her primary ministry , Peace writes in Becoming a Titus 2 Woman , which lays out the principles of her ministry model .
It ’s the role of older women to help her understand her priorities .
Those priorities may include rising early to feed the family , being available anytime to satisfy a husband ’s desires ( barring a few “ ungodly ” or “ homosexual ” acts ) , seeking his approval regarding work , appearance , and leisure , and accepting that he has the “ burden ” of final say in arguments .
After a wife has respectfully appealed her spouse ’s decision — a privilege she should not abuse — she must accept his final answer as “ God ’s will for her at that time , ” Peace advises .
The godly wife must also suppress selfish desires ( for romance , a career , an equitable marriage ) , practice addressing her spouse in soothing tones , and maintain a private log of bitter thoughts to guide her repentance .
“ If you disobey your husband , ” Peace admonishes in The Excellent Wife , “ you are indirectly shaking your fist at God . ”
The popularity of her audiotapes and books , translated into several languages and used as curriculum by Christian women ’s groups , has made Peace a celebrity in fundamentalist circles , with appearances at conferences and Bible meetings throughout the world .
But she ’s just one among hundreds of professional Titus 2 mentors , older women who help younger ones — as outlined by Apostle Paul in Titus 2:5 — ” to be self - controlled and pure , to be busy at home , to be kind , and to be subject to their husbands , so that no one will malign the word of God . ”
The mentoring tradition , carried out largely by thousands of lay churchwomen , fell into neglect starting in the 1960s — its leaders blame feminism — but has since enjoyed a strong resurgence in congregations ranging from the millions - strong Southern Baptist Convention to the constellation of independent Reformed evangelical churches .
( Saddleback megachurch pastor Rick Warren , Obama ’s controversial pick for the inaugural invocation , also preaches wifely submission .
The church website cites Ephesians : “ So you wives must willingly obey your husbands in everything , just as the Church obeys Christ . ” )
Titus 2 ministering can take many forms : one - on - one sewing and housekeeping instruction , submission - centric books and magazines — one of the oldest , Above Rubies , boasts a print run of 150,000 — and speaking engagements ranging from Peace ’s intimate dinner talks to Promise Keepers - type stadium rallies .
Together , these ministries form the backbone of what its adherents call biblical man / womanhood , complementarianism , or simply the patriarchy movement .

“ Lord , forgive me for maligning You .
Instead , use me for your glory however you choose .
If the symptoms have to continue , they ’ll just have to continue . ”
On vanity : “ Beauty is one of the ways the adulteress draws her prey … [ but ] it is all right to have some external adornment , because stripping oneself of all makeup and wearing only plain , drab clothing does not make a woman more pleasing to God . ”
In preparation for Peace ’s supper session , Jonesboro ’s churchwomen , dressed Southern - belle modern in garden - printed blazers , filmy blouses and pearls , and elegant updos , shuffle through a buffet line collecting plates of baked chicken , pasta salad , and a green salad adorned with flecks of chocolate .
With everyone settled , Peace , whose short dark brown hair closely frames a stern , youthful face , takes the podium to regale the ladies with tales of her marital missteps three decades past .
She breaks the ice with a laundry list of “ I ’d just be happy if ” demands she ’d put on her husband before she was saved at age 33 .
She ’d just be happy , she mockingly recalls , if they got married , had a child , moved back to Georgia from her husband ’s military post in Germany , had a second child .
The women laugh as Peace mimics his “ okay ” in the crushed monotone of a henpecked sitcom hubby .
She continues , describing her slide from demanding wife to substance - abusing , adulterous , career - worshipping feminist who farmed her children off to babysitters , nearly left her marriage , and even contemplated suicide .
Only then did she find God and begin her transformation to “ excellent wife . ”
The ladies are familiar with Peace ’s narrative , a story of female salvation that comes from accepting God ’s intentions — salvation , in particular , from the deceptions of the “ egalitarian ” feminist worldview .
Peace calls her story “ the taming of the shrew , ” a coinage her protégés adopt in describing their own wifely conversions .
Sensitive to charges that her busy career might contradict her message , Peace reassures audiences that she ministers only to women , and only under her pastor ’s supervision .
Indeed , the Titus 2 movement finds its most prominent voices in the Kentucky - based Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood and a roster of conservative male theologians that includes John Piper , founder of Desiring God Ministries ; John MacArthur , megachurch pastor of Grace Community Church ; Albert Mohler , president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary ; and Bruce Ware , president of the Evangelical Theological Society , who caused a public stir last June when he told a Texas audience that domestic violence often stems from women ’s lack of submission .
( Mohler irked fellow hardliners last fall when he and others reached for loopholes to justify Sarah Palin ’s candidacy as biblically permissible .
“ Palin represents the feminist lie that a woman can do it all , ” countered one critic at fundamentalist website VisionForum.com . )
These church leaders argue that a generation of women has abdicated its sacred responsibility by ignoring biblical directives that used to reign unchallenged .
In addition to the “ corrupting ” influence of feminism on the wider culture , they fear feminization of the church by female - majority congregations , the concept of a soft and womanly Jesus , and the elevation of women to positions of church authority .
Their concerns extend to questions — on Christian marriage counseling ; on women speaking in church or exercising authority over men as , say , teachers or cops — that are nearly as divisive in conservative churches as gay marriage is in mainline denominations .
“ A lot comes into this , ” Peace tells me .
“ Not just husbands and wives , but women as pastors , women in church .
It ’s not a matter of ‘ Good Christians can differ on the issue . ’
This is a slippery slope they ’re on .
It ’s like wherever the world goes , 30 or 40 years later , the church goes , too . ”
As an alternative , the movement offers a “ separate but equal ” division of duties and authority .
Men , the embodiment of Christ , are the breadwinners and spiritual leaders in worship , decision making , finances , and sex .
Women , representing the church , are encouragers , “ completers , ” and helpmeets , bound to transform the culture by example and to sacrifice in God ’s honor .
Reaching this austere conviction via shared women ’s study is a process that oddly parallels the protofeminist consciousness - raising groups of the ’60s and ’ 70s , in which women recognized their common complaints as part of a larger pattern of oppression .
Gloria Steinem called those groups “ the primary way women discover that we are not crazy , the system is . ”
But the Titus 2 message is precisely the opposite : The Lord ’s system is righteous , ungrateful feelings are sins to be surmounted , and feminist rebellion is a cultural scourge to be eradicated .
The radical leap taken by Titus 2 women is unconditional surrender — an army of Phyllis Schlaflys , fighting for their own subordination based on the promise that the meek shall inherit the Earth .
“ It is a revolution that will take place on our knees , ” writes author and Peace ’s contemporary Nancy Leigh DeMoss .
And a revolution it may be .
In October , more than 6,000 women turned out for DeMoss ’ “ True Woman ” conference in Chicago , affirming their holy duty to leave a legacy of “ fruitful femininity ” for the next generation .
“ You do n’t have to be a damsel in distress , ” Peace reminds the women of Jonesboro .
“ God has already ordered your steps and has a perfect plan to accomplish his will in your life . ”
Around the Sunday - school hall , plastic dinner plates pushed to the side , dozens of women bend over their event programs , not praying just yet , but taking notes in the margins .
Every software project I 've ever worked on has accrued technical debt over time :
Technical Debt is a wonderful metaphor developed by Ward Cunningham to help us think about this problem .
In this metaphor , doing things the quick and dirty way sets us up with a technical debt , which is similar to a financial debt .
Like a financial debt , the technical debt incurs interest payments , which come in the form of the extra effort that we have to do in future development because of the quick and dirty design choice .
We can choose to continue paying the interest , or we can pay down the principal by refactoring the quick and dirty design into the better design .
Although it costs to pay down the principal , we gain by reduced interest payments in the future .
The metaphor also explains why it may be sensible to do the quick and dirty approach .
Just as a business incurs some debt to take advantage of a market opportunity developers may incur technical debt to hit an important deadline .
The all too common problem is that development organizations let their debt get out of control and spend most of their future development effort paying crippling interest payments .
No matter how talented and smart the software developers , all these tiny deferments begin to add up and cumulatively weigh on the project , dragging it down .
My latest project is no different .
After six solid months working on the Stack Overflow codebase , this is exactly where we are .
We 're digging in our heels and retrenching for a major refactoring of our database .
We have to stop working on new features for a while and pay down some of our technical debt .
I believe that accruing technical debt is unavoidable on any real software project .
Sure , you refactor as you go , and incorporate improvements when you can – but it 's impossible to predict exactly how those key decisions you made early on in the project are going to play out .
All you can do is roll with the punches , and budget some time into the schedule to periodically pay down your technical debt .
The time you take out of the schedule to make technical debt payments typically does n't result in anything the customers or users will see .
This can sometimes be hard to justify .
In fact , I had to defend our decision with Joel , my business partner .
He 'd prefer we work on some crazy thing he calls revenue generation , whatever that is .
Steve McConnell has a lengthy blog entry examining technical debt .
The perils of not ackowledging your debt are clear :
One of the important implications of technical debt is that it must be serviced , i.e. , once you incur a debt there will be interest charges .
If the debt grows large enough , eventually the company will spend more on servicing its debt than it invests in increasing the value of its other assets .
A common example is a legacy code base in which so much work goes into keeping a production system running ( i.e. , " servicing the debt " ) that there is little time left over to add new capabilities to the system .
With financial debt , analysts talk about the " debt ratio , " which is equal to total debt divided by total assets .
Higher debt ratios are seen as more risky , which seems true for technical debt , too .
Beyond what Steve describes here , I 'd also argue that accumulated technical debt becomes a major disincentive to work on a project .
It 's a collection of small but annoying things that you have to deal with every time you sit down to write code .
But it 's exactly these small annoyances , this sand grinding away in the gears of your workday , that eventually causes you to stop enjoying the project .
These small things matter .
It can be scary to go in and rebuild a lot of working code that has become crufty over time .
But do n't succumb to fear .
I must not fear .
Fear is the mind - killer .
Fear is the little - death that brings total obliteration .
I will face my fear .
I will permit it to pass over me and through me .
And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path .
Where the fear has gone there will be nothing .
Only I will remain .
When it comes time to pay down your technical debt , do n't be afraid to break stuff .
It 's liberating , even energizing to tear down code in order to build it up stronger and better than it was before .
Be brave , and realize that paying your technical debt every so often is a normal , necessary part of the software development cycle to avert massive interest payments later .
After all , who wants to live forever ?
A new law designed to make it easier for copyright holders to go after illicit file - sharers will come into force April 1st in Sweden .
The IPRED legislation will also increase penalties and ultimately criminalize large scale infringement but according to a new poll , the majority of Swedes are against it .
Due to come into force in just two weeks , the controversial Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement Directive ( IPRED ) law will make it easier for copyright holders to get their hands on the personal details of suspected illicit file - sharers .
The law has been controversial from the start , with over 50,000 people signing up to the “ Stop IPRED ” group on Facebook .
Swedish Pirate Party Chairman Rick Falkvinge has been most vocal on the issue .
“ These laws are written by digital illiterates who behave like blindfolded , drunken elephants trumpeting about in an egg packaging facility , ” he told Torrent Freak .
“ They have no idea how much damage they ’re causing , because they lack today ’s literacy : an understanding of how the Internet is reshaping the power structures at their core . ”
Nevertheless , Sweden will go ahead with the introduction of the law and , as we predicted back in October last year , the objections to it continue .
E24.se reports that a new poll from Sifo indicates that nearly half of all Swedes ( 48 % of those questioned ) believe that the IPRED law is wrong .
The group showing the strongest opposition are the typical file - sharers – 15 - 29 year old men – with a huge 79 percent of those rejecting the new law .
In Sweden , 56 percent of men aged between 26 and 35 engage in file - sharing .
From the over 65 years old group , who will generally have less interest in the Internet , 27 percent of them were against IPRED , while 34 percent demonstrated support .
The narrow 50 - 54 year olds group showed a 45 percent opposition to the law .
Overall , just 32 per cent of respondents were in favor of the legislation .
In response to the new law and the heated copyright debate , the National Library of Sweden has closed its open Wi -Fi network .
They have thereby disabled online access to a lot of research material , which can now only be accessed upon request - just like in the olden days .
IPRED will come into effect April 1st 2009 .

Last month , AMD launched the Phenom II X4 processor line - up , and with it ushered in the first desktop processors built using the company 's 45 nm process node .
While the first two Phenom II processors to arrive , the 3.0GHz X4 940 and 2.8GHz 920 , were clearly superior to previous Phenoms in terms of performance and power efficiency , and they remain the two most powerful processors in AMD 's product stack today , they did not exploit all of the capabilities offered by their newly tweaked , and redesigned cores .
You see , the AMD Phenom II X4 940 and X4 920 were designed for the socket AM2 + platform , and as such , they supported only DDR2 memory .
The latest additions to the Phenom II line - up , the Phenom II X3 720 Black Edition and X4 810 , however , are designed for the AM3 platform .
That means these new chips can work not only in existing AM2 + motherboards with DDR2 memory , but in new AM3 - based motherboards with DDR3 memory as well .
The flexibility of these new socket AM3 based Phenom II processors should appeal to existing AMD system owners who may be thinking about a CPU upgrade , or potential new AMD - based system buyers who want the freedom to choose from a wide array of motherboards and memory type at multiple price points .
We 've taken the new triple - core Phenom II X3 720 Black Edition and quad - core X4 810 for a spin in our lab using both socket AM2 + and socket AM3 based motherboard platforms , to give you all an idea as to how each configuration performs .
Take a look at the specs below for some particulars , and then read on for the full scoop ...

ISPs have rejected a call by childrens ' charities to implement the government 's approved blocklist for images of child sexual abuse , because the list does not stop anyone who wants to accessing such material .
On Monday a coalition including the NSPCC and Barnardo 's sounded warnings that 700,000 homes could access websites hosting images of abuse because small ISPs do not filter their networks .
The charities aimed to put pressure on the government to force them to implement the Internet Watch Foundation 's blocklist , pointing out that in 2006 ministers said all providers should do so by the end of 2007 .
Small ISPs have resisted filtering their networks for several years on economic and principle grounds .
On Tuesday Malcolm
Hutty , policy chief Linx , a peering cooperative used by many small ISPs , reiterated the objections .
" Especially at the moment , it would mean spending a lot of money on something that simply does not work , " he said .
" The system is politically motivated . "
The IWF acknowledges that paedophiles with minimal technical knowledge are able to circumvent its censorship .
Whether their ISP has implemented the IWF blocklist , therefore , has no impact on their ability to access websites distributing child abuse images .
Rather , the IWF agrees , the blocklist protects average web users with no interest in such material from accidental exposure .
About 95 per cent of UK internet users are thus shielded from the darkest corners of the web by their ISP .
The rest are not .
In either case , paedophiles remain able to access images of child abuse over the web .
In that light the NSPCC 's assertion this week that " allowing this loophole helps feed the appalling trade in images featuring real children being seriously sexually assaulted " demands examination .
Zoe Hilton , the NSPCC 's policy adviser , told The Register that despite the simple technical counter - measures available to paedophiles , filtering websites was valuable .
" There 's a whole spectrum of offending , " she said .
" Clearly , we 're not going to stop determined paedophiles , but we know from our work with offenders that it can often start with an accidental exposure and curiosity .
There 's a huge element of opportunism to a lot the commercial sites . "
" It 's probably difficult for Register readers to believe , but lots of these people would never be able to use an overseas proxy [ to circumvent the IWF blocklist ] .
Hilton said that the objections to filtering raised to the NSPCC by small ISPs had been cost - based rather than function - based until now .
She recognised that use of peer - to - peer networks and other internet technologies by paedophiles was also of great concern , but said their availability did not mean web filtering was ineffective .
As pressure on small ISPs to filter the traffic entering their networks increased , a New Zealand ISP hoped to take advantage .
Peter Mancer , managing director of Watchdog Internet , said the alleged expense of implementing cleanfeed was no excuse .
His firm is acting as UK distributor of Netclean , a filtering technology developed in Sweden .
Watchdog is pushing Netclean as a cheaper alternative to Cleanfeed , the BT - developed filtering system used by all the major ISPs .
" The beauty of what we offer is it can be extremely cost effective to implement , " Mancer said .
Netclean allows filtering to take place outside ISPs ' networks , so several can use the same equipment .
Business provider Talk Internet has become the first UK customer for the system , filtering traffic based on the same IWF blocklist used by Cleanfeed .
Netclean is also being used by more than a dozen ISPs in the ongoing controversial internet filtering trials in Australia , where the government wants to providers to block much more than just child abuse material .
" It 's not easy to put a figure on return on investment , but more and more ISPs are aware of their social responsibility , " said Mancer , adding that the recent furore over the blocking of the whole of Wikipedia by the IWF and Cleanfeed would not have affected providers using Netclean , because it does not rely on proxying .
Clearly , ministers are extemely sensitive to criticism of their policies on child abuse .
The Home Office said the IWF blocklist was a " considerable success " and that it will continue to consider what further action might be needed .
It falls to small ISPs to judge what action , if any , might be forthcoming , and whether it would be cheaper to implement restrictions they view as pointless than to continue resisting . ®
Michael Malinowski and his two friends had been in the stormwater drain for about an hour when they heard a deep rumble that he later described as like an " earthquake " .
On January 20 last year , the three graffiti artists , Mr Malinowski , 27 , Holly Legge , 21 , and Dwaine Larrosa , 25 , had gone down the manhole at Lurline Bay to paint a mural , after learning about the site from the urban explorers known as the " Cave Clan " .
Michael Malinowski , left , survived , but Holly Legge , top right , and Dwaine Larrosa , whose funeral service was in North Ryde , bottom , died .
It had been a clear day , about 25 degrees on the surface when they descended five floors to do their art , Detective Sergeant Neil Apolony told Glebe Coroner 's Court today .
But within a couple of hours the conditions changed dramatically .

Researchers demonstrate cells that can power up in seconds .
Coated electrodes allow lithium - ion cells to charge up in seconds Getty
Two researchers have developed battery cells that can charge up in less time than it takes to read the first two sentences of this article .
The work could eventually produce ultra - fast power packs for everything from laptop computers to electric vehicles .
Byoungwoo Kang and Gerbrand Ceder of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge have found a way to get a common lithium compound to release and take up lithium ions in a matter of seconds .
The compound , which is already used in the electrodes of some commercial lithium - ion batteries , might lead to laptop batteries capable of charging themselves in about a minute .
The work appears in Nature1 this week .
Lithium-ion batteries are commonplace in everything from mobile phones to hybrid vehicles .
" They 're essentially devices that move lithium ions between electrodes , " says Ceder .
The batteries generate an electric current when lithium ions flow out from a storage electrode , float through an electrolyte , and are chemically bound inside the opposing cathode .
To recharge the battery , the process is reversed : lithium ions are ripped from the cathode compound and sent back to be trapped in their anode store .
The speed at which a battery can charge is limited by how fast its electrons and ions can move - particularly through its electrodes .
Researchers have boosted these rates by building electrodes from nanoparticle clumps , reshaping their surfaces , and using additives such as carbon .
But for most lithium - ion batteries , powering up still takes hours : in part because the lithium ions , once generated , move sluggishly from the cathode material to the electrolyte .
Tunnel vision
That seemed to be the case for lithium iron phosphate ( LiFePO 4 ) , a material that is used in the cathode of a small number of commercial batteries .
But when Ceder and Kang did some calculations , they saw that the compound could theoretically do much better .
Its crystal structure creates " perfectly sized tunnels for lithium to move through " , says Ceder .
" We saw that we could reach ridiculously fast charging rates . "
So why had n't anyone seen this speedy charging in practice ?
Ceder and Kang theorize that the lithium ions were having trouble finding their way to the crystal structure 's express tunnels .
The authors helped the ions by coating the surface of the cathode with a thin layer of lithium phosphate glass , which is known to be an excellent lithium conductor .
Testing their newly - coated cathode , they found that they could charge and discharge it in as little as 9 seconds .
" As far as I know , this is the fastest yet for this material , " comments Peter Bruce , a chemist at the University of St Andrews , UK .
The researchers do not know exactly how the disordered glass helps lithium ions transfer between the electrolyte and the cathode .
ADVERTISEMENT
Other materials , such as nickel oxide , have achieved similarly fast charging rates , says John Owen , a chemist at the University of Southampton , UK .
" This is a nice demonstration of the concept in a lithium system , " he says .
Lithium , though , can store more energy for less weight than nickel compounds , and holds its charge better .
It 's particularly important because lithium iron phosphate is already being used commercially , adds Bruce .
Speeding lithium ion movement would vastly improve energy recovery in hybrid vehicles , which recharge their batteries when the vehicle brakes — a process that lasts only seconds .
It could also eventually lead to fully electric vehicles that could charge reasonably quickly .
Ceder says that he thinks that improvements in modelling will allow researchers to find other candidates for ultra - fast batteries .
" My guess is that there are more materials like this out there , " he says .

CLEVELAND — Former Cleveland Councilman Robert
White , who resigned after pleading guilty to accepting bribes , will be sentenced this afternoon .
White will likely be sent to prison for between 1 ½ and 2 years , based on a plea agreement he struck with prosecutors in December .
He pleaded guilty to one count of bribery in U.S. District Court and admitted taking a $ 500 bribe in exchange for helping a Cleveland businessman get the electricity turned back on at his company .
White resigned from council the next day .
In November 2007 , the businessman asked White for help getting Cleveland Public Power to restore his electricity , which had been turned off for nonpayment , prosecutors said .
White agreed to help but wanted $ 500 for his effort .
White said after pleading guilty that taking the money from the businessman was a " bad decision . "
He apologized to the people in his ward and the city of Cleveland .
Prosecutors said in the plea agreement that they have more information about White but will not file additional criminal charges .
Prosecutors would not elaborate .
The sentencing is scheduled to begin at 12:30 p.m .

Attorney General suggests he may make secret Bush memos public John Byrne
Published : Tuesday February 3 , 2009
Print This Email This Obama 's freshly - confirmed Attorney General , Eric Holder , has opened the door to shedding light on a raft of clandestine legal memoranda issued in the name of the ' War on Terror ' under President George W. Bush .
Holder told senators in written responses to questions before his confirmation that he would consider declassifying controversial White House legal memos from the Bush era if no support for their original classification could be found , according to transcripts provided by the Senate .
Declassified briefs could then be made public .
A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment when asked directly about a new report detailing some three dozen secret memoranda issued by officials employed by President Bush .
In secret memos , Bush 's legal team outlined the defense of myriad controversial practices , such as the indefinite detention of enemy combatants , US policy on torture and the legality of domestic surveillance projects .
A chart created by the nonprofit reporting organization Pro Publica recently found that 40 of these memos remain secret , while just 12 have been made public .
The ratio of private to public memos remains unparalleled by the standard of recent US presidents .

Holder , who was confirmed by the Senate 75 - 21 on Monday , was responding to questions about " Secret Law " raised by civil liberties advocate , Sen. Russ Feingold ( D - WI ) , when he addressed the memos directly .
" I firmly believe that transparency is a key to good government , " Holder said .
" Openness allows the public to have faith that its government obeys the law .
Public scrutiny also provides an important check against unpersuasive legal reasoning -- reasoning that is biased toward a particular conclusion . "
 Once the new Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Office of Legal Counsel is confirmed , I plan to instruct that official to review the OLCs policies relating to publication of its opinions with the [ objective ] of making its opinions available to the maximum extent consistent with sound practice and competing concerns ,  Holder wrote .
Asked about the abuse of classification , Holder added : " I will review significant pending cases in which Justice Department has invoked the state secrets privilege , and will work with leaders in other agencies and professionals at the Department of Justice to ensure that the United States invokes the state secrets privilege only in legally appropriate situations . "
Holder 's comments were first noted by Secrecy News ' Steven Aftergood .
A reader writes :
The reader who wrote " Oh please " in response to another 's concerns about marijuana addiction needs to get a clue .
I spent a couple of very real , very sad years hung up on weed .
My life revolved around it : I woke up , and getting high was the first thing I thought about .
I went to work and was desperate to get home to smoke ; then I started getting high before work , occasionally .
( Before that job , I waited tables and smoked on the job with my coworkers in the employee bathroom ; those days too , I was usually desperate to get home to get high -- before I 'd remember that I already was . )
On my days off , instead of going out and doing things , I 'd plop myself in front of the TV with a bowl , and frequently devour a couple thousand calories of junk food in well under an hour .
Needless to say , I was n't exercising anywhere near enough to offset that .
My girlfriend had made it clear from early in our relationship that she did n't want to be married to a stoner , so I told her I only smoked once in a while and then planned our time together so that I 'd have plenty of time to hit the pipe at home and sober up again before we went out .
Of course it would have been easier just to not smoke , but that simply was n't an option -- I 'd throw away my stash , last a few days , and then call my dealer up .
While I waited for him , I 'd sneak into my roommates ' room and steal some of their weed .
I felt awful -- until I took the first hit , after which my guilt would melt away .
No , it was n't horribly debilitating in the sense that meth or cocaine or alcohol can be .
And when I finally stopped smoking and got some help , there were no awful withdrawal effects beyond a couple weeks of not knowing what to do with myself and confronting a lot of difficult emotions .
It turned out I was depressed , of course , and the pot was an easy way to avoid dealing with it .
Things worked out fine for me , and could have been much worse , but I still would n't wish the feelings of helplessness I had on anyone .
I remember so vividly telling myself over and over I should n't smoke because I had important things to do , and at the same time knowing I was going to crumble eventually .
It just brought me lower .
Despite all of this , I 'm very much for legalization , because I think the arguments for it make sense and because I think it 'll help dispel the myth that weed is n't addictive .
( " Not physical " shmysical -- if you find yourself up at 3 a.m. desperately scraping resin out of your bowl for the second time in a week , you have an addiction . )
Too many people 's attitudes are like the reader 's , whereas they 'd never so offhandedly dismiss the pain of someone admitting to a drinking problem .
That 's troubling , because I suspect there are more people going through what I did than most of us would guess .
Another writes :
I believe that marijuana should absolutely be legalized .
But it has been really psychologically damaging to me .
I 'm a senior in high school and for the last two years I have been smoking pot pretty regularly with my friends and at parties .
It was fun at the beginning of my junior year as my friends and I took our first few tokes .
Then , over the course of the year , for reasons unrelated to marijuana , I became depressed and anxious .
One of my regular self - abuse mechanisms was to look in the mirror and find all the asymmetry in my face and think about how I was actually the ugliest person in the world .
As this depression and anxiety developed within me , the fun of smoking pot declined .
I would leave my friends , go stand in front of the mirror , and find new asymmetry and faults in my face and hate myself even more .
I would spiral into my own thoughts and find thousands of reasons as to why I would never be happy .
I continued smoking pot until about three days ago .
Even when I 've made progress on my own issues , marijuana always brings me back down and allows me only to see bad things about myself .
Why would I ever want to smoke again ?
Another :
I am a 22 year old recent college graduate .
After smoking marijuana nearly every day for about 3 - 4 years , I am currently trying to quit the leafy green plant , or at least go on a break of a few months .
For at least the past couple months , every time I smoked I became intensely depressed .
But I kept the habit up anyway , because it 's the only thing I know .
I 've been adjusting to this new 9 - 5 grind , and part of that adjustment had been coming home ( to the parent 's home , while I save money ) and lighting up .
But , as a formerly creative person , I 'd found I had also been unable to create , though I 'm realizing now , this is n't really the sole fault of pot .
However , for a variety of reasons I am trying to give up this substance which had brought me much happiness for a few years , before I am hopelessly beholden to it .
Another :
While I agree that marijuana should be legalized , especially for medical purposes , I do n't think it 's completely harmless .
During a period in my life after college but before finding a job , I smoked multiple times a week .
I was getting high to escape feelings of uncertainty about my future .
It worked : while I was high , I did not feel these uncomfortable emotions .
Because of this , I was not motivated to do anything to prepare for my future .
Fortunately , I finally realized that I was in a bad downward spiral ; smoking pot was getting in the way of living a full and productive life .
I cut back on smoking , but I never stopped completely .
As I got my life on track , I came to realize that in moderation , I could enjoy pot but still be in charge of my life .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

The world at large still has aways to go before it catches up with Sweden 's Sigbritt Löthberg , but South Korea 's hoping to take a baby step in that direction by 2012 .
According to a new proposal by the Korea Communications Commission , it 's aiming to make broadband ten times faster in its nation in under three years , and according to the plan , it 'll take some $ 24.6 billion in order to make it happen .
The central government is looking to cough up around a third of that , with the rest having to come from private telecommunications companies .
We 're told that the initiative could create upwards of 120,000 jobs , and citizens will be able to kiss their 100 M bps connections goodbye as they replace 'em with 1 G bps alternatives .
The KCC hopes the move will enable more interactive TV services to be delivered along with additional e-commerce and home schooling ; South Korean residents , however , are probably just stoked about lowering their ping times .

Fueled by the surge behind prime time hosts Keith Olbermann and Rachel Maddow , MSNBC has jumped to second in the prime time cable news ratings .
Although CNN and MSNBC each have about half of the audience share of Fox News , March will be the first month ever that CNN has finished third in the ratings .
The problem for CNN is that Fox and MSNBC are both experiencing double digit ratings growth .
For FNC , ratings are up 30 % , and at MSNBC ratings are up 24 % .
In contrast , CNN has seen their ratings remain flat .
The Fox News prime time lineup is still dominant over the competition , but MSNBC has been able to bypass CNN at 8 pm with Olbermann ’s Countdown program dominating Campbell Brown ’s show .
Most interesting to me is the fact that Rachael Maddow ’s 9 pm show has almost caught up to CNN ’s Larry King Live .
It ’s my guess that it is only a matter of time before Maddow surpasses the stale King .
In an AP story about the rating CNN claimed that this was no big deal , but in reality it is a big deal .
CNN is the founding father of 24/7 cable news , but this status also appears to be part of their problem .
The landscape of cable news has changed .
Prime time shows are supposed to entertain while they inform .
This is what the prime time lineups at FNC and MSNBC do , or to put it another way , CNN has become a bland network that lacks an identity .

Although the former giant still is capable of putting up monstrous ratings when there is a breaking news story , on a day to day basis CNN seems to have no idea what direction it is going in .
Compare this to Fox and MSNBC who know exactly who their audience is and they direct their programming towards them .
Ask yourself this question who is the first person that pops into your head when you think of CNN ?
In all honesty , the first thing I think of is the voice of James Earl Jones saying , “ This is CNN .
” With Olbermann / Maddow occupying the left , and O’Reilly / Hannity on the right , where does CNN fit in ?
Much of the credit for MSNBC ’s prime time rise is justifiably given to Olbermann , but even more so , I think Rachael Maddow has been the recent driving force behind prime time .
Now that Olbermann has a proper partner in Maddow , MSNBC has been able to create a bloc of programming and further its progressive brand .
While Olbermann ’s show is doing fine , it is Maddow ’s show that is improving by leaps and bounds every week .
Most troubling for CNN is that a 10 pm replay of MSNBC ’s Countdown is doing well against CNN ’s Anderson Cooper .
While people on the left and right tend to engage in the battle between MSNBC and FNC , what is often overlooked is that the real loser in the prime time cable news wars is CNN , which still has its powerful brand name but it is lagging behind the competition in terms of both star power and interest .
Do you take your computer ’s security very seriously ?
Then a new PC which is set to ship next month may well be of interest , as it boasts a number of security features and defense measures , including a self - destruct mechanism which kicks in to wipe data if someone physically tampers with the machine .
Orwl is a compact PC – it ’s a disc - shaped device about the size of your palm – which is designed to be the ‘ world ’s most physically secure computer ’ according to the maker .
It comes with a unique key fob that uses NFC to communicate with the machine , and should the fob ( and therefore the user ) move more than 10 meters away from the PC , it locks itself – and shuts down its USB ( and other ) ports so they can’t possibly be used as an avenue for potential skullduggery .
Orwl is also full of various tamper - monitoring sensors ( including motion / shock detection and temperature monitors ) , and should it detect any tampering with its case by a would - be attacker trying to gain physical access to the PC , it can wipe the encryption key for its self - encrypted ( RSA - 4096 )
Intel SSD – meaning that your data wo n’t fall into the wrong hands .
The best Chromebook on the market is known for its security
Super secure
The device also benefits from other security measures including secure boot , secure firmware upgrade , and a password is needed to turn it on ( backed up with two - factor authentication , plus the aforementioned key fob ) .
Core specs include a Skylake Core m7 processor ( up to 1.2GHz ) with Intel HD Graphics 515 , 8GB of system RAM , and the encrypted SSD can be up to 480 GB in size .
You also get 802.11 ac Wi -Fi , Bluetooth LE 4.2 , an HDMI connector and a pair of USB Type - C ports .
It can come with Windows installed , or you can go for Linux : either Ubuntu or Qubes OS ( the latter being a specifically security - focused distro to tighten things up even further on the software side ) .
As we already mentioned , Orwl is set to ship in August , but it does n’t come cheap with the PC starting at $ 1,699 ( around £ 1,310 , AU $ 2,230 ) for the base version with a plastic case ( there ’s also a ‘ glass ’ model ) and a 120 GB SSD .
Obviously it ’s a niche product at that price bracket , aimed at real security enthusiasts only ( and indeed businesses and government employees ) .
But nonetheless it ’s an interesting look at some of the fancy security technology we might eventually see being incorporated into more run -of - the - mill PCs in the future .

Black Lace is back , whether you care or not
File this under : We Really Can't Explain This At All .
A 1984 song called Agadoo , made famous by a group called Black Lace , named the worst song of all time by a panel of music journalists , is being re-released .
Like we said , we really can't explain it .
Upon its original release 25 years ago , Agadoo , described as " magnificently dreadful " by Q magazine ( and we could n't agree more ) , peaked at number 2 .
It was kept from the coveted top spot by George Michael with his ballad Careless Whisper .
For reasons we still can't fathom , original Black Lace member Dene Michael is getting the gang back together ( minus Michael 's original band mate Alan Barton , who died in a bus crash in 1995 ) and is putting the song out again .
According to Michael , " With all the doom and gloom in the world , this is just what we need . "
We guess that 's as good a reason as any .
In case you were n't hip to Agaddo when it first appeared , it went a little something like this ...
The song proved so popular that is was spoofed by the show Spitting Image as The Chicken Song .
Frankly , we prefer the latter .
There was a time when teachers would freak at the sound of Jimi Hendrix 's " Purple Haze " or " Stone Free . "
Now the San Francisco school district wants them to get in the spirit .
" Remember the first time you heard Jimi Hendrix ? " reads the cover of the district 's new 51 - page education guide .
" Our plan is as transformational now as his music was then ! "
The manifesto is aimed at transforming the educational " experiences for every child in each of our schools . "
To drive home the point , a portrait of the '60s rocker - looking somewhat pensive , somber and perhaps stoned - graces the cover and every page of the manual .
The book also comes with a Hendrix poster and Hendrix - emblazoned canvas bag , which were handed out to a couple hundred administrators at Superintendent Carlos Garcia 's back - to - school confab in September .
Not everyone , however , is in tune with the campaign , given that the songwriter - guitarist died after overdosing on prescription drugs and alcohol at the age of 27 .
One school district employee , who asked not to be identified for fear of retaliation - but who described himself as a " liberal hippie educator who experienced the Summer of Love in San Francisco " - said he was disturbed that the Hendrix poster is popping up on school campuses .
" I find the choice of Hendrix as an inspiration to be used in an educational setting rather strange and out of touch , " he told us in an e-mail .
Garcia says he is just trying to " revolutionize " San Francisco 's schools , in the same way Hendrix 's guitar playing transformed music .
As for Hendrix 's druggie image ?
" Hey , " said Garcia .
" We 're in San Francisco . "
And on it goes :
More sparks between San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsomand Minister Christopher Muhammad , whose Nation of Islam followers have been dogging the mayor at his gubernatorial town hall meetings around the state .
Muhammad and his crew have been pummeling the mayor for what they say is his refusal to deal with toxic dust kicked up by developers at the former Hunters Point Naval Shipyard , a city - controlled site near a school that the Nation runs .
Newsom met privately with Muhammad a couple of weeks back , though things got off to a rough start when the minister showed up a half hour late .
Newsom essentially asked Muhammad to put up the evidence or shut up regarding the supposed health risks .
That led to a follow - up meeting Wednesday between the two , to which Newsom brought Public Health Department chief Mitch Katz and others to answer questions .
This time Muhammad was 15 minutes late .
Witnesses described another testy session that ended with Muhammad and one of the mayor 's aides getting into a heated , chest - bumping exchange in the hallway .
And things apparently got even hotter the following night out at the Bayview Opera House , where Muhammad and his followers took on Keith Jackson , a member of the Hunters Point development team - shaking him up enough that he filed a police report and got a temporary restraining order against the minister .
Muhammad did not return a call seeking comment .
Criminal complaint : When San Francisco State University student Joseph Yoon walked into the Taraval Police Station recently , he was hoping to make a complaint about an officer .
Instead , he wound up being cuffed and slapped with an assault citation by the very same officer he'd come to complain about .
" I could n't believe it , " Yoon said .
Yoon , president of the Korean Student Association at San Francisco State , went to the 24th Avenue station Feb. 9 to complain about how Officer James Nguyen had handled a traffic accident involving Yoon the night before .
Nguyen , 42 , a 10 - year veteran , apparently overheard what was going on and rather than walk away , stepped into the waiting room and told Yoon he had no cause for complaint .
Sgt. James Acevedo , who was summoned to the front , told us that Yoon was agitated and that his own officer was " a little upset , " so he tried to split them up .
Before leaving , however , Nguyen told Yoon that he could be arrested if he made false statements about how the accident had been handled .
At this point the story splits three ways :
-- Nguyen 's police report says
Yoon turned , his hands balled into fists , and stepped forward .
-- According to Yoon , he simply turned , raised his hands palms open and asked , " What are you going to do about it ? "
-- Acevedo said Yoon cursed , puffed out his chest and " advanced in a threatening manner . "
The sergeant says he figured Yoon was about to assault Nguyen , so he had him handcuffed to a bar in the holding area .
There he stayed for at least two hours , until he was cited for alleged misdemeanor assault on a police officer and released .
The citing officer : Nguyen .
Acevedo says he never asked Nguyen what he was doing confronting Yoon .
Nor did the sergeant concede that his own officer 's conduct might have made the situation worse .
We asked the captain in charge of Taraval Station , Paul Chignell , to pass along an interview request to Nguyen .
We have n't heard back from the officer .
Chignell , who was n't there at the time , said that " my officers did nothing wrong . "
A captain at another station , however , wondered why Chignell and other department supervisors do n't appear to be concerned about the incident .
" I do n't get it - where is the assault ? " said the captain , who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak for the department .
Apparently , District Attorney Kamala Harrisdoes n't think much of the " assault " either .
Her office chose not to file charges .

CouchDB - A use case
This article tries to give you an overview on how CouchDB can be used to map data to a data storage and how it is completely different from relational databases .
I try to introduce the basic concepts and show an advanced use case .
The application
The problem I try to solve is the typical example of a group based user permission management .
Let 's take a look how this would be commonly solved in a RDBMS ( relational database management system ) :
+------+
+-------+
+------------+ | user | | group | | permission |
+------+
+-------+
+------------+ | id | <- n:m -> | id | <- n:m -> | id | | name | | name | | name | | ... | | ... | | ... | +------+
+-------+
+------------+
We basically have a list of permissions associated with each group , and each user associated to any number of groups .
In the database you need of course create the five required tables for this , and then you can query the data by a simple query with some JOINs .
We do this for years , and it can be considered as basic handcraft .
So , how can this be done with CouchDB ?
The basic documents
In CouchDB we do not talk about rows , or database entries - we talk about documents .
We have some database , which contains all documents , which are required for our application with no constraints on the data contained by the documents in the database itself .
The documents itself are just random JSON objects - with any number of attributes and any depth of nesting of objects and arrays in the properties .
In the tables above the table columns define the data which can be stored in the tables , and thus , which data can be stored in the database at all .
If there are additional fields , which should be stored in the user table , for example - the schema needs to be changed by adding additional columns or tables .
With the known problems .
CouchDB is accessed through HTTP , which is not really relevant here , as this is just the method to connect to the server .
You will notice this though , because documents and views are accessed through URLs in this article instead of plain table or database names in RDBMS .
Document constraints
You of course want to apply constraints to your data in your database , like when you want to query all users from your database - without all the other documents .
In CouchDB you can do so by specifying views .
Views are basically functions in any language , which are called for each document in the database and decide , if they want to index the current document by some key .
By default the functions are written in ECMAScript ( Javascript ) , but you can also use PHP or any other language for this .
Views are also documents in the CouchDB database , located in a special folder of the database .
Each view document can contain any number of actual view functions , which can be considered as a method to group view functions .
Commonly the views for documents which fulfill a similar set of constraints are contained in one view document .
A practical example
Consider the above mentioned example of querying all users in a database .
The constraint we apply for user documents may be , that the documents are required to have a property called " username " , or a property of the name " type " , which contains the string " user " or whatever you can imagine and fits your use case .
When you use the PHPillow document classes each document has such a type property , which then serves as a good basic constraint in the view functions .
So I will use it here in my basic example :
function ( doc ) { if ( doc.type == ' user ' ) { emit ( doc._id , doc._id ) ; } }
This is a really trivial example of a view function , which really just ensures the document has the value " user " in type property and the calls the special CouchDB emit ( ) function .
The emit function takes a key and a value and creates an index from the provided keys .
If emit ( ) is not called for one document , the document will not be added to the respective index , like for all documents which do have a type != ' user ' in this case .
The key can be of any type , not only ID strings / int , like in this case , but this is not yet relevant , and we get back to this later .
The same is true for the value , but for a user listing the IDs are enough , which enable us to fetch the entire document later with the ID .
More complex view
Beside the very basic view shown above , with a turing complete language you can implement far more complex constraints on the documents .
The following example shows a still simple variant , which only would return users with confirmed accounts , indicated by a property confirmed , set to true .
View functions are contained by just another document in the database .
A complete view definition document with both view functions , stored to the path / database / _design / users would the be a JSON structure like :
{ " language " : " javascript " , " views " : { " all " : { " map " : " function ( doc ) { if ( doc.type == ' user ' ) { emit ( doc._id , doc._id ) ; } } " } , " registered " : { " map " : " function ( doc ) { if ( ( doc.type == ' user ' ) && ( doc.confirmed === true ) ) { emit ( doc._id , doc._id ) ; } } " } } }
We now defined two view functions , which give us different subsets of the documents based on the constraints in the view functions .
The view itself can be queried by accessing the path / database / _view / users / registered , which would list the IDs of all registered users in the database .
The view result can be influenced with skip and count ( like LIMIT ) , or by keys , which is described in further detail in the CouchDB documentation and is not relevant yet .
Adding groups and permissions
Like in the model above we need to add groups and permissions to the database .
We do this in group documents , containing lists of associated users and the actual permissions .
Such a document could look like :
{ " _id " : " group-users " , " _rev " : " 7984327592 " , " name " : " Users " , " permissions " : [ " wiki-read " , " wiki- write " ] , " users " : [ " user - kore " , " user - john " ] , " type " : " group " }
It just has a name , id ( like every document in a CouchDB database ) , the common type property and the two arrays with permission identifiers and user IDs .
This is exactly the data we represented in the five RDBMS tables shown above in two different document types .
But how to query such data ?
The most common query probably is to request the permissions of an user , for example when he logs into the system .
Let 's write a CouchDB view function for this :
function ( doc ) { if ( doc.type == " group " ) { for ( var i = 0 ; i < doc.users.length ; ++i ) { emit ( doc.users[i ] , doc.permissions ) ; } } }
In this function we emit the permissions for each user associated with the current group .
CouchDB perfectly works with multiple values emitted for one key , and will return all of them , if the data for this key is requested .
If we now query the view with the key " user - kore " we get a result set like :
{ " rows " : [ { " key " : " user - kore " , " value " : [ " wiki-read " , " wiki- write " ] } ] }
If we have multiple groups associated with one user , with overlapping permissions , they of course may be set multiple times in the view result .
But what is map without reduce ?
Of course CouchDB can do this for you .
This is why all those view functions were defined in a property called map .
Let 's have a look at such a map reduce of user permissions and the result of this :
{ " language " : " javascript " , " views " : { " user_permissions " : { " map " : " function ( doc ) { if ( doc.type == " group " ) { for ( var i = 0 ; i < doc.users.length ; ++i ) { emit ( doc.users[i ] , doc.permissions ) ; } } } " , " reduce " : " function ( keys , values ) { var permissions = [ ] ; for ( var i = 0 ; i < values.
length ; ++i ) { if ( permissions.indexOf ( values [ i ] ) == - 1 ) { permissions .
push ( values [ i ] ) ; } } return permissions ; } " , } , } }
The reduce function is called with the return values from the view and receives two arrays , the keys of the result and the values from the result .
With those information we can now build up a JSON structure which should match the JSON structure retuned from the map function .
This enables partial reduce spread over multiple nodes , or vertical splitting of reduce result calculation .
In this case we just aggregate all permission arrays passed to the reduce function into one permission array .
When called for all users , the array will contain all permissions by all users , or , queried for just one user , it will contain all permissions of one user :
{ " rows " : [ { " key " : null , " value " : [ " wiki-read " , " wiki- write " ] } ] }
We can of course also query this data for one user .
This always returns a unique list of permission for each user with quite simple structure in out CouchDB database .
The additional features like grouping of view results would allow us to query the permissions for each grouped key ( for each user ) , in just one query .
Advanced interesting features
Attachments
Each document may have any number of files attached .
They are directly accessible using the proper URL .
The documents returned then have a new property which contains a list with the attached documents .
View collations
As mentioned above , the keys emitted by the emit ( ) function may be of any JSON structure .
With the sorting of keys this enables you to implement - for example - tree structures of your data trivially .
Think of hierarchical forums , navigations structures , etc. - for more details take a look at view collations in the wiki .

Documents and view documents for the application described above are delivered with the default distribution of PHPillow .
Information about the usage can be found in the tutorial and the test cases of PHPillow .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Merck & Co Inc said on Monday it would acquire Schering - Plough Corp for $ 41.1 billion , uniting the makers of cholesterol drugs Zetia and Vytorin in the second megadeal for big pharma in weeks .
The deal between the New Jersey drugmakers comes amid a harsher climate for pharmaceutical companies , as they have failed to produce enough new drugs to replace old ones , and as the new Obama administration prepares healthcare reforms that could pressure drug prices .
It also landed the same day that Roche Holding AG moved closer to acquiring the 44 percent of Genentech Inc that Roche does not already own , with a source telling Reuters the two sides are discussing a deal for about $ 46.7 billion .
Schering - Plough ’s earnings and share price have deteriorated over the past year due to a plunge in sales of Vytorin and Zetia , its biggest products , even as several of its most promising drugs move into very costly late - stage trials .
Merck , which has seen profits and shares battered by Vytorin ’s decline and other setbacks , has deeper pockets and would help fund research on Schering - Plough products , including promising blood clot and hepatitis C drugs .
“ The deal gives Merck more breathing room , ” said Mehta Partners analyst Viren Mehta , as it girds for patent expirations in 2012 on its $ 4 billion - a- year Singulair asthma drug and by next year for its Cozaar blood - pressure treatment .
The deal , which many analysts have forecast for years given the Vytorin partnership between Merck and Schering - Plough , follows Pfizer Inc ’s $ 68 billion planned purchase of Wyeth .
Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said it was surprising that Wyeth and Schering - Plough agreed to sell , given their depressed stocks and their robust long - term outlooks .
“ What could this imply about how pharma company management teams view the future of the industry ? ” Anderson said .
The transaction offers a premium of 34 percent for Schering - Plough shareholders based on Friday ’s closing price and will generate savings of $ 3.5 billion annually after 2011 .
Merck and Schering - Plough , which announced significant job cuts last fall , said about 15 percent of their combined workforce would be eliminated under the deal , with most job cuts to take place outside the United States .
“ It seems somewhat inevitable , ” analyst Jeffrey Holford of Jefferies in London said of the deal , referring to an industry coping with generic rivals as cost cuts have run their course .
“ The industry needs to shrink because there is just not the same market for branded pharmaceuticals going forward as there has been over the last 10 years .
There is overcapacity and ( Merck and Schering - Plough ) need to take each other ’s capacity out of the market . ”
It will also double the number of experimental medicines Merck has in late - stage development to 18 and diversify Merck ’s lineup of medicines to include cardiovascular , respiratory , oncology , neuroscience and infectious disease .
Schering - Plough shareholders will receive 0.5767 shares of Merck and $ 10.50 in cash for each of their shares , valuing each share of Schering - Plough at $ 23.61 .
Schering - Plough investors have reason to feel short - changed , said Caris & Co analyst David Moskowitz .
“ I think it should be at least $ 12 billion to $ 15 billion higher , ” he said .
“ I do n’t think investors will be happy until the price comes up to the high - $ 20 ’s or $ 30 ( per share ) . ”
Schering - Plough shares rose 14.2 percent to $ 20.13 , still below their 52 - week high of $ 22.78 .
Merck closed down 7.7 percent at $ 20.99 , after hitting a 14 - year low of $ 20.10 .
Slideshow ( 5 images )
Merck ’s 4.75 percent notes due in 2015 traded weaker , with spreads widening to 149 basis points over Treasuries , yielding 4.4 percent .
On March 4 , in their last notable trade , the spread was 124 basis points with a yield of 4.2 percent , according MarketAxess data .
ARTHRITIS DRUG RIGHTS IN QUESTION
A big question is whether Merck will inherit Schering - Plough ’s overseas rights to nearly $ 2 billion - a- year Remicade and newer arthritis drug golimumab .
Analysts expressed surprise at Merck ’s confidence it will not have to hand back the arthritis drug rights to Johnson & Johnson under a change of control clause .
Slideshow ( 5 images )
Merck , which structured its takeover as a reverse merger that analysts said may give it some leverage to protect the arthritis drugs , said it had not discussed the matter with J&J and that the high - stakes issue would be settled by binding arbitration if J&J throws up a roadblock .
“ It is theoretically possible that J&J comes in and bids for Schering - Plough , because the fit between Schering - Plough and J&J would be a good one , ” said Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson .
J&J officials declined to comment .
The deal is composed of $ 9.8 billion in cash , $ 8.5 billion in financing provided by JPMorgan Chase & Co and $ 22.8 billion in Merck stock .
Merck Chief Executive Richard Clark , who investors initially considered a caretaker CEO when he took the helm in 2005 , will lead the combined company , with Merck shareholders owning a 68 percent stake .
Schering - Plough CEO Fred Hassan , who turned around Pharmacia Corp before selling it to Pfizer Inc , said his plans after the Schering - Plough deal is completed are unclear .
Merck , which vowed to maintain its dividend , expects the deal to close in the fourth quarter and add modestly to operating earnings in the first full year following completion and “ significantly ” after that .
The combined 2008 revenue of the two companies totaled $ 47 billion and Merck believes it will maintain its current credit ratings .
Bernstein ’s Anderson cautioned that such a big company , with combined revenues close to Pfizer ’s , could have a much harder time delivering earnings growth .
J.P. Morgan acted as financial adviser and Fried , Frank , Harris , Shriver & Jacobson LLP acted as legal adviser to Merck .
Goldman , Sachs and Morgan Stanley acted as financial advisers and Wachtell , Lipton , Rosen & Katz acted as legal adviser to Schering - Plough .

Two Israeli traffic policemen have been shot dead near the West Bank town of Nablus and an operation is under way to try to catch the attacker or attackers .
The dying officers were found in their overturned car in the Massua district of the Jordan Valley .
It is the first fatal shooting of an Israeli in the West Bank since April of last year .
A previously unknown group , named after a dead Lebanese Hezbollah leader , has claimed responsibility for the attack .
The Imad Mughniyeh Group , named after the man killed by a bomb in Damascus just over a year ago , made its claim in messages to foreign media .
Israel denied any role in the Hezbollah leader 's assassination .
The Israeli intelligence services had issued an alert saying there could be retaliation on the anniversary of his death , 12 February .
However , it was thought that this would target Israeli businessmen or holidaymakers abroad , the BBC's Paul Wood reports from Jerusalem .
Sensitive time
Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said a " nationalistic motive " appeared to have been behind Sunday 's attack .
Our correspondent says the West Bank had become relatively peaceful before Sunday 's attack .
Palestinian police , trained and funded by the West , have become increasingly effective in clamping down on militants , our correspondent says .
The attack took place in an area close to the Jordanian border and under Israeli security control .
Our correspondent says anger has been running high since Israel 's offensive in the Gaza Strip , which left some 1,300 Palestinians dead .
The shooting also comes at a particularly sensitive time as Israel 's government agonises over how many Palestinian militants it could release from prison in exchange for captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit , our correspondent adds .
Massua is located in the Jordan Valley , just south - east of Nablus and near the major West Bank settlement of Ariel .
The Haaretz newspaper says that a driver from the West Bank settlement of Kochav Hashahar was seriously wounded when a gunman opened fire on his car on the highway near the settlement in January .

Real - time microblogging and messaging services like Twitter could potentially become a threat to Google -- whose search index does n't keep up with conversations as quickly as Twitter's .
So what does Google ( GOOG ) CEO Eric Schmidt think about Twitter ?
" Speaking as a computer scientist , I view all of these as sort of poor man 's email systems , " he said this afternoon at Morgan Stanley 's technology conference .
( Live notes here . )
What 's he talking about ?
" In other words , they have aspects of an email system , but they do n't have a full offering .
To me , the question about companies like Twitter is :
Do they fundamentally evolve as sort of a note phenomenon , or do they fundamentally evolve to have storage , revocation , identity , and all the other aspects that traditional email systems have ?
Or do email systems themselves broaden what they do to take on some of that characteristic ?
I think the innovation is great .
In Google 's case , we have a very successful instant messaging product , and that 's what most people end up using .
Twitter 's success is wonderful , and I think it shows you that there are many , many new ways to reach and communicate , especially if you are willing to do so publicly . "
Schmidt also plugged Google 's new Twitter account .
But he flubbed Twitter 's famous 140 characters - per- message limit in the process , describing @google as a place to " go ahead and listen to our ruminations as to where we are and what we 're doing in 160 characters or less . "
The Dutch team has defeated the heavily favored Dominican Republic team twice in one week , and now will advance in the World Baseball Classic .
My Dad moved to America from Holland when he was 10 , so I consider the Dutch my brothers .
In order to help my fellow countrymen celebrate I have prepared a gallery of their rabid fans .
The Netherlands is known for having some of the best fans in all of sport .
Most of these photos come from Football ( Soccer ) matches , however the Dutch represent at every event that they are competitive in , including skiing , speed skating , cycling , swimming , and now Baseball .
OLPC may be facing some tough times as of late , but there 's no denying that the little - laptop - that - could has made an impact where it 's been distributed , as evidenced by this latest indication of the project 's reach in Rwanda .
Apparently , in addition to helping students with their schoolwork , the laptop is also teaching them the fine art of finding free WiFi , and this particular group seems to have quickly discovered that the Kigali International Airport is one of the best spots in town .
And just what are they using the laptops to look up in their time outside the classroom ?

I CAME ACROSS the following quote from Barack Obama while surfing the internets :
... given the increasing diversity of America 's population , the dangers of sectarianism have never been greater .
Whatever we once were , we are no longer just a Christian nation ; we are also a Jewish nation , a Muslim nation , a Buddhist nation , a Hindu nation , and a nation of nonbelievers .
And even if we did have only Christians in our midst , if we expelled every non-Christian from the United States of America , whose Christianity would we teach in the schools ?
Would we go with James Dobson's , or Al Sharpton's ?
Which passages of Scripture should guide our public policy ?
Should we go with Leviticus , which suggests slavery is ok and that eating shellfish is abomination ?
How about Deuteronomy , which suggests stoning your child if he strays from the faith ?
Or should we just stick to the Sermon on the Mount - a passage that is so radical that it 's doubtful that our own Defense Department would survive its application ?
So before we get carried away , let 's read our bibles .
Folks have n't been reading their bibles .
...
My first reaction was probably the same as yours — gratitude that we have such a reasonable and courageous mind at the helm right now .
But I also had some thoughts about the specific issues these two paragraphs raise , so briefly , about the religious right :
" We are no longer just a Christian Nation . "
The ongoing conservative claim that the United States is a Christian nation is a prime example of pure political rhetoric : rhetoric used only with an eye to its effect , without any regard for the truth .
Remember back in high school English when the teacher explained the difference between " denotation " and " connotation " ?
Between what a word actually means , and the emotional impact of the word ?
Call someone a fascist , and you get all the emotional associations of Hitler , and concentration camps , and Colonel Klink .
But the actual meaning of the word has to do with a certain type of government structure .
Or , call someone an angel , and you get a completely different emotional reaction .
But no one is likely to ask you whether you intend to imply that they could dance on the head of a pin , or whether their existence is purely intellectual .
This idea of a " Christian nation " is purely connotative , purely an emotional claim — aimed at rousing the base of the religious right .
It has no substance .
No one seriously believes that the United States was ever intended to be a theocracy .
It 's quite clear that the founding fathers — many of whom were not Christians at all in the modern , fundamentalist , sense of the word — did not think that the nation should ever endorse any one religion over another .
And , as Obama points out , the truth ( small - t ) is that we are a much more complex people than that .
Our nation includes Christians , Muslims , Hindus , Atheists , Mormons , Buddhists , several different varieties of Native American spirituality , and many , many , more .
But it gets more interesting : " And even if we did have only Christians in our midst , if we expelled every non-Christian from the United States of America , whose Christianity would we teach in the schools ? "
More on that next time ...
A Lok Adalat on Sunday ruled that even a second wife has the right to maintenance for herself and the couple ’s child .
The court dealing with pending matrimonial cases asked a Delhi police constable to pay his second wife Rs4,000 per month as maintenance .
The court also asked him to include the name of his second wife ’s daughter in his official documents , including the Central Government Health Scheme , so that the child can avail of the medical facility .
The policeman had married the woman in 2003 even though his first marriage was alive .
He has three children from the first marriage .
“ The court decided that my wife will keep her and I will pay her Rs4,000 a month .
I am happy with the decision , ” he said .
The court has fixed March 5 for the final disposal of the case .
About 5,426 cases of domestic violence and 7,700 cases of maintenance are pending in five district courts in the capital .
Not long before she was killed , Fern Holland told a friend she was thinking about coming back to Oklahoma , maybe settling down and starting a family .
She walked away from a high - paying job with a Tulsa law firm to join the Peace Corps in 1999 , drifting from war zone to war zone across Africa and the Middle East .
After the 2003 invasion of Iraq , she went to work for the Coalition Provisional Authority , dodging mortars and car bombs to promote women ’s rights in the country ’s fledgling democracy .
" It ’s not easy to picture her as a soccer mom , ” says Stephen Rodolf , a Tulsa attorney who worked with Holland and remained a close friend after she left town .
" She would have to find a way to juggle being a mom and being an activist — because that ’s just who she was .
She could n’t not do it . ”
Five years ago today — March 9 , 2004 — insurgents disguised themselves as Iraqi police to stop Holland ’s car at a checkpoint .
Apparently hoping to derail Holland ’s campaign to win the right to vote for Iraqi women , they shot and killed her , along with an Iraqi translator and a fellow activist who were traveling with her .
Holland , 33 , became the first U.S. civilian to die in the war , attracting international news coverage when the Pentagon announced the deaths on March 11 .
That same day — within hours of hearing the news —
Holland ’s family asked Rodolf to set up the Fern Holland Charitable Foundation , raising money to continue her work in Iraq and elsewhere .
" We did n’t want her work to end that way , ” Rodolf said .
" We were n’t going to let that happen . ”
A year after her sister ’s death , Vi Holland went to west Africa , visiting the refugee camps and shanty towns where her sister had worked in an effort to figure out the best places to send the donations .
" When you stand there in the heat and the humidity , when you stand there in the stench and the squalor , it affects you , ” Vi Holland said .
" It changes you .
For the first time , I really understood Fern .
I understood why she did what she did , because once you ’ve seen it , you have to do something . ”
The foundation was no longer just a way to remember Fern Holland ’s work .
It was Vi Holland ’s cause , too .
Bath products to raise money
Since 2004 , the foundation has raised between $ 50,000 and $ 60,000 , channeling most of it through Women for Women International , a group founded by one of the Iraqi women who worked with Fern Holland .
But in recent years , after Fern Holland ’s name fell out of the headlines and the American public grew weary of the war in Iraq , donations have slowed to a trickle .
In fact , Rodolf described the foundation as being at a " virtual standstill . ”
But Vi Holland has a plan .
This spring , she ’s launching a new line of bath and body products called " Violet Fern , ” with half the proceeds going to the charitable trust .
A single mother living in Collinsville , Vi Holland does n’t have time to travel the world the way her sister did .
But she ’s learning to do what Fern Holland might have done , if she had gotten the chance .
She ’s learning how to juggle being a mom and being an activist .
" It might sound over - the - top to some people , ” Vi Holland said of her little sister .
" But this is a way to keep Fern with me , to keep her spirit alive . ”
Scratch another one against privacy in the name of " public safety " and " protection " : Following European Union directives , Spain will disconnect all pre-paid phone lines that are n't registered with the owner 's personal information .
Who wins here ?
Advertisement
The move comes as part of a campaign that orders people to " Identify yourself ! " , just like when Franco was a dictator .
They want pre-paid phones to be associated with the user 's personal information , including name , address , and national ID numbers ( the equivalent to the Social Security number in the US ) .
The new law also requires operators to register every single call made and hold the information for a year .
The reasoning of the European Union and the retarded Spanish government is that , by doing this , they can avoid bomb attacks like the ones that happened in Madrid 's train stations in March 11 , 2004 , where terrorist triggered bombs using cellphones , killing 191 people and wounding 1,800 .
As if the terrorists could n't forge identification data .
Advertisement
But does this make sense ?
Yes , bombs can be triggered with cellphones , but what difference does this make ?
They can be triggered by suicide bombers too , clocks , radio control , and by any other method you can think about .
The fact is that there were bombs in Spain — and everywhere else — being triggered by a variety of methods before cellphones arrived .
Cellphones are just one of them .
Does these irrational fears justify a campaign to control the communication of private citizens , specially when the bad guys can avoid the controls and use alternative methods to wreak havoc in society ?
Paraphrasing Churchill :
Do you want to die free and standing up , or live under fear and control , like in a fascist state ?

Artificial muscles are likely to be essential components of robotics , prosthetic limbs , and a variety of micro-machinery .
Quite a few designs are out there , involving materials like carbon nanotubes and silicon elastomers but , to one degree or another , these usually fail to operate as well as natural human muscles .
In today ’s issue of Science , University of Texas at Dallas scientists led by Ray Baughman report on a new type of muscle that dramatically outperforms biological ones in nearly every way .
Baughman ’s research group created carbon nanotube aerogel sheets by pulling nanotubes from a mass of disordered tubes into organized bundles of ribbons .
These bundles formed an aerogel with a surprisingly low density ( about 1.5 mg / cm3 ) , making them nearly as light as air .
Just one gram of this material can cover an area of over 30 m2 .
Although these sheets can spread out , they are also compressible .
Their thickness can be reduced 400 - fold , decreasing their overall volume .
Perhaps even more notable than their low density is their amazing elasticity , which is simultaneously combined with hardness .
The aerogel sheets can stretch both in thickness and width when electric current is pumped into them .
The current causes adjacent bundles of nanotubes to repel each other , forcing the gel as a whole to expand .
Width - wise , it can elongate by 220 percent at a rate of 37,000 percent per second .
That is superior to other carbon nanotube materials , which have a actuation rate of only 20 percent per second .
To put that into perspective , natural muscles has a maximum rate of 50 percent per second , so the material outperforms muscle by a factor of over 700 .
The thickness of the sheets can also stretch to about 200 percent .
The hardness comes in because this material is inelastic along its length .
Whenever the material stretches in width or thickness , it contracts in length , but only by a few percent .
It ca n’t stretch in length because it 's extremely rigid in that axis and can generate an isometric stress ( isometric means without changing shape ) of 3.2 MPa , which is 32 times more than the sustainable maximum for skeletal muscles .
An accompanying perspective describes this difference in behavior between the two axes as follows : " this apparently unprecedented degree of anisotropy is akin to having diamond - like behavior in one direction and rubber - like behavior in the others . "
The material can also operate in a large temperature range that would be impossible for biological materials .
From 25 �C to over 1200�C , the properties of the material remain relatively stable .
While Baughman ’s artificial muscle is temperature - independent and superelastic and has high isometric stress - generation capability , biology is n't obsolete just yet .
The new material does n’t measure up to natural muscles in at least one way : maximum work achieved for every cycle .
It can do 30 J/kg , which is lower than the 40 J/kg for real muscles .
Given the positive properties of these artificial muscles , they have the potential to allow prosthetics and future robots to operate with superior muscle elasticity and isometric stress generation , even at extreme temperatures .
But Baughman and his colleagues also envision a variety of other uses for them .
The new material has interesting optical properties , as it can diffract light in a direction that is perpendicular to the nanotubes ' alignment and this can be modulated to different frequencies .
Finally , these muscles can be elongated and then immobilized in their stretched states at various densities .
Combining that factor with the optical properties and voltage - dependent actuation , the authors propose using their material for “ organic light - emitting displays , solar cells , charge stripping from ion beams , and cold electron field emission . ”

The smallest exoplanet ever seen is less than twice the size of Earth , and orbits a star similar to our sun 390 light years away .
Astronomers recently spotted this world , the most Earth - like planet yet discovered , with the COROT satellite .
" For the first time , we have unambiguously detected a planet that is
' rocky ' in the same sense as our own Earth , ” said Malcolm Fridlund , ESA
COROT project scientist .
For all its similarity to our own globe , though , it is still a far cry away from a habitable Earth - twin .
For one thing , it is so hot — between 1,830 and 2,730 degrees Fahrenheit — that scientists think it might be covered in lava .
It orbits extremely close to its sun and whips around the star once every 20 hours .
Nonetheless , the discovery takes us one step closer to finding another world that could host life .
The newly found planet , dubbed COROT - Exo - 7b , is distinct from most of the roughly 330 exoplanets so far discovered , which are by and large gas giants like Jupiter .
This planet , however , is a terrestrial world like Earth , and seems to have a density similar to that of our own planet .
" Finding such a small planet was not a complete surprise , " Daniel Rouan , an astronomer at the Observatoire de Paris Lesia , said in a press release .
" COROT - Exo - 7 b belongs to a class of objects whose existence had been predicted for some time .
COROT was designed precisely in the hope of discovering some of these objects . "
Terrestrial planets are so hard to find because they are small , and their low mass makes it tough to detect their gravitational pull on parent stars ( a common way of discovering exoplanets ) .
COROT ( Convection , Rotation and Planetary Transits ) , a European Space Agency spacecraft , instead hunts for exoplanets by searching for changes in a star ’s brightness caused by a planet passing in front of it .
The drop in light of COROT - Exo - 7 b ’s star as the planet moves in front can be seen in the graph above .
This technique is particularly successful with planets that orbit close in to their star , even if they are small .
“ We now have to understand this object further to put it into context , and continue our search for smaller , more Earth - like objects with COROT , " Fridlund said .
The researchers announced the finding today at a COROT symposium in Paris .

US Treasury Unveils Plan to Buy Banks ' Troubled Assets
Last Monday the US Treasury presented a plan that is aimed at cleaning toxic assets from banks ' balance sheets .
The Treasury is to take over up to $ 1 trillion in bad assets ( such as mortgage securities ) with the help of private investors .
According to the plan , for every $ 100 of bad mortgages being purchased from banks , the private sector would put up $ 7 that would then be matched by $ 7 from the government .
The remaining $ 86 would be covered by a government loan .
It is believed that banks fund economic activity by means of credit expansion .
Toxic assets , however , cause banks to curtail the expansion of credit and thereby plunge the economy into a severe economic slump .
So it is not surprising that for most experts and President Obama the success of the Treasury plan ( i.e. , the removal of toxic assets from banks ' balance sheets ) is a key for economic recovery .
The goal , said President Obama ,
is to get banks lending again , so families can get basic consumer loans , auto loans , student loans , ( and so on ) that small businesses are able to finance themselves , and we can start getting this economy moving again .
( MSNBC.com March 23,2009 )
Some commentators , such as Nobel laureate Paul Krugman , are of the view that what is needed to get the economy going is to nationalize banks .
By doing so , the government could force the banks to expand credit .
The increase in lending would then provide support to various economic activities and this in turn would set the foundation for general economic expansion .
If what keeps the economy depressed is too many toxic assets on banks ' balance sheets , then it makes sense to do whatever is necessary to remove those assets from banks ' balance sheets .
Equally , it also makes sense to nationalize banks and force them to lend .
We suggest , however , that what matters when it comes to economic recovery is the state of real savings .
Contrary to popular thinking , it is real savings that fund economic activity and not bank lending .
Real Savings and Lending
Consider John the baker who has produced ten loaves of bread and has consumed two loaves .
The real savings here is eight loaves of bread .
Let us say that John decided to lend his real savings ( eight loaves of bread ) to a shoemaker Bill for a pair of shoes in one month 's time .
Through lending , John supplies
Bill the shoemaker with the means of sustenance ( eight loaves of bread ) while Bill is busy making shoes .
Also note that what made the lending possible here is the saved loaves of bread .
Hence , what limits the size of lending is the amount of loaves saved .
If John could produce twelve loaves and consume two loaves , then he would be able to increase his lending from eight loaves to ten .
Now let us introduce an intermediary and let 's called it a bank .
Instead of lending eight loaves directly , John transfers his saved bread to the bank .
The bank in turn lends it to Bill the shoemaker or to other individuals .
Bank lending here is dictated by real savings — eight loaves of bread — and it is real savings that sets the size of lending here .
Now let us assume that John 's real savings declines — his production of bread has fallen to eight loaves while his consumption is still two loaves .
In this case , the bank would be forced to curtail it 's lending to six loaves .
Would it make sense to blame the bank for curtailing lending ?
Introducing Money
The essence of our analysis does not change with the introduction of money .
Now John the baker can exchange his saved loaves for money .
When deemed necessary , John can use the money to secure various goods and services .
John can also decide to lend the money to another producer .
The borrower can now use the money and secure consumer goods that will support him while he is engaged in the production of other goods ( say , tools and machinery ) .
Again , note that what makes the lending possible here is not money but the saved consumer goods .
Money just serves here as a facilitator .
Or we can say that the act of lending here is about the transfer of final consumer goods from lender to a borrower with the help of money .
The essence of credit will not be altered by the introduction of banks .
Instead of lending money directly , John could now engage in lending through the intermediary .
( John transfers his money to the bank .
The bank lends the money to a borrower . )
Real savings determines the size of credit .
What people really want is real stuff , i.e. , real savings and not money as such .
Hence , as long as banks facilitate credit that is fully backed by real savings , they should be seen as the agents in the transmission of wealth .
In the modern monetary system , which is presided over by the central bank , banks can embark on lending that is not fully backed by real savings — credit created " out of thin air . "
In the case of fully backed credit , the borrower secures goods that were produced and saved for him .
This , however , is not the case with unbacked credit .
No goods were produced and saved here .
As a result of the unbacked credit , an additional demand for various goods emerges .
This leads to an attempt at expanding the infrastructure of the economy .
This attempt is bound to fail since the flow of real savings is not large enough to support the expansion of the infrastructure .
The attempt to expand the infrastructure leads to the diversion of real savings from various activities that make the present flow of real savings possible .
Consequently the flow of real savings comes under pressure and the rate of real economic growth follows suit .
( Remember that real savings fund economic activity — not money . )
Credit or money created out of thin air can't replace the non-existent real savings .
( In our previous example , we saw that without the saved loaves of bread no lending is possible . )
Can the cleansing of banks ' balance sheets lead to an increase in fully backed lending ?
Without the expansion of the pool of real savings , the increase in lending is mission impossible .
The Obama administration is currently introducing plans that are likely to further undermine the flow of real savings and hence hamper banks ' abilities to engage in productive ( fully backed ) lending .
By forcing banks to expand lending while the pool of real savings might be in trouble , policy makers are only encouraging an increase in credit created out of thin air .
Such credit only further dilutes real savings and retards prospects for a meaningful economic recovery .
It is extraordinary that various commentators who are currently blaming the banks for refusing to increase the pace of lending and thus delaying economic recovery , were the first to accuse the banks for causing the present economic crisis by not practicing prudent lending .
Currently banks are happy to lend to quality borrowers — those who are likely to repay the borrowed money .
A stagnant or a falling pool of real savings implies that the economy 's ability to produce real wealth is currently impaired .
Obviously , in this case the percentage of wealth generators and good - quality borrowers is likely to be under pressure .
The issue of the good quality of borrowers cannot be fixed by an artificial cleansing of banks ' balance sheets or by nationalizing the banks .
What is required is the expansion of the pool of real savings .
Monetary pumping and credit created out of thin air cannot fix this .
Since the heart of credit is real savings , it is obvious that no government schemes , such as cleansing banks ' balance sheets , can increase fully backed credit .
These government plans can only redistribute a given pool of real savings .
Instead , wealth generators must be allowed to move forward as soon as possible .
Only wealth generators can lay the foundation for the expansion of the pool of real savings and hence lending .
Wealth generators , however , cannot work efficiently in an environment of government controls , and money and credit created out of thin air .
Billionaire Roland E. Arnall , whose widespread philanthropy and extraordinary political friendships stood in contrast to repeated investigations into alleged lending abuses at his giant subprime company , Ameriquest Mortgage Co. , died Monday .
The longtime Holmby Hills resident was 68 .
Arnall , a Holocaust survivor who co-founded the Simon Wiesenthal Center , had resigned as President Bush ’s ambassador to the Netherlands on March 7 , returning to Los Angeles to be with a seriously ill son , the family said .
The senior Arnall was diagnosed Wednesday with esophageal cancer that had metastasized and died early Monday at UCLA Medical Center , a spokesman for the family said .
Intensely private about his business and charitable affairs , Arnall was personally a gregarious character known for befriending service workers he encountered , along with some of the most powerful politicians in California and the nation .
Earlier donations went mostly to Democrats , including statewide races by Tom Bradley , John Van de Kamp and current state Atty .
Gen. Jerry Brown , to whom Arnall lent $ 25,000 for his 1978 gubernatorial bid .
When Gray Davis ran for governor in 1998 , Arnall advised him that he would need 20 backers good for $ 250,000 each -- and stepped in as the first , according to Davis strategist Garry South , who told The Times in 2005 : “ Roland was responsible for Gray becoming governor . ”
When Arnall married his second wife , Dawn , two years later , Davis officiated at the ceremony .
A few years later , the Arnalls became major backers of President Bush and Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , both Republicans .
Since 2004 , the couple had given more than $ 12 million to GOP causes and candidates , becoming the heaviest donors to the 2004 election cycle , including the Republican National Convention and Bush ’s inaugural celebration , campaign finance records showed .
Arnall said Bush won his support because of his pro-Israel stance .
He maintained that he supported individuals , not parties , and continued to donate to certain Democrats , including many members of the Latino Caucus in the state Legislature .
Even while giving $ 1.4 million to Schwarzenegger and his campaign committees , the Arnalls donated $ 130,000 to Davis , plus $ 100,000 more to oppose Davis ’ recall .
“ He had an upbeat and indefatigable personality -- sort of an Energizer Bunny -- and he infused other people with that same confidence , ” South said Monday .
Arnall ’s December holiday parties were command performances for generations of politicians , South said , recalling one at which former California Govs.
Pete Wilson and Davis joined Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and Pennsylvania Gov. Edward G. Rendell -- along with various Arnall drivers and aides and lesser political luminaries .
Schwarzenegger lauded Arnall ’s work to promote peace and understanding through the Wiesenthal Center .
Attending the museum ’s groundbreaking with Arnall in 2004 “ was one of my most precious memories , ” Schwarzenegger said in a statement .
Born March 29 , 1939 , on the eve of World War II to Eastern European Jews who had fled to Paris , Arnall spent his early childhood in a French village where his family pretended to be Roman Catholics .
He was n’t told he was Jewish until after the war .
His family soon relocated to Canada and then to the United States , where he had his first business selling flowers on the streets of Los Angeles .
Over the years , Arnall amassed huge interests in apartments and other businesses .
But he was chiefly known as a pioneer of lending to high - risk , or subprime , borrowers .
Using databases to identify customers and set loan terms , he partnered with Wall Street firms that provided funding and bundled his loans into mortgage - backed bonds -- the business whose recent meltdown has shaken the global financial system .
His direct - to - consumer lending company , Ameriquest Mortgage , and sister companies including Argent Mortgage Co. , which made loans through independent brokers , had become the nation ’s largest subprime lenders by the middle of this decade .
Ameriquest advertised heavily on television , sent blimps soaring above stadiums bearing the company ’s name and Liberty Bell logo , and sponsored a Super Bowl halftime show and a Rolling Stones tour .
But the company that called itself the “ proud sponsor of the American dream ” was dogged by allegations from government authorities , community groups and angry customers .
Former employees said Ameriquest ran “ boiler rooms ” of loan agents who socked borrowers with hidden fees and higher - than - promised interest rates while steering customers into loans they could n’t afford .
Arnall blamed the problems on rogue agents who were terminated .
After The Times ran a series of articles detailing the allegations in 2005 , Ameriquest disclosed that it was under investigation by a task force of state attorneys general .
Arnall ’s confirmation as ambassador was held up in the Senate until his company agreed to pay $ 325 million to settle with 49 states and the District of Columbia .
Ameriquest Mortgage shut down its lending last year , an early casualty of the subprime meltdown .
Its loan servicing , or bill collection , arm was later sold to Citigroup Inc. , along with the lending systems used by Argent , the affiliate that worked through brokers .
The remains of Arnall ’s lending empire are “ being wound down , ” a spokesman said .
Even Arnall ’s harshest critics acknowledged difficulty in reconciling the complaints with the man they knew as a benefactor of animal shelters , a 16 - year trustee of the California State University system and a diplomat who strove to build bridges to the Islamic community in Europe and the United States .
“ Roland Arnall was a distinguished philanthropist in the Jewish community and general community as a whole , with a commitment to education and supporting those in need in hospitals and those who are disabled in the U.S. and around the world , ” said Rabbi Marvin Hier , dean of the Wiesenthal Center .
“ He played a leadership role in the Simon Wiesenthal Center and Museum of Tolerance since its inception in 1977 and served as co-chair of its board until he resigned to become U.S. ambassador to the Netherlands , ” Hier said .
“ This is a great loss . ”
In addition to his wife and son Daniel , Arnall ’s survivors include a daughter , Michelle ; nephew Adam Bass , former vice chairman of Ameriquest ; and a brother , Claude .
Memorial services were pending .
Instead of flowers , the family requested that well - wishers make contributions to the American Friends of Shalva , a support group in New York for disabled children .

Sorry guys : female sexual cannibalism is far more common than male .
In some species , males provide the single biggest food source for the females of their kind .
While scientists have postulated all kinds of evolutionary reasons for sexual cannibalism , their theories are often confounded by three core conflicts :
it prevents males from further mating
many male mates avoid being eaten if possible
males are usually eaten before they can even mate
So while there might be an adaptive reason for these relationships it is equally likely that the ( usually much larger ) female might just decide that a given male will make a better meal than a mate .
1 ) Scorpions are everywhere – mountains , deserts , tropics , caves and even post - nuclear blast sites .
Nonetheless , scorpions have as many predators as they do habitats , including various mammals , frogs , salamanders , insects spiders and birds .
However , did you know that their own biggest predator is themselves ?
Over half of sand scorpions prey on scorpions and in many species the female consumes its mate , while in rare species the reverse is true .
How the Males Escape ( Sometimes ) :
Many males have been observed to sting the females into stunned submission prior to the mating process as well – presumably in part to limit their chances of beaten eaten alive afterward .
2 ) Spiders are one of the most widely recognized mate - eating animal types in the world , with one kind – the so - called Black Widow – notably named for this habit .
So why do the females consume the males , in some species at a rate of over 80 % ?
Many theories have been advanced to explain this but the most solid explanation seems to be simply a matter of size : in species where the female is significantly bigger the females much more frequently eat the males .
In short , it is n’t about fuel for the pregnancy or an evolutionary adaptation – it is a simple natural slaughter of opportunity .
How the Males Escape ( Sometimes ) :
Some male spiders hold the jaws of their female mates open while mating in order to keep from being eaten alive – others bring a diversionary meal to distract their partner .
3 ) Praying mantises are anything but penitent in the act of mating , infamous for often biting off the heads of their male partners during the act itself ( which , amazingly , only speeds things up ) .
Some males appear to wait for an ideal opportunity to dismount without prompting the female into a cannibalistic rage , though scientists have yet to determine and still debate which is the more adaptive trait for the males : permitting their own consumption in order to complete the process and improve chances of fertilization or making a clean getaway to mate again .
Large mantises have been known to eat lizards , mice and small birds – making a male a small snack .
How the Males Escape ( Sometimes ) :
The best known self - preservation tactic for male mantises is simply waiting until their partner has caught a snack – and to hoping she is n’t still hungry after they finish copulating .

As a mathematician , what programming language should you use when you need to do anything algorithmic ?
For some specific domains there are languages tailored for the task , for example Macaulay2 is great for some types of algebra .
For general problems many turn to Mathematica or Maple .
But although they are universal ( in the sense of Turing ) they 're not great platforms for general purpose algorithms and can perform very poorly unless the feature set of these languages just happens to marry well with the problem you 're trying to solve .
These tools are also like the proverbial sledgehammer - you 're using a giant engine to solve what can sometimes be a simple problem and you 'll pay the price in terms of memory and CPU usage .
If you want a general purpose programming language the answer is simple .
There are eleven reasons why you should use Haskell .
So if you 're a mathematician who occasionally needs to write code , get started on a tutorial right away !
Functions are the bread and butter of mathematics so it makes sense to use a programming language in which functions are first class objects .
It 's not at all unusual for a mathematician to take a function of two arguments , say f(. , . ) , and construct from it a function of a single variable defined by f_x (y ) = f( x , y ) .
Computer scientists call such a thing a closure - it's a function constructed by supplying values for some , but not all , of the arguments of another functions .
It 's one of the most natural operations in the world and yet it 's actually quite horrible to construct such a thing in languages like Fortran , C or C ++.
It 's slightly cleaner in C++ because you can use objects and templates to simulate closures , but the syntax is still pretty hideous .
( I know there are libraries that make this even easier - but they do so by implementing a functional language as a ' domain specific language ' within C++ , essentially making my point for me . )
Here 's how you do this in Haskell : you write " f x " .
The way it works is quite neat .
Given sets A , B and C there is a natural bijection between the set of functions AxB ->C and the set of functions A-> C^B .
So rather than write functions of multiple arguments Haskell function always take one argument and return the function that operates on the rest of the arguments .
At first this might seem like a bad idea because functions of multiple arguments are now , in some sense , a second class object .
But it 's not a problem at all .
To apply the function f to the arguments 1 and 2 we simply write " f 1 2 " .
To get an idea of how horrible it can be to work with functions without functional programming consider the code in Numerical Recipes in C .
Most of their code is ' functional ' in character in the sense that it is intended to perform operations on functions .
But look at how you have to make use of horrible void * pointers to pass in those extra arguments to simulate closures .
As a mathematician you 're more interested in solving the problem than dealing with the idiosyncracies of the hardware and issues like memory management .
Haskell does a great job of insulating you from the underlying hardware so that you do n't have to worry about these things .
Languages like Java are n't too bad at this either .
C++ is terrible , if you decide you do n't want to manage memory yourself you can use shared_ptr <> objects and turn your code into a horribly unreadable mess .
It 's surprising how well Haskell peforms .
You might think " if every time I add a to b it has to construct a temporary intermediate object that represents the function that adds a to a number and then apply that function to b it's going to be slow " .
But that is not the way to look at things .
Haskell does n't simply execute code by working top to bottom , left to right through your source code .
The compiler ( itself written in Haskell ) is pretty sophisticated and frequently performs comparably to C .
It 's generally not as fast as C , but it 's usually in the same league .
The Haskell compiler rips apart your code and reconstitutes it as an executable in ways that are quite surprising .
In Haskell you can often write code using idioms that feel natural , but are generally considered slow in other languges , without performance impact .
One example is in list handling .
Often you want to return a temporary list of objects and perform some operation on them .
In many languages there is an overhead in making such a list , only to take it apart again when you want to operate on the actual elements so you instead have to restructure your code so that no list is constructed .
In Haskell the compiler will often figure out that your list is temporary and do the restructuring behind the scenes for you .
Mathematicians like to spend their time saying what is the case rather than thinking in terms of sequences of operations .
If b = f( a ) and c = f( b ) then it does n't matter if you say c = f( b ) and then b = f( a ) .
Order is irrelevant .
In an imperative language like C it matters to a large extent what order your code is written in because a statement like b = f( a ) is an instruction .
In Haskell you are n't giving a list of instructions so much as stating what is true .
This fits much better with the way that mathematicians work .
Haskell can take care of some of the details of precisely what order the operations are going to be performed in and hide those details from you .
This goes hand - in - hand with Haskell being declarative .
Haskell only computes what it needs to compute in order to get the answer you require .
It tries not to do unnecessary work .
Languages that are n't lazy like this are called ' strict ' languages .
In a strict language , say , if you required the first component of the cross product of a vector , you would typically compute all three components of the vector and throw away the second and third components .
If your code needed to be efficient you 'd probably end up writing special purpose code to compute just the first component of the cross product .
You'd be unable to reuse your cross product code .
Mathematicians do n't want to do this .
They want to say that x is the first component of the cross product because it 's true statement and not worry about what exactly gets implemented when .
This laziness is ubiquitous throughout all of Haskell .
One place that laziness really pays off is in working with lists .
Haskell has absolutely no problem working with infinite lists as long as you do n't actually try to look at all of the elements .
Instead of evaluating all of the elements it simply retains enough information to construct as many elements as are needed .
Computing the elementwise sum , say , of two infinite lists is completely straightforward .
And performing computations with power series , say , where the later elements are functions of the earlier elements , is absolutely straightforward .
You do n't have to check to see if you 've computed enough of the earlier elements to compute the later one .
Haskell does all that for you .
If you want to see the first ten elements of the final infinite list you can just ask for them .
You do n't need to decide in advance how many elements you want and build that into the code from the beginning .
Haskell is good at dealing with datastructures .
Often mathematicians do n't realise that they are using datastructures all the time .
But they are .
For example a group is a set equipped with functions to perform multiplication and inversion as well as a singled out element , the identitiy .
Haskell makes it very easy to work with structures that are tuples of objects like this .
It 's also very easy to build one datastructure out of another and even specify rules about datastructures .
For example a matrix is a two - dimensional array of objects .
But if the objects form a ring then so does the matrix .
This kind of statement is easy to express in Haskell making it well suited to working with algebraic structures .
If you 've defined formal power series over a ring and you 've defined the ring of polynomials over another ring it 's trivial to build the ring of power series over polynomials over the integers , say .
What 's more , the compiler can tell you when the structure you 're trying to create does n't make sense , for example if you were to try to multiply two matrices whose underlying elements can't be multiplied .
A programming language like Mathematica is very poor at this as it does n't really distinguish between datatypes .
You 'll only discover your error when the program is actually running and it tries to multiply the underlying objects .
Haskell also uses type inference .
You do n't have to explicitly tell it the type of something because it can often figure it out for itself .
If you see the number ' 1 ' in a textbook what does it mean ?
Is it an element of N , Z , R , Q , R[ sqrt ( 2 ) ] , C or some other completely different algebraic structure ?
It could be any of these things depending on the context .
The same is true in Haskell , it 'll figure out what you mean by ' 1 ' using completely unambiguous rules .
This means that you do n't have to use a different symbol for ' 1 ' in different contexts , and yet you do n't have to laboriously state what you mean every time you use it .
And rather than having an ad - hoc system of datastructure types Haskell 's is algebraic
Not in the topological sense .
Haskell code tends to be much shorter than its counterpart written in other languages .
There is little extraneous verbiage and the verbiage that does exist is very powerful .
This is more than a space saving exercise .
Consider the history of calculus in n-dimensions .
When Maxwell first wrote down his equations of electrodynamics they took up most of a page .
WIth the introduction of vector notation they were simplified .
By using the notation of exterior calculus they were simplified to dF = 0 , d*F = * J .
This is n't just typographically simpler but conceptually simpler .
You can see immediately how you might generalise to n-dimensions instead of three , you can see trivially that d*J=0 from d^2 = 0 and you can now perform countless computations in a few lines that previously would have taken dozens of pages .
What 's more the new notation makes it harder to accidentally write equations of motion that do n't make physical sense because they automatically obey symmetries that are difficult to see in more complex notation .
Haskell is just like this too .
You can do a lot with a tiny amount of code .
And if two blocks of code appear to do similar things you can often factor out the common part and make it a separate block of code in a way that 's much harder than with just about any other language .
This makes it much easier to generalise your code and have insights about it .
This works well with the way mathematicians like to think about things .
Haskell draws on ideas from interesting branches of mathematics , for example Category Theory and Logic .
And the logic part does n't appear the way you expect - it appears via the Curry - Howard ' isomorphism ' in the type system used to define datastructures .
As mentioned above , Haskell code lends itself well to generalisations .
You 'll find all sorts of commonality between things that previously did n't seem similar , and you 'll find ways to express that similarity in your code .
One of my favourite examples is by Ralph Hinze .
He does n't just illustrate thesimilarity between binomial tree and binary arithmetic , he actually shows how merging binomials and adding binary numbers are actually instances of the very same thing .
Haskell encourages this kind of abstraction .
Though I 've wandered into the realm of computer science with talk of trees this is still the type of abstraction that mathematicians find interesting .
When you add two numbers you get the sum .
You do n't find that something else in the universe has happened as well ( except maybe the temperature in the room goes up if it's a really hard sum ) .
So functions in a programming language should n't have any side effects .
In Haskell afunction does nothing other than return the value of its result .
This means that it 's easy to bring your mathematical experience to bear when analysing programs .
( Almost ) all of the usual rules for manipulating mathematical expressions apply so that , for example , if b = f( a ) and c =g( b , b ) , then c = g( f ( a ) , f( a ) ) .
In many other programming languages you 'd have to make sure that calling f twice did n't have some side effect that made it behave differently to calling it once .
In most imperative languages a line of code like x=f ( x ) means replace the value of x with f applied to the old value of x .
In Haskell it means x equals f( x ) .
It has no problem with you defining a variable in terms of itself and x=f ( x ) means that x is a fixed point of the function f .
In practice it 's not so simple , you can't just write x = 1 - x ^ 2 and expect it to figure out that x is the golden ratio .
Haskell is a programming language not an equation solving package .
But in my formal power series library I 'm able to use a line like " e = 1 + integrate e " to define the power series for exp x .
See here for another example of using circular definitions to solve differentialequations .
What I mean is that Haskell is built on fairly solid mathematical foundations in lambda calculus and proof theory .
It 's not just an ad hoc language that has accreted features over the years .
Everything is there for a reason and people have thought long and hard about the theoretical underpinnings of what went into it .
Well , that 's a matter of taste .
But I find it very elegant .
That 's 11 .
I think there 's a rule against making lists with prime numbers of elements but I 'm ignoring it .
To be fair I ought to point out that it 's not all a bowl of cherries .
Haskell is n't very good at dealing with arrays .
In most programming languages it takes time O ( 1 ) to access the ith element of an n element array .
In Haskell you can get this kind of performace if you do n't mind using the various painful to use array operators available , or you can sacrifice performance , keep the elegance , and get O ( log n ) performance .
On the other hand , you'd be surprised just how many useful matrix algortihms do n't require random access to the ith element .
Because Haskell functions do n't have side effects it does n't make sense to perform an operation more than once because it'll just do the same thing each time .
So there 's no notion of a ' for ' loop ( well , maybe there is ) in Haskell and instead you must find other ways to express iterative operations - ie .
using ' higher order functions ' or recusrion .
But sometimes you feel like you just want to write the loop and be done with it .
There 's always another way of expressing the problem but when the iterative approach is the first thing to pop into your head it can occasionally be frustrating .
And sometimes you 'd like side effects Haskell comes with a library of functions called the ' standard prelude ' .
Unfortunately , whoever designed it knew just enough mathematics to be dangerous and made a complete hash of it .
Instead of using a well known hierarchy of algebraic structures such as group - > ring -> field they defined all kinds of bizarre structures starting with something like a ring with a norm or valuation .
And while the library supports complex numbers it 's not flexible enough to support the Gaussian integers ( probably a consequence of forcing rings to have a norm ) .
All things that could have been implemented correctly in a few seconds if a mathematician had been consulted early on .
And the last caveat .
I found learning Haskell hard .
Let me put it in perspective : I 'm 39 .
I 've been programming since I was 11 .
I 've been writing recursive code since about 15 and I 've been using whatever approximations to functional programming are avalable to me in any language I use for almost that long ( including torturing myself with C++ template metaprogramming ) .
I 've even implemented a couple of declarative languages , Prolog and SASL , the latter being a functional lazy language a lot like Haskell that I thought I 'd investigate before Haskell .
And I still found Haskell tricky to learn .
But it was worth it .
And I believe that the trickiness of the language is the kind of trickiness that mathematicians should be able to handle .
( And it probably helps if you do n't know any C or C++ ... ) A friend of mine , and I , have been writing all kinds of mathematical code and finding Haskell well suited to the task .
Logic ( eg. building analytic tableau as in Smullyan 's book on first order logic ) , Group Theory ( eg. the Schreier - Sims algorithm ) , Calculus ( automatic differentiation ) , Combinatorics ( via formal power series ) , Algebra ( eg. Grobner bases ) and now we 're looking into investigating relationships between elliptic functions and modular forms .
( Hmmm ... my friend takes most of the credit here . )
Haskell is great at all of this stuff even though it 's not in any way an algebra or mathematics package .
And one list thing about Haskell .
If x is an integer ( called an " Integer " in Haskell ) then x+1>x .
It 's nice to work over the integers rather than a cheap and nasty 2 - adic approximation ( though the cheap and nasty approximation is there if you want it . )

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
Two colossal black holes appear to be orbiting one another in sort of a cosmic minuet at the center of a faraway galaxy formed when two separate galaxies collided , U.S. astronomers said on Wednesday .
This artist 's conception shows two supermassive black holes orbiting each other in what is known as a binary system .
Each black hole is surrounded by a disk of material gradually spiraling into its grasp , releasing radiation from X - rays to radio waves .
The two black holes complete an orbit every 100 years .
The findings were published in the journal Nature .

These two so - called supermassive black holes , which are celestial objects with enormous gravitational pull , are locked in orbit about 5 billion light years away from Earth , the scientists said .
A light year is about 6 trillion miles ( 10 trillion km ) , or the distance light travels in a year .
Data from Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico provided the best evidence to date of two black holes orbiting each other , according to astronomer Todd Boroson of the National Optical Astronomy Observatory in Tucson , Arizona .
This is known as a binary system .
Scientists believe all or most galaxies have supermassive black holes at their center .
For example , our Milky Way galaxy has a black hole at its center that is about 3 million times the mass of the sun .
When galaxies collide and merge , as they do relatively often , the black holes at their center may gravitate toward one another because of their great mass , entering into orbit as these two appear to be doing .
Boroson said orbiting black holes eventually may merge into an even larger single black hole .
While scientists think binary black holes may be relatively common , they have been elusive .
Boroson and fellow National Optical Astronomy Observatory astronomer Tod Lauer detected these two by spotting the radiation emitted by objects apparently being sucked into the black holes by their gravitational pull .
“ You do n’t see the black holes .
You only see the effects of the black holes , ” Boroson said in a telephone interview .
The smaller of the black holes is about 20 million times the mass of our sun , while the larger one is a billion times the sun ’s mass , the scientists wrote in the journal Nature .
“ We ’ve discovered that there ’s a pretty good correlation between the size of a black hole and the size of the galaxy that it ’s in .
This could be a case where a big galaxy ate a smaller galaxy , ” Boroson said .
These two black holes take about a hundred years to orbit each other and are located about three - tenths of a light year from each other , Boroson said .
Mr Brown said banks were not lending enough Gordon Brown has said he believes the credit drought will " start to ease " in the next few months as banks increase their lending to businesses .
Mr Brown said recent agreements with RBS and Lloyds Banking Group meant they now had a " duty " to lend more freely .
Ministers were working " night and day " to fix the banking system whose failure was " rather unique " , he told the BBC .
Mr Brown said he took " responsibility " for the state of the economy but said the crisis was global , not domestic .
' Real problem '
The Conservatives have persistently called for the prime minister to apologise for the recession , saying his policy failures while chancellor left the UK more vulnerable than other countries .
In an interview with BBC Radio 4's You and Yours show , Mr Brown said he would not " shy away " from any of the decisions he had made over the last 11 years as chancellor and prime minister .
I take full responsibility for what happens but what I can't say to people is that the cause of the crisis is something that happened within Britain alone
Gordon Brown
Listen to full interview
But he said the financial crisis was global in its origin and had not been caused , as in the past , by governments letting inflation and interest getting out of control at home .
" I take full responsibility for what happens but what I can't say to people is that the cause of the crisis is something that happened within Britain alone , " he said .
" This is something which happened right round the world .
We can't find a solution unless we know we have got to sort out the banking system right across the world . "
Responding to accusations that banks were still not lending despite getting billions in taxpayer support , Mr Brown admitted the amount of credit available was not " enough " .
The lack of credit was a " real , real problem " and was affecting all areas of industry .
Proper job
But he said recent agreements with RBS and Lloyds Banking Group , combined with guaranteed support from Northern Rock , would ensure that more than £ 40bn in additional financing would come on stream for hard - pressed businesses and home - buyers .
" The answer is to get the banks to do the job they should have done , " he said before adding that a lot of lending in the UK had come from foreign banks - including Icelandic ones .

Restoring credit conditions to normal would take time , he added , but Mr Brown said he expected the picture to gradually improve .
" The injection of money into the economy is such and the cuts in interest rates are such and the support given to help people through these difficult times that it will have an effect . "
He added : " I think you 'll find the situation for the businesses you are dealing with will start to ease over the next few months as more money becomes available for lending by the banks . "
He also pledged help for savers hit by the collapse in interest rates with information for people wanting to shop around and find the best rates on the market .
This followed figures from the Bank of England showing that the average interest rate for savers who want instant access to their money is now barely above zero .

Originally I generated the sitemap for onsmalltalk as a file on disk and let Apache serve it up .
There 's nothing wrong with this approach but it'd be cooler if I had Seaside generate and render it on demand and serve as a good excuse to talk about serving up content statelessly in Seaside .
Seaside is a session based web framework , but there 's nothing really session specific about a sitemap and I really do n't want a new session created when a request for a sitemap is made .
There 's a lot of overhead in doing that and sometimes you just want to serve up stuff statelessly .
When a request comes in , the application mounted on the base URL handles the request by plucking the session id out of the cookie or the URL and either creates a new session or finds the existing one needed to handle the current request .
Once found , the request is pumped through the current session which runs through a similar procedure looking for a continuation to invoke .
Since I want to avoid all that and just handle the request at the application level I 'll override #handleRequest : in my custom WAApplication subclass , check the URL of the current request and either render the sitemap and end the request by immediately returning a response , or allow processing to continue normally into the session lookup done by the call to super .
handleRequest : aRequest ( aRequest url endsWith : '/ sitemap.xml ' ) ifTrue : [ ^WAResponse new beXML ; cacheFor : 1 hour ; contents : ( self siteMapFrom : aRequest ) asString readStream ; yourself ] ^super handleRequest : aRequest siteMapFrom : aRequest ^ ( SBSiteMapGenerator blogRoot : ( ' http://{1} / ' format : { ( aRequest host ) } ) ) generateFromItems : { ( SBPost new ) } , ( SBBlog onSmalltalk publicPosts ) , SBTag findAll .
If you have things in your application that can be done statelessly , this is a good place to hook into the framework and take care of that stuff at the application level .
Sometimes you do n't need all that fancy Seaside stuff and you just want to work directly with HTTP requests and responses .
Two small methods and the sitemap is now generated dynamically , and statelessly directly from Seaside , removing the need to manually invoke the sitemap generation as I had previously been doing to the file system .
Oh , one small extension that I 've put on WAResponse and use occasionally ...
Over the past few years we ’ve noticed a few stories appearing on the internet relating to the introduction of a fashion modification which firstly blows my mind ( pun intended ) , and secondly reinforces the hunch that some inventors have exhausted their supply of fresh ideas .
The trend I ’m referring to is Air Conditioned Clothing and on a whim I decided to find out whether someone could , if patient and sweaty enough , put together an entire air conditioned outfit based on products readily available via the internet .
Below are the results , starting at the head .
The Hat
The Solar - Powered Cooling Pith Helmet is an unsightly stroke of genius which promises to provide an energy efficient supply of cool air to the front of the head by way of a small fan .
On top of the hat are small ( but large enough to be seen from afar ) solar panels which power said fan , however should the sun not be in view the power supply can be switched to a couple of headbound batteries .
In all honesty , this is a good idea .
Aesthetically though , not so much .
The Tie
Of all the air conditioned items of clothing on the list , this one is a definite favourite .
Inside the knot of the tie produced by Thanko sits a small fan unit , ready to pump cool air towards the collar area by way of power sourced via the USB port of your computer .
No batteries needed .
If that ’s not enough to sell the idea , just take a look at the chap ’s face in the top right hand corner of the picture .
Cool air plus a vibrating laryngeal prominence makes Jack a happy boy .
The Shirt
A Japanese company by the name of Kuchou - fuku ( trans : air conditioned clothes ) have the torso covered with this air conditioned shirt ; a garment which manages to give the human wearing it the appearance of a skydiver mid-drop thanks to its interior cooling system .
Two fans blow air around the shirt via a rechargeable battery pack .
The Trousers
For the lower body , these cargo pants will have to do .
From the photo above it looks as though they ’ve replaced the lower pockets with fans , resulting in an ideal pair of trousers for those who work in sweaty environments .
I ’ve no idea who ’s responsible for these but they look similar enough in style to Kuchou - fuku ’s shirt for me to point my finger at the same company .
Again , they look horrific so to wear them unless absolutely essential would be dangerous .
The Shoes
Ever wished your shoes contained an air conditioning system ?
I know I have so I ’m happy as Larry now that I ’ve discovered the Breezewalk shoe : a piece of footwear which supposedly keeps the foot cool and fresh by way of an air pump in the heel .
As you walk , the pump pushes air around the shoe .
Not exactly hi-tech and possibly more gimmick than anything else , but 10 out of 10 for effort .
What I ’d prefer is the ability to pump hot air around my toes when it ’s cold .
When that ’s available , give me a call .
Dear Chancellor : Inflationary Facts

Dear Chancellor ,
The Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) just published data showing that Consumer Price inflation in the United Kingdom rose to 3.2 % in February from a year earlier .
Not only was that rate of inflation far ahead of analyst forecasts .
Nor did it merely rip up a dozen newspaper front - pages , all trying to explain " deflation " to a nation paying nothing but rising prices since 1960 .
And nor could the latest data fail to conceal the sharpest month - on - month jump of the last 19 years .
( It was only just shy , in fact , of the worst monthly jump since the wipe - out inflation of spring 1980 . )
No , the CPI inflation figure also rose more than one whole percentage point above our 2.0 % target , as mandated by you .
And that requires me to explain , in this open letter , why the cost of living is rising so quickly , rather than tumbling as everyone guessed .
" Oh bugger , " as I believe Gordon of Khartoum said when the Mahdi army broke through .
The reason for this letter
Yes , so it 's the fourth such letter of the last 10 months .
But it 's still only the fourth such letter since the Bank was given independence to set interest rates almost 12 years ago .
Only four letters after 142 inflation headlines since May 1997 ...?
That 's a far better goal difference than we should have expected .
Not least because , since I became Governor , the UK money supply has swelled at an average 11.3 % rate per annum .
Just last month , indeed , growth in the broad money supply hit almost 19 % year - on - year – the fastest rate of expansion since the late 1970s .
And " Few empirical regularities in economics are so well documented as the co-movement of money and inflation , " as I used to enjoy pointing out .
Across the final three decades of the last century , in fact , the rate of growth in the money supply and the rate of price - inflation were virtually identical – not only here in the UK ( on the Bank 's own analysis ) , but across 116 countries in a detailed study of 1995 .
Inflating the money supply only stopped inflating the cost of inflating in the first part of this decade – a period I previously said was all very N.I.C.E. ( non-inflationary , constant expansion ) but unlikely to last .
Most especially with me running the Bank 's policy team !
Even so , anyone at the Treasury hoping for a mea culpa today will have to accept this nostrum culpum instead I 'm afraid .
Why has inflation moved away from the target ?
In reviewing the current data , Chancellor ...oh who are we kidding ?
You and I both know why deflation has failed to appear and why I 'm having to write this letter once more .
Cutting Bank Rate below its 300 - year floor of 2.0 % ;
Creating £ 10 billion out of thin air to buy up long - dated government bonds , with a further £ 140 bn now at the printers ;
Announcing £ 148bn of new gilts to be issued this year to cover your own spending deficit .
Inflate money , devalue debt in short .
And with such a very great deal of debt to devalue , that rare empirical regularity of economics would dictate a very great deal of monetary inflation .
It 's happening much faster and far more dramatically than I had expected , however .
Indeed , the inflation in prices is coming even as money - supply growth for private households has sunk to a four - decade low .
That 's quite the reverse of what I claimed would happen when this recession began , because I 'd missed the plain fact that people spend – and do n't save – when interest rates sink .
Debtors merely pay down their debts , and savers flee cash because they 're much wiser than our policy models accept .
Just recently , for instance , £ 2.3 billion was withdrawn – net , inside one month – from household bank accounts .
We can't account for all of it , but very nearly one pound in every £ 100 went to Buy Gold at BullionVault .
Returning to Target in the Medium Term
Howsoever it 's working , the " pass through " from our forced devaluation of Sterling – the devaluation we 've so clearly wrought between us , now running to 28 % on the foreign exchanges , and greater still against Gold Prices than both the IMF crisis of 1976 and the post - Gold Standard drop of the Great Depression – cannot be ignored for much longer .
Not with the Easter break looming , but air fares up 12 % from April last year .
Not with everyone planning their summer holidays , but finding package deals nearly 7 % dearer .
And most certainly not with the cost of food here at home more expensive by one - eighth in the last 12 months alone .
What to do ?
Frankly , I 'm stumped – which is why I should most likely consider resigning today .
The alternative , here in this letter , would be to lambast you and your administration for nurturing the very inflation that 's now exploded , forcing you to take such desperate remedies as issuing public debt worth 11 % of GDP over the next year , while forcing us here at the Bank to start monetizing that debt quantitative easing .
A buyers ' strike at forthcoming gilt auctions cannot be far off , however , and now that everyone involved in this mess fears the public roasting ( if not physical violence ) threatened against our senior commercial bank chiefs , I shall opt instead to snipe and snip at your policies during this week 's Parliamentary Committee hearing .
Sincerely ,
Governor &c .
P.S : Hoping that at somehow , at some point , a withdrawal of this extraordinary stimulus will be both achievable and politically tenable is , quite frankly , absurd .
You know it , I know it , and clearly the know - it - all continentals at the European Central Bank have guessed it as well .
We must n't expect the G20 summit to achieve anything like a consensus for any policies we propose .
I suggest the PR team get to work selling that failure immediately .

Last week , Attorney General Eric Holder said the federal government would stop prosecuting medical marijuana distributors who comply with state law .
Drug policy reformers immediately wondered how the change would affect Charlie Lynch , who last year was convicted of five felonies for helping California patients alleviate their suffering with marijuana .
Evidently the judge charged with sentencing Lynch is wondering the same thing .
On Monday , when Lynch was scheduled to be sentenced , U.S. District Judge George
Wu said he needed more time to consider the meaning of the Justice Department 's new policy .
Now that the Obama administration has promised to respect state medical marijuana laws and leave people like Lynch alone , the injustice of sending him to prison is even more glaring .
Since mid-2006 , the Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) has raided at least 80 medical marijuana dispensaries in California .
During his campaign , Barack Obama repeatedly said he would end the raids , and last week , his attorney general gave the clearest sign yet that the president intends to keep that promise .
" The policy is to go after those people who violate both federal and state law , " Holder said .
Lynch , who is now scheduled to be sentenced on April 30 , does not seem to be one of those people .
He openly ran a medical marijuana dispensary in Morro Bay for a year , with the sanction of state law and the support of local officials , before the DEA closed it down .
Last August he was convicted of five distribution and conspiracy charges that carry combined penalties of five to 85 years in prison .
After the verdict , the jury forewoman said , " we all felt Mr. Lynch intended well , " but " under the parameters we were given for the federal law , we did n't have a choice . "
In letters to Judge Wu , two other jurors have described the case as a miscarriage of justice , saying they felt constrained to convict Lynch because they were told state law was irrelevant .
Lynch 's story -- including his cooperation with local officials , his inability to discuss the medical use of marijuana at his trial , and the regretful jurors -- is reminiscent of the case against Ed Rosenthal , who grew marijuana for patients under an arrangement with the city of Oakland .
Rosenthal was convicted on federal drug charges in 2003 and again in 2007 , after an appeals court overturned the first verdict because of juror misconduct .
Like Wu , U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer , who presided over Rosenthal 's case , refused to allow any explanation of the defendant 's motivation , since federal law recognizes no legitimate use for marijuana .
And like Lynch , Rosenthal faced a mandatory minimum sentence of five years .
But in a surprising turn , Breyer sentenced Rosenthal to one day , which he had already served .
Breyer 's leniency was based on his conclusion that Rosenthal had honestly and reasonably believed he was acting within the law .
Thus Breyer essentially took into account at sentencing the defense he had not allowed during the trial .
Breyer 's legal rationale was a " safety valve " provision that allows departures from the five - year mandatory minimum sentence for growing or distributing more than 100 kilograms of marijuana .
This provision applies to cooperative defendants with minimal or no criminal histories who do not possess a firearm , threaten or commit violence , cause death or serious injury , or play a " leadership role . "
Since Lynch had employees at his dispensary and was convicted of conspiracy , meeting that last criterion might be tricky , but otherwise he seems to qualify .
In Rosenthal 's case , the federal appeals court implicitly approved the one - day sentence in a footnote to its decision ordering a retrial .
Unlike Rosenthal , who faced a vindictive Justice Department that unsuccessfully challenged his sentence and then tried to pile on new charges in his second trial , Lynch faces a Justice Department that ostensibly understands the merits of federalism in this area .
Assuming Obama is serious about letting states set their own medical marijuana policies , there will be no one to second - guess
Wu if he finds a way to keep Lynch out of prison .
The body of Wang Diange , from the Chinese province of Inner Mongolia , was found in the wreckage of a house where he had been overseeing the wake of a previous family funeral , after mourners felt a loud explosion which took off half the roof .
Another Benz , another BRABUS , another Benz , another BRABUS .
And so forth , and so on …
But somehow , some way , it never gets old .
BRABUS always brings their A - game and their new tuning package for the Mercedes - Benz E550 is rock solid .
In this case , they beat AMG to the punch for the E - Series and have boosted the 6.1 - liter V8 engine from 382 hp up to 462 hp .
The run from 0 to 62 mph takes only 4.7 seconds with a top speed of 191 mph .
BRABUS has also devised a complete aerodynamics package for the Mercedes E550 .
The front bumper has been replaced by a new one that provides reduced lift along with LED daytime running lights and fog lamps .
In addition , new rocker panels and carbon fiber air inlets give the profile a much sportier look .
In back , a rear apron with a centrally located rear deflector houses two chrome plated exhaust pipes on each side .
BRABUS is offering Monoblock wheels in various sizes starting at 17 inches .
The ultimate option provides 20x9s in front and 20 × 10.5s in rear with matching 245/30 ZR20 and 285/24 ZR20 tires .
Brakes come in the form of monster 14.8 inch vented and cross-drilled discs on the front axel with 12 - piston aluminum calipers and 14.0 inch discs with six - piston calipers on the rear axel .

The canton is keen to stamp out nude hiking before the summer
A local Swiss government plans to take action against a sudden and apparently unwelcome phenomenon - naked hikers .
Authorities in the canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden plan to introduce fines for anyone found walking in the picturesque mountain region without any clothes .
They decided to act before this year 's hiking season began , after noticing a sudden influx of nudists last year - many of them from Germany .
" FKK " , or " free body culture " , is a popular pastime in Germany .
But Appenzell Innerrhoden is not keen to encourage its spread .
" We were forced to introduce the legislation against this indecent practice before the warm weather starts , " said Melchior Looser , justice minister in the canton in north - eastern Switzerland .
" The point is many children visit our mountains in the summer , " he told he Guardian newspaper .
A naked hiker was detained last autumn , but could not be fined as naked rambling was not outlawed , he said - hence the need for a new law .
Just out of curiosity , do you take notes when you listen to your pastor ’s sermon ?
Why , or why not ?
If you do take notes , how do you use them ?
I ’m a note taker .
I take notes primarily to help me stay focused on the sermon .
I wish I could say that taking notes aids retention , but I can ’t .
Nothing I do seems to helps me retain what I hear .
I also never refer back to my notes for personal use .
I do sometimes use them in family worship .

Americans use a gun in self defense once every 13 seconds :
The National Self Defense Survey , as conducted by Florida State University criminologists in 1994 , indicates that Americans use guns in self defense 2,500,000 times per year , which is once every 13 seconds .
In about 30 % of the defensive gun uses , the would - be victim believes that the gun “ almost certainly ” or “ probably ” saved a life .
In more than 1 / 2 of the self defense gun uses , the would - be victim was under attack by 2 or more criminals , making a firearm the only viable means of self defense for most people .
The overwhelming majority of these defensive gun uses were never reported by the news media .
Gun ownership protects 65 lives for every 2 lives lost .
For those who wish to read the peer reviewed and published studies substantiating these facts , see :
“ Armed Resistance to Crime : The Prevalence and Nature of Self - Defense with a Gun , ” Gary Kleck and Marc Gertz , in The Journal of Criminal Law & Criminology , Northwestern University School of Law , Volume 86 , Number 1 , Fall , 1995
“ Guns in the Medical Literature – A Failure of Peer Review . ” Dr. Suter , Journal of the Medical Association of Georgia .
March 1994 .
An interview with the author of this study , Dr. Gary Kleck , can be seen here .
NOTE from the LearnAboutGuns.com Author : I write about a tiny percentage of the real - life armed self defense cases that occur each year .

“ It is possible to establish a series of activities that all serve to humiliate a sub .
As we have shown , everything in this genre is done with the intention of showing the inequality of the relationship while often going against the commonly acceptable ideals of society .
A Dom can implement rituals or behaviors into the daily activity of a sub to further impress these points .
The method which a Dom and sub walk in public can be altered to fit this end .
In most relationships , people walk side - by - side when going down the street or through a store .
This can be amended so that your sub walks behind you .
This is more like the Eastern tradition where servants walked behind their rulers .
Again , it shows the inequality of the relationship .
I like to have a sub serve my every whim .
In addition to preparing the meals , a sub can be instructed to refill your drink , get your shoes , or change the television channel .
Being dictated
at is not something that our culture promotes .
We are taught self reliance and to take care of ourselves .
Having a sub do the most menial of tasks which are easily handled can be humiliating .
I found the more absurd the activity , the more the impact was .
You can also take this to another level by having him or her worship certain body parts .
It is not uncommon to have a sub kiss your feet in an effort to show his / her appreciation and obedience .
The licking of the anus is another activity which shows a sub ’s position .
Many times , the sub will take a subservient posture when receiving the order and following through .
Anytime one is physically lower than another , the concept is enhanced . ”

Dear Rush , Your mission is simple : Restore the Republican Party to its former greatness .
A letter to Rush Limbaugh
Dear Rush ,
Congratulations !
You have been selected by the Obama administration , the mainstream media and 20 million of your most passionate followers to be the new head of the Republican Party .
Advertisement
As such , you are given all the rights and responsibilities that come with being a true political leader .
Your mission is simple : Restore the Republican Party to its former greatness by single - handedly helping Republicans to regain control of Congress and to offer a reasonable and viable alternative to President Barack Obama .
You should be honored that the Obama administration has selected you , El Rushbo , to lead the Republicans in such a quest .
Obviously , they find you to be a formidable foe — politically adept and a proven vote - getter .
Since we are a party of metrics and accountability , we would like to see your plans to make Republicans more competitive .
While your supporters are passionate and energized , we would like to see how you are going to expand your base of support .
While 20 million listeners is an impressive number , Obama had nearly 70 million voters .
Fifty million is a pretty big gap to make up , but we are certain that , with your effervescent personality , you will be able to close that in no time .
We would also like to see your plan to help Republicans compete in the Northeast , the Upper Midwest , the West Coast and Florida , in the big cities and in the suburbs .
Republicans have been pretty much wiped out in all of those areas in the past two elections .
We would like to see your plan to attract more women ’s votes .
While we always get creamed by single women in elections , even married women turned against us this time .
Not sure if calling female leaders “ feminazis ” really works in this atmosphere , but we are willing to hear you out on that .
We got killed by America ’s fastest - growing voting population , Hispanics , in the last election .
What is your plan to attract these voters ?
I know that you despise any kind of nuanced position on immigration reform , but we would love to see any of your ideas for getting some of these voters in the next election .
We got completely demolished by the African - American vote in the last election .
No surprise there , given the top of the ticket .
But we are wondering how referencing our president ’s race in any way , shape or form is productive or relevant to the current discussion .
Please let us know .
Another problem area is independent voters , who went with Obama big time in the last election .
Not sure why .
Maybe they liked his saying he would govern from the center .
Now , we all know that was just rhetoric , but will we really attract independent voters if we decide to move further to the right ?
Just asking .
There are plenty of ways to point out deficiencies in the opposition ’s plans .
And believe us , we know there are many dumb ideas that are coming from the other side .
But our research shows that the American people actually want help with certain things ( the failing education system , the high cost of health care , the sagging economy , etc. ) .
Do you have any good ideas that you can share with us — ideas that will be seen as reasonable by the American people — that can serve as a viable alternative ?
Or is it your plan to simply oppose every idea that comes from the Obama administration ?
Anyway , congratulations on this big promotion .
We are proud of you , and , of course , we are all “ ditto - heads . ”
Please get us your plans as soon as possible , because we have a lot of work to do .
Sincerely ,
The Republican Party

Essentially a .338 - caliber rifle mounted to the bottom of a Vigilante unmanned helicopter ( though it could eventually be made to work on a Predator drone , for instance ) , this bad boy utilizes a modified Xbox 360 game controller for targeting while the vehicle itself stays put courtesy of its autopilot functions .
Never again will your favorite sniper need to leave the comfort of his barracks !

For one thing , the sides are open and you can see through it .
Then there are the trees growing from floors that extend plank - like beyond the walls .
Welcome to Pig City – not to be confused with Hogtown – one of several dozen proposals brought together in an exhibition titled Carrot City : Designing for Urban Agriculture .
On display at the Design Exchange ( 234 Bay St. ) , the show , which opens tomorrow , offers proof positive that in a place like Toronto , anything grows .
Or at least could .
As the preponderance of theoretical projects makes clear , we have n't progressed much beyond the talking stage .
There are some real - life exceptions , however , several of them right here in Toronto .
Take Wychwood Barns , for example .
Opened just months ago , these rebuilt streetcar repair sheds have found new life as an arts centre , food outlet and vegetable garden .
The complex , already acclaimed for its brilliance and innovation , sets a new standard for green and adaptive reuse .
Then there 's Evergreen 's Brick Works , an environmental and gardening showcase now being carved out of the old Don Valley industrial site .
This visionary scheme has the potential to become a focus of eco-design and indigenous plant species .
Other proposals are as simple as temporary gardens of earth - filled bags .
Also included are various updates of the Victory Garden , which many Canadians planted in their backyard during the food shortages of World War II , as well as the oft - noted Royal York hotel 's rooftop herb garden .
Even Pig City , as post - apocalyptic as it looks , makes sense .
Proposed by the Dutch architectural firm MVRDV , the argument is that it 's more efficient to raise swine in highrise farms than on the ground , where they take up a lot of room .
According to MVRDV , if pigs in Holland were raised organically – i.e. fed 100 per cent grain – three - quarters of the country would have to be set aside to meet their needs .
By giving these pigs wings and stacking them in the sties in the skies , the land below remains free and transportation and distribution costs can be cut .
Each tower could feed 500,000 people annually .
The pigs would also get to enjoy well - ventilated spaces with great views .
God knows how the NIMBYs would respond but this might be one case where swinish behaviour was both the cause and result of their unhappiness .
" Urban farming is in its early stages , " says Joe Nasr , who with fellow Ryerson profs Mark Gorgolewski and June Komisar organized the show .
" But it 's moving fast , " says Nasr .
" The scene in Toronto is quite well organized .
There 's a lot of networking around this .
Although the idea has been around for centuries , this is a new movement . "
In fact , what we 're really talking about is a society emerging from a 50 - or 60 - year period during which cities were laid upon the altar of the automobile and sacrificed to the gods of convenience .
Turns out that was n't such a great idea after all .
Which is why concepts such as Pig City suddenly make sense .
It 's either that or no pork .
In fact , the future of urban farming will include radical measures such as the porcine towers , but most will likely comprise countless small operations – but for the plants being grown , grow - ops .
As Nasr also makes clear , many of the current obstacles are man-made .
For instance , at some point in its past Toronto banned chickens from the city .
New York did n't .
" There 's no rationality , " Nasr says .
" Most of it is historical accident . "
Carrot City continues until April 30 .

Redoubt the morning on April 4 .
Friday , April 4 , 2008
The Alaska Volcano Observatory ( AVO ) reported today a " significant explosive event " had occurred at Mount Redoubt in Alaska .
Lightning was observed within an ash cloud that formed over the volcano .
As a result the AVO raised the alert level to ' warning ' and level ' red ' for aviation .
The event occurred at 6:00 a.m. ( AKDT ) .
According to the Observatory , seismic activity caused a major lahar , similar to a mudslide or landslide , to occur in the Drift River Valley .
Inhabitants of the Valley were advised to seek high ground and take immediate precautions against flooding .
So far there are no reports of injuries or evacuations .
Wikinews has e-mailed the AVO for a statement regarding the event , but has yet to receive a reply .
" Strong , but diminishing seismic activity is continuing as of 07:35 AKDT , " said the AVO on its website .
At 9:18 a.m. , the AVO reported that the event had ended .
" Continuing seismic activity and web camera images indicate that low level emissions of steam , gas , and some volcanic ash are continuing to be emitted at the volcano at altitudes of [ 20,000 feet ] . "
The AVO is sending a team to investigate the latest eruption which will include a fly - over to take readings on the gases being emitted .
The explosion sent volcanic ash which spread to " Homer , Anchor Point , and Seldovia " to an altitude of over 50,000 feet .
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) has issued an advisory stating that ash fall can be expected from " Ninilchik Southward through mid morning . "
The advisory is scheduled to end at 10:00 a.m. ( AKDT ) .
As a result of recent eruptions at Redoubt , half of the 6 million gallons of crude oil stored in the Drift Valley will be removed to a safer location .
There is no word on when the move will take place .
The storage facility is located just 22 miles from Redoubt .

Nxd3 25.cxd3 Bxc3 26.bxc3 Qxc3 , however his knight is hanging , if we remove the pawn on e4 and the rook on f5 then White would deliver mate in two with Qxh7 + and the black queen and the rook on e7 look suggest the possibility of a fork with the knight ( Nd5 ) or with the pawn on e4 ( e5 - exd6 ) .

: Material is even , but white clearly has a strong initiative , with pressure on the lightly defended castled black king position , particularly h7 .
Black is attempting to neutralize that pressure by exchanging off white 's minor pieces .
But does white need his minors to execute a powerful attack ?
Immediately I like the move e5 , for four reasons : ( 1 ) It is forcing because it attacks the Nb4 ; ( 2 ) it opens the b1 - h7 diagonal ; ( 3 ) it opens e4 for the knight and ( 4 ) the pawn could join the attack .
So , 24.e5 with the following defenses to consider :
A. 24 ... Nxd3 25 .Nd5 Qd7 26 .Nxe7 + ( 26.Nf6 + gxf6 27.exf6 Ne5 seems to hold ) Rxe7 27.exd6 Qxd6 28.cxd3 ( not Rd5 Nf2 + ) and white 's exchange should prevail .
B. 24 .... Rxe5 25 . Qxb4 is a safe extra piece .
C. 24 .... dxe5 25 . Qxb4 e4 26.Bc4 e3 27 .Rxf7 Rxf7 28 . Rxf7 Qxf7 29 .
Bxf7 + Kxf7 30 . Qxb7 + Re7 31 . Qd5 + Kf8 32.Ne2 Rf7 33.Kg1 Rf2 34 .Qf4 wins the a -pawn and keeps black 's e-pawn reined in , so the queen for the rook wins easily .
D. 24 .... Bxc3 25.exd6 !
Qxd6 26.Rd5 ! Qh6 ( else 27. Qxh7 + ) 27 . Qxe7 ! Qe6 28 . Qxe6 fxe6 29 .Rd7 Bxb2 30 .
Rxb7 Bc3 31.Ra7 Nxd3 32.cxd3 Bxa5 33 .
Rxa6 and white 's extra exchange whould win here too .
D.1 26 .... Nxd3 27 . Rxd6 wins the queen and another piece .
E. 24 .... g6 25.Ne4 ( The threat of Nf6 + is decisive ) h5 26.Nf6 + Kf8 ( Kg7 27 .
Nxe8 + Rxe8 28.Rxf7 + ) 27 .Rxh5 gxh5 28 . Qxh5 Re6 29 . Qa8 + and mate next .
There may be sharper options in here , but it 's time to check it out .

agb2002 : The puzzle position reminded me of Fischer vs Benko , 1963 .
That made my task much easier with the exception of the move Rf6 ( line B.3 , the influence of that game ! ) which I had to reconsider .
Apr-10-09 Mulyahnto : 24 . e5 Nxd3 pretty much forces :
25 . Nd5 Qd8 26 .
Nxe7 + Qxe7 27 . Qxe7 Rxe7 28 . exd6 d7 29 . cxd3 f6 .
And white is up by a pawn and the exchange .

e5 Bxc3 25 . exd6 and black may continue :
25 . ... Be1 !? 26 . Qd4 Nc6 27 . Qf4 Bd2 28 . Qg3 Be1 29 . Qf3 Qxd6 30 . Rxf7 g6 31 .
Bc4 Kh8 ( pretty much all forced by black ) and white has a devastating attack

e5 g6 is cleverly answered with :
25 . Ne4 ! gxf5 ? 26 . Nf6 + Kf8 27 .
Nxh7 + Kg7 28 .

White forces mate !

neilmcmurdo :
The best play lines after 24 ... nxd3 are complex .
However , OTB whilst considering white 's 24th move , I think it 's enough to show that winning the exchange is good enough to secure a decent advantage for white .
That there are stronger continuations after move 26 ( e.g. knight sacs on f6 ) is a bonus , and one the attacking player might be able to spot once you get to that point .
Apr -10 -09 The ChessGuy : Pushing a pawn in the center initiates a kingside attack !
Always play over the entire board , it gives you so many variations to work with .
Apr-10-09 penguin496 : It seems to me that in the last two puzzles the first move was clear from pure positional considerations .
Here moving the pawn to open the line for the bishop and yesterday sacrificing the exchange so the bishop can take the pawn on f7 .
Apr -10 -09 YouRang : Happily ( considering how poorly I 've been doing lately ) , I noticed the tactical benefits of 24.e5 pretty quickly : [ 1 ] threatens QxNb4 , [ 2 ] opens diagonal for LSB to support Qh7+ & Qh8 # , [ 3 ] threatens exd6 .
Black can save their N and take our LSB with 24 ... NxBd3 , but then comes Nd5 forking Q+R , followed by NxRe7 + and cxNd3 .
Or , black can guard their N and take ours with 24 ... Bxc3 , but then we exploit the LSB mate with 25.exd6 Qxd6 26 .
Rd5 ( guards our LSB with double - threat : RxQ and Qxh7 + ) .
I expected 26 ... Qh6 with 27 . Qxd7 Qe6 ( 27 ... Rxd7 ? 28.Rd8 + ~ # ) , and after trade - offs , white wins the exchange .

gawain : Good puzzle .
I had some of the pieces of the solution but did not put them together .
I saw the mating threat via an eventual Qxh7 once the Bishop gained control of the diagonal .
It did not look to me as if W had time to exploit this as TWO pieces had to move to clear the diagonal .
But I saw that White could in some variations get a free move for his rook to attack the Black Queen by dis-covering the Bishop 's attack on h7 .
But I did not think e5 was forcing enough .
I did not see that moving the pawn discovers an attack by the White Queen on the b4 knight .
I considered starting with 24 e5 but did not think it through -- and I assumed that Black would simply take the c3 bishop with his knight .
I had earlier seen ( but then forgot ) that if the Black N vacates b4 then Nd5 will fork the black Q and R I like it that White wins without ever having to carry out the qxhh7 threat !
Apr-10-09
Sneaky : < PinnedPiece : 24 . e5 Nxd3 leaves 25 . Nd5 for white .>
I think that is what this puzzle is REALLY about .
Some people say " 24.e5 is obvious " , and of course it is , because it makes that bishop come alive .
In a bullet game I would play 24.e5 without thought .
But when you have time to contemplate , you look at it and think " Black can just chop wood NxB so where 's the teeth to e5 ? "
The teeth are in that Nd5 !
intermezzo , which gets really slippery to calculate ( at least for me ) because there are so many pieces on the pot .
Once you can safely rule out NxB is a plausible reply to 24.e5 !
it quickly becomes clear that it's a crusher .

I really wanted to sac my queen , so much so that I never noticed I was attacking the knight at b4 .
And I never considered 24 ...♗xc3 or ♘xd3 .
Apr -10 -09 newzild : I missed it today , but I did think of a good pun if this was GOTD : " Oral sucks ! "
Apr-10-09 SpoiltVictorianChild :
Saw the first move , and had the general idea , though I 'm sure I would n't have played this well OTB .
Apr -10 -09 TheBish : Nisipeanu vs Oral , 2004
White to play ( 24 . ? ) " Difficult " ( 3 stars )
Material is even .
Positional considerations :
White has a possible knight fork on d5 if Black 's knight moves ( Nxd3 ) , and latent threats on h7 that will manifest if both the e5 pawn and f5 rook are cleared .
In addition , both Black 's knight and bishop are undefended , which often are conditions present in tactical solutions .
Candidate moves : Nd5 , e5 .
24 . Nd5 Nxd5 25 .
exd5 succeeds in opening the diagonal leading to h7 for White 's bishop , but it also opens the e-file for Black 's doubled rooks , and after 25 ...h6 or 25 ... g6 , there is no follow - up and Black stands well , at least equal .
24 . e5 ! simultaneously attacks the knight on b4 , as well as partially clearing the d3 - h7 diagonal for the bishop .
White threatens both 25 .
Qxb4 as well as 25 .
exd6 Qxd6 26 .
Rf6 ! gxf6 27 . Qxh7 + Kf8 28 . Qf8 mate .
Now : A ) 24 ... Qxa5 ? 25 . e6 ! ( even stronger than 25 . exd6 Re5 ) wins with dual threats on the queen and pawn fork ( exf7 + ) .
B ) 24 ... Nxd3 25 .
Nd5 wins at least the exchange , but actually much more .
After 25 ... Qd7 ( or Qd8 ) 26 .
Nf6 +!
gxf6 ( forced , since 26 ... Kf8 27 . Nxh7 + Kg8 28 . Nf6 + forces it anyway ) 27 . exf6 threatens 28 . Qg4 + and a quick mate .
After 27 ... Kh8 28 . Rh5 h6 29 .
Rxh6 + Bxh6 30 .
Qxh6 + Kg8 31 . Qg7 mate , or 27 ... Kf8 28 . Qg4 Rc8 29 . Qg7 + Ke8 30 . Qg8 mate .
Any other move by Black 's queen ( after 25 . Nd5 ) allows 26 .
Nxe7 + Rxe7 ( or 26 ... Kf8 27 .
Rxf7 # or 26 ... Kh8 27 . Qxh7 +! Kxh7 28 . Rh5 # or win of Black 's queen if 25 ... Qc5 or 25 ... Qc4 ) 27 . Qxe7 and a quick crush .
C ) 24 ... Bxc3 ( removing the pesky knight , but leaving the pesky bishop ! ) allows 25 .
exd6 and now Black faces a dilemma : C1 ) 25 ... Qxd6 26 . Rf6 ! wins the queen , since mate in two starting with Qxh7 + is threatened .
C2 ) 25 ... Qd7 26 . dxe7 Nxd3 ( or 26 ... Bxb2 27 . Qxh7 +!!
Kxh7 28 .
Rh5 + Kg8 29 .
Bh7 + Kh8 30 .
Bg6 + Kg8 31 . Bxf7 mate , or 26 ... Bd2 27 . Rxf7 with dual threats of Rf8 + and Qxh7 # , or 26 ... Bf6 27 . Rxf6 Nxd3 28 . Rxf7 ) 27 .
Rxf7 h6 ( or 27 ... Bf6 28 . R1xf6 ) 28 .
Rf8 + Kh7 29 . Qf5 + g6 30 .
Rf7 + Kh8 31 .
Qxg6 and mate in two after the spite check ( Nf2 + ) .
I think that 's about it ... time to check !
Apr -10 -09 TheBish : Rats , I missed it by a whisker , since I had 26 .
Rf6 instead of 26 .
Rd5 ! , although 26 .
Rf6 Qxd3 27 . cxd3 Bxf6 28 .
Qxb4 should still win in the long run , but not the quick crush as in the game .
So I guess I get an A- instead of an A .
As I often do , once I got the winning position I rushed the finale , but as I often say , in an OTB situation , I would probably find the better move if I had the time !
Apr-10-09 crwynn : < Gilmoy : < SamAtoms1980 : However , after 24 ... Bxc3 25 exd6 Qxd6 , I had not 26 Rd5 , but 26 Rf6 > < DoubleCheck : I did not see the impressive Rf6 ! > 26.Rf6 ??
Re6 and Black's K has a flight square through e7 .
27 . Rxf7 Rh6 and now it 's
White who 's getting mated at h2 , so he must give his Q. Oops . >
I believe the " oops " is yours , 26.Rf6 was my solution as well , after the obvious 25th moves , and of course 26 ... Re6 ?? 27 . Qxh7 + leads to mate .
What I missed is 26 ... Qxd3 ! and Black is worse after the exchanges , but the game continues .
Apr-12-09
patzer2 : For the Friday April 10 , 2009 puzzle solution , White initiates a deep discovered attack combination with 24 .
e5 !!

I thought it would be fun to write a Ruby script to generate the HTML table I used in the previous post and it turned out to be a nice little exercise .
I admit way up front here that I am still getting the feel for Ruby so it ’s entirely likely that my Ruby skillz are non-idiomatic or down - right bogus .
If so , please let me know so I can learn from you gurus …
Twitter search
First , I wanted to hit the Twitter Search API to grab all of my tweets with links in the last week .
You can pretty quickly figure this out by using the Twitter advanced search screen and looking at the resulting search , something like : “ from : puredanger filter : links since : 2009 - 03 - 23 ” should do the trick .
Scripting the search
I decided to write the script in Ruby as I wanted something relatively short and I assumed that there were existing Ruby libs out there .
Sure enough , I quickly found the twitter - search gem and it worked flawlessly .
You just need to grab the gem as mentioned on the main page .
To actually run a search , you need some code like :
require ' rubygems ' require ' twitter_search ' agent = " recent - links " @client = TwitterSearch :: Client.new agent @tweets = @client.query " from : puredanger filter : links since : 2009 - 03 - 23 " @tweets .each do |tweet| # work with properties of the tweet like : # tweet .id # tweet.created_at # tweet . text # tweet .
from_user # tweet.from_user_id # tweet.to_user # tweet.to_user_id # ... and some others you can look up if you want end
Regexen
As we all know , knowing regex gets you all the chicks .
In this case I went with something super quick and dirty : /( http : \S+ ) / .
Feel free to make it as complicated and perfect as you like .
I decided that I wanted to remove the url from the tweet and make the whole tweet into a link itself in the output .
That yielded this ugly chunk ( could be shorter but was easier to debug this way ) :
text = tweet .
text link_regex = /( http:\S+ ) / text_no_links = text.gsub( link_regex , '' ) links = text.scan( link_regex ) [ 0 ] link = links [ 0 ]
Unraveling short urls
I noticed then that I had a bunch of crappy shortened urls and thought it would be nice to resolve them into the more understandable ( in blog context with hovers ) long urls .
There is a very nice service that can help with this called LongURLPlease.com .
I ’ve been using their Firefox plugin for a while and find it very helpful ( not just in Twitter Web , but also in forums , web mail , etc ) .
They also happen to have an API ( cha-ching ) .
So it was simple enough to write my own Ruby interface to their API which will resolve a short url into a long one ( and if it ’s not a short url , give you back the original ) .
Here is longurl.rb :
require ' rubygems ' require ' net / http ' require ' json ' require ' cgi ' module LongURLPlease class LongUrlClient LONG_URL_API_URL
= ' http://www.longurlplease.com/api/v1.1'
LONG_URL_TIMEOUT
= 5 def headers { " Content - Type " => ' application / json ' } end # the api can handle multiple url queries and response , but this does just 1 def query ( search ) url = URI.
parse ( LONG_URL_API_URL ) url.query = " q=#{CGI.escape( search )} " # req = Net:: HTTP::Get.new(url.path ) http = Net:: HTTP.new(url.host , url.port ) http.read_timeout = LONG_URL_TIMEOUT
json = http.get(url.to_s , headers ) .body urls = JSON.parse ( json ) long_url = urls.values [ 0 ] if long_url.nil ?
then search else long_url end end end end
I hereby release this ( and all code in this blog entry ) as public domain – do anything you want with it .
Copy , re-release , re-distribute , make it into a gem , publish it as your own , etc .
It comes with no warranty of any kind , you accept all risk , and no attribution is required .
Enjoy .
You can use this API by doing something like :
require ' longurl ' @longurl_client = LongURLPlease ::LongUrlClient.new short_link = # something long_link = @longurl_client.query short_link
Paging
The Twitter search api wo n’t necessarily hand you all responses in the world – the API exposes a paging parameter to walk through multiple pages of results .
To do this with the twitter - search API , you need to pass a hash of url parameters instead of a string ( for just the query ) :
params = { ' q ' => " from : puredanger filter : links since : 2009 - 03 - 23 " , ' page ' => page.to_s } @tweets = @client.query params
Clean up
And finally , I did a round of clean up to pull out hard - coded twitter IDs , make the # of days history and # of max links into command line arguments , etc .
I also added some simple code at the end to dump the results oldest to newest ( you get them newest first ) in an HTML table , easy for me to copy / paste into my blog .
The finished script is this :
require ' rubygems ' require ' twitter_search ' require ' longurl ' # input parameters user = ' NO_USER_SET ' # required max_days = 7 # optional max_links = 100 # optional if ARGV.empty ?
puts ' ruby mylinks.rb < user > [ < max days > [ < max links > ] ] ' exit 1 else user = ARGV [ 0 ] max_days = ARGV [ 1]. to_i if ARGV.size > 1 max_links = ARGV [ 2 ]. to_i if ARGV.size > 2 end agent = " recent- links - #{user} " @client = TwitterSearch :: Client.new agent @longurl_client = LongURLPlease ::LongUrlClient.new page = 1 @rows = [ ] while @rows.size < max_links params = { ' q ' => " from : #{user} filter : links since : #{Date.today - max_days} " , ' page ' => page.to_s } @tweets = @client.query params if @tweets.size == 0 break end @tweets .each do |tweet| text = tweet .
text link_regex = /( http:\S+ ) / text_no_links = text.gsub( link_regex , '' ) links = text.scan( link_regex ) [ 0 ] link = links [ 0 ] long_link = @longurl_client.query link @rows << " < tr ><td>#{tweet.created_at [ 5,6 ]
}</td><td>< a href=\" #{long_link}\ " >#{text_no_links}</a></td></tr> " end page = page + 1 end # print table puts puts ' < table border = " 1 " >' puts ' < tr >< th> Posted </ th>< th> Tweet </th></tr>' @rows [ 0..( max_links - 1 ) ] . reverse_each { |row| puts row } puts ' < / table > '
And I ran it with : ruby mylinks.rb puredanger 7
Hope you enjoyed this diversion as much as me …. feel free to hack it into whatever you need .
Please post comments about improvements too if you have some .
Seems like it would be pretty trivial to do a Javascript version of this that could actually run completely in the browser , but I am far worse at Javascript than I am at Ruby . :)
GreenTalk Radio host Sean Daily talks with American indy filmmaker Sam Bozzo of Purple Turtle Films about his new award - winning documentary on the global water crisis , “ Blue Gold : World Water Wars “ .
Transcript
Sean Daily : Hi everyone , welcome to GreenTalk Radio .
Iâ€™m your host Sean Daily .
Water is the source of all life .
Most of us take it for granted .
And few people would think of water as something that wars might be fought over .
Or as something that might someday be less available or even unavailable to inhabitants of the planet .
In films , like the one created by my guest today , are beginning to change that way of thinking .
And , like an Inconvenient Truth did for bringing awareness to global warming and climate change , Blue Gold : World Water Wars by director Sam Bozzo , is beginning to change the way people think of water .
Sam Bozzo is an American documentary filmmaker and also the owner of a production company called Purple Turtle Films .
Found online at purpleturtlefilms.com .
His latest film , Blue Gold : World Water Wars , premiered at the Vancouver International Film Festival last September .
The film , narrated by Malcolm McDowell , takes a hard look at the coming , and for some , present , water crisis facing our planet .
One quick editorial note before we get started .
This is actually a two part interview with Sam .
He has some fascinating stories that I want you to stay tuned for in part two .
And that we will release a few days afterward on bluelivingideas.com , greenlivingideas.com , and other sites that syndicate the show .
So Sam , first of all , welcome to the program .
Sam Bozzo :
Oh , thanks for having me .
Sean Daily : Itâ€™s our pleasure .
So , I watched the film last night and I wasnâ€™t really sure what to expect , and I have to say that I was truly blown away and very disturbed in watching it .
I think maybe even more so than I was when I first watched an Inconvenient Truth many years ago .
Um , â€˜cause uh , thereâ€™s just , thereâ€™s so much going on , it was a real eye opener .
Uh , and uh , again , disturbing but also like there was a lot of hope in there .
So , well letâ€™s talk about the film .
First of all I want to congratulate you on the success of the film .
Uh , I know that it is starting to win awards and itâ€™s made its rounds around the world with the premiers and so forth .
Sam Bozzo : Yeah .
No , thank you .
And Iâ€™m really happy .
Um , PBS video is going to be doing the distribution .
Itâ€™s actually coming out Tuesday on the DVD .
And Iâ€™m happy about that because I made it … I really wanted to get this to its wide a general audience as possible .
You know , as opposed to specific , so I am really happy to have that PBS branding there , uh , to help with that .
Sean Daily :
So where are you in the release , uh , I know thatâ€™s itâ€™s gone around the , you know sort of the debuts and the film festivals .
Is the official a DVD from North America … is that out yet ?
Sam Bozzo : Thatâ€™s coming out Tuesday April 7th .
Sean Daily : Okay .
Sam Bozzo :
And um , theyâ€™ve been ordering it .
You can buy it online at shoppbs.org .
But it will be in stores on the seventh .
Sean Daily :
In watching the film there are so many issues that come up around water .
Itâ€™s kind of amazing .
And in a lot of ways in kind of feels like a perfect storm .
No pun intended .
Um , around water .
Uh , for the planet .
And that sort of …I think it really , drove home , what a crises we are facing .
And , I think , what is somewhat surreal about it to me is how little of it is known to the general populace .
Sam Bozzo : Yeah .
Absolutely .
When I um , I mean I actually did a narrative films .
My background at film school and short films .
And I was writing a script with a producer for the …a sequel to the sci fi man who fell to earth , and thatâ€™s an old sci fi where David Bowie was an alien whose planet was running out of water and they came here looking for our water .
And we thought weâ€™d be clever and think about twenty years from now what if we started running out of water which seemed … you know … just preposterous to us .
And Si the producer found the book Blue Gold .
And I read it .
And thatâ€™s when I um …and like you , I was just blown away .
What was actually happening , had already happened …um , was , was bigger than anything we were coming up with for a science fiction .
And um , you know , thatâ€™s when we put down the project .
And I said you know , I have a camera .
I won this camera from Kevin Spacey from a short film contest .
And so I had that and I , you know , I knew I could uh , could do a documentary fairly cheaply .
I thought , just from traveling and um , I just thought it had to get out there .
I had to do it just clearly as a documentary and try to get the information out before going back to that project .
Sean Daily :
So now , uh , the authors of the book , Iâ€™m curious how you first made the connection .
I think itâ€™s a Maude Barlow , who is a very famous water expert , speaks for the United Nations and pretty much everybody that uh , needs an expert on water speaking …uh , and then Tony Clarke … tell us about that relationship and how you first came to know them .
Sam Bozzo : I got very lucky .
Once
Si found the book , I um , I contacted the publisher listed in the book and I figured that they would want a lot of money and that would be that .
You know , but I thought Iâ€™d contact them .
But as it turned out , the first publisher who I contacted , had uh , lost the book somehow and sold it to somebody and in that process they didnâ€™t have the film rights so the author still had the film rights .
And uh , they were immediately friendly and excited that I was going to do this .
And um , in fact I started the film by trying to figure out what their schedule would be going around in the fall around the world .
And um , so there was this timeline to get started .
And I found uh , a funder , after I had the authorâ€™s blessings .
I found a funder , and I bought all the equipment on credit cards , all the plane tickets on credit cards , and then the night before the shooting started my funder backed out completely .
And I was actually going to uh , back out of the project .
I was going to return everything .
And itâ€™s uh , itâ€™s a semi…it sounds like a corny story except that itâ€™s true .
I was going to tell my wife .
It was the night before shooting that it was all off .
And my son who was three years old at the time .
I devote the film to him because of this .
And he had woken up from sleep and he was in the hall and I said why are you awake and he said he was thirsty .
And it just uh …and I just got him a glass of water and it was in that process that I decided uh , I just never said anything .
I figured the money will come as I go and I got up and kept shooting because all the plans were there .
I just had it all on credit .
But once the authors found out I was doing that they helped me find a couple grants but itâ€™s still been a struggle since then .
But itâ€™s certainly something I am glad I did .
Uh , knowing , that I would uncover all the things you saw in the film , I donâ€™t know if I would have got it started knowing the scope of it .
But once you got started it seemed I had to go on a global level and find as many of these stories as I could .
And I was surprised that it was very easy to find stories .
It was hard choosing them .
I mean the first cut was four hours .
Thereâ€™s tons that isnâ€™t there .
And uh , itâ€™s just amazing uh , how much of this is going on as you said with little or none known about it .
Sean Daily :
Well , truth again , it is very well edited , I mean I think that it doesnâ€™t meander at all .
And it uh , it seems that uh , again , I there are so many areas that are covered , it , itâ€™s almost at some point youâ€™re like stop I canâ€™t believe that there are this many crises around one topic you know , but certainly Maude and Tony , both who appear in the film as on camera experts and they really represent two different perspectives and I appreciate it .
Heâ€™s is more of the impassioned guy and she is this really well spoken expert who just really knows her stuff and sheâ€™s a true scientist and clearly knows what she is talking about .
Um , and so together I thought that they really presented uh , the facts very well .
It doesnâ€™t , it doesnâ€™t , it did not come off to me as alarmist in any way .
Um .
But the facts themselves are alarming .
So letâ€™s talk about the specifics of the film if we could .
I would like to dive in first of all … letâ€™s just summarize … because I said there are so many … letâ€™s just summarize maybe some of the basic premises of why we are in this situation and what that situation is .
Um , it seems that weâ€™re …. the film starts off by talking about the desertification thatâ€™s occurring of the planet .
And we are essentially desertifying .
And , and , and ….
Sam Bozzo : Right .
Yeah … what I liked about the book itâ€™s broken up into three parts .
The crises .
The politics .
The way forward .
I added water wars in there because thatâ€™s the ultimate end of the politics and what I ended up focusing on .
But yeah the crises … I mean , what really we need to think about …is that we are pumping ground water much faster than weâ€ ™re … than rain can replenish it .
And we are pumping it mostly through agriculture needs and through uh , industry needs .
People donâ€™t think about cars needing water , you know .
Everything you make need the factories , need water to make it .
And so you have these giant , giant , industrial world pumping much more water from the ground than thatâ€™s going back in .
And creating a desert .
Um , the water thatâ€™s used goes down the drain and most of the time goes to the ocean .
Um , and then , what we end up having …uh , when you have a desert , is when it does rain , the water just slides right off .
It doesnâ€™t soak back into the ground .
And so it goes to the ocean through rivers .
And what we end up having is a ocean with all the fresh water which is why you see…one reason you see increased hurricanes and increased drastic weather .
Um , weâ€™ve gotten used to blaming everything on carbon .
And , and , and thatâ€™s very important .
Iâ€™m so glad that we are hitting the carbon issue .
But , what , what , a lot of these experts are saying is even if we got rid of all carbon emission tomorrow , we are going to have weather change .
We are going to have climate change .
Because as long as we have a desertifying land , and hurricanes over the ocean , thatâ€™s not , you know , the , the , thatâ€™s going to increase the weather change we are seeing .
Sean Daily :
And we are also seeing ancillary issues .
And not to divert this but then there are also issues like the relation between the increase of CO2 acidifying the oceans and then affecting the fish population .
You know , so these things are all so connected .
Sam Bozzo : Yeah .
The pollution … yeah the pollution angle is definitely connected with carbon .
So what …I mean the important thing is so what if we are turning into a desert is that , we have so much fresh water that itâ€™s always been on the planet , itâ€™s never going to be more or less .
Itâ€™s a finite amount .
And the thing is whatâ€™s usable to us .
So some people say we can never run out because it is always the same .
But if we are dumping it …if itâ€™s all in the ocean…or if itâ€™s all polluted … those are the two main , you know , issues when you get down to it … then we canâ€™t use it if we donâ€™t have access to it for a growing population .
And thatâ€™s when … thatâ€™s really what the crises is about is our population is growing uh , and yet we are running out of water for it .
And as that continues , what sources of drinking water we do have …who controls them … becomes uh , incredibly important to the whole political structure in the next twenty years .
Sean Daily :
So water is not water .
Not all water is the same .
And that we are basically …. we are perverting water that would be otherwise usable by life and taking it and putting it into a state where it is not usable .
And so …
Sam Bozzo : Right , either by letting it go to the ocean or um , from over ground water use or by polluting it to the point where we canâ€™t use it .
Sean Daily : Right .
And you , and you talk about the ways in which thatâ€™s happening and there are unfortunately the , the …the means are myriad …as it turns out .
So you mentioned the hard soil run off so as the desertification occurs the soil gets harder , that causes more run off to the rivers .
And then letâ€™s talk about , if we could , talk about the damming of the rivers .
Which I did not no about .
Sam Bozzo : Yeah .
Me too .
At first , at first , you know , going into this , I think it helped not to know anything , because um , I , you know , there are so many times if youâ€ ™re … if you know a little bit about it you can skip over the basics and so I really was careful .
If I didnâ€™t understand something I wanted to get to the bottom of it .
So I had no idea , why are dams bad ?
Whatâ€™s so , whatâ€™s so bad about a dam ?
Itâ€™s getting clean electricity .
Why is that a problem ?
And um , especially since if the problems … if one of the problems getting fresh water to the ocean and wonâ€™t dams be a help by stopping it even , you know .
But the bottom line is um , dams are caused … there , there , stopping the water flow .
And what rivers do is they carry nutrients down stream .
And so , that keeps the land fertile , uh , so that , uh , you can grow crops so that it doesnâ€™t desertify .
And so when you block a dam you are blocking a giant reservoir of water , the down stream now is going to become more eroded .
Uh , just because there are no nutrients getting to it .
And the water behind the dam becomes stagnate and unusable itself … highly polluted with mercury from the flooding of the area .
So , you are really um , youâ€™re , youâ€ ™re making the desert problem on both sides of the dam .
And we have fifty thousand dams worldwide .
Giant ones .
Itâ€™s crazy .
So weâ€™ve become so uh , dependent on this for electricity that you can really see that one of the solutions presented are micro turbines .
Or there are many other kinds of ways to get electricity from flowing water without blocking it .
And I can see in the future , uh , I mean , uh , removal of dams being a major part of the solution , as we go solar more .
You know , it will just make more sense .
But um , itâ€™s hard … itâ €™s taken so much time to make these dams itâ€™s hard to think about removing them .
But itâ€™s something we will have to deal with .
Sean Daily :
Well I can only imagine too there like many things … there is going to be pressure from both private organizations , private companies and government bodies against that .
I mean that , that canâ€™t be an easy thing to do .
To dismantle a dam .
Sam Bozzo :
Well and also , itâ€™s interesting um , one thing I had to kind of cut from the film but one of the big solutions for this , uh , in Slovakia Dr. Kraftcheck made this thing called the blue alternative in the film .
Where …and that was in response to a dam , uh , in Slovakia the government wanted to put this giant damn that was going to flood , uh , a lot of villages .
And just , you know , displace a lot of people .
And um , so he said well this is ridiculous we can , we can um , we can solve this issue by just keeping more water in the ground .
By , by replenishing ground water .
So thatâ€™s where he started .
They started by terracing the land into little water catchments which allowed rain water to be caught , seep into the ground .
And keep the ground water , you know , in its place .
And um , that plan is really important .
I think thatâ€™s the root solution to everything because , uh , if there is no demand for water , if everyoneâ€™s got it around them , then there is not going to be this ownership problem which weâ€™ll get into with the politics of who , who controls it .
And um , but that came as a direct alternative to a dam .
And they did fight it .
Uh , very much .
Um , because they …. thereâ€™s a lot of money in making a dam .
Uh , a lot of people get paid and , and , itâ€™s uh , political issue of its own .
Sean Daily :
One of the experts on camera was the woman from India .
I do not recall her name .
Sam Bozzo : Vandana Shiva .
Sheâ€™s amazing .
Sean Daily : Yeah .
She was talking about …. she was drawing an analogy that uh , she was talking about the changes to the hydrologic cycle .
Um , as was Tony Clarke and that , also that we should think of this as , uh , that rivers are to the earth , uh , as the circulatory system is to the human body .
And that by damming up the river itâ€™s like clogging the arteries .
And ….
Sam Bozzo :
And thatâ€™s a heart attack .
Sean Daily :
And thatâ€™s a heart attack .
Sam Bozzo :
And the planet is headed for …itâ€™s having spasms of a heart attack in a sense .
Which is a good analogy .
Itâ€™s absolutely accurate .
Sean Daily : Yeah .
And the idea that these rivers are carrying these nutrients into the echo system and we block them up …. we naturally …. it just makes sense …. it makes , makes logical sense , you donâ€™t really even have to be any kind of expert for that for that to appeal to your logic .
Um , so letâ€™s switch topics .
Iâ€™d like to talk a little a bit about …also the sink hole issue and some of the issues that , by pulling the water out …. which is …. what you mentioned happening …. where …we are pulling water out of um , our watersheds , and that one of the things that is happening … an example was given of …. historical example of fabled Atlantean city of Ubar .
A city that disappeared but was later found by um , archeologists .
It was found collapsed into the desert sand .
That was from …. they had been also pumping out ground water which created some giant sink holes in the city and that you pointed out in the film , or somebody pointed out in the film , thatâ€™s actually happening today in places even like Florida in the United States .
Sam Bozzo : Yeah , there are giant … what happens … .
I didnâ€™t understand …. starting this ….
I didnâ€™t even understand how ground water works .
Itâ€™s not so much that thereâ€™s a lake underground , in a big cavern , itâ€™s , itâ€™s in the mud and the sand .
The waters kind of mix and it just gets …. you know , itâ€™s within the dirt .
So when you dry that out you have air pockets within the dirt structure that used to have water .
And eventually , that , that , if there is too much weight will just collapse .
And in Florida you will have entire …. there was a picture in there , I forget how big it was , it looked like six city blocks just that totally collapsed into a giant sink hole .
But what also happens , is what is less evident is that entire regions will just slowly and evenly go down like in the San Joaquin Valley there was …. thereâ€™s a picture in the film of where it was in 1970 the entire horizon landscape of farm land .
And itâ€™s gone down some fifty feet .
Just from slowly subsiding .
Um , and so , you know , but as far as the uh , the dangers of collapsing cities … Mexico city is also an example in there …and thatâ€™s the most drastic that I see .
There , there one of the first major cities to run out of …. that will run out of water .
Sydney is another one .
And um , Beijing .
But theyâ€™re pump …. theyâ€™ve pumped so much that you can see churches are just slanting … entire buildings …. the whole …you know you really see it dramatically how the city is starting to collapse .
Sean Daily :
You actually had a picture on there of a tilted …. you could see the picture of the church and not even with the ground …. it was a visible tilt .
Sam Bozzo : Yeah .
So itâ€™s getting very evident .
Um , and , which is , in one sense good , because people need to see problems before they deal with them .
And I think one big issue with it being underground and ground waters , we never see ground water .
So , itâ€™s hard to imagine , what itâ€™s doing to us by , by draining it so quickly .
Sean Daily : I think it is that out of sight out of mind nature of this that make it uh , so sort of insidious you know in a lot of ways .
So itâ€™s funny you mentioned that place in Florida , thatâ€™s actually Winter Park which is near where my brother lives .
So that was extra disturbing because I felt like I needed to pick up the phone and call my brother Craig and let him know you are sitting on top of a sink hole .
Sam Bozzo :
Oh yeah , exactly .
Sean Daily :
So , I think again , and I talked about this , feeling like a perfect storm , another aspect of that , was the fact that of the over population and migration to , to cities of our population which is well known .
But , and then , about cities themselves for exacerbating this because you have concrete in cities and so you have this hard pack that obviously concrete cannot absorb the water .
So we are essentially , we are interfering with the hydrologic cycle by paving everything .
Sam Bozzo : Yeah and I never thought of that either until this film .
And uh , Dr. Kraftcheck again , he did a….he did a sample ….he started studying since world war two and when we really started paving everything after world war two and things got more and more industrial .
Started studying in his hometown and in Slovakia , how much water was being wasted just by that .
And then you , expand that to the world .
And it really is its own issue .
Um , and it goes … . itâ€™s an easy issue to see because pavement you can tell why water wonâ€™t be going into the ground .
And it really points out um , why water catchments within cities …. thereâ€™s even a permeable pavement solution that they have where there is some pavement where the water can seep through and be filtered .
And thatâ€™s what we are going to have to see but um , yeah our own , our own desertification of pavement in a way is also was an interesting aspect to this .
Sean Daily : Yeah .
Well , I have so many other questions for you and I want to talk about water privatization and water rights and all that good stuff but we are going to take a quick break right here and I will be right back and my guest is Sam Bozzo , he is the director of Blue Gold : World Water Wars .
A new documentary .
That will be out soon on DVD .
Hopefully by the time you are hearing this .
And you can find it on their website at bluegold - worldwaterwars.com .
Or on the purpleturtlefilms.com site .
Or I suppose on Amazon.com is that right Sam ?
Is it on there ?
Sam Bozzo :
Or a shoppbs.org .
Uh , PBS has it out and also at Amazon.com .
Sean Daily : Okay great .
Weâ€™ll be right back on GreenTalk Radio .
Thanks everyone .
Sean Daily :
And we are back on GreenTalk Radio and this is Sean Daily .
We are talking on water today .
I am speaking with American documentary filmmaker Sam Bozzo .
Heâ€™s the director of Blue Gold : World Water Wars .
Sam , we were talking before the break about the film .
And we were focusing on some of the basic issues around why we have desertification , um , the depletion of our watersheds and the run off to water …. things like this .
I think the , the elephant in the room we havenâ€™t talked about so far , and I wanted to save it â€˜till after the break because it deserves itâ€™s own segment , is uh , water privatization , and the threat of …. that many perceive of multinational corporations that are ….
as many say stealing our water essentially while we sleep .
So , letâ€™s just start with some of the issues that are brought up in the film .
Uh , and some of the examples of things that have happened .
If I am to understand this correctly , what is happening is that these large multinational corporations …. and thereâ€™s a big three that are sort of mentioned … Suez , Veolia , which is also Vivendi and RWE - Thames .
Sam Bozzo : Right .
Sean Daily :
And these companies in various forms .
And other companies as well .
Not just those three .
Um , have , basically what they are doing is going to various places that are …. theyâ€™ve identified this coming crises and value of this com , this finite commodity and depleting commodity of water as a profit incentive and that theyâ€™re essentially going in and going to poor countries or even in the United States in case of the Great Lakes and in Illinois and saying hey listen we want you to privatize your water and some sort of exchange happens sometime a bribe of politicians and as it happened you give the example of an Illinois governor or going into third world countries for example and the world bank essentially giving favors for uh , reducing national debt in exchange for the privatization of water so that these private ….
these multinational private corporations can come in and essentially own the water and then export it , sell it , and even sell it back to the indigenous people for a profit .
Um , thatâ€™s unbelievable to me .
Is that where we are ?
Sam Bozzo : Yeah .
Thatâ€™s what amazed me about this story is um , you know thereâ€™s been a lot of complaint or a lot of focus on you know the value or problem with global economy in general .
With global trade and with um , you know sweat shops in certain countries , and , when water enters that field though , I think they are really crossing , the system is crossing that it really canâ€™t come back from because people just wonâ€™t have …. they wonâ€™t take it .
Weâ€™ll handle gas happening ….uh , the price is being raised and everything because honestly when we run out of oil weâ€™ll finally go to solar .
I think , just , you know , weâ€™ll go on .
Um , but with water , what they found , what they didnâ€™t realize , is people just wonâ€™t stand for it .
Um , and just to go back track a little , they , it started , you know , French , started , privatization started in …. with Napoleon in France and thatâ€™s why the big companies are there .
And it wasnâ€™t so bad when it was local .
What happened in the Reagan - Thatcher era is when we started this global economy , thatâ€™s when they expanded .
And they did exactly what you said .
They said oh well Bolivia needs water .
Letâ€™s go buy all their water .
And um , then you know , they buy the entire system .
Itâ€™s cheaper to deliver than it is to maintain .
Thatâ€™s why you have a big pollution problem .
You know , a lot of …. we can talk about Mexico in a second , remind me .
But they um …. and then they end up raising the prices to the point where in Bolivia , uh , they were paying more for water than for food .
They were paying half their salary for water .
And , and eventually a boot maker named Oscar Olivera , started this protest …. which started as a protest and ended up taking it to the streets which turned into a revolution .
And the government actually sent the military out there to protect the company .
And started putting snipers in the crowd and shooting people .
Um , eventually , the government realized , they were going to be overthrown .
And they kicked out the company .
But it was a great …. thatâ€™s a very good example of how uh , how this can go horribly wrong .
And what hit me was yes , itâ€™s the corporations , but I do want to stress though , you know , corporations by nature are there to make a profit .
They are not social service agencies .
So , the other issue and maybe the bigger one arguably is , why are the governments selling to them ?
Sean Daily : Right .
Sam Bozzo :
You know itâ€™s the governmentâ€™s job to take care of people .
So if Veolia comes to you and wants to buy all of your water , why did Bolivia sell to them ?
And thatâ€™s where you get the corruption .
Most of the time itâ€™s for an influx of cash .
Directly .
A lot of corruption stories I told in the film .
And thatâ€™s the juggling act we are going to see here .
Is holding our governments accountable for just not selling the water in the first place .
Sean Daily :
What was particularly egregious to me were the countries for example in Africa .
Uh , that were not able to sell their goods at fair value prices .
Even goods labeled as fair trade , for example .
Because uh , in my understanding from the film was that what is happening is that they are being told you cannot charge the tariffs , the export tariffs , for them to be able to pay off their debt .
And so they are not able to sell at a fair price their goods and so they canâ€™t make as much money .
And so , and then , and then , theyâ€™re exploited also on the water privatization side so that these companies come in .
So , itâ€™s kind of like their being …. their being completely exploited and taken advantage of .
Sam Bozzo : Yeah , thatâ€™s important ….is um …and again it goes back to why weâ€™re seeing the entire global economic system challenge , or the way it operates , in that , again , from world war two debts that World Bank set up , uh , Africa will have to …. they canâ€™t charge as much or canâ€™t make as much profit off .
An example in the film was tea , but you have diamonds , you have gold , you have oil , you have everything .
Um , because they need to pay high tariffs to pay off that debt and so , theyâ€™re being forced to grow cash crops in order just to have any input of money .
That of course uses all of their fresh water for these crops .
And they , and the government there is also corrupt so they …. their not even …. they donâ€™t even have money to have pipes to go to their house .
And yet they have a lot of water in Kenya for instance .
And so , they are being forced to use water to grow roses , I used as an example , to , to go to Europe .
Europe , europe doesnâ€™t have enough clean water to grow roses which people there donâ€™t realize .
And so , they are getting it all from Lake Naivasha in Kenya .
And um , and itâ€™s such a huge industry there , there was another filmmaker brought up in the film Joan Root who was killed trying to bring this to light .
And , and , um … .
Sean Daily : Regarding the Lake Naivasha issue , that was her , that was her cause .
Sam Bozzo : Yeah .
Yeah .
It was her cause for many reasons also because of the hippopotamus there dying , everything is dying as you drain that lake .
But you know , that , that , that , someoneâ€™s been killed over a rose exportation is just crazy .
And thatâ€™s where we need to look at virtual water which is brought up in the film .
And what this is , is that , itâ€™s not just fresh water itself , itâ€™s what fresh water is used to make .
Because you know , you need to make food from water , and then you export that food , thatâ€™s , you are really exporting the water that that took to make .
And we need to get that into our heads too is that itâ€™s what water is used for in industry and in agriculture and the exporting of that as well .
Sean Daily :
Now there have been some happy stories .
Hear of successfully taking on the multinational corporations .
And to varying degrees of success .
But there was one that sort of went well but then didnâ€™t go well .
And that was the one around the Great Lakes .
Again , this also affects here in the United States .
This isnâ€™t all happening in …. for people listening in …. in remote places like Africa .
Um , there was , there was a situation , uh , that happened , uh , around Nestle , I believe coming in , and being given water rights for pumping water out of the Great Lakes .
And , uh , there was allegedly some , I think uh , politicians taking bribes for that to happen and then there was a gentleman , he had spoken up against it , and his mother was also featured in the film , uh … .
Sam Bozzo : Yes .
Terry Swier of um , Michigan um , conservation of water .
They um , theyâ€™re the ones that fought Nestle and her son …. well , let me set up something real quick about the great lakes .
Sean Daily : Sure .
Um hmm .
Sam Bozzo :
Because yeah it is very important to understand that this isnâ€™t just in the third world .
And thereâ€™s been some people that say itâ€™s almost easier to fight in the third world than here .
Because in the third world youâ€™ll get revolutions … youâ€™ll get …people will take physical action because they have to .
Sean Daily : Like in Bolivia where they take to the streets and ….
Sam Bozzo : Yeah .
They …. because they have to .
So in a sense , the fights , at least it gets over with and itâ€™s up front .
With here , we have a legal system so itâ€™s fought in courts and itâ€™s fought …. you know the corporations have so much power and so much money here that it …in some ways itâ€™s harder .
So , the Great Lakes have so much fresh water and itâ€™s jointly …. you know , Canada and the U.S. are both on that border , so , thereâ€™s a lot of contention between … .
Canada is worried about in the future , America taking all of its water , or starting to pump it all down because we canâ€™t manage our own and we are running out of our own .
Um .
The Great Lakes being a major source of that , becomes a hot spot .
And youâ€™ll see , youâ€™ll see … .
weâ€™ve set up military bases around there .
A military base that , that , Canada didnâ€™t like us doing .
A lot of the mayors didnâ€™t like that happening .
But , it is a hot spot area and the companies know that .
So when you are dealing with the bottle water company like Nestle , the technology has gotten to the point where uh , you know , a plant that is set up now , can pump so much water that it will drain an entire areasâ€™ water .
Now you know in the beginning of the bottled water industry that wasnâ€™t the case .
The technology wasnâ€™t there that it could really hurt anything .
It was more of …. and thatâ€™s why bottled water itself … .
I um , Iâ€™m hesitant to say , you know , I think we have to focus on really what is wrong with it .
If someone is just pumping locally , selling locally to the local area , then itâ€™s really just a consumer issue of being charged a thousand times more than itâ€™s worth .
Itâ€™s a , itâ€™s a scam issue .
Sean Daily : Right .
Sam Bozzo :
But , when you get these huge companies that can pump enough to drain a whole area , thatâ€™s becoming a bigger issue , and thatâ€™s what happened in uh …. first they tried to set up in Wisconsin , Nestle did .
And it was a…it was a retired …. a group of retired people , um , you know , deer hunters , republicans , which I love , there just these old people and they , and they fought them out .
They actually somehow raised enough of an issue , that the governor , who initially welcomed them because it brings a lot of money , was kind of forced to kick them out .
And that was …that was the only success story we have in America so far .
But , they ran … . you know they went immediately to Michigan , learned from their mistakes there …
Sean Daily :
They being the company .
Sam Bozzo : Yeah .
Nestle moved from Wisconsin where it got kicked out right into Michigan , Set up right away .
Didnâ€™t wait for permission .
Started pumping .
They realized itâ€™s easier …cause it was easier …. you know …itâ €™s easier to ask for forgiveness than permission .
Sean Daily : Right .
Sam Bozzo :
And they just set up base right away .
And people like Terry Swiers , they saw the water tables dropping , started a group to fight against this , but they are just regular people .
So , they had garage sales , they have Texas holdâ€™em tournaments .
They raised a million dollars and uh , defied Nestle , this giant corporation .
Now in that fight , what youâ€™ve mentioned with Terry Swierâ€™s son , is Nestle started throwing slap suits at some of the people , anyone who spoke against them .
Uh , you know , and quite … .
they say itâ€™s a coincidence , but itâ€™s not .
Quite …. you know the son of person who is leading this group against them , throwing slap suits at them to try to scar them to stop uh , to stop fighting them .
But they did end of winning in court .
Which was amazing .
Uh , they won the case , they said you are going to stop pumping now .
They were very excited .
But within three days , that was overturned .
Or the injunction was overturned .
And they , they could pump but they were limited to two hundred and fifty thousand gallons a minute or something which would still drain the area .
But the fact that …. thatâ€™s why itâ€™s somewhat harder in the U.S. some people say because it took â€˜em a million dollars in a year to get their day in court .
They win .
And within three days , the companyâ€™s up and running again .
And you donâ€™t see this in the news or anything .
So , how do you fight in that system ?
Uh , it becomes an issue we are going to be dealing with more and more .
Sean Daily : Yeah , itâ€™s a slap for people who are not familiar ….itâ€™s actually an acronym … .
I never knew this , itâ€™s a strategic lawsuit against public participation .
Sam Bozzo : Yeah .
So , so , these people in a public hearing would be asked , what do you think of this , what do you think of this , and theyâ€™d say I hate it , itâ€™s no good , you are taking all our water and then they would throw this slap suit at â€˜em and itâ€™s really there ….
the fact that companies are allowed to this is ridiculous .
But itâ€™s really there to try to intimidate um , activist from speaking their mind .
And it goes directly against our right to free speech if you think about it .
And also , um , they donâ€™t expect to win but they can tie these people up in court forever .
Uh , and in all these cases they never went through with the slap suit .
It was directly an intimidation tactic as the film pointed out .
They just let it go .
And didnâ€™t …. and eventually ….it just went away .
But the fact that they can put that kind of pressure on people to speak their mind , especially when itâ€™s over their water , uh is something we have to look at as well .
And it comes about because the executive producer of this film , Mark Achbar , he made one of my favorite documentaries The Corporation .
And he …. and uh , in that film it really talks about how corporations in our country for whatever reason have the right of a citizen .
So that is why they can just buy a plot of land , and pump whatever is under there .
Even though they have a factory that is pumping way more than any individual ever could .
Sean Daily : Right .
Sam Bozzo :
And so thatâ€™s why all these prob … .
the , the , the , all the problems need to be solved through legislative is what Iâ€™ve come to realize .
Sean Daily :
But the… .
Sam Bozzo :
It is really legislative mass , legislative changes , the only way to solve something this big .
And it …. but it could happen easily .
Thatâ€™s the good news .
Is with legislation , it could be solved rather quickly .
But itâ€™s getting ….
Sean Daily : Right .
But the problem is that …. and a lot of people … would assert not to sound like paranoid conspiracy theorist .
But the problem is that there are lobbies involved here .
These are major multi national corporations .
Which have lobbies and political power .
And so they have a profit motive .
And so we are expecting the legislation to come from politicians who are being lobbied uh by these …. people donâ€™t realize the size of the lobbies …. they think oh what , a water company ?
What ?
Whoâ€™s that ?
I … . you know , they are used to other types of companies being large .
Um , military industrial complex type corporations but , you know , these companies …. these companies are huge they are just a little bit more behind the scenes .
Sam Bozzo : Yeah .
And thatâ€™s why uh , you know , they bribe the third world countries directly , but yeah thereâ€™s lobbies …. we call our bribery lobbying .
And so , we can , you know , they are …. they are um …. they have influence there .
Again what I …. thatâ€™s what fascinates me about water is I think , once they put water into the system I think we are going to see the system really be challenged .
Because where people have kind of sat back for it with special interest group dealing with oil or dealing with anything that we donâ€™t need .
When it comes to water , what we have seen through these success stories is people just wonâ€™t take it because they canâ€™t .
Once you start taking their water or trying to sell their water back to them they wonâ€™t take it .
We will stand up because you have to , and thatâ€™s where I see the real big chance for change here .
Um , where we have allowed lobbying to happen before , we wonâ€™t allow it here when it comes down to it .
But the question is how bad does it have to get before we ah … .
before it gets there .
And thatâ€™s really the big issue .
Sean Daily :
Well that concludes part one of my two part interview with American director and independent filmmaker Sam Bozzo of Blue Gold : World Water Wars .
While you are waiting for part two which will be on our site in a few days , you can check out the filmâ€™s website at bluegold - worldwaterwars.com .
The film is now in general release for the DVD in North America .
Thanks everyone , and weâ€™ll see you next time on GreenTalk Radio .
So at least we have an answer .
There are indeed limits to the Slumdog Millionaire touch of gold .
Not every tale of a plucky Indian lad can capture the hearts of Americans .
How bad was Bobby Jindal tonight ?
On “ Charlie Rose , ” David Brooks called the Louisiana Republican ’s remarks the worst response to a speech ever , and added–as if that was n’t clear –“ That response from the most prominent Republican competition was to me an unmitigated disaster . ”
Within an hour of the speech , a Google search for “ jindal kenneth 30 rock ” yielded almost 75,000 hits .
Jindal ’s fellow travelers on Fox News used words like “ sing - song ” and “ childish ” to describe his delivery .
Maybe it ’s because I get motion - sickness on bandwagons , but I ’m almost tempted to disagree .
Almost .
Sure , Jindal seemed to alternate between telling a creepy bedtime story about the magical gumdrop Land of Tax Cuts and a creepy bedtime story about the evil Democrats who lurk under your bed .
But Democrats gave their share of creepy responses over the past eight years –I ca n’t be the only person still scarred by Nancy Pelosi ’s unblinking delivery in 2004 .
Speakers from both parties suffer from the constraints of The Response , which is never a rebuttal of the State of the Union but rather a collection of partisan talking points unmoored from the speech that preceded it .
With the president ’s words so fresh in listeners ’ minds , the responder often can’t help but sound like either a liar or an idiot .
Take tonight .
Jindal praised the GOP ’s devotion to tax cuts and warned that Democrats want to “ raise taxes and put more money and power in the hands of Washington politicians . ”
But just minutes earlier , Obama had declared that the stimulus package would result in a tax cut for 95 % of Americans .
Similarly , Jindal ’s charge that Obama thinks “ America ’s best days are behind her ” was hard to swallow after the President ended his speech with the assertions that “ we are not quitters ” and that “ every American who is sitting here tonight loves this country and wants it to succeed . ”
Jindal is a smart guy , a frighteningly smart guy .
I ’d love to hear his real , honest , not - positioning - for - 2012 response to Obama ’s speech tonight because I suspect he ’d have some sharp and useful criticisms .
But when network anchors are quoting Jindal ’s response hours before Obama even arrives at the Capitol , and when Democrats and Republicans alike begin emailing around their own reactions at 6 pm , a real give - and - take obviously is n’t the goal of the evening .
UPDATE : After the jump is the full prepared text of Jindal ’s response–minus the weird “ Happy Mardi Gras ! ” introduction –in case you want to evaluate the speech without the Louisiana guv ’s delivery .
If anything , the sing - song distracted attention from the weird “ jokes ” and strained puns , as well as Jindal ’s willful misrepresentation of the anger about Katrina .
Those affected were n’t upset that government was involved in the rescue efforts .
They were upset about that particular government ’s incompetence .
And if the point of the story is that Americans are better off weathering the recession by going it alone , the GOP should n’t expect a bounce in its approval ratings from tonight .
Good evening .
I ’m Bobby Jindal , Governor of Louisiana .
Tonight , we witnessed a great moment in the history of our Republic .
In the very chamber where Congress once voted to abolish slavery , our first African - American President stepped forward to address the state of our union .
With his speech tonight , the President completed a redemptive journey that took our nation from Independence Hall . to Gettysburg . to the lunch counter .
and now , finally , the Oval Office .
Regardless of party , all Americans are moved by the President ’s personal story — the son of an American mother and a Kenyan father , who grew up to become leader of the free world .
Like the President ’s father , my parents came to this country from a distant land .
When they arrived in Baton Rouge , my mother was already 4 ½ months pregnant .
I was what folks in the insurance industry now call a ‘ pre-existing condition . ’
To find work , my dad picked up the yellow pages and started calling local businesses .
Even after landing a job , he could still not afford to pay for my delivery — so he worked out an installment plan with the doctor .
Fortunately for me , he never missed a payment .
As I grew up , my mom and dad taught me the values that attracted them to this country — and they instilled in me an immigrant ’s wonder at the greatness of America .
As a child , I remember going to the grocery store with my dad .
Growing up in India , he had seen extreme poverty .
And as we walked through the aisles , looking at the endless variety on the shelves , he would tell me : ‘ Bobby , Americans can do anything . ’
I still believe that to this day .
Americans can do anything .
When we pull together , there is no challenge we cannot overcome .
As the President made clear this evening , we are now in a time of challenge .
Many of you listening tonight have lost jobs .
Others have seen your college and retirement savings dwindle .
Many of you are worried about losing your health care and your homes .
And you are looking to your elected leaders in Washington for solutions .
Republicans are ready to work with the new President to provide those solutions .
Here in my state of Louisiana , we do n’t care what party you belong to if you have good ideas to make life better for our people .
We need more of that attitude from both Democrats and Republicans in our nation ’s capital .
All of us want our economy to recover and our nation to prosper .
So where we agree , Republicans must be the President ’s strongest partners .
And where we disagree , Republicans have a responsibility to be candid and offer better ideas for a path forward .
Today in Washington , some are promising that government will rescue us from the economic storms raging all around us .
Those of us who lived through Hurricane Katrina , we have our doubts .
Let me tell you a story .
During Katrina , I visited Sheriff Harry Lee , a Democrat and a good friend of mine .
When I walked into his makeshift office I ’d never seen him so angry .
He was yelling into the phone : ‘ Well , I ’m the Sheriff and if you do n’t like it you can come and arrest me ! ’
I asked him : ‘ Sheriff , what ’s got you so mad ? ’
He told me that he had put out a call for volunteers to come with their boats to rescue people who were trapped on their rooftops by the floodwaters .
The boats were all lined up ready to go — when some bureaucrat showed up and told them they could n’t go out on the water unless they had proof of insurance and registration .
I told him , ‘ Sheriff , that ’s ridiculous . ’
And before I knew it , he was yelling into the phone : ‘ Congressman Jindal is here , and he says you can come and arrest him too ! ’
Harry just told the boaters to ignore the bureaucrats and start rescuing people .
There is a lesson in this experience :
The strength of America is not found in our government .
It is found in the compassionate hearts and enterprising spirit of our citizens .
We are grateful for the support we have received from across the nation for the ongoing recovery efforts .
This spirit got Louisiana through the hurricanes — and this spirit will get our nation through the storms we face today .
To solve our current problems , Washington must lead .
But the way to lead is not to raise taxes and put more money and power in hands of Washington politicians .
The way to lead is by empowering you — the American people .
Because we believe that Americans can do anything .
That is why Republicans put forward plans to create jobs by lowering income tax rates for working families , cutting taxes for small businesses , strengthening incentives for businesses to invest in new equipment and hire new workers , and stabilizing home values by creating a new tax credit for home - buyers .
These plans would cost less and create more jobs .
But Democratic leaders in Congress rejected this approach .
Instead of trusting us to make wise decisions with our own money , they passed the largest government spending bill in history — with a price tag of more than $ 1 trillion with interest .
While some of the projects in the bill make sense , their legislation is larded with wasteful spending .
It includes $ 300 million to buy new cars for the government , $ 8 billion for high - speed rail projects , such as a ‘ magnetic levitation ’ line from Las Vegas to Disneyland , and $ 140 million for something called ‘ volcano monitoring . ’
Instead of monitoring volcanoes , what Congress should be monitoring is the eruption of spending in Washington , DC .
Democratic leaders say their legislation will grow the economy .
What it will do is grow the government , increase our taxes down the line and saddle future generations with debt .
Who among us would ask our children for a loan , so we could spend money we do not have , on things we do not need ?
That is precisely what the Democrats in Congress just did .
It ’s irresponsible .
And it ’s no way to strengthen our economy , create jobs or build a prosperous future for our children .
In Louisiana , we took a different approach .
Since I became governor , we cut more than 250 earmarks from our state budget .
And to create jobs for our citizens , we cut taxes six times — including the largest income tax cut in the history of our state .
We passed those tax cuts with bipartisan majorities .
Republicans and Democrats put aside their differences , and worked together to make sure our people could keep more of what they earn .
If it can be done in Baton Rouge , surely it can be done in Washington , DC .
To strengthen our economy , we need urgent action to keep energy prices down .
All of us remember what it felt like to pay $ 4 at the pump — and unless we act now , those prices will return .
To stop that from happening , we need to increase conservation , increase energy efficiency , increase the use of alternative and renewable fuels , increase our use of nuclear power , and increase drilling for oil and gas here at home .
We believe that Americans can do anything — and if we unleash the innovative spirit of our citizens , we can achieve energy independence .
To strengthen our economy , we also need to address the crisis in health care .
Republicans believe in a simple principle : No American should have to worry about losing their health coverage – period .
We stand for universal access to affordable health care coverage .
We oppose universal government - run health care .
Health care decisions should be made by doctors and patients — not by government bureaucrats .
We believe Americans can do anything — and if we put aside partisan politics and work together , we can make our system of private medicine affordable and accessible for every one of our citizens .
To strengthen our economy , we also need to make sure every child in America gets the best possible education .
After Katrina , we reinvented the New Orleans school system — opening dozens of new charter schools , and creating a new scholarship program that is giving parents the chance to send their children to private or parochial schools of their choice .
We believe that , with the proper education , the children of America can do anything .
And it should not take a devastating storm to bring this kind of innovation to education in our country .
To strengthen our economy , we must promote confidence in America by ensuring ours is the most ethical and transparent system in the world .
In my home state , there used to be saying :
At any given time , half of Louisiana is under water — and the other half is under indictment .
No one says that anymore .
Last year , we passed some of the strongest ethics laws in the nation — and today , Louisiana has turned her back on the corruption of the past .
We need to bring transparency to Washington , DC — so we can rid our Capitol of corruption and ensure we never see the passage of another trillion dollar spending bill that Congress has not even read and the American people have n’t even seen .
As we take these steps , we must remember for all our troubles at home , dangerous enemies still seek our destruction .
Now is no time to dismantle the defenses that have protected this country for hundreds of years , or make deep cuts in funding for our troops .
America ’s fighting men and women can do anything .
And if we give them the resources they need , they will stay on the offensive , defeat our enemies and protect us from harm .
In all these areas , Republicans want to work with President Obama .
We appreciate his message of hope — but sometimes it seems we look for hope in different places .
Democratic leaders in Washington place their hope in the federal government .
We place our hope in you — the American people .
In the end , it comes down to an honest and fundamental disagreement about the proper role of government .
We oppose the National Democrats ’ view that says — the way to strengthen our country is to increase dependence on government .
We believe the way to strengthen our country is to restrain spending in Washington , and empower individuals and small businesses to grow our economy and create jobs .
In recent years , these distinctions in philosophy became less clear — because our party got away from its principles .
You elected Republicans to champion limited government , fiscal discipline , and personal responsibility .
Instead , Republicans went along with earmarks and big government spending in Washington .
Republicans lost your trust — and rightly so .
Tonight , on behalf of our leaders in Congress and my fellow Republican governors , I say : Our party is determined to regain your trust .
We will do so by standing up for the principles that we share — the principles you elected us to fight for — the principles that built this into the greatest , most prosperous country on earth .
A few weeks ago , the President warned that our nation is facing a crisis that he said ‘ we may not be able to reverse . ’
Our troubles are real , to be sure .
But do n’t let anyone tell you that we cannot recover — or that America ’s best days are behind her .
This is the nation that cast off the scourge of slavery , overcame the Great Depression , prevailed in two World Wars , won the struggle for civil rights , defeated the Soviet menace , and responded with determined courage to the attacks of September 11 , 2001 .
The American spirit has triumphed over almost every form of adversity known to man — and the American spirit will triumph again .
We can have confidence in our future — because , amid today ’s challenges , we also count many blessings :
We have the most innovative citizens – the most abundant resources — the most resilient economy — the most powerful military — and the freest political system in the history of the world .
My fellow citizens , never forget : We are Americans .
And like my Dad said years ago , Americans can do anything .
Thank you for listening .
God bless you .
And God bless America .
ToysRUs could be looking to increase its online presence Toy retailer ToysRUs has paid $ 5.1 m ( £ 3.6 m ) for the Toys.com domain name .
The amount has surprised onlookers and hints at a deeper commitment to online retailing for the toy giant .
It is believed to be the biggest payout for a domain this year but has some way to go to beat the $ 14 m paid for sex.com in 2007 or the $ 9.5 m paid for porn.com .
UK domain name seller Sedo said it had seen prices halved for .co.uk domain names since the economic downturn started to take hold .
Brand kudos But , said Sedo 's business development manager Nora Nanayakkara , more small - to medium - sized businesses are buying domains .
" Sales have tripled as businesses see the value in having a presence online , " she said .
" In the case of ToysRUs it could be that they are thinking of rebranding or increasing its online presence , " she said .
" Toys.com is going to put them in the top search ranking and is likely to give them kudos in terms of brand recognition , " she added .
In the US , domain name prices have remained stable , according to Ron Jackson , editor of the Domain Name Journal .
He said that the average .com domain was selling for $ 2,688 ( £ 1,904 ) in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to $ 2,788 ( £ 1,976 ) for the same period in 2007 .
Selling online
For many online , it is a way to buck the downturn , he thinks .
" The severe recession is forcing businesses to look for the most cost effective , efficient way they can possibly operate and for many that means establishing or reinforcing a web presence , " he said .
" This is especially true of brick and mortar retailers .
There is much less overhead involved in selling toys for example online than through hundreds of cash - draining big box retail stores . "
The Toys.com auction , which took place last week , saw a series of bidders for the domain .
But as the price hit $ 3 m ( £ 2.1 m ) , only two were left - ToysRUs and National A - 1 Advertising .
The domain had previously been up for auction and went to a company called Faculty Lounge for $ 1.25 m ( £ 886,000 ) .

Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton traveled to Mexico on Wednesday with a blunt mea culpa , saying that decades of U.S. anti-narcotics policies have been a failure and have contributed to the explosion of drug violence south of the border .
“ Clearly what we ’ve been doing has not worked , ” Clinton told reporters on her plane at the start of her two - day trip , saying that U.S. policies on curbing drug use , narcotics shipments and the flow of guns have been ineffective .
“ Our insatiable demand for illegal drugs fuels the drug trade , ” she added .
“ Our inability to prevent weapons from being illegally smuggled across the border to arm these criminals causes the deaths of police , of soldiers and civilians . ”
Clinton appeared to go further than any senior government official in recent years in accepting a U.S. role in the long - contentious issue of the Latin American narcotics trade .
In the past , U.S. politicians have accused Mexico , the main gateway for cocaine , heroin and other drugs entering the United States , of not doing enough .
But two years ago , President Felipe CalderÃ³n unleashed the Mexican military on traffickers , a move that has contributed to an explosion of violence by drug gangs .
More than 7,000 Mexicans have been killed in the bloodletting since January 2008 , with the gangs battling authorities and one another for supremacy .

Mexicans , sensitive to slights from their richer northern neighbor , have reacted with outrage in recent weeks as the U.S. Joint Forces Command and some senior U.S. officials have suggested that the drug problem is so severe that Mexico is losing control of parts of its territory .
Clinton sought to soothe the wounded feelings , praising CalderÃ³n’s “ courage ” and announcing that the Obama administration is seeking $ 66 million in new funding for extra helicopters for the Mexican police .
She also pledged further unspecified steps to block the movement of guns southward , and acknowledged that proceeds from drugs sold in the United States — an estimated $ 15 billion to $ 25 billion a year — support Mexican drug gangs .
Clinton ’s comments came at the start of a U.S. blitz to emphasize support for Mexico ’s embattled government and improve relations with Latin America .
The Obama administration announced Tuesday that it is sending hundreds more agents and extra high - tech gear to the border to intercept weapons and drug proceeds heading south .
U.S. border states have become alarmed about a possible spillover of the drug violence , and Congress has held hearings on the drug war .
Clinton vowed to press for swift delivery of equipment promised under the Merida Initiative , a three - year $ 1.4 billion package of anti-drug assistance to Mexico and Central America .
Mexican officials and U.S. lawmakers say there are long lag times for helicopters and other desperately needed gear .
In addition , Mexicans complain that Congress has approved only $ 700 million of the $ 950 million that the Bush administration requested for the program since it began last year .
Clinton was greeted warmly by Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa , who called her a “ close friend ” at a news conference .
The Mexican official said that “ we recognize very much these efforts that are now being undertaken by U.S. authorities ” to combat the flow of guns and drug proceeds into Mexico .
But Mexican officials have indicated that they are hoping for more U.S. action .
The Obama administration is trying to draw up a broader regional strategy on the drug problem to ensure that traffickers chased from one country do not simply move to another , aides said .
One reason Mexico has emerged as a major drug hub is because the routes for trafficking Colombian cocaine have shifted away from the Caribbean islands .
Clinton ’s visit comes as some prominent Latin Americans are urging the United States to reexamine its drug policies .
Last month , former presidents of Brazil , Colombia and Mexico called on the United States in a report to consider legalizing marijuana use and focusing more on treatment for drug users .
Obama has emphasized his support for expanded treatment facilities , although not for allowing marijuana use .
In addition to Clinton , Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. plan to visit Mexico in the coming weeks , leading up to a mid-April trip by Obama .
The president will then attend the Summit of the Americas , a gathering of the region ’s 34 democratically elected heads of state and government , on April 17 and 18 in Trinidad and Tobago .
In comments to U.S. reporters , Clinton called for a new approach to tackling the drug problem , noting that “ we have been pursuing these strategies for 30 years . ”
“ Neither interdiction [ of drugs ] nor reducing demand have been successful , ” she said .
Clinton ’s assessment appeared to be at odds with some conclusions by U.S. anti-drug officials .
The Drug Enforcement Administration says that Mexican traffickers have had an increasingly hard time getting their shipments into the United States , in part because of U.S. military and law enforcement operations against their transportation networks .
“ The seizure rates are off the charts for the last three or four years , ” Michael Braun , who recently retired as a senior DEA official , told a congressional hearing this month .
While emphasizing the U.S. desire to cooperate on drugs , Clinton said she wanted her trip to also illustrate the broad range of issues the two countries routinely work on together , including the environment and education .
She announced $ 720 million in funding to modernize border crossings in an effort to promote trade , and said both sides are trying to resolve a dispute over allowing Mexican trucks into the United States that had led Mexico to place tariffs on dozens of U.S. products .

“ The relationship we have with Mexico is much broader and deeper ” than the drug issue , she said .
Clinton is planning to travel Thursday to Monterrey , Mexico ’s business capital , before heading back to Washington .

Noisebridge 's members have filled this small space with an enviable collection of shared tools , parts and works in progress .

FRANCISCO — R. Miloh Alexander and Seth Schoen are hunched over an old pay phone whose innards are being grafted onto the guts of a Walmart telephone and a voice - over - IP modem .
Right now , the Frankensteinish hybrid looks like a pile of tangled wires .
Somewhere in the mess , an alligator clip has popped loose .
Schoen frowns .
" We really need to solder these down , " he says .
The two are working on a recent Monday evening at Noisebridge , a collectively operated hacker space in San Francisco .
Across the table , Noisebridge member Molly Boynoff is typing on a sticker - covered MacBook , learning to program in Python .
Next to her , Noisebridge co-founder Mitch Altman is showing two newcomers how to solder resistors and LEDs onto a circuit board .
" There are zillions of people around the world doing this , " says Altman , referring to the swell of interest in do - it - yourself projects and hacking .
" It 's a worldwide community . "
At the center of this community are hacker spaces like Noisebridge , where like - minded geeks gather to work on personal projects , learn from each other and hang out in a nerd - friendly atmosphere .
Like artist collectives in the '60s and ' 70s , hacker spaces are springing up all over .
There are now 96 known active hacker spaces worldwide , with 29 in the United States , according to Hackerspaces.org .
Another 27 U.S. spaces are in the planning or building stage .
Located in rented studios , lofts or semi-commercial spaces , hacker spaces tend to be loosely organized , governed by consensus , and infused with an almost utopian spirit of cooperation and sharing .
" It 's almost a Fight Club for nerds , " says Nick Bilton of his hacker space , NYC Resistor in Brooklyn , New York .
Bilton is an editor in The New York Times R&D lab and a board member of NYC Resistor .
Bilton says NYC Resistor has attracted " a pretty wide variety of people , but definitely all geeks .
Not Dungeons & Dragons–type geeks , but more professional , working - type geeks . "
For many members , the spaces have become a major focus of their evening and weekend social lives .
Since it was formed last November , Noisebridge has attracted 56
members , who each pay $ 80 per month ( or $ 40 per month on the " starving hacker rate " ) to cover the space 's rent and insurance .
In return , they have a place to work on whatever they 're interested in , from vests with embedded sonar proximity sensors to web - optimized database software .
Altman wears a black Dorkbot T - shirt , a black zip - up hoody and olive khakis with large side pockets .
His long gray hair features vibrant blue and red stripes , and he 's nearly always smiling .
His enthusiasm for hacker spaces is infectious .
" In our society there 's a real dearth of community , " Altman says .
" The internet is a way for people to key in to that need , but it 's so inadequate .
[ At hacker spaces ] , people get a little taste of that community and they just want more . "
Noisebridge founder Mitch Altman shows first - time visitor Jay Thomas how to solder .

* Noisebridge is located behind a nondescript black door on a filthy alley in San Francisco 's Mission District .
It is a small space , only about 1,000 square feet , consisting primarily of one big room and a loft .
But members have crammed it with an impressive variety of tools , furniture and sub - spaces , including kitchen , darkroom , bike rack , bathroom ( with shower ) , circuit - building and testing area , a small " chill space " with couches and whiteboard , and machine shop .
The main part of the room is dominated by a battered work table .
A pair of ethernet cables snakes down into the middle of the table , suspended overhead by a plastic track .
Cheap metal shelves stand against the walls , crowded with spare parts and projects in progress .
The drawers of a parts cabinet carry labels reflecting the eclecticism of the space : Altoids Tins , Crapulence , Actuators , DVDs , Straps / Buckles , Anchors / Hoisting , and Fasteners .
Almost everything in the room has been donated or built by members — including a drill press , oscilloscopes , logic testers and a sack of stick - on googly eyes .
While many movements begin in obscurity , hackers are unanimous about the birth of U.S. hacker spaces : August , 2007 when U.S. hackers Bre Pettis , Nicholas Farr , Mitch Altman and others visited Germany on a geeky field trip called Hackers on a Plane .
German and Austrian hackers have been organizing into hacker collectives for years , including Metalab in Vienna , c-base in Berlin and the Chaos Computer Club in Hannover , Germany .
Hackers on a Plane was a delegation of American hackers who visited the Chaos Communications Camp — " Burning Man for hackers , " says Metalab founder Paul " Enki " Boehm — and their trip included a tour of these hacker spaces .
They were immediately inspired , Altman says .
On returning to the United States , Pettis quickly recruited others to the idea and set up NYC Resistor in New York , while Farr instigated a hacker space called HacDC in Washington , D.C. Both were open by late 2007 .
Noisebridge followed some months later , opening its doors in fall 2008 .
It could n't have happened at a better time .
Make magazine , which started in January , 2005 , had found an eager audience of do - it - yourself enthusiasts .
( The magazine 's circulation now numbers 125,000 . )
Projects involving complex circuitry and microcontrollers were easier than ever for nonexperts to undertake , thanks to open source platforms like Arduino and the easy availability of how - to guides on the internet .
The idea spread quickly to other cities as visitors came to existing hacker spaces and saw how cool they were .
" People just have this wide - eyed look of , ' I want this in my city . '
It 's almost primal , " says Rose White , a sociology graduate student and NYC Resistor member .

* In Noisebridge 's case , the community had a boost thanks to Altman 's geek cred ( he 's the inventor of the TV - B - Gone ) and his connections to existing geek societies , such as Dorkbot , a monthly gathering of San Francisco techies .
Other cooperative arts - and - technology spaces in the San Francisco area — such as NIMBY , The Crucible and CELLspace
— also helped prepare the ground .
And of course it helps that San
Francisco is already receptive to geeks , anarchists and other square pegs .
The recent crop of hacker spaces has followed a rough blueprint prepared by Jens Ohlig called " Building a Hacker Space "
(.pdf ) .
Ohlig 's presentation is a collection of design patterns , or solutions to common problems , and outlines some of the best practices used by German and Austrian hacker spaces .
Many are governed by consensus .
Noisebridge and Vienna 's Metalab have boards , but they are structured to keep board members accountable to the desires of the members .
NYC Resistor is similarly democratic .
Most of the space — and the tools — are shared by all members , with small spaces set aside for each member to store items and projects for their own use .
" The way hacker spaces are organized seems to be a reaction against
American individualism — the idea that we all need to be in our separate single - family homes with a garage , " says White .
" Choosing to organize collectives where you 're sharing a space and sharing tools with people who are not your family and not your co-workers — that feels different to me . "
Noisebridge even welcomes non-members to come use the space , and
Altman says non-members can do everything that members can ( except block the consensus process ) .
The community governs itself according to the guiding principle expressed on a large poster of Keanu Reeves hanging from the loft : " Be excellent to each other , dudes . "
" It sounds hokey , but it works , " says Altman .
Hacker spaces are n't just growing up in isolation :
They 're forming networks and linking up with one another in a decentralized , worldwide network .
The hackerspaces.org website collects information about current and emerging hacker spaces , and provides information about creating and managing new spaces .
There 's also lots of information exchanged via IRC and a weekly telephone conference .
They even enable extramural exchanges .
" It 's like an embassy for hackers , " says Metalab 's Boehm , who has been spending a lot of time at Noisebridge lately while here on a tourist visa .
" If you are a member of a hacker space , you can go anywhere in the world .
It 's like instant family . "
That welcoming attitude is proving powerfully attractive to many geeks .
" I can go to any hacker space anywhere in the world and be welcome there , " says Altman .
" You could too . "

Everywhere you turn there is news that the Fed , the Treasury , or Congress is attempting to " get credit flowing again " .
Kevin Depew was discussing this situation in Five Things : Credit is the Lifeblood of the Economy ?
These are heady times we are living in .
Collectively , our national intoxication runs deep and fierce .
From moment to moment no one really knows whether to laugh , cry , or do both at the same time , and so the air on the street is juiced with a mildly psychotic hum .
Consider the assertion - made almost daily by politicians and monetary policy figures - that all we need to do to end this economic crisis is “ kick start ” lending and that credit is the “ lifeblood of the economy . ”
These baseless assertions infect news article after news article and are repeated by the vast majority of economists and market pundits over and over again as “ self - evident ” truths .
The reality , however , as noted on Minyanville recently in the article , “ Deflation Redux , ” is that these assertions are non-sequiturs .
Meet the World ’s Dumbest Criminals : from a robber who decided to burglarize a house full of karate blackbelts , to another who called to check if there was money in the cash register before the crime .
1 The Robber who tried to rob a bank that had already closed
A bank robber was arrested in Liberty , Pennsylvania , USA , after police said he tried to rob a bank that had already closed for the afternoon .
Christopher Allen Koch , 28 , arrived at Citizens & Northern Bank around 11.40 am and sat inside his car in the bank ’s parking lot for 20 minutes .
But Koch had not read the opening hours , posted on the bank ’s door and the bank closed at noon .
He tried to enter the bank at 12.01 pm – a minute too late .
He was wearing ski mask and gloves and had a gun .
Employees inside spotted Koch and got a license plate number that led police to him .
Koch was charged with criminal attempted robbery and possessing instruments of a crime .
2 The Robber who decided to burglarize a house full of karate blackbelts
Manizales , Colombia may not sound like a capital of karate , but the Pan - American karate champion Cristian Garces happens to live there , along with her instructors and fellow karate - peeps .
So when a burglar decided to invade his house in 2008 while every single one of Manizales most bad - ass appendage launchers was present , they sprung into action and beat the shit out of him before he could scream “ Auxilio ! ”
The thief already had a bag and a laptop computer , two digital cameras and other items of value that he left behind before attempting to flee but was apprehended by residents until police arrived .
“ I do n’t think the thief was eager to continue robbing here , he was very scared , ” said Garces .
3 The Robber who tried to fool police by playing dead at a funeral home
On 2008 , a burglar broke into a funeral home in Burjassot , a small town just outside Valencia and tried to fool police by playing dead , but two things gave him away .
First , he breathed .
Second , he wore grungy clothes rather than the Sunday best of those settling in for eternal rest .
Neighbors living nearby alerted police when they heard the front door of the business being forced open in the middle of the night Police officers arrived with the owner , and eventually found the suspect lying on a table in a glassed - in chamber used for viewings of deceased people during wakes .
The suspect ’s name was not released .
Police said he had served jail time in the past for robbery .
4 The Robber who called to check if there was money in the cash register before the crime
On 2008 , police charged Daniel Glen , 40 , with robbing a convenience store in Windsor , Ontario , after he called ahead to ask the clerk how much money was in the cash register before showing up .
The clerk alerted police , who arrested Glen nearby .
Canwest News Service reported Glen was a suspect in two similar incidents where the thief called ahead to make sure the clerk had the money bagged and ready for him .
5 The Burglar who wrote his own name on the crime scene
An 18 - year - old burglar who vandalized a children ’s campsite building was caught because he wrote his name on a wall at the scene , a court has heard .
Peter Addison , of Heaton Mersey , Stockport , and his friend Mark Ridgeway of Poynton , Cheshire , smashed crockery and let off fire extinguishers .
There are some pretty stupid criminals around , but to leave your own name at the scene of the crime takes the biscuit .
Apart from writing his own name in black marker pen at the Toc H centre in Adlington , Cheshire , Addison also left his gang ’s name on the wall , “ The Adlington Massiv ! ” .
6 The Robber who was defeated by a 95 - year - old woman
Armed only with a screwdriver , a 95 - year - old woman in a wheel chair kept a burglar from breaking into her home by repeatedly stabbing his hand .
It was 3 a.m. when a 95 - year - old Bartlesville woman heard somebody break the glass on her front door and push the door open .
When a hand came inside and tried to unlock the door , she stabbed it .
Again and again .
The woman would not leave the door for fear the man would break in while she was calling for help .
When police arrived , they found the bloody suspect passed out on the front porch with dozens of stab wounds to his lower arms and hands .
The suspect , 46 - Year - Old Robert Horsley , is in jail facing one count of first - degree burglary .
7 The Robber who tripped and stabbed himself with the very knives he was stealing
man running from a western Michigan store with stolen hunting knives hidden in his pants tripped , fell and stabbed himself in the stomach .
The man had put about 300 US dollars worth of hunting knives in his waistband and tried to leave the store , but Meijer employees confronted him and a scuffle followed , he then fell and was stabbed by the knives he had hidden in his clothing .
The suspect was hospitalized after the attempted theft from a Meijer Inc. superstore in the US city of Grand Rapids and is expected to face a misdemeanor shoplifting charge , police say .
8 The Robber who drove a stolen car to court
A 37 - year - old man was charged with stealing a Lexus SUV after he drove it to court the day a jury decided whether to convict him in an unrelated auto theft charge .
Police were suspicious after watching the San Francisco hairstylist walk to the car , parked in front of the courthouse , with keys in hand .
The car also attracted attention as it had several Yorkshire Terriers mulling around it .
The man was charged with receiving a stolen vehicle , receiving stolen property and charges of animal cruelty for leaving the dogs unattended in the vehicle .
Meanwhile , the jury convicted the man of the original auto theft charge .
He was charged with possession of a Porsche Carrera , valued at $ 125,000 , that had been stolen from a San Anselmo home .
9 The Burglar who stole , got drunk and got caught
burglar who pinched a bottle of expensive champagne to celebrate after stealing money and jewellery was caught after he parked his car to sleep it off .
Police were called out by worried passers - by who saw the 37 - year - old man slumped behind the wheel of a car at the side of the road in Dusseldorf , Germany .
Officers who woke him up checked his ID and found he was wanted for a string of robberies .
A police spokesman said : “ The officers could n’t believe their luck when they found out who he was .
He even had the stolen goods from his latest robbery with him in the car .
And we can also got him for drink driving as well . ”
10 The Robber who broke into the home of a sword - wielding Olympic fencing ace
burglar in Hungary climbed over a fence to rob a house only to be confronted by a sword - wielding Olympic fencing ace .
Virgine Ujlaky , 23 , was practicing her swordplay when she saw Pal Nagy , 43 , clambering in through a window of her house in a posh suburb of Budapest .
Within seconds and a few swift slashes of the sword the crook was pinned against the wall , with the blade against his throat as the swordswoman reached for the phone and called police .
They arrested the villan 20 minutes later , who had to be treated by paramedics for shock .
Ujlaky said : “ I was n’t scared when I saw him .
It was good practice as I have a competition coming up this week . ”
Even the strongest levees and flood walls cannot be guaranteed to save New Orleans from another hurricane like Katrina , a US National Academy of Engineering panel concludes .
The existing flood protection measures are designed to protect the city from the worst flood likely in 100 years .
But the panel argues that this approach is not acceptable for densely populated areas where failure of the levees , however unexpected , would be catastrophic by causing flooding that would hinder evacuation .
In addition , the New Orleans authorities need to start a programme of voluntary relocation in some neighbourhoods , the panel says .
Hospitals and nursing homes should in any case be relocated away from flood - prone areas ; during the Katrina evacuation some vulnerable people died .
If people refuse to move , buildings in endangered zones should be raised so their lowest floor sits above expected flood levels .
This has already been applied in some hurricane - prone coastal resorts , which require homes along the shore to be elevated on posts .
Meanwhile , a court this week began hearing a lawsuit to decide whether the controversial Mississippi River Gulf Outlet built by the army ’s Corps of Engineers exacerbated flooding during Katrina .
In its report , the NAE panel suggests that it contributed at most a minor amount to storm surge and flood depths .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The United States is keeping a close eye on Pakistan after this week 's Taliban surge into the Buner district brought them just 60 miles from the capital , Islamabad .
A Taliban fighter in the district of Buner , which is only 96 kilometers from Islamabad .
A Pakistani government official said Friday that the insurgents had completely withdrawn from the district by the end of the week , but a human rights group said people in Buner were reporting that local Taliban remained in the district .
And senior U.S. officials cautioned that any withdrawal by the Taliban was likely meaningless and that the fundamentalist group now holds large areas of the country with the government seemingly unable to stop them .
" We 're certainly moving closer to the tipping point , " Adm .
Mike Mullen , chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff said on NBC's " Today " show Friday .
In the interview from Afghanistan , Mullen said he was " extremely concerned " about indications the Taliban is moving closer to Pakistan 's capital of Islamabad .
Syed Mohammed Javed , commissioner of the Malakand Division that includes Buner , said the Taliban withdrew on Friday without any conditions .
Earlier in the day , Taliban spokesman Muslim Khan told CNN that the militants would pull back from the district .
Pakistani Express TV showed live footage of armed and masked Taliban militants in Buner , loading pickup trucks and driving away .
Sufi Muhammed , an Islamist fundamentalist leader who has been negotiating on behalf of the Taliban , was on scene overseeing the withdrawal , police said .
U.S. military commander Gen. David Petraeus credited about 300 Pakistan 's Frontier Corps with driving Taliban militants out of Buner .
The U.S. Central Command chief spoke to CNN on Friday after testifying before a Congressional panel about the need for the United States to boost its support for Pakistani counterinsurgency troops such as the Frontier Corps .
But Amnesty International 's regional chief said people in Buner are reporting a different situation .
" What we 're hearing from people in Buner ... is that the Taliban that have moved out are the non-local ones , " Sam Zarifi , Amnesty 's Asia Pacific director , told CNN .
" So the local branch of the Taliban are still in place in Buner . "
Amnesty International is concerned that those local Taliban will continue to enforce the Taliban 's " abusive and repressive " control of Buner .
Girls over the age of 7 are forced to wear a burka , a head - to - toe covering that the Taliban say is required of Muslims under its radical interpretation of Islamic law , or sharia .
" I think we 're going to see those harsh edicts stay , " Zarifi said .
The Taliban installed strict Islamic law when it took over Afghanistan after a two - year fight with warlords , many of whom surrendered without a fight .
They fought with a coalition of some of those warlords known as the Northern Alliance from 1996 until U.S. forces , seeking the leadership of al Qaeda after the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , added bombing raids to Northern Alliance ground operations and successfully drove the Taliban out of most of Afghanistan .
iReport : Should the U.S. intercede in Pakistan ?
But the Taliban regrouped in 2004 , launching a guerrilla war against the Afghan government while operating from the tribal areas of that country and Pakistan .
Meanwhile , senior U.S. officials said that the " retreat " was likely meaningless .
Control was the impetus behind the Taliban move into Buner , and the fundamentalist group now controls large areas of Pakistan , they said .
The officials said , however , that they did not believe the Taliban 's goal was to take over the government of Pakistan but rather to create instability by taking advantage of Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari 's apparent inability to cope with the situation .
Zardari , they said , does not understand the gravity of the situation , remains distracted by domestic politics and appears unable to make critical decisions to deploy the army to stabilize the country .
State Department envoy Richard Holbrooke has been on the phone " nonstop " with officials in Islamabad and Washington , the officials said , providing frequent information to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and President Obama .
Holbrooke 's read on the situation , officials familiar with the conversation said , is that the Pakistani government does not know how to handle the situation and is looking to the United States for direction .
A senior military official , however , presented a more dire case .
Pakistan is " rapidly deteriorating , " he said .
He said that he could not rule out the possibility of a military takeover in Islamabad , although he added that such a prospect was not in the immediate future .
As for Pakistan 's nuclear arsenal , he said the weapons " are safe for now " but that the United States is monitoring the safety systems in place .
Administration officials said that the Pakistani military had assured the United States it would not act without an express order from the civilian leadership .
Earlier this week , Clinton warned that nuclear - armed Pakistan was in danger of falling into terrorist hands .
Before the Taliban 's apparent withdrawal Friday , a local Pakistani official expressed doubt about whether the militants would leave , as they pledged to local elders on Thursday .
" Nobody can trust them , " Sardar Hussain Babik , the provincial education minister , said by phone from Buner .
The Taliban have broken promises before and probably would do so again , he said .
Militants who swarmed into Buner subsequently locked up courthouses , seized court documents and battled Pakistani troops who were sent to protect residents .
The militants said they took control of the district to ensure that Islamic law was properly imposed .
The Pakistani government called the land grab a breach of a recent peace agreement .
CNN 's Barbara Starr , Elise Labott , Ivan Watson , Tricia Escobedo and Samson Desta contributed to this report .

Deterrence 2.0
Graham Allison has been a pioneer in issuing clarion calls about nuclear terrorism .
He ’s been accused of alarmism , but Cassandras are supposed to err on the side of caution .
Especially when it comes to an issue that ’s susceptible to being elbowed aside in this Age of the Emergency that we ’re living through .
Between garden - variety terrorism and the economic crisis , we have enough to freak out about , thank you .
Last year the House and Senate passed the Nuclear Forensics and Attribution Act “ to strengthen efforts in the Department of Homeland Security to develop nuclear forensics capabilities to permit attribution of the source of nuclear material . ”
Forensics and attribution are not intended to determine what state has initiated a nuclear attack — that would be apparent — nor necessarily even which terrorist group .
That news also would n’t be long in coming .
The idea is to use these techniques to figure which state should be assigned attribution for supplying the terrorist group with the bomb .
In a recent Newsweek article , How to Keep the Bomb From Terrorists , Allison explains nuclear forensics to the public .
Nuclear experts are now at work assembling a vast database of all known sources .
In the case of uranium and plutonium . . . every step in the nuclear - fuel cycle .
. . leaves traces that can identify where . . . the material came from .
After a nuclear bomb detonates , nuclear forensic cops would collect debris samples and send them to a laboratory . ….
By identifying unique attributes of the fissile material .
. . one could trace the path back to its origin . …
“ After a nuclear bomb detonates ” might better have been phrased “ Should a nuclear bomb detonate . ”
He continues ( emphasis added ) :
As we face the threat of nuclear terrorism with a weapon that could come not only from North Korea but also from Pakistan or , in time , Iran , the challenge is to revitalize the concept of deterrence .
The goal would be twofold : first , to deter leaders of nuclear states from selling weapons to terrorists by holding them accountable for any use of their own weapons ; second , to give leaders every incentive to tightly secure their nuclear weapons and materials .
Again , the objective is n’t to deter the undeterrable — al Qaeda — but states that have actual populations and land masses to worry about being retaliated against .
Also , let ’s get this out of the way : Even if Iran did develop the bomb , what are the odds it would offload the thing ?
It ’s neither addicted to the adrenaline surge of brinksmanship like North Korea , nor careening towards the status of a failed state like Pakistan .
Besides , what would Hezbollah want with a nuclear bomb ?
Al Qaeda - like apocalyptic fervor is n’t their modus operandi .
Canadian Michael Levi is the director of the Council on Foreign Relations program on energy security and climate change ( and has acted as a consultant to the TV program 24 ) .
The element of energy security with which he ’s most concerned , judging by his output , is nuclear terrorism .
Levi ’s book On Nuclear Terrorism ( Harvard University Press , 2007 ) features an image on the cover of a high - wire walker .
The implied tension may be a product of states possessing nuclear weapons , but trying to keep them from terrorists .
To this reader , however , the balancing act is the book itself , which demonstrates how hard it is for terrorists to bring exploding a nuclear bomb to fruition , while managing to keep from minimizing the threat of nuclear terrorism .
In truth , due to the technical nature of the book , I set it aside halfway through .
But in November 2008 , Levi wrote a report on attribution and deterrence for the Council of Foreign Relations titled Deterring State Sponsorship of Nuclear Terrorism .
It ’s more accessible to the lay person than his book .
But , it ’s considerably more in - depth than Allison ’s Newsweek piece , which was intended for general readership .
Levi writes :
[ Analysts ] have long argued that the central pillar of Cold War strategy — deterrence by threat of punishment — is largely irrelevant to [ combating nuclear terrorism because terrorists ] lack the clear return addresses of warheads mounted on missiles [ and ] unlike states , do not present clear targets for retaliation .
The United States attacked by a nuclear bomb — all dressed up with no place to bomb .
Most efforts to prevent nuclear terrorism have instead aimed to eliminate the threat directly .
… by stopping terrorists from acquiring the nuclear explosive materials [ as well as cooperating ] with states to secure their weapons and materials [ and prevent terrorists from acquiring them ] in the first place .
But , Levi writes , thanks to concerns North Korea might transfer weapons or materials to a terrorist group :
. . . traditional deterrence is enjoying a resurgence in popularity , albeit in a supporting rather than a central role .
… the United States has responded by implicitly threatening North Korean leaders with retaliation should terrorists use its stockpile to mount an attack against the United States .
By relegating the new , improved deterrence to a “ supporting role , ” Levi does n’t do forensics and attribution justice .
In truth , it ’s Deterrence 2.0 .
North Korea aside , Levi then admonishes the United States to be careful about wielding deterrence in the traditional ways :
Threatening retaliation against countries like Russia and Pakistan in response to terrorist attacks stemming [ in this case ] from lax security practices is unwise .
It undercuts efforts to work cooperatively with those states to improve their nuclear security .
Returning to Allison :
Establishing a general principle of nuclear accountability that will apply to Pakistan , Iran or even Russia and the United States is an undertaking for [ a ] global alliance .
But this will take months of consultations .
[ Meanwhile , the ] time to deter Kim from the extreme act of selling a nuclear weapon to terrorists is now .
As you ’ve no doubt guessed thus far , Levi shares Allison ’s preoccupation with North Korea ( emphasis added ) :
North Korea is . . . unique among nuclear states in that there is a real prospect that , absent the possibility of retaliation , its leaders might deliberately transfer nuclear materials to a terrorist group .
[ The ] United States must [ state ] that the U.S. president may .
. . decide , based on compelling but imperfect evidence , to retaliate following a nuclear terrorist attack [ while ] stopping short of regime change .
As for that “ imperfect evidence ” and just how advanced the capabilities of attribution are , former Los Alamos chemist Cheryl Rofer has her doubts :
It ’s not a matter of one box tells all about the sample ; it never is in analytical chemistry .
You have to know a bit about what you ’re looking for .
Many of the tests destroy the sample , and most need some minimum amount .
But it really , really helps if you have some idea of what the starting material was .
[ Physicist Andrew ]
Foland notes that the molybdenum signature might help to identify an Iranian bomb , but there ’s plenty of molybdenum in structural steel .
And concentrations of the various components are important , too , and will be scrambled in a nuclear explosion .
To an extent , Levi agrees :
[ The attribution capabilities of the United States ] are and will always be limited .
… anything close to perfection is an unreasonable goal .
How then should the United States compensate for limited attribution capability ?
[ It ] has two basic choices .
It can place the burden of proof squarely on itself .
. . threatening retaliation if and only if nuclear weapons or materials used in an attack can be unambiguously traced back to North Korea .
Alternatively [ it can declare a willingness ] to retaliate on the basis of very strong evidence [ as opposed to ] certain attribution .
This second option , approached properly , is best . …
Finally , Levi warns that , in the aftermath of an attack , the American public needs to have confidence .
. .
. . . that their government had exceptional capabilities to identify the sources of an attack .
…
Wielded wisely , [ this ] new twist on deterrence can make important contributions to strengthening nuclear security .
But applied incautiously and indiscriminately , it could deeply undermine efforts to that same end .
By which he means entangling us in the wrong war yet again .
The Deproliferator ( the column ’s title , not the author ’s nom de plume ) covers nuclear nonproliferation and disarmament , with an emphasis on treaties , negotiation , and diplomacy .
The author is not employed in the arms control field .
A term coined by sociologist and professor of international relations Amitai Etzioni , “ deproliferation , ” he writes , “ calls for removing the access to nuclear arms and the materials from which they can readily be made — first and foremost in unstable and noncompliant states , and only then in all others . ”
Whatever the merits of this approach , it lends itself to reinforcing the distinction between the nuclear haves and have - nots .
Fond of his phrase , though , we ’re appropriating it to our own ends .
For the purposes of this column , deproliferation means , simply , disarmament .

Lego Mindstorms NXT
Manufacturer : Lego
System requirements : 256MB RAM , 300MB hard drive , USB port , CD - ROM , Bluetooth ( optional ) , 1024x768 display , Mac OS X 10.3.9 or later ( 600MHz G3 , G4 , or G5 CPU ) , Windows XP SP2 ( 800 MHz Pentium CPU or equivalent )
Price : $ 250 ( shop for this item )
Steve Hassenplug is sitting in a van with seven other people on the way to a Lego convention in Washington , DC , explaining the limitations of Lego 's previous robot - building kit , called Mindstorms .
" It was always difficult to build a robot that could drive straight , " he says .
The confession prompts others infrared communication on the units was sketchy , and it was difficult for advanced builders to incorporate enough motors and sensors to craft something sophisticated .
Something adult .
Something that could , in short , get chicks ( not Steve 's words ) .
The original Mindstorms systems , cool as they may have been at the time , look like children 's toys from an 8 - bit world .
They featured the familiar Lego look and had limited sensor options .
The heart of the system , the day - glo RCX , would not have looked out of place in the Yellow Brick Road .
Despite the limitations , hobbyists like Steve have stretched the 1998 technology further than anyone thought possible .
Steve himself is especially proud of his own creation , a robot that can play Connect Four and can win 95 percent of the time .
" Whenever I set that up at a show , " Steve says , " kids will line up and play it all day . "
But Steve is n't riding a van through the Appalachians just so he can demonstrate his Connect Four - playing robot for another group of eager kids .
Instead ,
Steve has been serving as one of Lego 's ambassadors for the last few months , crisscrossing the country on the corporate dime to evangelize his new favorite product , a completely overhauled and redesigned Mindstorms kit , with a 32 - bit NXT control brick , ultrasonic sensors , a revamped set of pieces , a new piece of visual programming software , and Bluetooth support .
" Basically , I 've been flown around by Lego to show off some of the things that I 've done , " he says , " which is like every kid 's dream . "
Steve 's love for the new Mindstorms NXT is infectious enough that we had to take a look at the new system , so we hauled a system into the lab for inspection .
Thirty minutes later , surrounded by a scatter of bricks and instruction booklets , a baby ArsBot rolled off the assembly line and into our hearts .
We were hooked .

We 've seen some interesting large - scale multitouch products from SMART lately , but the company 's bread and butter is still the SMART Board interactive whiteboard , and it 's getting a neat little upgrade today : touch recognition .
The board now intelligently senses the difference between a pen and your hand , so you can draw with the pen , move objects with your finger , and erase with the palm of your hand all at the same time -- no tool switching required .
It 's just a little tweak , sure , but it 's the stuff like this that 's going to make touch a viable primary interface -- check out a video after the break .
LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
A new sleeper virus that could allow hackers to steal financial and personal information has now spread to more than eight million computers in what industry analysts say is one of the most serious infections they have ever seen .
Experts say a single infected laptop could expose an entire network to the worm .
The Downadup or Conficker worm exploits a bug in Microsoft Windows to infect mainly corporate networks , where -- although it has yet to cause any harm -- it potentially exposes infected PCs to hijack .
Mikko Hypponen , chief research officer at anti-virus firm F - Secure , says while the purpose of the worm is unclear , its unique " phone home " design , linking back to its point of origin , means it can receive further orders to wreak havoc .
He said his company had reverse - engineered its program , which they suspected of originating in Ukraine , and is using the call - back mechanism to monitor an exponential infection rate , despite Microsoft 's issuing of a patch to fix the bug .
" On Tuesday there were 2.5 million , on Wednesday 3.5 million and today [ Friday ] , eight million , " he told CNN .
" It 's getting worse , not better . "
Hypponen explained to CNN the dangers that Downadup poses , who is most at risk and what can be done to stop its spread .
How serious is it ?
It is the most serious large scale worm outbreak we have seen in recent years because of how widespread it is , but it is not very serious in terms of what it does .
So far it does n't try to steal personal information or credit card details .
Who is affected ?
We have large infections in Europe , the United States and in Asia .
It is a Windows worm and almost all the cases are corporate networks .
There are very few reports of independent home computers affected .
What does it do ?
It is a complicated worm most likely engineered by a group of people who have spent time making it very complicated to analyze and remove .
The real reason why they have created it is hard to say right now , but we do know how it replicates .
How does it spread ?
The worm does not spread over email or the Web .
However if an infected laptop is connected to your corporate network , it will immediately scan the network looking for machines to infect .
These will be machines that have not installed a patch from Microsoft known as MS08 - 067 .
The worm will also scan company networks trying to guess your password , trying hundreds and hundreds of common words .
If it gets in , even if you are not at your machine , it will infect and begin spreading to other servers .
A third method of spreading is via USB data sticks .
How can I prevent it infecting my machine ?

Detainees at Guantanamo
Bay have regularly complained of being tortured
Human and civil rights groups in the US have expressed dismay at news that CIA agents will not face prosecution over interrogation tactics in the Bush era .
Campaigners welcomed the White House 's decision to publish details of harsh interrogation techniques now banned by President Barack Obama .
But rights groups said the decision not to prosecute agents was a failure to uphold the law of the land .
Others defended the techniques , saying the interrogations boosted US security .
The former head of the CIA , Michael Hayden , who ran the agency under President George W Bush , said the White House move would undermine intelligence work and dissuade foreign agencies from sharing information with the CIA .
" If you want an intelligence service to work for you , they always work on the edge .
That 's just where they work , " he told the Associated Press .
Boosting morale
Mr Obama banned the use of interrogation techniques such as sleep deprivation and simulated drowning - known as waterboarding - during his first week in office .
BUSH -ERA INTERROGATION
Waterboarding : Aimed at simulating sensation of drowning .
Used on alleged 9/11 planner Khalid Sheikh Mohammed Insect : Harmless insect to be placed with suspect in ' confinement box ' , suspect to be told the insect would sting .
Approved for Abu Zubaydah , but not used Walling : Detainee slammed repeatedly into false wall to create sound and shock Sleep deprivation : Detainee shackled standing up .
Used often , once for 180 hours
Interrogation : Obama 's approach Report claims CIA used ' torture '
CIA agents are now required to use only those methods outlined in the US Army Field Manual .
The justice department has now released four memos detailing techniques the CIA was able to use under the Bush administration .
In publishing the memos , the Obama administration is clearly hoping to draw a line under the whole episode , says BBC defence correspondent Rob Watson .
The administration did not say it would protect CIA agents who acted outside the boundaries laid out in the memos , or those non-CIA staff involved in approving the interrogation limits .
That leaves open the possibility that those who crafted the legal opinions authorising the techniques , one of whom is now a federal judge , could yet face legal action .

But politically and legally further moves will not be easy , our correspondent adds : the Department of Justice has already in effect ruled out any criminal prosecutions and is even offering legal assistance to any CIA official subject to any international inquiries or congressional investigation .
Politically the Obama administration has been sending strong signals that a functioning CIA is vital to national security and that nothing should be done to weaken confidence or morale at the agency , our correspondent says .
' Crimes committed '
Announcing the release of the four memos , Attorney General Eric Holder said the US was being " consistent with our commitment to the rule of law " .
" The president has halted the use of the interrogation techniques described in these opinions , and this administration has made clear from day one that it will not condone torture , " he said .
However , civil and human rights campaigners remain uneasy and there are calls for an independent inquiry into the issue , one which could offer immunity from prosecution in return for testimony .
The release of the memos stems from a request by civil rights group the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) .
Amnesty International said the Department of Justice appeared to be offering a " get - out - of - jail - free card " to individuals who were involved in acts of torture .
" Bottom line here is you 've had crimes committed , " Amnesty International analyst Tom Parker told the BBC .
" These are criminal acts .
Torture is illegal under American law , it 's illegal under international law .
America has an international obligation to prosecute the individuals who carry out these kind of acts . "
One of the four secret memos released on Thursday contains legal authorisation for a list of specific harsh interrogation techniques , including pushing detainees against a wall , facial slaps , cramped confinement , stress positions and sleep deprivation .
The memo also authorises the use of " waterboarding " , or simulated drowning , and the placing of a detainee into a confined space with an insect - one technique that was not eventually used .
However , most methods were regularly used on " high value " detainees suspected of belonging to the upper echelons of al - Qaeda 's command structure .
Jed Babbin , a former Pentagon official during President Bush 's first term , told the BBC that the decision to use harsh methods was justifiable .
" I 'm not at all convinced that what we got from them was not valuable intelligence in some circumstances , " he said , adding that " retribution " against Bush - era officials would not be productive .
" The job of the American justice system is not to please human rights groups , it is to administer the American law as it exists . "
REACTIONS TO OBAMA DECISION
The memos ' matter - of - fact clinical descriptions belie the harsh tactics to which they gave a green light .
But ... it is not enough to say that when we have a president who does not believe in cruel and inhuman treatment and torture , the United States will not engage in such practices .
We must formally acknowledge that what was done was wrong , indeed criminal .
Georgetown University Professor David Cole , debating the issue at The New York Times
By repudiating the memos , the Obama administration has again seized the high ground and restored some of the honor lost over the past few years .
Yet the decision to forgo prosecutions should not prevent -- and perhaps should even encourage - further investigation about the circumstances that gave rise to torture .
Editorial , The Washington Post
On the surface , the statement today looks like a big ol ' grant of immunity - or a concession - or a deliberate attempt to boost morale at the CIA ...
There are plenty of CIA officers who followed the rules and should n't be prosecuted .
They 're the ones who are a little relieved today ... although they might have to explain some things to their priests and their families .
Marc Ambinder , The Atlantic
Another major issue is lingering , however .
Did the torture " work " ?...
Without a rigorous investigation into the alleged efficacy of U.S. torture , we 'll never know .
But while Obama has turned the page , many others have n't - including the people , and their allies , who think waterboarding was a good idea .
Without a commission ... we could start torturing all over again .

The Tata Nano
The world 's least expensive car , the Tata Nano , has been launched in India .
It will go on sale in April , and will start delivery in July .
The automobile costs only 100,000 Indian rupees , or just under US $ 2,000 .
" We are at the gates offering a new form of transportation to the people of India , and later I hope other markets as well , " said the chairman of the auto firm , Ratan Tata , calling the vehicle a " milestone . "
" From the drawing board to its commercial launch , the car has overcome several challenges , " Tata said .
" I hope it will provide safe , affordable four - wheel transportation to families who till now have not been able to own a car .
" This was never conceived as the cheapest car , but as providing transport to those people who never owned a car , " Tata said .
" Driven mainly by the change in demand that we see elsewhere in the world , we suddenly felt we had a product that could be of considerable interest as a low - cost product in western Europe , eastern Europe , the UK and even the U.S. "
The Tata Nano is a four - door vehicle , and is 3 metres long , 1.5 m wide , and 1.5 m tall .
It is equipped with a 33 bhp , 624 cc engine at the rear .
No radio , airbags , power steering , or air conditioning are available in the basic model , although upgrades are available .
The Nano Europa , a slightly larger European version of the car , is expected in 2011 .
According to Ravi Kant , the managing director at Tata Motors , the first 100,000 people to receive a Nano would be chosen from the initial orders by a ballot .
An auto analyst for Bombay 's Angel Broking , Vaishali Jajoo , predicted that the Nano will add only three percent to Tata 's revenues even if it can sell a quarter of a million such cars per annum .
" That does n't make a significant difference to the top line , " Jajoo said .
" And for the bottom line , it will take five to six years to break even . "
Environmentalists say that the car will exacerbate traffic problems already rife in India , and help increase pollution levels .
Tata , however , stated that its vehicle is the least polluting car in the country .

Rumors
Already some workers have reacted to the furloughs with more stoicism than bitterness .
While a single mother in Sacramento complained that the state furloughs would force her to give up smoking , her only luxury , furloughed employees around the country have said that they see small sacrifices as necessary to prevent larger ones .
Another California employee was using the time off to watch her daughter ride horseback .
There is a counterargument , though .
Critics who support the idea of shorter workweeks in theory say a recession is not the time to force them on workers .
Stagnant wages , said Thea Lee , policy director for the A.F.L. - C.I.O. , have already made time off unaffordable .
“ Normally you would expect that as society gets wealthier , their wages rise ; and as their wages rise , people work less , ” Ms. Lee said .
“ Since we ’ve ruptured that connection between wages and productivity growth , people have no choice but to work more to maintain their standard of living , and even that has n’t been enough . ”
In an ideal world , said Juliet Schor , an economist at Boston College and the author of books on labor , leisure and consumerism , shorter working hours would be voluntary , and workers would be compensated for any increased productivity .
But even forced furloughs could provide more time for family , community , learning and volunteering , unless people must scramble to fill the time with a second job .
Smaller paychecks , she said , would “ dampen down the competitive consumption that ’s associated with the high - hours economy , ” leading to a sustainable way of life .
Employers , too , may find collateral benefits to furloughs .
Studies show that reducing work hours can increase productivity per hour .
Atlanta has recorded fewer sick days , and work crews have saved time because they set up and break down four times a week instead of five , said David Edwards , a policy adviser to Mayor Shirley Franklin .
Such results have precedents .
During the Great Depression , Kellogg ’s instituted a 30 - hour workweek that was so popular vestiges of it lasted until the mid-1980s .
Within two years , productivity had reached 40 - hour levels , said Benjamin Hunnicutt , a professor of leisure studies at the University of Iowa and the author of “ Kellogg ’s Six - Hour Day . ”
Morale improved , and 85 percent of workers liked the change despite the lower pay , he said .
Other studies have shown that vacation , leisure time and shorter hours reduce stress and physical ailments like heart disease  though those ills can pile up again if you ca n’t pay the mortgage or the car mechanic .
After circling the globe three times , my wife and I settled down and had a baby .
I was a travel writer who suddenly could n’t travel much , so it seemed like a good time to write that book I ’d had in my head for ages : The World ’s Cheapest Destinations .
I did n’t feel like I had the patience or the track record to break down the New York publishing doors .
So after researching the options , I published it as a POD title through BookLocker in early 2003 .
My modest expectations of selling a couple hundred copies did n’t take long to exceed .
I got some nice write - ups , I started a website and blog , and eventually journalists started calling looking for cheap travel ideas .
As I built a reputation as one of the leading bargain travel experts , the book sales kept increasing and I got into storied publications such as the Wall Street Journal , Newsweek , and USA Today .
By just writing articles , being visible , and being generous with my time , the results snowballed and the first edition sold close to 3,000 copies .
A second edition followed .
It did even better , with mentions in Maxim , Men ’s Health , Fortune , and many big newspapers .
I sold the Italian rights for that edition , landing a nice bonus .
I eventually got an agent and landed two traditional publishing contracts for other travel books .
Both deals were partly a result of the strong sales I accomplished on The World ’s Cheapest Destinations – many thousands sold net ( no returns ) , without any bookstore presence whatsoever .
I am on the third edition now of my BookLocker title and expect it to once again outsell the books I have out through the “ regular ” publishing and distribution channels .
And hey , it ’s good for the environment : no wasted print runs !
For a niche title from someone with a platform , print - on - demand and BookLocker are a winning combination .

Glenn
Beck believes he 's a sage of the market because he says he warned people to get out when the market was at 14,000 .
And so he 's been ranting and raving for the past month , warning about the impending " Economic Apocalypse " headed our way , complete with cute nuclear - missile graphics .
But that does n't mean he actually knows diddly about economics or the economy .
Because he clearly does n't .
Yesterday on his Fox News show , Beck invited on Stephen Mosher of the Population Research Institute -- a " pro-life " organization set up to " debunk " concerns about overpopulation * -- to talk about the dire economic situation and why Obama is taking us taking us down the road to economic perdition .
Mosher believes Obama 's policies will bring about global inflation :
Mosher :
Well , first of all , I do believe we face fairly substantial inflation over the next couple of years , because we 're spending beyond our means , right ?
We 're running up the bill on the credit card , and we keep going back to the bank -- not the Bank of America , or AIG -- we own it .
We go back to China and say , ' Lend us more money , lend us more money . '
Beck : OK , what does it mean , a ' substantial inflation ' ?
We 're already , uh , we 're already in inflation .
What does substantial inflation mean to you ?
Um , hate to tell you guys this , but deflation , not inflation , is the dire economic problem we currently face .
The problem is global : in the U.S. , in Europe , and China too .
The only reportage on inflation to be found these days is about how it 's been flat -- nearly nonexistent -- for a record period of time , which is why everyone 's so worried .
Not that anyone in their right financial mind would take economic advice from either of these characters .
The same could be said for Beck 's political advice .
And anyone who watches Fox News deserves what they get anyway .

See PETA 's paperwork
According to Newkirk 's figures , year after year PETA has killed more animals than 80 % of the animal control shelters in the State of Virginia .
1
In 2003 the Norfolk SPCA found adoptive homes for 73 percent of its animals .
The Virginia Beach SPCA adopted out 66 percent .
The same year PETA could only manage 14 percent .
Note the steady increase in the rate of PETA 's killing since 1998 .
And these are just the deaths PETA admits to .
The accuracy of this data came into question the instant PETA was caught red - handed killing animals that it promised to adopt out and hiding the dead bodies in other people 's dumpsters in the middle of the night .
NEWKIRK PEDDLES PETA'S KILL SKILLS TO POUNDS
Newkirk 's killing spree does n't stop there .
For years Newkirk has been hawking PETA as killers - for - hire to pounds throughout the state .
Instead of using its annual budget of $ 29,000,000 to negotiate a better life for these animals , Newkirk has been offering to do the pound 's killing for them in her ' softer and gentler ' way .
Just how many kittens and puppies she 's responsible for killing may never be known .
Newkirk Opposes No-Kill Sheltering
Newkirk staunchly opposes a no-kill goal despite an avalanche of worldwide supporters including several dozen shelters in PETA 's home state which have adopted the philosophy .
In 2005 PETA came out with a scathing cover article on why no-kill shelters wo n't work and says its supporters ' have no clue ' .
In 2000 Newkirk told a reporter : " It sounds lovely if you 're naive .
We could become a no-kill shelter immediately .
It means we would n't do as much work . "
If by ' work ' she means killi ng , many would agree .
Reportedly PETA has been quite busy rounding up thousands of animals statewide from vet offices , pounds , rescues and guardians ; leaving each group with the indelible impression the donated animals would be adopted ; then procuring and warehousing enough chemicals to kill thousands ; and finally , disposing of all those bodies without anyone catching on .....
The latter was probably the most challenging task for a notorious organization that for decades has been vehemently protesting the killing of animals at anyone else 's hand .
Some dead bodies presumably wound up in a huge freezer , which cost PETA $ 9,370 according to a tax return .
( What else would vegans do with a walk - in freezer ? )
Others mysteriously popped up in commercial dumpsters at shopping centers .
Each known drop was on a Wednesday in the wee - hours , about 30 carcasses per load , the bodies always encased in heavy - duty black plastic bags .
These regular ' deliveries ' were first noticed 18 - months ago .
Newkirk has doggedly defended PETA 's killing to date .
But the question begs : if she truly believes her killing is justified , why the wee - hour dumping and the cover up ?
PETA Endorses Trapping and Killing Feral Cats
Killing seems to be a continuing theme at PETA .
Apparently death is Newkirk 's " all - sizes - fit - one " solution for stray cats as well .
PETA publishes instructions encouraging the public to end their misery by trapping them and disposing of them at the neighborhood pound where they are almost certain to die .
The manual reads , " Please do not allow the prospect of euthanasia to deter you from trapping cats . "
Newkirk ignores the long - standing practice of TNR or TNRM - Trapping , Neutering , Releasing and Monitoring .
This allows cats to live unfettered outdoors for years with the help of human caregivers who provid e food and medical treatment including spay and neuter .
In September 2003 , PETA battled local rescuers to block a neuter / return program proposed to the city of Newport News .
1 PETA is the last major animal advocacy group in the U.S. that overtly opposes TNR feral cat control and no-kill sheltering .
1 NEWKIRK ACCUSED OF KILLING CAT COLONIES SUPERVISED BY RESCUES
In March 1998 , Animal People published an allegation of Norfolk cat - rescuer , John Newton .
He claimed that for three years ' a hit squad , ' led initially by Newkirk , trapped colonies of cats they knew were being cared for by rescue Meower Power and took many to their deaths at kill pounds .

THE STAKE - OUT after entering the van .
The dead animals found on June 15 came from at least three sources - where each were led to believe PETA was saving the day by helping to find homes for the adoptable .
Bertie County Manager Zee Lamb said he believed the animals were being taken for evaluation and " the ones that were adoptable would be adopted , " and euthanasia would be only a last resort .
Sue Gay , health director for Northampton County , said she assumed the same .
Others animals came from Northhampton County pound where Veterinarian James Brown worked .
He said he turned over many animals to PETA .
ï¿½When they started taking them , they said they would try to find homes for them , ï¿½ he told the Virginian - Pilot .
ï¿ ½Nobody ever checked on them .ï¿½
More dead came from Ahoskie Animal Hospital according to vet Patrick Proctor .
ï¿½They came to the office last Wednesday and picked up the cat and two kittens , " he told Roanoke - Chowen reporters immediately after the arrests .
" They were just kittens we were trying to find homes for .
PETA said they would do that ... So imagine my surprise when I learned they allegedly dumped dead animals in a trash bin later that same day . "
He said the animals ï¿½were in good health and were very adoptable , especially the kittens .ï¿½
Proctor was asked to examine one of the dead animals taken from the PETA crime scene .
ï¿
½The animal that I found was a very healthy six - month puppy that had been killed that day , ï¿½ he told TV station WNCT Channel 9 .
" It was a six month old lab mix and appeared to be in very , very good shape ... and he had received some type of injection in his front right leg , " he said .
ï¿½PETA will never pick up another animal from my practice .ï¿½
Since 2001 , PETA has taken animals from shelters in Bertie , Hertford and Northampton counties and the town of Windsor .
No one knows how many of those were killed by PETA or dumped in trash cans .
Read about 220 more dead animals found in trash bags , infra .
PETA APOLOGIZES FOR ILLEGAL DUMPING , BUT NOT FOR KILLING HEALTHY ANIMALS
PETA issued apologies after the criminal acts but these were limited to the dumping of the bodies in someone else 's dumpster .
No apology was given for killing adoptable kittens , puppies and small dogs .
David Harrell , who manages the store where the animals were dumped , received a letter from Newkirk apologizing and offering money , stating , " If it is true , as it appears , that our staff members have done this , PETA owes you a huge apology .
Such conduct is hideous and absolutely violates PETA policy .
Although the case is pending , I would like to pay for any expenses that you might have incurred in dealing with body disposal or related matters .
Please let me have a bill for that and I will see that it is promptly attended to . "
1 PETA issued another apology limited to the dumping of the bodies on August 15 , 2005 in response to an article on the PETA arrests by Randy Cassingham of This is True : " A terrible mistake was made with the dead bodies , but no secret was made of the fact that PETA euthanizes animals and that the animals retrieved from the pounds would be provided with a humane death . "
But veterinarians and animal control officers disagreed .
They told police PETA workers promised to find homes for the animals rather than euthanize them .
The grand jury apparently did not buy PETA 's version .
Criminal indictments were handed down charging PETA staff members with obtaining animals under false pretenses .

HUNDREDS MORE DEAD BODIES IN DUMPSTERS !
The Ahoskie dumping on June 15 , 2005 was not an isolated incident .
Harrell said over a period of 18 months , dead animals were found on a regular basis in Ahoskie dumpsters , apparently dumped in the wee hours on Wednesdays .
In every instance , the bodies were inside industrial - strength black bags .
1 Harrell told a Norfolk television station , " They just slung the doors [ open ] and started throwing dogs ... beautiful cats .
I saw a [ dead ] beagle last week that was pregnant ... last week it was 23 or 24 dogs ... it 's happened to us nine times ... they drove straight from there , straight here , and disposed of the dogs in 30 seconds . "
Inquiring minds are asking :
Where else were bodies dumped that have yet to be discovered ?
70 ADDITIONAL DEAD ANIMALS DISCOVERED !
A few days after the arrests , officials in Greenville , North Carolina told WNCT -TV
News they found in excess of 70 dead animals that could possibly be linked to PETA .
They are in addition to the bodies found in grocery dumpsters .
150 MORE EUTHANIZED DOGS FOUND IN TRASH BAGS IN VIRGINIA !
Just prior to the June , 2005 PETA arrests , an eerily similar event occurred .
On April 8 , 2005 MSNBC reported that 150 euthanized dogs were found in industrial - strength trash bags in PETA'S home state .
A construction worker made the grisly discovery on a remote road outside of Gate City .
The bags contained various breeds , including Rottweilers , German shepherds , Labradors and a few small - breed dogs .
Sheriffï¿½s investigator Chris Holder said , ï¿ ½I ï¿½ve never seen anything like it .
It looks like a deliberate dumping .ï¿½ 1 Just the tip of the iceberg ?
GUARDIANS WHO GAVE PETA THEIR PETS THOUGHT THEY WOULD GET ADOPTED
A former PETA employee told a reporter : " a teary - eyed man showed up at PETA headquarters one day with his beloved pet rabbit .
The man had grown old and sick and was no longer able to care properly for his friend .
He supplied a cage , bed , toys , and even vet records for this pet .
He was assured by PETA workers that they would take " good care " of his rabbit and find him a home .
The man left distraught but no doubt believing that his friend would be able to live out the rest of his life in a loving , compassionate home ... PETA workers carried him to the ' death house ' immediately and ended his life ! "
The employee said there are many similar examples .
1 Former director of Norfolk 's SPCA , Dana Cheek , wrote " I often receive phone calls from frantic people who have surrendered their pets to PETA with the understanding that PETA will " find them a good home ... Little do they know that the pets are killed in the PETA van before they even pull away from the pet owner 's home . "
RESCUES FEAR THE WORST FOR ANIMALS THEY GAVE TO PETA TO ADOPT
The recent arrests have local rescues frantic with worry about the animals they gave PETA .
In 2008 a Danish court ruled in favor of the IFPI , and ordered the ISP Tele2 / Telenor to block all access to The Pirate Bay .
Now a petition from the ISP against the decision has been accepted , which will see the appeal go Supreme Court .
A Danish appeals body has accepted a petition from Telenor to take a High Court decision ordering it to block The Pirate Bay , to the Supreme Court .
“ We are pleased that we now have the opportunity to find out whether it is Internet Service Providers responsibility to ensure the closure of a website , ” said Telenor ’s regulatory chief Nicholai Kramer Pfeiffer .
Referring to the court ’s decision last year ordering it to block the world ’s largest tracker , Pfeiffer added , “ We have always been highly skeptical when we receive subpoenas in this type of case . ”
Pfeiffer told Computerworld that he believes taking the case to the Supreme Court will result in a clearer picture for those dealing with these types of cases ( blocking sites ) in the future .
“ We seek a clarification of whether we have a responsibility to help the stuff flowing through our networks , as we have no commercial interest in the individual sites , ” said Pfeiffer .
Pfeiffer also said that it makes “ good sense ” to get as close as possible to the source of a problem .
Indeed , if the Swedish authorities could close down The Pirate Bay , then there would be no need for Telenor to block anything at all , since there would be nothing to block .
Earlier this year Pirate Bay ’s Peter Sunde told TorrentFreak that they are seriously considering suing the IFPI for unfair competition .
“ They have had a monopoly on distribution and we ’re breaking that monopoly , and in turn they sue people that allow access to our distribution method , ” he told us at the time .
The IFPI is not scared of yet another confrontation .
“ Peter Sunde is welcome to sue us , ” Jesper Bay , the head of the Danish IFPI said when the news was announced .
Ironically , one of the websites explaining how to get around the Danish blockade carries Jesper Bay ’s name .
Jose Luis Coca was cooking tacos on a corner of Insurgentes , one of the main roads into central Tijuana , when the shooting began .
Four carloads of gangsters , with AR15 assault rifles , opened fire on a rival gang gathered in front of his stall .
Within minutes , 400 rounds had racketed the night sky , and 16 people lay dead or dying .
Mr Coca survived by lying face down on the pavement , and crossing his fingers .
His taco stand still bears witness to the lucky escape , eight bullet holes in its pockmarked frame .
" One missed my head by maybe 10 centimetres , " he says .
" It went so close I could feel it .
Every day since , I thank God for protecting me . "
That was in September .
Since then , Mr Coca has done an awful lot of thanking God .
In November , two men were murdered outside a seafood restaurant 100 yards away , this time in daylight .
Last month , he saw the driver of a Ford Explorer dragged from his vehicle at the local traffic lights , frogmarched to the nearby river , and dispatched with a single shot to the back of the head .

Such tales have become common in Tijuana , a ramshackle border city on the front line of a bloody drug war sweeping Mexico 's northern frontier .
Violence between rival groups of organised criminals has been bubbling there for years , but has now reached epidemic levels .
To the consternation of the world , a staggering 6,500 people were murdered in Mexico last year , including hundreds of soldiers and policemen .
Many of the dead have been decapitated , or publicly tortured .
Hundreds of innocent bystanders , like Mr Coca , have been caught in the crossfire .
" I 've been working this spot for 20 years , " he says .
" Lately , I 've learned not to mess with anybody .
When people come here drunk , and ask for free food , I just say , ' OK , you can pay next time ' .
You get into an argument with these guys , they 'll just kill you .
This is the reality of life now : say the wrong thing to the wrong person , and you 're a dead man . "
The violence has left Mexico , a nation that boasts the world 's twelfth largest economy , in danger of being declared a " failed state " .
Tourism , one of its largest industries , has collapsed .
Whole regions are under the control of drug cartels , and hobbled by rampant corruption .
Two months ago , the US Joint Forces Command declared that , after Pakistan , it was the world 's most likely nation to suffer a " rapid and sudden collapse " .
Last week , President Barack Obama had a request from the Texas Governor , Rick Perry , to station National Guard troops along the border .
On Friday , the Secretary of State , Hillary Clinton , said she was planning an urgent diplomatic visit , to discuss the soaring violence with the government of President Felipe Calderon .
Barry McCaffery , a former " drug tsar " for Bill Clinton , said : " The dangerous and worsening problems ... fundamentally threaten US national security .
We can not afford to have a ' narco state ' as a neighbour . "
Tijuana 's problems stem from an accident of geography .
A sprawling , seedy , and crowded city jammed up against the US border at the top of Baja Mexico , it represents prime real estate for anyone wishing to smuggle some of the 350 metric tonnes of cocaine that find their way into the United States each year .
Since 2006 , rival gangs have been battling for control of these drug routes .
They are well - funded – the cocaine industry in the US is worth $ 5.5 bn ( £ 3.9 bn ) a year – ruthless , and care little for human life .
More than 800 people were killed on the streets of Tijuana last year , from a population of 1.5 million .
This gave the city a worse murder rate than Baghdad .
The killings are often sickening .
A few weeks back , the decapitated heads of three policemen were left in an icebox by the side of a road .
Days earlier , police near Tijuana had arrested Santiago Meza , a local drug baron's " fixer " known as El Pozolero [ " The Soupmaker " ] .
He confessed to having dissolved more than 300 murder victims in acid over nine years .

" In the past , the gangs had rules , " says Victor Clark Alfaro , a local human rights lawyer .
" They respected families .
They did n't kill children .
But those rules have changed .
Now they do n't respect anything .
They 'll kill anybody , and decapitate them , or cut the body , to send a message to society . "
The breakdown in law and order stems from the 1980s and 1990s , when the US launched a crackdown on Colombian drug cartels , allowing Mexican syndicates to emerge in their place .
Soon these groups controlled almost nine - tenths of America 's entire supply of cocaine from South America .
For many years , Mexico 's cartels were largely left to get on with business , on the basis that they killed only their own kind .
But the arrival of multi-party democracy to in 2000 – for 70 years , Mexico had been a one - party state – led to government crackdowns on their trade .
These had some success .
The Arellano Felix cartel , which for years controlled a north - west portion of the country , has lost most of its leaders , including , most recently , Eduardo Arellano Felix , one of the seven brothers who founded the organisation .
He was captured in October , after a shootout at a house overlooking the city , which last week was still derelict , and riddled in bullet holes .
Unfortunately , when you arrest one drug baron , you do not kill off the trade .
Instead , you create a vacancy , and a turf war .
Most of the recent violence across Mexico , and in Tijuana in particular , has involved remnants of the Arellano Felix cartel battling rivals from the so - called Sinaloa syndicate , and Gulf Cartel , both keen to move in on the patch .
The impact of this war is visible throughout Tijuana , where army units patrol the streets day and night , and civilians think twice about venturing out after dark .
In almost every neighbourhood , gangland territories are marked by shoes dangling from electricity wires hanging across streets .
" Three shoes stands for ' El Teo ' , who is from the Sinaloa family , " says Jorge Ramos , a security guard at a bank outside the city 's notorious red - light district .
" Five means ' Felix ' .
Seven stands for ' Sinoloa ' .
You learn to read the signs .
Ending up on the wrong street can mean trouble . "
Efforts to halt the violence are not helped by rampant police corruption .
The cartels , with their 2,500 per cent profit margins , are not short of bribe cash .
Forbes magazine revealed that Joaquin " El Chapo " Guzman , head of the Sinaloa cartel and Mexico 's most wanted man , was worth a cool $ 1bn , making him 701st in its league of the world 's richest men .
Local politicians describe Tijuana 's police as institutionally corrupt .
" I 'm firing about 400 of my 1,600 police officers , " the city 's mayor , Jose Reyes , said in a recent documentary , Narco War Next Door .
" They failed a lie - detector test in which we specifically asked if they were involved in corruption related to organised crime . "
Violence is also fuelled by a flow of guns and ammunition over the border from the US , from states such as Texas , where assault weapons can be sold to anyone passing a rudimentary background check .
In a desperate effort to stem the tide , one of the army bases in central Tijuana offers to exchange illegal firearms for money or food , no questions asked .
And while the US consumers created the market for the drugs that has caused this war , US politicians are also unwittingly providing many of its footsoldiers .
Every day , buses arrive in Tijuana carrying hundreds of illegal immigrants , rounded up for deportation from America .
Impoverished and desperate , many are immediately recruited by cartels .
" These people have nothing to lose , " says Victor Clark Alfaro , who works with deportees .
" They speak English , and many were in gangs in the US , so they know the business of drugs and they have contacts on the US side , so they become a cheap labour force for organised crime . "
It is not as if Tijuana is exactly brimming with other opportunities .
Though only 25 of the city 's 800 - odd murder victims last year were classed as innocent bystanders , the US State Department has advised its citizens against travelling south of the border .
US Marines at Camp Pendleton , a base north of San Diego , are banned from crossing the border on leave .
This has crippled the local economy , which for years relied on free - spending Americans visiting to stock up on cheap liquor and pharmaceuticals .
In Rosalito Beach , a resort containing a seedy mixture of tattoo parlours , hotels , and chemists , the streets are deserted , despite the imminent " Spring Break " which normally brings tens of thousands of visitors .
" This is my livelihood , " says Christian Roza , owner of Dulceria Ayala , a sweet store .
" It 's safe in this town .
Look at the place .
Have you seen anyone killed here ? "
The Mexican government insists that it is winning the war on drugs , and is deeply critical of what it sees as sensationalist reporting by Western media and governments .
President Felipe Calderon condemned Forbes for including " El Chapo " in its rich - list .
" Magazines are not only attacking and lying about the situation in Mexico , but also praising criminals , " he said .
But Mr Calderon 's best hope may lie in simple economics .
" Wars are expensive , " says Bruce Bagley , an expert on drug - trafficking from the University of Miami .
" The violence has made it more costly to run drugs over the Mexican border , so more cocaine is coming through Haiti or Dominican Republic or Puerto Rico .
Mexico's share of the market is down from 90 per cent to nearer 65 per cent . "
Dr Bagley believes the drug war has three possible outcomes .
" Either one cartel emerges and takes over everything , with the government turning a form of blind eye .
Or there 'll be an internal agreement between cartels to stop fighting .
Or the cocaine industry totally atomises with drugs entering the US from different routes . "
Whatever the ending , for Mexico 's tourist guides and taco - stall owners alike , it can not come soon enough .

China boosted its gold reserves by 76 percent since 2003 and has the world ’s fifth - biggest holding by country , said Hu Xiaolian , head of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange .
The nation increased its reserves by 454 tons to 1,054 tons through domestic purchases and refining scrap metal , Hu said in an interview with the Xinhua News Agency today .
The amount is more than Switzerland ’s 1,040 tons , World Gold Council data show , and is worth $ 31 billion at current prices .
China has the world ’s largest foreign exchange reserves at $ 1.95 trillion as of March 31 , according to state administration data .
The holdings have climbed about sixfold in the past six years as the country had record trade surpluses and inflows of foreign investment .
Gold prices have almost tripled to more than $ 900 an ounce from $ 337 .
“ Chinese foreign - exchange reserves have absolutely exploded in the past few years , ” said Jan Lambregts , head of Asia research at Rabobank International in Hong Kong .
“ We should n’t be surprised that they ’re adding a lot of all asset classes .
I do n’t think they ’re shifting away from U.S. dollars into gold . ”
Gold climbed to a record $ 1,032.70 an ounce on March 17 last year and traded 0.9 percent higher today at $ 912.08 an ounce at 3:18 p.m. local time in Singapore .

GAZA  Israeli troops and tanks massed along the Gaza border and the government said it had called up reserves for a possible ground operation , as the death toll increased to nearly 300 after Israeli aircraft pounded Gaza for a second day on Sunday .
The continued strikes , which Israel said were in retaliation for sustained rocket fire from Gaza into its territory , unleashed a furious reaction across the Arab world , raising fears of greater instability in the region .
Much of the anger was also directed at Egypt , seen by Hamas and some nearby governments as having acceded to Israel ’s military action by sealing its border with Gaza and forcing back many Palestinians at gunpoint who were trying to escape the destruction .
Witnesses at the Rafah border crossing described a chaotic scene as young men tried to force their way across into Egypt , amid sporadic exchanges of gunfire between Hamas and Egyptian forces .
Egyptian state television reported that one Egyptian border guard was killed by a Hamas gunman .
A Palestinian man was killed by an Egyptian guard near Rafah , Reuters reported .

In Gaza , officials said medical services , stretched to the breaking point after 18 months of Israeli sanctions , were on the verge of collapse as they struggled to care for the more than 600 people wounded in two days .
At Shifa Hospital in Gaza City , women wailed as they searched for relatives among bodies that lay strewn on the hospital floor .
One doctor said that given the dearth of facilities , not much could be done for the seriously wounded , and that it was “ better to be brought in dead . ”
The International Committee of the Red Cross appealed on Sunday for urgent humanitarian assistance , including medical supplies , to be allowed to enter Gaza .
Israeli officials said that some aid had been allowed in through one of the crossings .
Egypt temporarily opened the Rafah crossing on Saturday to allow some of the wounded to be taken to Egyptian hospitals .
Israel made a strong push to justify the attacks , saying it was forced into military action to defend its citizens .
At the same time , the supreme religious leader of Iran and the leader of Hezbollah expressed strong support for Hamas .

Across Gaza , families huddled indoors as Israeli jets streaked overhead .
Residents said that there were long blackouts and that they had no cooking gas .
Some ventured out to receive bread rations at bakeries or to brave the streets to claim their dead at the hospitals .
There were few mass funerals ; rather , families buried the victims in small ceremonies .
At dusk on Sunday , Israeli fighter jets bombed over 40 tunnels along Gaza ’s border with Egypt .
The Israeli military said that the tunnels , on the Gaza side of the border , were used for smuggling weapons , explosives and fugitives .
Gazans also use many of them to import consumer goods and fuel in order to get around the Israeli - imposed economic blockade .
In the first two days of the operation Israeli jets destroyed at least 30 targets in Gaza , including the main security compound and prison in Gaza City known as the Saraya , metal workshops throughout Gaza that were suspected of manufacturing rockets , and Hamas military posts .
Hamas said Israel bombed a government ministry compound and the Islamic University in Gaza , a stronghold of Hamas , late Sunday night .
The Hamas - owned television station Al Aqsa was also struck , as was a mosque that the Israeli military said was being used as a terrorist base .

On Monday , Israeli warplanes bombed the Hamas - run Interior Ministry , Reuters reported , based on a Hamas statement .
Israel appeared to be settling in for a longer haul .
The government on Sunday approved the emergency call - up of thousands of army reservists in preparation for a possible ground operation as Israeli troops , tanks , armored personnel carriers and armored bulldozers massed at the border .
Speaking before the weekly cabinet meeting in Jerusalem , Israel ’s defense minister , Ehud Barak , said the army “ will deepen and broaden its actions as needed ” and “ will continue to act . ”
Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said Israel ’s goal was not to reoccupy Gaza , which it left unilaterally in 2005 , but to “ restore normal life and quiet to residents of the south ” of Israel .
Tzipi Livni , Israel ’s foreign minister , appeared on American talk shows to press Israel ’s case .
She said on “ Fox News Sunday ” that the operation “ is needed in order to change the realities on the ground , and to give peace and quiet to the citizens in southern Israel . ”

Militants in Gaza fired barrages of rockets and mortar shells the farthest yet into Israel on Sunday .
One rocket fell in Gan Yavneh , a village near the major port city of Ashdod , almost 20 miles north of Gaza .
Two landed in the coastal city of Ashkelon .
Several Israelis were wounded .
Fawzi Barhoum , a spokesman for Hamas , told reporters that Israel had started a “ war ” but that it would not be able to choose how it would end .
He called for revenge in the form of strikes reaching “ deep into the Zionist entity using all means , ” including suicide attacks .
The hundreds of thousands of Israeli citizens now within rocket range have been instructed by the authorities to stay close to protected spaces .
In Lebanon , the leader of the Shiite militant group Hezbollah , Sheik Hassan Nasrallah , put his fighters on alert , expressing strong support for Hamas and saying that he believed Israel might try to wage a two - front war , as it did in 2006 .
He called for a mass demonstration in Beirut on Monday .
And he , too , denounced Egypt ’s leaders .
“ If you do n’t open the borders , you are accomplices in the killing , ” he said in a televised speech .

Iran ’s supreme religious leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , condemned the silence of some Arab countries , which he said had prepared the grounds for the “ catastrophe , ” an Iranian news agency , ISNA , reported .
“ The horrible crime of the Zionist regime in Gaza has once again revealed the bloodthirsty face of this regime from disguise , ” he said in a statement .
“ But worse than this catastrophe is the encouraging silence of some Arab countries who claim to be Muslim , ” he said , apparently in a reference to Egypt and Jordan .
Egypt has mediated talks between Israel and the Palestinians and between Hamas and Hamas ’s rival , Fatah , leaving it open to criticism that it is too willing to work with Israel .
In turn , Egypt and other Western - allied Sunni Arab nations are deeply opposed to Hezbollah and Hamas , which they see as extensions of Iran , their Shiite nemesis .
Across the region , the Israeli strikes were being broadcast in grisly detail almost continually on Arab satellite networks .
TUCSON — Drug smugglers parked a car transport trailer against the Mexican side of the border one day in December , dropped a ramp over the security fence , and drove two pickup trucks filled with marijuana onto Arizona soil .
As Border Patrol agents gave chase , a third truck appeared on the Mexican side and gunmen sprayed machine - gun fire over the fence at the agents .
Smugglers in the first vehicles torched one truck and abandoned the other , with $ 1 million worth of marijuana still in the truck bed .
Then they vaulted back over the barrier into Mexico ’s Sonora state .
Despite huge enforcement actions on both sides of the Southwest border , the Mexican marijuana trade is more robust — and brazen — than ever , law enforcement officials say .
Mexican drug cartels routinely transported industrial - size loads of marijuana in 2008 , excavating new tunnels and adopting tactics like ramp - assisted smuggling to get their cargoes across undetected .
But these are not the only new tactics : the cartels are also increasingly planting marijuana crops inside the United States in a major strategy shift to avoid the border altogether , officials said .
Last year , drug enforcement authorities confiscated record amounts of high potency plants from Miami to San Diego , and even from vineyards leased by cartels in Washington State .
Mexican drug traffickers have also moved into hydroponic marijuana production — cannabis grown indoors without soil and nourished with sunlamps — challenging Asian networks and smaller , individual growers here .

James Agee ’s Let Us Now Praise Famous Men ( 1941 ) opened a whole , huge space for considering and pursuing documentary writing that owes more to what we will term the documentary impulse than it does to the genre of the documentary .
Whereas the genre of documentary has grown in the last 60 years or so out of newspaper , magazine , radio , and tv journalism , the documentary impulse seems present in a huge array of literary and other art that is not bound , as journalism is , to the supposedly objective representation of the “ facts . ”
In some ways , the documentary impulse may be considered a method for documenting the huge array of experiences that are , for various reasons , problematic to journalism , and to journalism ’s conception of a knowable , objective reality .
That Agee – a journalist – grappled with these ideas is clear from the first pages of Let Us Now Praise Famous Men ; and for this reason his and Walker Evans ’ text seems a valuable foundation for our consideration of What May Be Documented and how Art and Artistic structures become necessary – ( and may be the only / best means ) for this sort of documentation .
Our goals then , in this class , circumvent attempts to define what it and is not documentary art .
Instead , we will look at a variety of texts for what they may teach us about representing oftentimes hidden phenomena in the world around us .
SAN FRANCISCO 
Some might look across this city 's rolling hills with its waves of roofs and see some of America 's priciest real estate .
Trevor Paque saw virgin farmland .
He calls his enterprise , MyFarm , a " decentralized urban farm . "
His aim is to turn San Francisco 's under-used , overgrown backyards into verdant plots of green that will provide organically grown food for the city 's residents .
Since May , Paque , 29 , has planted half an acre of vegetables if you add up all 55 gardens that his farmers have sown .
He hopes that the 150 or so families his enterprise will be feeding by spring will represent the dawn of a new age of local foods in even the biggest cities .
" This is revolutionary , really one of the coolest things I 've heard in a long time , " says Dan Sullivan of the Rodale Institute , which has been teaching about organic agriculture since 1947 .
For time - starved residents , MyFarm is a way to get organic produce grown steps from their kitchen without having to touch a trowel .
For yardless neighbors , it lets them effectively buy a share of their neighbors ' gardens .
" It 's turning grass into productive landscape , and it's not only feeding the people who own the grass , but feeding other people who want locally raised organic food , " Sullivan says .
And what gardens they are .
MyFarm has been building two to five a week since Paque tipped the first bucket of mulch five months ago .
Its crew of farmers shows up by bicycle , towing trailers of shovels , rakes and an irrigation system .
It was late September when the farmers pedaled up to the home of Craig Tiballi , 34 , and Annabrook Temple , 35 , on Potrero Hill , just before their order of three cubic yards of organic composted soil arrived by truck .
It was dumped in the street , and the four farmers began a three - hour bucket brigade to carry the mountain of dirt through the basement and into the backyard .
There they carefully spread a 6 - inch layer , leaving small pathways from which MyFarm 's farmers can get to each plant .
The couple have a 1 - year - old son , Reno , and Temple loves the idea of growing organic foods for him in their admittedly untended yard .
That 's the selling point to many customers , says MyFarm 's operations manager , Chris Burley , 26 .
" We can make a backyard a productive space and a beautiful space , and a place that actually grows healthy food for you and your kids . "
By late afternoon , what had been a 128 - square - foot area of hard - packed dirt had become a planting bed with a timer - based drip irrigation system .
Three weeks later , " it 's thriving .
It 's pretty incredible how much it 's grown , " Temple says .
Their farmer , Matthew Lowe , comes once a week to maintain it .
Last week for the first time he left them " a big bag of baby greens " for salads or sautéing .
They were , Temple says , " delicious . "
MyFarm charges customers $ 800 to $ 1,200 to install the garden .
Then for a weekly fee that varies according to the size of the plot , a gardener weeds , tends and harvests the garden , leaving the owner with a week 's worth of vegetables .
There are similar services out there .
In Portland , Ore. , Portland Organic Gardens installs organic vegetable gardens and does weekly maintenance at a cost of $ 90 to $ 130 a week .
In Charlotte , Instant Organic Garden has put in 150 gardens in two years .
Sun , soil , space
What makes Paque 's venture different is that he sees all the gardens as merely components of one large farm .
Local real estate agent Howard Reinstein of Prudential estimates that if it were all contiguous , the half an acre of land would sell for about $ 1 million .
Paque 's plan is to take that land and use it to create what 's called a CSA , for Community Supported Agriculture .
CSAs are one of the hottest trends in farming , says Ed Wells , chairman of the Environmental Studies Department at Wilson College in Chambersburg , Pa .
The school 's Robyn Van En Center is the nation 's largest research group on the trend .
In a CSA , a farmer sells shares of his or her harvest to a group of customers in a nearby town , providing each with a weekly box of whatever 's in season , delivered to the customer 's door or a nearby location for pickup .
The farmer gets paid in advance , and the customers get local , fresh , seasonal food — and a relationship with the person who grew it .
MyFarm combines these two innovations — outsourcing vegetable gardening and CSAs — to get something new .
When the MyFarm farmer comes to evaluate a potential yard , he or she does three things : estimates how much sun it gets ; tests the soil for lead and other toxins ; and measures how big a plot it can support .
If there 's not enough sun , dirty soil or less than 16 square feet , they say thanks but no thanks .
If there 's sun , soil and space , they put in as big a garden as they can .
My Farm plants by the box size .
A 4 - by - 4 - foot garden will produce a box of vegetables a week for one family .
Gardens range from 4 - by - 4 to 12 - by - 12 - feet , enough for three families ' vegetables a week .
The more extra produce a yard grows , over and above the owners ' needs , the less they will pay for weekly upkeep .
It 's that extra capacity , above and beyond what the person living there can eat , that will provide the vegetables for the CSA that MyFarm hopes to have running in the spring .
The MyFarm CSA has sold 50 shares for the spring so far and is on track to sell out by the new year , Burley says .
A share that provides a box of vegetables for one person a week costs $ 25 and $ 35 for two , a cost comparable to other local CSAs .
But instead of the food being trucked in from farms 50 and 100 miles outside of San Francisco , it 's bicycled over from gardens within a mile or so of the CSA member 's house .
MyFarm 's mission resonated with Anne Fisher Vollen , 44 , who is raising two children , ages 9 and 12 .
" I joke that the only thing more neglected than my husband is my backyard , " she says .
Now that formerly unproductive swath of dirt is home to a flourishing garden .
On a brisk autumn day , her gardener , Max Goldstein , stopped by on his bike , weeded , dug up some zucchini that had gotten out of hand and harvested chard , escarole , tomatillos , corn , lettuce and Jerusalem artichokes .
Her daughter , " a really picky eater , " says the backyard broccoli " just tastes better , " Fisher Vollen says .
That special taste , true freshness , is something people will pay a little more for once they 're exposed to it , says John Ikerd , a professor emeritus of agricultural economics at the University of Missouri - Columbia and expert on sustainability and small farms .
" After a few years of that , you do n't want to eat stuff out of the grocery store .
It just does n't taste as good , " he says .
Preparing for winter
As fall days cool and shorten , the MyFarm farmers are turning their plots to winter mode .
Although it 's possible to grow gardens year - round in San Francisco , its first year out , MyFarm wants to work on building up the soil .
So the farmers will be hoeing under plants in the coming weeks , planting perennials and putting in soil - enhancing cover crops such as vetch and fava beans for the winter .
Over the winter they 'll expand beyond vegetables , putting in herb gardens and fruit trees during the wet months .
Though what grows in San Francisco is going to be different from what will work in Memphis or Dubuque , Iowa , the basic concept is n't .
And MyFarm 's staff wants that concept to spread faster than dandelions on a summer 's day .
Calls have come in from Chicago , Portland , Washington , San Diego , Los Angeles , Nashville , Minneapolis , Australia and the United Kingdom with requests for information .
The MyFarm staff is putting together a business manual , so no one else has to reinvent this particular wheel .
" We want to be able to offer consulting to individuals in other areas so they can learn from our experience , " Burley says .
Neighbors come together
Michelle Mammini , 65 , knew that her Italian mother - in - law used to feed the family from the garden in back of their house in San Francisco 's Marina district .
But she was n't quite up to it herself , so she called around to landscapers to help get her started .
" I said I wanted herbs and flowers , and the plans I got back were all grass and trees , " she says .
She read about MyFarm in the local newspaper and called .
Paque put in the garden on Aug. 6 and within three weeks she was getting radishes and lettuce .
By Sept. 18 , a cornucopia of vegetables was growing , including Chinese cabbage , fava beans , arugula , several types of kale and mustard greens , broccoli , carrots , beets and peas .
The weekly basket has taught her and her husband to eat things she had n't known about before .
" I 'd never cooked mustard greens or kale before .
Now I steam them , cook them with garlic .
They 're quite tasty , " she says .
Having someone else think about staggering the plantings is also wonderful , she says .
" I 've gardened for years , and my least - favorite part was harvesting , because everything is ripe at once and it's too much . "
As Goldstein works , Mammini 's next - door neighbor , Brock Benson , 32 , leans over the fence to take a look .
Soon they 're talking animatedly about different kinds of peas , and she brings a double handful for him to taste and take home .
That , too , is part of Paque 's vision : " We can use food to get people to know each other . "
He 's already hatching plans to get neighbors whose farms are near each other to have a harvest dinner together , featuring foods grown in their own backyards .

The British Isles apparently are n't big enough for two altruistic acts .
Last night , on the third night of a weeklong residency on the Late Show With David Letterman , U2's The Edge proved that the No. 1 reason to read out the Top 10 list is the opportunity to call out a fellow righteous rocker , going off the teleprompter script to smack down lovingly reference tantric musicman Sting .
In addition to improving tenfold the original joke , The Edge 's appropriately edgy ad lib also earned the approval of Letterman himself , who told the rocker during the obligatory handshake portion of the segment , " Very funny . "
" I like that ! " he announced after the barb .
Sting , on the other hand , might not .

Jacob T. Schwartz , a mathematician and computer scientist who did seminal research in fields as diverse as molecular biology and robotics , died Monday at his home in Manhattan .
He was 79 .
He died in his sleep of liver cancer , his wife , Diana , said .
He was chairman of the computer science department at New York University , which he founded , from 1964 to 1980 .
During a career that also included 42 years as a professor at the Courant Institute for Mathematical Sciences at the university , Dr. Schwartz wrote more than a dozen books and more than 100 scientific papers and research reports .
At his death Dr. Schwartz was actively working on research in both molecular biology and logic .
Throughout his life , Dr. Schwartz , who was known as Jack , moved from one scientific field to the next .
He was not a dilettante , but mastered each field in turn and then made significant contributions .
If I were a sneaky disease , working my pathological magic through mimicry , I think I 'd be vocal cord dysfunction .
What 's VCD ?
I did n't even know it existed until last week , so do n't feel embarrassed .
Also known as laryngeal dysfunction , paradoxical vocal cord motion , laryngeal dyskinesia , vocal cord malfunction and a number of medicalese terms , this tricky little guy masquerades most commonly as the everyman of respiratory conditions , asthma .
( And from the dawn of the 20th century to today , occasionally it 's diagnosed as hysteria .
It 's all in your head , person who can't breathe , it 's all in your head . )
First , a quick anatomy lesson .
Your larynx has two main functions : protect your trachea by preventing aspiration during both respiration and swallowing , andallow vocal communication ( through your vocal cords ) .
So , what is VCD ?
According to this paper , it is " a condition where the larynx exhibits paradoxical vocal cord adduction during inspiration , resulting in any of a number of symptoms that would be expected from extrathoracic airway obstruction , including , wheezing , dyspnea , cough , and shortness of breath . "
Or more clearly , " The adduction of vocal cords with an open glottic chink in a patient experiencing dyspnea .
In VCD the vocal cords adduct anteriorly from the vocal process , and the posterior glottic chink remains open .
The adduction occurs during inspiration or in both the inspiratory and expiratory phases . "
Ok , maybe not so clear .
Translation : when you breathe , your vocal cords are open ( see A in the figure ) , allowing air to pass through .
But in people with VCD , when they breathe , their vocal cords paradoxically ( hence paradoxical vocal cord motion ) constrict ( see B in the figure , encircled ) , leaving a small " chink " or diamond space that severely restricts airflow .
You can actually see the characteristic " chink " via the gold standard for diagnosis , laryngoscopy ( also called videostroboscopy ) - a physician sticks a mini telescope through your mouth or nose and asks you to talk / make sounds .
The telescope magnifies and records your vocal cords working in slow motion .
( Check out this 2 minute video of a videostroboscopy in action .
Seriously cool . ) The problem : while some physicians know about the disease , it 's often not on the tip of their tongue when someone comes in with symptoms mimicking asthma .
But you can't blame them - the symptoms are pretty much the same :
Shortness of breath
Chronic cough and / or throat clearing
Chest and / or throat tightness
difficulty inhaling ( most common )
difficulty exhaling ( less common ; usually irritant - induced )
panic , anxiety , fear of suffocating
insufficient oxygen in the blood
feeling like something is stuck in the throat
Another problem is that VCD can be associated with asthma or completely independent of it .
The overall prevalence is n't exactly clear , but estimates from a number of studies in patients previously diagnosed as asthmatic , 10 percent just had VCD , and about 30 percent have both VCD and asthma .
The condition is strongly associated with gender ( around 85 - 90 percent of patients are female ) , competitive sports and high achievement , and stress .
More problems : sometimes VCD can be secondary to underlying conditions like GERD , ALS , brainstem compression , myasthenia gravis and others .
A clue for physicians is a patient 's response to asthma medication .
A patient with asthma will respond to bronchodilators and / or steroids ; patients with VCD often will have reduced or no response .
What do we know ?
At first , not much .
But the National Jewish Medical and Research Center did some pioneering work starting in the 1980s and since then researchers have been plugging away .
An example of a study exploring misdiagnosis of VCD is Boris et al .
Allergy Asthma Proc. 2002 Mar - Apr;23(2) :133-9 .
The researchers evaluated 158 patients referred to an allergy practice with a diagnosis of asthma .
The patients were separated in four groups by their pulmonary function as assessed with flow volume loops .
32 percent had asthma alone , 16 percent had asthma and laryngeal dysfunction , 26 percent had laryngeal dysfunction alone , and 25 percent did n't meet study criteria .
The patients were treated with antireflux meds ( a common concomitant condition in asthmatics ) and inhalers .
In the laryngeal only group , 73 percent had trouble breathing in ( and 71 percent had trouble breathing out ) , compared with only 2 percent in the asthma only group ( 7 percent breathing out ) ( p < 0.0001 ) .
The
laryngeal dysfunction group only had a 29 percent beneficial response to Albuterol inhalation compared with a 92 percent response in the asthma group ( p < 0.0001 ) .
The laryngeal dysfunction group responded significantly less to both inhaled and oral steroids ( p = 0.002 ) .
A number of case studies and reviews have been published - see Ibrahim et al. , Postgrad Med J. 2007 Mar;83( 977 ) :164-72 , for a recent overview .
What can we do ?
This is the tricky part .
Unlike asthma , you can't aerosolize a therapy for VCD .
At this point we just have speech therapy and in some cases psychotherapy ( for patients whose condition is accompanied by panic attacks and hysteria ) .
Speech therapy techniques are aimed at focusing attention on exhalation and breathing with your abdomen rather than inhaling and breathing with your throat / lungs .
Relaxation techniques are important too , helping to relax the neck , shoulder and chest muscles to promote " normal " breathing .
Physician education - both educating the physician , and the physician educating the patient - is part of the management .
If you 're in or near Colorado , you 're in luck : the National Jewish Medical and Research Center is a leader in the field , both in research and treatment .

You may know the expression « peeing in your pants to keep warm » .
It means that to pee in your pants to stay warm , may be a good tactic at the moment .
But in some minutes , you will regret it , when your wet pants gets cold much quicker than they did before the peeing …
On friday the 17th of April , the record - and moviecompanies won some really wet pants .
The Judge in Stockholms tingsrett handed down a guilty verdict to the founders of The Pirate Bay , who now face a year in prison and a fine of 30 million Swedish kroner , about 3.6 million US Dollars .
The Pirate Bay appealed the decision immediately .
Read the whole verdict in Swedish here ( pdf- document ) .
The copyright holders are of course cheering , and Rick Carnes , president of the Songwriters ’ Guild of America says to Cnet News :
I would like to tell the Pirate Bay the same thing everybody has told us for the past 10 years .
They should go out and find a new business model , one that does n’t involve profiting from stolen property …
What everybody who steals music should realize is that e-looting is not a victimless crime .
Everyone who does it is hurting themselves .
They are killing the music .
Let me just start by saying that I ’m not defending The Pirate Bay .
I do n’t download other people ’s legal works , and I do n’t think others should do it either .
But I have serious problems with the tactics of the copyright holders , and I have even bigger problems understanding why the record companies , movie companies , tv stations and game companies do n’t understand how the internet has changed everything about how you do business .
And here ’s why :
1 ) They do n’t get any money
Even if The Pirate Bay lost , the money will never be paid .
There are no money to be found at The Pirate Bay , and the founders say that they would rather burn the money than pay .
The artists and the copyright holders will get no money from this trial .
2 ) Major advertising campaign for The Pirate Bay
The last few months The Pirate Bay has got almost as much PR as Obama .
Almost .
Even your grandmother now knows how bittorrent works ( see our Creative Commons licensed video about bittorrent – in Norwegian – but the graphics should tell the story even if you ca n’t decode the Norwegian .
It would be interesting to see the traffic numbers at The Pirate Bay , now that the copyright holders have decided to put a huge , bright spotlight on them .
And leaving themselves in the darkness , angering their potential customers even more :
3 ) Even more angry customers
On forums , Twitter , Facebook and blogs , people are really angry !
Some say thay as of friday 17th of April never are going to buy a single album or movie anymore .
The copyright holders are risking boycotts and even worse sales .
I think the case against The Pirate Bay is an amazingly stupid strategy , and I wonder who convinced the copyright holders to do this ?
« What if we made our customers even angrier ?
Especially the ones who are setting trends , and finding new artists ! »
4 ) Impossible to stop
A verdict in Sweden will take three to five more years , as the case needs to be tried again higher up in the court system before it is all settled .
In five years lots will have changed , and even today a ruling against The Pirate Bay would n’t mean a thing .
The Pirate Bay servers are spread all over the world already , and even they do n’t know where they rent servers .
So even if The Pirate Bay gets a verdict in Sweden , they can continue just as before .
Nothing will change .
What should have been done
I ’ve been working with marketing for years , and in marketing we often do a SWOT analysis : Strengths , Weaknesses , Opportunities , and Threats .
What is the strenght of The Pirate Bay ?
It ’s free and quite easy to use .
What is the weakness of The Pirate Bay ?
It ’s illegal to share other people ’s copyrighted works via bittorrent .
And for most people , it should be possible to make easier ways to download and use music , movies and tv than using bittorent .
What are the opportunities ?
Moving the « pirating » customers over to easy - to - use paying solutions .
What are the threats ?
Many !
Record companies could go bankrupt , people have got used to not paying , you ca n’t stop filesharing because the pirates are always a step ahead and so on .
It seems to me that the copyright holders have done a sloppy analysis .
They figured out that The Pirate Bay is free , and ran to their lawyers .
And forgot about the easy part .
The copyrights holders have to make sure that their solutions are easier to use than The Pirate Bay .
It ’s not that difficult .
To play a tune found on The Pirate Bay you have to …
– type name of tune
– download torrent file
– play
Often there are few seeders , and often there are only crappy copies .
You often spend quite some time finding stuff unless it ’s on the top list at the moment .
This can of course be done easier and better .
1 ) You CAN compete with « free »
Spotify ( Norwegian article ) is an excellent example .
Dead easy – two steps .
– type name of tune
– hit play
iTunes on the iPhone is another example .
I ’m sitting in a cafe , and hear something I like on the stereo or even from the people at the next table playing with their phones .
I ’m starting Shazam and wait 12 seconds .
It finds the tune , I click the link and end up in the iTunes store , hitting « buy » .
To minutes later I have a legally bought copy of the tune on my iPhone .
It is possible to make things easier than illegal downloads .
Try making better products and telling the world about them instead of silly campaigns comparing downloading with graveyards ( Norwegian article ) and lawyers .
Carrots , not whips .
Sit down with the telecom companies , make subscription plans where data traffic when downloading of legal music is free , so that kids do n’t have to ruin themselves just to download music via 3G / Edge when on the run .
Sit down with top designers and workflow spesialists and make suggestions for new interfaces for music – and movieshops online .
Why is it still easier for me to buy an airline ticket than a 99 cent music file ( except when I ’m using iTunes ) ?
2 ) One world – not 200 countries
The copyright holders seem to think that we still travel the Atlantic in a ocean liners run on coal .
So they operate with licences that ignore the fact that people do n’t care about countries and borders anymore .
A cool remix from Brazil ?
A catchy tune from Indonesia ?
A cool website from Australia ?
A designer making lovely stuff in Canada ?
A shoe made in Iceland ?
People do n’t get why there are tunes in Spotify I can’t hear in Norway .
Take a drive across the border to Sweden and use the WLAN in the first café .
And you can hear it !
People do n’t get why there are thousands of movies for rent in iTunes in the US , and NONE anywhere else in the world .
People do n’t get why you ca n’t see the tv-shows on YouTube outside the US , or the series on Hulu .
We have heard the excuses , but we do n’t see why it STILL is a problem .
Why is n’t this all sorted out by now ?
The internet is 20 + years , how long is it going to take ?
Why is n’t it possible to make standard contracts that make it possible to sell an artists tunes everywhere in the world , once he or she is signed to a label ?
What are young people spending the most time using on the internet ?
Social networks .
Across the world .
Not caring about whether a person is in this or that country , where he is born or where she lives .
3 ) Now .
Not in a while , but NOW .
Imagine I ’m a fan of Lost ( I ’m not , but lets pretend ) .
I read online that the latest episode is airing in the US .
Why can’t I buy shortly after it ’s aired and see it here in Norway ?
Not tomorrow , but now ?
Yes , I know about the deals the Lost producers make with tv-companies all over the world , I ’ve been working in the media for almost 20 years .
But what if I pay US$ 100 for an episode ?
I still ca n’t buy an episode .
They wo n’t let me .
They do n’t want my money .
It does n’t take three weeks for news to get across the world anymore .
We DO get to know the news in Europe the exact second they happen in the US .
Because of Twitter and other social networks the world is now truly one .
Everything is happening at the same time everywhere .
Except records , movies and games .
Colleague and good friend Eirik Solheim made a comic about « How Bob the Millionaire became a pirate » in 2005 .
It ’s still 100 % true – four years later .
The copyright holders have n’t learned a thing in 1 500 days …
I still ca n’t buy American series here in Norway , even I pay two extra digits .
I still ca n’t use iTunes or Hulu to stream movies .
I ca n’t even rent the movies from my local cable provider
Get until several weeks after they have premiered in the US .
Why is this ?
Why is it ok that I pay NOK 100 ( about 15 US Dollars ) to watch a movie at the cinema in Oslo .
But it ’s not ok to pay NOK 100 to stream it at home ?
When I ’m at the movies , there are more people and companies between me and the people who make the thing .
When I ’m at home , they get more of my money .
Why do n’t they ?
Why do I have to travel to the cinema to see it legally ?
It does n’t make sense , espacially when you know that travel makes the earth less green and I tend to fill up on unhealthy snack at the cinema …
One of NRKbetas readers , Frode Svendsen wrote a comment on another article about The Pirate Bay verdict ( in Norwegian ) .
He told about a speech by Cory Doctorow ( of Boingboing fame ) where Cory told about Valve – the game company .
They decided to launch games in Russia the same day as in the US , « zero - day » launching .
Earlier they waited 1 - 3 months when launching new games in Russia .
When they started using the « zero - day » tactic , the number of illegal copies in Russia dived .
When Britney Spears was launched in the US , it took over two weeks before her album showed up in iTunes Norway .
And by that time , the kids had downloaded it on The Pirate Bay .
We live in a time of « instant gratification » – people want their needs to be fulfilled right now .
The copyright holders may dislike this , but they ca n’t ignore it .
« Next week » and « later this summer » just does n’t cut it anymore .
Only NOW works .
Congratulations !
So congratulations to record , movies , tv- and gamecompanies .
You and your lawyers and strategy consultants just wet your pants big time .
It ’s nice and warm right now , but it will get even colder than before in a short time .
And just to clarify : I do n’t support illegal filesharing at all .
I buy my music at iTunes ( BTW , why did it get to be 2009 before DRM was removed …? ) , at amiestreet and 7digital .
I use Spotify at home when we ’re having parties , and we buy lots and lots of DVDs – which I rip and put on the computer ( with a sad heart – I ’d rather buy them as files with no DRM from someone nice ) .
I have friends that run record companies and friends that are musicians .
They see their works on The Pirate Bay and people that do n’t pay .
They suffer from illegal file sharing , and I do understand the problem this is for people who live from what they make .
But I almost go Hulk - green when I see the headless strategic work being done by the copyright holders .
They have content that people want , that people want to pay for .
But do they want to sell it to us ?
No , they do n’t .
It ’s fascinating and sad .

Lots of excellent points !

Value Added : The Nonprofit Entrepreneur
By Thomas Heath
I have been tweeting on Twitter ( my call sign is addedvalueth ) for the last two weeks , wondering why a grown - up would share mundane parts of his personal life ( " heading to sleep " ) with complete strangers on the other end of a computer or handheld .
And why anyone would want to read aforementioned drivel .
The most substantive discussion I had on this social networking site centered on the merits of Chicago - style deep dish pizza versus the flat , greasy New York pizza .
I wondered what the possible business applications of Twitter could be .
While I was wondering , I got a pitch from entrepreneur Scott Beale , who used Twitter , Facebook , Craigslist and a bunch of other Web sites to win $ 100,000 from online contests to fund his District startup .
The start - up is a non-profit .
Do n't press the snooze button yet .
Beale approached the project as if he were building the next Google .
The 33 - year - old Georgetown graduate and former U.S. State Department employee quit his $ 42,000 - a- year Foggy Bottom career three years ago and , using the same Web skills that President Obama used to raise campaign funds , built what he calls a " Peace Corps in reverse . "
His creation is Atlas Corps , which lures highly - skilled non-profit decision - makers from India and Colombia to the United States for a year , running Sept. 1 to Aug. 30 .
He concentrates on India and Colombia because he speaks the languages and because they have highly - developed non-profit sectors .
They also have a high opinion of the United States , Beale said .
He finds U.S. non-profit organizations to host the visitors ; the hosts pay $ 26,000 for the volunteers .
The idea is to help the volunteers learn U.S. non-profit management skills .
The non-profits hope to learn something from the volunteers as well .
" I 'm using entrepreneurial business skills to make a difference in the social sector , which is n't any different from using business skills to make money in the for - profit sector , " Beale said .
Atlas keeps $ 4,000 of the $ 26,000 to cover its rent and administrative costs .
It gives the rest to the Atlas " fellow , " which covers a stipend for housing , food and transportation .
Atlas covers health care too ( at a student rate of $ 800 ) .
Chief executive Beale and his company live on the cheap .
He has five staffers and sublets a tiny , windowless office space near DuPont Circle in the District .
( For its first two years , staffers worked out of their own apartments . )
Beale collects a salary in the " low $ 40s " and his five staffers split $ 120,000 a year .
He travels to New York on $ 25 - each - way buses , entertains over coffee and bagels and uses free space at Synergos , another non-profit ( sponsored by a Rockefeller heiress ) that works in the developing world .
The group currently has 12 fellows in the program , including nine in the Washington area .
Atlas also has helped send three Americans to Colombia .
When they are finished with the fellowship , participants must return to a nonprofit in their home country .
In addition to the fee Beale collects from host organizations , he has come up with another source of revenue .
This second stream reminds me of the movie about five years ago called " The Prize Winner of Defiance , Ohio , " about a 1960s woman who supported her family by winning jingle contests .
Beale has entered and won a series of online contests such as AOL mogul Steve Case 's America 's Giving Challenge and IdeaBlob , which brought in more than $ 100,000 last year .
The goal of the contests varies , but typically involves amassing the most donations of a certain size or encouraging people to register at a specific site .
To win , Beale contacts old friends from Georgetown and elsewhere , asking them to become captains and contact other friends .
The viral network is just like political bundling , where every person you contact in turn contacts five others , and they contact five others , et cetera .
To beat the big colleges at the contests , Beale timed his big push for the Christmas break , when students were home relaxing .
He asked for money on a YouTube commercial he made featuring his three - year - old nephew .
" During one contest , we had 800 people donate in the last 48 hours .
It 's just like running a campaign , " said Beale , who is working on another $ 10,000 contest right now .
Beale said the inspiration for his company came from his time in India working for the State Department .
He had an idea where people from places like India would come to the United States .
The key hurdle was visas , which allow foreigners to work in the United States but are difficult to get .
Beale figured if he could get certified by the State Department to bring non-profit workers into this country under a visa program , he would have a competitive advantage over rivals .
To find people who knew the ins and outs of visas , he advertised for employees on Web sites such as idealist.org and Craiglist.com , listing the job qualifications .
Non-profit fundraising came easy to Beal .
He is an extrovert who would routinely throw parties to raise money for charities at his Adams - Morgan apartment back in the early 1990s after graduation .
He further developed the non-profit bug while working with Ashoka , a non-profit which sponsors social entrepreneurs .
His time in the Clinton White House , where he worked as a liaison with U.S. governors , and for the State Department in India whetted his appetite for using business skills to impact social objectives instead of just turning profits .
In 2006 , an attorney friend helped him file the papers with the Internal Revenue Service to create a non-profit .
Cost : $ 500 .
To find board members and non-profit sponsors , he tapped a long list of contacts in the non-profit world and from the federal government .
Ashoka signed up to pay $ 17,000 for a fellow the first year .
At the time , Beale had a long commute .
Without a job , he was living in Bogota where his wife worked at the U.S. Embassy .
He wooed prospective donors in Washington , where he slept on friends ' couches and knocked on non-profit doors .
It was a crazy lifestyle .
He took his phone calls , whether he was in Bogota or D.C. , on a 202 - area code telephone link through Vonage .
But the craziness paid off .
Beale got $ 80,000 from Ebay founder Pierre Omidyar and $ 20,000 from DuPont Corp. to get off the ground .
" I am just like a business entrepreneur , but instead of making a big paycheck I try to make a big impact , " he said .
His competitive advantage lies in his certification from the State Department , allowing him to bring in experienced non-profit managers .
At last check , 500 people were applying for this year 's 12 positions .

This morning , The Doctors discussed different methods and hormones that can be utilized to intensify women 's orgasms .
One is a clit pump , the other is a nasal spray that shoots a hormone into the brain .
I 've tried lots of weird looking sex toys in my day , but the clit pump - which is an electronic sucking device that cups over the clitoris to engorge it with blood - looks kind of scary .
It 's supposed to be used daily as an " exercise " rather than right before sex to get in the mood , but the underlying sentiment is that it was a tool for masturbation .
The nasal spray seems a lot more interesting and possibly really helpful , particularly for peri-menopausal women suffering from lower libidos .
It 's a fast acting drug that shoots the hormone Oxytocin - which facilitates breast feeding and bonding with babies , and studies also show it is linked with social recognition , bonding , anxiety , trust , and arousal - right into the brain .
Foreclosure Homes Pull Down New York City Home Prices
Category Rss Feed - http://www.realestateproarticles.com/rss.php?rss=265
By : John Cutts
As the number of foreclosure homes continues to soar across the country , home prices continue to slide down .
New York City�s housing market , which was generally shielded from price declines in 2008 due to continued prosperity on Wall Street , has now joined the other U.S. cities in home price declines .
The stock market collapse , the mortgage crisis and the glut of foreclosure homes across the country have adversely affected New York City , which is now saddled with 8,000 unsold new condos and an additional 22,000 units scheduled to be marketed in 2010 .
These condos were all built to serve young financial hotshots and international investors , but the continued entry of foreclosure homes into the housing market nationwide , the global economic downturn and corporate downsizing have put a stop to most real estate purchase plans .
Residential real estate developers in the city are now awash with inventories , as more and more New Yorkers lose their jobs and fewer foreigners buy Manhattan condos because of the global downturn .
Developers are also considering real estate auctions , which are rare in New York , just to move properties and show buyers how low home prices have fallen .
The city is rarely mentioned in news related to foreclosure homes , but the nationwide foreclosure crisis has extended its adverse effects on the city .
Real estate auctions were last undertaken in New York City in the 1990s when the city was overloaded with a surplus of co-op condos and interest rates were at two - digit levels .
Now New York City condo and apartment builders are planning to use auctions to obtain liquidity .
They also have seen how auctions succeeded in rescuing housing markets in South Florida which were devastated by foreclosure homes .
Boston - based Accelerated Marketing Partners , an auctioneer and real estate marketer , has been approached by several developers for possible auction deals .
One is a developer who wants to auction five mid-range and high - end condos in Manhattan in Brooklyn .
Another is a condo builder who wants to auction units in his downtown building , priced previously at $ 1,100 per square foot .
Now the units would probably be priced at minimum bids of $ 700 per square foot .
One strategy of Accelerated to prevent condo prices from diving to the price level of foreclosure homes is to auction only several units of a particular building at a time .
The other unsold units are marketed outside the auction arena .
Auctioneer Sheldon Good & Company will also auction condo properties located in various parts of the city and neighboring New Jersey in May .
Among these condo properties are the 17 units of a new condo in one wealthy community of New Jersey .
John Cutts has been educated in the finer points of the foreclosure market over 5 years .
Several private BitTorrent trackers including Nordicbits , Powerbits , Piratebits , MP3nerds and Wolfbits , have closed down after the Pirate Bay verdict came in last Friday .
Other trackers are set to follow this example in what could be the greatest voluntary tracker collapse ever .
Operating a BitTorrent tracker from Sweden is not as fun as it used to be , last Friday ruined all that .
What was once considered a safe haven for BitTorrent sites , is now a Bermuda Triangle for some previously very active BitTorrent trackers .
The harsh verdict against the four individuals involved with the largest BitTorrent tracker on the Internet led to worries among those who operate similar sites in Sweden and elsewhere .
In the days following the verdict , several large and small BitTorrent trackers have decided to close down and more are expected to follow suit in the days to come .
One of the sites that has closed its doors is NordicBits , which displays a message citing the verdict as one of the reasons for the closure .
We have to shut down the site now due all circumstances .
We do n’t have time to do anything to the code , we do n’t have interest in it , we do n’t have any more money and the biggest reason is The Pirate Bay info .
Rumors say that at least a dozen trackers will discontinue operations in the days to come including Swebits , who have already shut down their tracker but not the site itself .
SeedIT , a relatively small community is another tracker that ’s decided to shut – they posted their latest torrent a few hours ago , titled :
“ RiP.SeedIT.We.Have.always.been.the.best.of.the.best.Love.love.love.XXX-RIP ”
Several of the trackers that are now offline were operated by Swedes , who are worried that they might be facing legal troubles as well .
In addition , there are many other BitTorrent trackers hosted in Sweden run by non-Swedes – time will tell how they respond .
The Pirate Bay continues business as usual as the defendants appeal their case , but in the meantime the Swedish anti-piracy lobby will use the verdict to their advantage .
Uncertain times .

Apr 8 , 2009 ( CIDRAP News ) –
The recent series of H5N1 avian influenza cases in Egyptian children yet very few in adults has raised concern that some Egyptians may be getting infected without getting sick , according to a Reuters news report published today .
John Jabbour , a World Health Organization ( WHO ) emerging diseases specialist based in Cairo , said the Egyptian government and the WHO are planning a study to find out if subclinical or asymptomatic cases have been occurring , according to the story .
Jabbour said the occurrence of asymptomatic cases would be worrisome because it could give the undetected virus more time to mutate in human hosts , Reuters reported .
" If there is any subclinical case in Egypt , the aim is to treat immediately to stop the reproduction of the virus , " he told Reuters .
" Because whether [ through ] mutation or reassortment , this will lead to the pandemic strain . "
The story said that all but two of the 11 Egyptians infected with H5N1 this year have been children under age 3 ( the official WHO count for Egypt reached 12 today ) .
In the same period last year , most of the seven Egyptian case - patients were adults and older children , the report said .
Jabbour said the string of cases in children without similar cases in adults had prompted the questions whether adults were being infected without falling ill .
He said the Egyptian study would involve testing the blood of people who were potentially exposed to infected birds but had not gotten sick .
Tim Uyeki , MD , a medical epidemiologist in the Influenza Division at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , told CIDRAP
News that limited studies in several countries over the past few years have found relatively little serologic evidence of asymptomatic or unrecognized cases of H5N1 virus infection .
When the H5N1 virus first infected humans in Hong Kong in 1997 , there were two studies in which investigators looked for H5N1 antibodies in people who had potentially been exposed to the virus , Uyeki said .
One study focused on 293 poultry cullers , of whom only nine ( 3 % ) were found to have H5N1 antibodies , indicating past infection .
In the other study , involving 1,525 poultry workers , an estimated 10 % had antibodies .
More recent studies " have either found no evidence of H5N1 virus infection or very low seroprevalence of H5N1 antibodies , around 1 % or less , among different exposed populations , " Uyeki said .
" Since H5N1 virus strains continue to evolve , there 's a continued need for these studies in people who have contact with poultry in countries where H5N1 virus strains are circulating in birds , since the risk of transmission to exposed persons could change . "
Uyeki also noted that subclinical infection with seasonal influenza virus is known to occur .
" But how that relates to H5N1 is unclear , " he said .

My girlfriend always seemed to enjoy seeing how much she could get away with doing some form of bondage stuff in public .
She does this partly because she finds it fun , mostly because she knows it drives me out of my tree .
Usually , I 'm able to fast - talk my way out of potentially embarrassing situations with Mundanes , but yesterday she very nearly got me fired .
Yesterday afternoon we had lunch together .
Afterward , she accompanied me back to work .
I thought this slightly unusual , since she had never before expressed in interest in my work ( electronic engineering ) , but it did n't occur to me that she had something planned .
We arrived at my workbench , where I am currently trying to figure why the $ % @^ $ board on which I am working is not performing the way it is designed .
" Is this where you work ? " she asked .
" At the moment , " I replied .
I reached over to turn on the scope , thereby completely failing to notice the huge black studded collar she had produced from her purse .
Before I could blink ( it 's amazing the speed at which she can do this ) , she had locked the collar snugly around my neck , and locked the end of the 6 foot jack chain to the center of the bench ( where there just happened to be a mounting hole , dammit ) .
I turned to her in utter disbelief , mouth agape .
" I 'll be back for you at five , " she said .
" HAVE YOU GONE COMPLETELY WACKO !??!?! "
I yelled in a hushed voice .
" How the hell am I going to explain this !?!?! "
" You 'll think of something , " she said , dropping the keys into her cleavage , " you always do . "
" But suppose I have to go to the bathroom , " I countered .
" Do n't give me that " , she hissed , " I 've seen you go a whole day without visiting the bathroom . "
" But .... " I tried to say .
" SHHH !
The subject is closed .
I 'll be back at five .
Bye "
She turned around and left , against my hushed protests .
I sat in panic and tried to think out my situation .
I tried to think of who might visit .
Most of my co-workers were friends who knew that my girlfriend and I were a bit odd , so this should n't surprise them .
But I had * no * idea what I was going to do if one of my bosses came in .
I checked my watch to see how long I would have to endure this ignominy .
13:30 ( I'm a military time weenie ) .
" Three and a half hours , " I thought .
I heaved a heavy sigh , and got to work , such as I could .
As it happened , three of my co-workers visited for what - not .
All of them immediately noticed the collar ( it would be hard not to ) and asked if it was my girlfriend 's idea .
I said yes .
They asked what I would do if my supervisor saw it .
I told them I had n't the faintest idea .
One of the aforementioned colleagues took the bench next to me , and after a few remarks ( and a question as to where he could get such a collar ) , settled down to work in silence .
After some time , I checked my watch .
16:40 .
" Gee , I just might make it through this after all , " I thought .
I was even beginning to get a handle on the problem with the $ # % &&$# board on which I was working .
Murphy must have been standing right behind me , reading my thoughts , for not two minutes later one of my bosses entered the room .
And not just any boss .
Noooooooo .
This was Mr. Narrowminded himself .
This was the guy who took Lifespring * and* became a born - again funda- mentalist .
How he came to have the power of hire - and - fire over us is one of the Great Mysteries of The Universe .
We avoided this guy at all costs .
His eyes fell upon me immediately .
A few picoseconds later , he saw the collar around my neck in all it 's splendor .
" My life is over , " I thought .
I still had n't thought of a plausible explanation for this .
Mr. Solderbrain ( the name we called him behind his back ; a corruption of his real name ) started to walk slowly and deliberately over to me , his eyes fixed on the collar .
Fifteen agonizing seconds later , he was standing next to me .
I thought the guy sitting next to me was going to have seizures stifling all his giggles .
I continued to work , acting as though there were nothing the least bit unusual about my predicament .
Finally , he spoke .
" What . the .
HELL ! is .
THAT !?!? ! "
I do n't know how I thought of what I said .
In fact , I 'm pretty sure I did n't know what I was going to say until I was saying it .
I 'm even more amazed that Solderbrain actually bought it and did n't fire me on the spot .
I turned to face him calmly , with total nonchalance , exuding complete confidence in what I was about to say , even though I did n't know what it was yet .
I did n't even miss a beat .
" Grounding strap , " I said , and returned to work .
The guy next to me fell off his chair and nearly died laughing .

Magnet Theory Meets Earthquakes
Mathematical tools from the theory of magnets applied to seismic data reveal that the stronger an earthquake , the sooner the next one will occur , and it could be hundreds of miles away .

After the magnitude 6.7 Northridge earthquake in 1994 , further quakes were likely to follow quickly , even beyond the local area of aftershocks , according to research that borrows mathematical tools from the study of magnetism .

After the magnitude 6.7 Northridge earthquake in 1994 , further quakes were likely to follow quickly , even beyond the local area of aftershocks , according to research that borrows mathematical tools from the study of magnetism . ×
The time you ’ll most likely see an earthquake is soon after another earthquake , even if it occurred hundreds of miles away , according to several studies .
Now a paper in the 8 July PRL quantifies this idea by showing that the stronger an earthquake , the sooner there will be another one .
A Spanish researcher uncovered this relationship by studying seismic data using mathematical tools from the physics of solids that were inspired by quantum theory .
The paper concerns the statistical properties of earthquakes , so it does not provide a magic formula to predict where and when a quake will occur .
Combing through global seismic data , theorists have discovered in recent years that earthquakes tend to come in clusters–large numbers of events close in time–and that they follow a “ self - similarity , ” or “ fractal , ” principle : A cluster is most likely to occur soon after another cluster ; a cluster of clusters after another cluster of clusters , and so on .
If you plot thousands of events worldwide as dots on a timeline , the clustering that shows up on a year ’s worth of data looks very similar to a decade ’s worth of data where the dots represent clusters .
The similarity extends to the century scale , if you again replace clusters with single dots .
This is a bit like comparing the coastline of Africa with that of a tiny island–often the “ roughness ” of the coastline is similar , regardless of the scale of the map .
Álvaro Corral of the Autonomous University of Barcelona looked at seismic data in analogy with another case of self - similarity in nature , the critical magnetization of a metal .
A metal becomes magnetic when clusters of atoms feel one another ’s magnetic forces and align their magnetic moments in the same direction , like a collection of tiny arrows all adding up to one big arrow .
If you heat them up , the arrows jiggle more and more , and at very high temperatures , they all point in random directions .
But at an intermediate , “ Curie ” temperature , they can still feel one another ’s magnetism and form aligned clusters , although each cluster points in a random direction .
At this special temperature , there are clusters and “ superclusters ” of all sizes .
The configuration looks the same if you “ zoom in ” to the atomic scale or “ zoom out ” to the macroscopic scale .
This self - similarity allows researchers to use a mathematical tool orignally from quantum theory called the renormalization group , the mathematical representation of the “ zoom ” operations .
Corral realized that the same tool could be applied to seismic data .
Researchers knew that after a major quake , earthquakes are more likely in a wider region than that affected by aftershocks , but no one had quantified the relationship .
Corral used renormalization to look at data from many time scales all at once .
His model predicts that the stronger an earthquake , the sooner the next one will occur .
He believes that a future , more complex model could show that the whole recent history matters , not just the last event .
However , he says , his model suggests no correlation with the likely magnitude of the next earthquake .
“ Earthquakes know when they will happen , but they do n’t know what magnitude they are going to be , ” he says .
This notion contradicts the commonly held belief that a large earthquake today means a long wait before the next large earthquake .
Norman Sleep of Stanford University in California says the paper is a useful step in understanding earthquakes .
The fact that earthquakes come in clusters has a physical explanation , he says : “ A large earthquake can trigger another large earthquake on a nearby fault where the static stress increased . ”

A secondary school teacher has been interviewed in connection with the hanging of two paintings of Taoiseach Brian Cowen in two art galleries in Dublin .
The 34 - year - old man was questioned by detectives at Pearse Street Garda Station for two hours yesterday afternoon .
He was released without the charge and a file is being sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions .
Gardaí began investigating the case yesterday morning .
They identified the painter as a 34 - year - old secondary school teacher , who lives in Rathgar in Dublin .
They phoned the man and he agreed to come in to Pearse Street Garda Station to be interviewed .
The man was not arrested and made a voluntary statement .
He also handed over five similar paintings of other senior politicians .
It is understood he admitted painting and hanging the two portraits of Mr Cowen on the walls of the National Gallery and the Royal Hibernian Academy .
The garda investigation into the matter was completed in less than six hours .
It is understood the man may be prosecuted for alleged criminal damage after he was captured by CCTV putting glue on to the gallery walls before hanging the pictures .
Fine Gael justice spokesman Charlie Flanagan has branded the investigation a gross affront to freedom of expression and a waste of garda time .
Mr Flanagan said it was a waste of resources for detectives to be probing ' what amounted to a practical joke that offended the Taoiseach 's ego ' .
' Today FM has clearly come under pressure to hand over emails about this matter while RTÉ News was obviously browbeaten into a grovelling apology , ' he said .
' Freedom of expression is fundamental in a democracy .
' As politicians , we are frequently subject to unflattering comment and depiction but that is part and parcel of being a politician living in a free society .
' The Taoiseach 's over - reaction to what amounted to satire is completely over the top . '
While scouring their data , the team found ethyl formate as well as evidence for the deadly chemical propyl cyanide in the same cloud .
The two molecules are the largest yet discovered in deep space .
Researchers at Wuhan University in China discovered that adding chicken manure to soil contaminated with crude oil triggered degradation of 75 % of the oil within two weeks .
“ The use of chicken manure to stimulate crude oil biodegradation in the soil could be one of the several sought - after environmentally friendly ways of abating petroleum hydrocarbon pollution in the natural ecosystem . ”
The report , published in the International Journal of Environment and Pollution , suggests that animal waste , particularly chicken manure , can provide the necessary microbial and chemical initiators to facilitate the biodegradation of crude oil when applied to contaminated soil .
Chicken manure raises the pH of soil to the optimal range of 6.3 to 7.4 for the growth of the oil - utilizing bacteria .
Bello Yakubu , Huiwen Ma , and ChuYu Zhang analyzed the microbes from soil samples and found 21 different species , of which the Bacillus species and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the best for breaking down crude oil .
Compared to leaving the oil to degrade without additives , the manure method was 25 % more effective in soils with a 10 % volume to weight oil contamination .
This method of bioremediation could result in the use of less of the applications of potentially harmful chemical fertilizers to contaminated soils , which can lessen the quality of the soil and cause soil hardening .

A weather phenomenon over the Dallas - Fort Worth area Thursday afternoon had North Texans grabbing their cameras and snapping photos .
Some NBCDFW users who sent in photos referred to the oddity as a " sun dog " but meteorologist David Finfrock says not so fast -- it 's really a circumhorizon arc .
You can find a very detailed explanation of a circumhorizon arc and photos from Atmospheric Optics as well as the National Weather Service .
Or , click " watch video " on the left to hear an explanation from Finfrock .
The simple explanation is that it's a halo or optical phenomenon caused by the refraction of sunlight through thick , flat , horizontal ice crystals in cirrus clouds .
The result is just like when sunlight hits a prism separating the light into a myriad of colors .
A new poll released today by Yale and George Mason Universities finds that Americans trust scientists most when it comes to information on climate change .
Second to scientists is family and friends , which beat out environmental organizations , religious leaders , mainstream media , and President Obama .
According to the poll , 82 percent of Americans trust scientists on climate change with 28 percent saying that they strongly trust scientists .
Americans also trust those close to them : 77 percent said they trusted family and friends when it came to information about climate change .
Environmental organizations were trusted by 66 percent of those polled , making it third .
Mainstream media garners very little trust from Americans when it comes to climate change .
In fact Americans trust Al Gore ( 58 percent ) , President Obama ( 51 percent ) , and religious leaders ( 48 percent ) over mainstream media .
Only John McCain ( 38 percent ) and corporations ( 19 percent ) were less trusted than the media , which came in at 47 percent .
The poll appears to agree with a recent Gallup poll that showed more Americans than ever believed that the media exaggerated global warming .
In that poll 41 percent of Americans said that the media exaggerated global warming , while 28 percent of Americans thought that the media was guilty of underestimating the threat of climate change .
Both polls point to a strong distrust of the media .

Mrs Clinton has backed a two - state solution - but is time running out ?
By Jeremy Bowen
Middle East editor , BBC News
A journey to Ramallah from Jerusalem tells you a lot about the state of peace and war between Israel and the Palestinians .
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton does not get the delays at checkpoints that most people face .
But if she looked out of the window of her armour - plated SUV she would have seen some of the ways this place is changing , and why that undercuts the policy that she is here to promote .
Throughout her visit , speaking to Israelis and Palestinians , Mrs Clinton has been saying that she wants to create a Palestinian state alongside Israel - the so - called two - state solution to the conflict .
The security walls appear to symbolise the lack of trust on both sides
She says that making a Palestinian state possible is a commitment she carries in her heart , not just in her portfolio as secretary of state .
But when others who also believed for years in two states look out of their car windows at what is happening in the West Bank and Jerusalem , they cannot help thinking that their dream has gone .
Big chunks of the land that Palestinians want to use for their state has been taken for Jewish settlements , for the network of security roads and military bases that protect them and connect them to Israel , and for the complex of walls and hi-tech fences that make up the separation barrier .
And as the land goes , so does trust , on both sides .
Palestinians find it easy now to ignore politicians when they talk about peace , because they have heard it so many times before .
The years of violence have also worn down Israelis .
Many who used to think a Palestinian state would make their lives safer and more secure now think it would turn into Greater Hamastan - a bigger version of Gaza and an easier place to use as a base for launching rockets into the heart of Israel .
More than vigour
Even those who still have some hope that the two - state solution is possible and desirable believe that the next few years are the last possible opportunity to make it happen .
Mrs Clinton 's words have been almost indistinguishable from those of her predecessor Condoleezza Rice
Mrs Clinton hinted at that herself .
She said that time was of the essence , and that the Obama administration was going to work vigorously to get the two sides to make an agreement .
It will take more than vigour .
The Israeli Prime Minister designate , Benjamin Netanyahu gets his core support from parties who reject the idea of a Palestinian state .
If they dominate his governing coalition - when and if it is formed - then a collision with Washington looks inevitable , if President Obama and Secretary Clinton are as keen as they say on two states .
For this to work , the Americans are going to have to persuade the Israelis that their security will be enhanced , not jeopardised .
In the current climate that will be difficult .
Paying lip - service ?
The Americans will also have to show Palestinians that they are prepared to lean on their Israeli friends .
Pressure on Palestinians costs nothing for American politicians .
In fact its absence can lose them votes .
The decisions taken by Mr Bush made the divisions broader and deeper
But pressure on Israel is an entirely different matter , and it will be necessary if Israel is to stop expanding Jewish settlements in the occupied territories and is to contemplate ever removing some of them .
In her public statements while she has been here Mrs Clinton 's words have been almost indistinguishable from those of her predecessor Condoleezza Rice .
Both women called for peace and for a state called Palestine alongside Israel , and both said they would work to make it a reality .
By the time Secretary Rice left office the vision looked as distant as ever .
The difference between them hinges on the determination of their bosses .
Former President George W Bush always seemed to be paying lip - service to the project .
What Palestinians and Israelis do not know yet is whether President Obama will be different .
His intentions seem clear , but he has a very crowded and complicated agenda .
In the Middle East alone , what he does with the Israelis and the Palestinians will be shaped by what he also wants to do across the Arab and Muslim countries of the world .
And the fault lines in the small area that makes up Israel , the West Bank and Gaza have a habit of producing challenges that demand action .
The decisions taken by Mr Bush made the divisions broader and deeper .
It will be clear soon enough whether President Obama has what it takes to bridge the gaps , and even close a few of them .

On her last day in the war - torn Darfur region of western Sudan , Gemma Davies , a British staffer with Doctors Without Borders , helped arrange for a gunshot victim to be transferred from the charity group 's remote mountain clinic to a faraway state hospital .
She watched as doctors discharged a young mother a day after a difficult delivery .
Then she and about a dozen colleagues lifted off in a helicopter , leaving behind a small local staff , a few weeks ' worth of supplies , and a promise to make radio contact twice a day .
Their departure , three days before the International Criminal Court was due to issue an arrest warrant for Sudanese President Omar al Bashir in connection with atrocities in Darfur , was a security precaution .
Ms. Davies figured she 'd return to the clinic in a couple of weeks .
Now , however , Davies and her team , part of the Dutch arm of Doctors Without Borders , are banned from Darfur after Sudan expelled 13 international humanitarian agencies and three domestic groups last week who were working in the troubled region .
Soon after the warrant was announced , Mr. Bashir accused the foreign agencies of collaborating with the court – which they deny – and Sudanese authorities began freezing their bank accounts and confiscating computers , telephones and radios .
AID WORKERS KIDNAPPED
[ On Wednesday , three members of the Belgian branch of Doctors Without Borders were kidnapped at gunpoint from their compound in northern Darfur .
The aid organization said Thursday that it would now withdraw most of its remaining international staff back to Khartoum , forcing the closure of several more clinics and medical facilities .
The gunmen seized a Canadian nurse , an Italian doctor and a French coordinator , along with two Sudanese guards who were later released .
Negotiations for their release are underway , the Associated Press reports . ]
The future of the clinic where Davies worked – and that of scores of programs throughout Darfur that provided clean drinking water , sturdy latrines , prenatal care , vaccinations , schooling , and emergency food for malnourished children – is in doubt .
The clinic and many other sites are cut off from communication and supply lines , reduced to islands in a harsh , sprawling scrubland the size of Texas .
Relief groups are scrambling to shutter their offices , pay off local staff members and vacate the country , with no idea how – or whether – their programs will continue .
The United Nations estimates that the expulsions will affect 1.1 million people .
" We 're very concerned that we 've left patients behind , " Davies said in an interview in Nairobi , in neighboring Kenya , where many expelled aid workers are beginning to arrive .
WHO WILL HELP DARFUR'S NEEDIEST ?
A day before flying home to London , Davies sat in a plush banquette at a sleek new Nairobi coffee shop , 1,500 miles and a universe removed from the craggy Jebel Mara mountains in southern Darfur , where she 'd worked for the previous six months in a village called Feina .
She had three months remaining on her contract .
The free clinic in Feina , established two years ago , is the only health facility serving some 90,000 people who 've been displaced by fighting and are scattered throughout the mountains .
The nearest decent hospital , in the city of Nyala , is an eight - hour drive away , if rains have n't washed out the road .
In an average month the clinic saw about 3,000 patients .
" The population is scattered all over and access is a huge problem , " said Davies , who previously worked for Doctors Without Borders in Turkmenistan .
" With us gone , they have no one . "
The agency also was forced to end services in Kalma , a camp that houses 90,000 displaced people , and in the town of Muhajariya , where it helped to operate the only hospital in an area , which has 70,000 residents .
Darfur has been a killing field since 2003 , when rebel groups launched an uprising and the Sudanese government responded with a brutal scorched - earth campaign .
Perhaps the only bright spot has been the response by humanitarian agencies , which braved the tough terrain and byzantine government bureaucracy to build from scratch the world 's most complex relief operation , dramatically curbing deaths from malaria , cholera , and other treatable illnesses .
" The immediate future for Darfurians is a sharp decline in the remarkable humanitarian work that has reduced mortality rates to near - normal levels in the aftermath of the massacre years of 2003 - 04 , " Julie Flint , a leading expert on Darfur , recently wrote on the website of the Social Science Research Council , a New York - based research center .
HALF THE AID WORKERS EXPELLED
The expelled US - and Europe - based groups provided about half the relief services in Darfur , says the UN , which has warned of catastrophe if the groups are n't reinstated .
There are no signs that Sudan will reverse the decision , however , and ousted aid workers are n't optimistic that the Sudanese government or the remaining relief groups will be able to fill the gap quickly .
" There are no NGOs " – nongovernmental organizations – " with the capacity to do it , " said David Clatworthy , a water and sanitation coordinator in Darfur for the International Rescue Committee , a US - based group that also was expelled .
Mr. Clatworthy helped run projects in three sites in Darfur , pumping some 1.5 million gallons of drinking water daily into camps that house 167,000 displaced people .
When diesel fuel for the pumps runs out and the water taps need replacing – 250 taps wear out every month from overuse – no one will be around to do it , he fears .
Aid groups long have complained about the strictures of operating in Darfur , including lengthy delays to obtain travel permits and authorizations for deliveries .
Once , Davies ' team 's monthly shipment of food to Feina was delayed for several days because authorities objected to one item : canned peaches .
" You face barriers to what you 're doing , " Davies said .
" You can have all the will and capacity , but you still need permission to get food , logistical support , medical supplies . "
In the end , the team in Feina never numbered more than 12 foreigners .
That was the maximum that could be carried out by helicopter in an evacuation .
More than 50 local staff members remain , but on the other end of the radio – where Davies and her team were supposed to check in twice daily – there 's only silence .
" I would think they would keep running as long as they could , " Davies said .
" But we have no way of knowing .
To know you have more than 50 staff there , totally unsupported , their level of knowledge not great – it's very difficult to imagine what will happen . "

Conditional “ tee ” with Python
This post describes the conditional tee ( " ctee " ) module I wrote to split a sequence into two generators , according to a filter function .
The problem
David Beazley has a great article about generator pipelining using Python .
This is a technique for handling ( potentially very large ) streams of data in a flexible yet efficient way .
As an example , here 's a code snippet he gives for summing the total bytes from a log file :
open ( " access-log " )
bytecolumn = ( line .
rsplit ( None , 1 ) [ 1 ] for line in wwwlog )
bytes = ( int ( x ) for x in bytecolumn if x != '-' ) wwwlog =bytecolumn =line.linewwwlogbytes =bytecolumnx != print " Total " , sum ( bytes )
The code above first opens a log file , then gets the byte column for each entry .
The byte value ( if any ) is then calculated for each row .
Finally , the generator is consumed ( or " pumped " ) , yielding the sum .
Since the entire file is never loaded into active memory , you could run this on quite huge log files , or even add a few steps and run it on collections of log files , without blowing up your memory .
Another feature of this technique is that it 's very flexible : you can add steps , combine steps into atomic actions , rearrange them , and so on .
This works great , as long as your pipe does n't branch .
If you want to split your pipe — say , dividing a stream of integers into one stream of even numbers and another of odds , things get a little complicated .
One really elegant way to handle this situation is with the itertools .
tee function .
tee takes an iterable sequence , and returns n " copies " of that sequence that can be iterated independently .
Using itertools.tee
import itertools lines = open ( " numbers.txt " )
numbers = ( int ( line ) for line in lines ) first , second = itertools.tee( numbers ) evens = ( i for i in first if not i % 2 )
odds = ( i for i in second if i % 2 ) print " Evens total : " , sum( evens )
print " Odds total : " , sum ( odds )
The code first opens a file containing a bunch of random integers , and creates a generator that 's a stream of integers .
It then uses itertools .
tee to make two copies of that generator ( first and second ) , and applies generator expressions to create two streams : one of even numbers , and one of odd numbers .
The built - in sum function is then used to consume each tee .
Here 's the number file that I used for this code .
It 's a list of 1,000 random integers between 1 and 1,000,000 .
That 's fine in this case , where the filter expression is relatively inexpensive .
But what if we have an expensive filter , like testing whether the number is prime , or making a database query ?
It could really hurt our performance if we have to perform the same test twice .
Ideally , we 'd just like to perform the test once for each element in our pipeline .
There are lots of ways to handle that situation .
One common way is the " continuation - passing " style , where you pass some data , a filter condition , and one or more functions to perform depending on the results of the test .
This works , but it disrupts the pipeline .
That costs us the flexibility and dynamic nature of the generator paradigm .
I wrote the conditional tee ( ctee ) module for cases when you want to use a generator pipeline , but you need to split the sequence into two generators , and the filter condition is expensive .
It creates a pair of instances of the ConditionalTee class , which are linked to each other .
Using conditional tee
Here 's the meat of the code .
The module can be downloaded here ( ctee.zip ) .
from Queue import Queue class ConditionalTee( object ) :
" " " A conditional tee class " " " def __init__ ( self , sequence , condition ) :
self .sequence = sequence
self.condition = condition
self.othertee = None
self.q = Queue ( ) def next ( self ) :
" " "
Get the next item that matches the condition .
Adds items to the queue of the other sequence until
one matching this condition is reached .
" " "
if not self.q.empty ( ) :
return self.q.get ( ) item = self.sequence.next ( )
while not self.condition ( item ) :
self.othertee.q.put( item )
item = self.sequence.next ( )
return item def __iter__( self ) :
" " " We are an iterator " " "
return self def ctee( sequence , condition ) :
" " "
Creates two sequences from sequence : one where
condition holds , and the other where it does n't
sequence -> ( x for x in sequence if condition ( x ) ) ,
( x for x in sequence if not condition ( x ) )
" " " yes_iter = ConditionalTee( sequence , condition )
nocond = lambda x : not condition ( x )
no_iter = ConditionalTee( sequence , nocond )
yes_iter.othertee = no_iter
no_iter .othertee = yes_iter return yes_iter , no_iter
The ConditionalTee class takes a sequence and a filter condition as arguments to its __init__ method .
The __init__ method also creates an empty queue member , and an othertee member that 's initialized to None .
When the next method of a ConditionalTee instance is called , it first looks for any items in its queue .
If there is an item on the queue , it returns the first one .
Otherwise , it iterates through its sequence ; it keeps adding any items that do n't match to the queue of its othertee member , until it either finds an item that matches or raises a StopIteration exception .
The ctee function also takes a sequence and a filter condition as arguments .
It creates two ConditionalTee instances , and sets their othertee members to each other , then returns the two instances as a pair .
Here 's some sample code using ctee :
lines = open ( " numbers.txt " )
nums = ( int ( line ) for line in lines )
iseven = lambda x : not x % 2
evens , odds = ctee. ctee ( nums , iseven )
There 's still a problem if you " pump " each of these generators in succession , though : if the amount of data is large , the other generator class is going to accumulate a huge queue of data .
It would be better to pump each generator expression alternately , taking an item and processing it from each generator in turn , in order to avoid building up a big queue .
Here 's a function that 'll do that :
Pumping generators alternately instead of consecutively
def diagonalize ( sequences ) :
" " "
Takes each sequence in turn , retrieving one item from that
sequence and performing action on it , until all sequences
are exhausted .
sequence is a sequence of ( iterable , action ) pairs .
" " "
sequences = [ ( iter ( s ) , a ) for ( s , a ) in sequences ]
while sequences :
for sequence , action in sequences :
try :
item = sequence .
next ( )
action ( item )
except StopIteration :
# remove the exhausted sequence from the list
sequences = [ ( s , a )
for ( s , a ) in sequences
if s != sequence ]
This takes a sequence of ( sequence , action ) pairs .
It iterates through each pair , taking the next item in the sequence and applying the action to it .
If the sequence raises StopIteration , it 's removed from the list of sequences .
The list comprehension at the start of the function is to make sequence test False when empty , and to ensure each sequence in it is an iterable ( i.e. supporting next ) .
Here 's an example of using this function :
open ( " numbers.txt " )
numbers = ( int ( line ) for line in lines ) lines =numbers =linelinelines evens , odds = ctee( numbers , lambda x : not x % 2 ) evenout = open ( " evens.txt " , " w " )
oddout = open ( " odds.txt " , " w " ) def writeline ( out , item ) :
print >> out , item evenaction = lambda x : writeline ( evenout , x )
oddaction = lambda x : writeline ( oddout , x ) diagonalize ( ( ( evens , evenaction ) , ( odds , oddaction ) ) )
This code will write all the even numbers to " evens.txt " , and all the odd numbers to " odds.txt " .
You might ask , how is this different from the continuation passing style ?
And you 'd have a point ; this is essentially continuation passing .
The thing is that here , the pumping only happens at the end .
You can still go on wrapping all sorts of other filtering and transforming generators around your two conditional tees ; the sequence wo n't actually be processed until you start pumping the generators at the end , so you wo n't build up enormous queues of data .
❤ “ But the Lord said to Samuel , “ Do not look on his appearance or on the height of his stature ( Saul ) , because I have rejected him .
For the Lord sees not as man sees : man looks on the outward appearance , but the Lord looks on the heart ( David ) . ” ~ I Samuel 16:7
Authenticity 101 : I am neither tall , dark nor handsome .
Thus , it was n’t unusual for my being one of the last ones picked as a team member .
I never went to Senior Prom or Homecoming either .
My senior year in High School , the Captain of the Cheerleaders squad stopped me in in a hallway , looked me in the eyes and said , “ You would be one of the cutest guys in school if you were n’t so short ! ” ( Sigh … )
My college business professor told me in front of the whole classroom , “ You have brains , wit and improvisational skills far superior to most I know in the business world .
The only thing holding you back is that you are not six foot tall .
( Sigh … )
When I came to saving faith in Jesus Christ – the Spirit began showing me just how skewed the world really is – measuring a man by his outward appearance ; what he looks like , how much money he has , his career path and the such .
God however , cares for none of these things ; rather favoring what a man possesses inwardly ; richness toward Him , a contrite and humbled heart , a self - awareness of one ’s own frailty and propensity toward sin and an acute need to thank God for His good mercies and graces given daily .
I have lived more a life than most men would live in three lifetimes .
I ’ve touched the beauty of relationship , adventure , career and fellowship and even His wisdom .
The Lord has held nothing back from me ; also allowing my wandering ; being torched by my pride , desire and the resultant consequences that followed .
Let ’s just say that I am no longer impressed with a woman ’s outward beauty if that is all she can bring to a relationship .
Nor am I impressed with a man ’s business resume ’ ; if he cannot also bring mercy , integrity or ethic to the table .
As for me personally ?
I do n’t want to be that old man preoccupied with my physical or financial appearance for others sake .
I want them to see Jesus in me .
Nothing else .
“ Father ?
Help me to run to the finish line .
I see it more clearly now than at any other time in my life .
I wo n’t make it without you sustaining me , guiding me and empowering me to the end .
I need you more today than I ever realized previously .
You have been kind , gracious and Holy towards me from the very first day I believed .
Keep my in your firm grip .
Thank you for affirming your value of me as an adopted son and friend .
I love you so .
In Jesus Name .
Amen ! ” 💕
First of all , I ’d like to welcome all of the new Michelle Malkin and Instapundit readers to the site .
Now that you are here , I ’d like to ask five quick questions ( in all seriousness ) of you .
Where was the Republican outrage about the burdensome spending created with the No Child Left Behind Act ?
Why were n’t y’all as upset about the cost of Medicare Part D as you are about Obama ’s socialistic health care schemes ?
Please do n’t respond that “ at least Bush gave us tax cuts . ”
Is there any reason that no one seemed pissed off that Bush was the biggest taxer in the world ?
On spending , as early as early 2004 , even the GOP - friendly Heritage Foundation was upset about Bush / Republican domestic spending .
Where were Rush Limbaugh and the rest of the mouthpieces of the right at this time ?
Since Republican politicians try to jockey for the position of who can sound the most like Ronald Reagan , why did n’t y’all listen to the person who wrote most of Reagan ’s words ?
To be clear , I think it is cool that it appears that libertarians have some newfound friends on the small - government team .
However , it ’s fair to color us a bit skeptical , as we are still licking our Republican - inflicted wounds .
It may take a bit of time for us to recover from the political PTSD we are suffering after fighting Republicans for the last eight years over government spending issues .
A few honest answers may help the healing process , though .
Over the years I 've taken a strong stand for legal due process on this blog .
I 've opposed the government 's treatment of Ahmed Zaoui , its plans to seize assets from suspected ( or even acquitted ) criminals , and its plans for ASBOs , local body banishment orders , anti-domestic violence " police orders " , and anti-boy - racer " cease and desist orders " for one simple reason : because I believe that people should not be punished without trial , and that when the government accuses you of something , you should be given a decent chance to defend yourself against that accusation .
These are basic principles of a fair and just society , and recognised as such in our Bill of Rights Act .
So you can imagine what I think of the government 's attempt to impose guilt by accusation on the people of New Zealand when it comes to copyright .
This move violates those basic principles of justice and fairness , and it does so for the worst of reasons : because the copyright mafia have decided that it would be too expensive to even try to prove an allegation of breach of copyright .
Instead , they want people cut off from the internet - and by extension , their friends , family , community , society , political system , and life - simply on accusation .
And if they get it wrong ?
Tough shit .
This should not happen in a free society .
We should not let it happen .
Quite apart from the gross unfairness , the potential for abuse is enormous .
Want to silence someone ?
Accuse them of copyright violation , and their ISP will be forced to take them down .
The possibilities are endless ...
As for what you can do about it , the Creative Freedom Foundation has a few suggestions here .
And they promise not to kick you off the net if you pass it around ...

Zeitbombe Schützenvereine Jochen Bott
Eines hatten alle jugendlichen Amokläufer der jüngsten Vergangenheit gemeinsam : Praxis an der Waffe
Als 11 .
September 2001 mit Flugzeugen gemordet wurde , spekulierte man am 12 .
September , dass die Terroristen am PC trainiert haben könnten In Wirklichkeit waren sie in Pilotenschulen .
Wann immer ein Jugendlicher durchdreht , wird als erstes von Computerspielen und Videofilmen gesprochen .
Doch das Schießen haben alle jugendlichen Amokläufer woanders gelernt .
Der 16 - jährige Amokschütze Martin Peyerl richtete am 1 .
November 1999 ein Blutbad in Bad Reichenhall an , das außer ihm selbst vier Menschen das Leben kostete und sechs Verletzte zurückließ ..
Sein Vater war Mitglied bei den Sportschützen und dem Deutschen Soldaten - und Kameradschaftsbund , einem weiteren Club , " in dem scharf geschossen wird " , und auch sein Sohnemann durfte regelmäßig Schießübungen im Wald durchführen .
Der Vater bekam unter anderem auch deswegen Ärger , weil die Polizei in seinem Haus 19 Waffen fand und er legalerweise lediglich 17 ( sic ! ) besitzen durfte .
In Brannenburg tötet im 16 .
März 2000 der 16 - jährige Michael F. seinen Internatsleiter und jagt sich selbst eine Kugel in Kopf .
Zuvor hatte er sich aus dem Waffenschrank seines Vaters zwei Waffen besorgt .
Dieser Vater wiederum gehörte drei Schützenvereinen an , und besaß neben seinen legalen Waffen immerhin noch 70 illegale
Im Februar 2002 erschießt der 22 - jährige Adam Labus zwei ehemalige Arbeitskollegen und den Direktor seiner Ex-Schule .
Adam Labus wird als Einzelgänger und Waffennarr mit einem Faible für Gotcha beschrieben .
Seine Waffen stammten aus illegalen Quellen , was Stoiber zu dem Kommentar veranlasste , dass dieses " schreckliche Ereignis nicht dazu geeignet " sei , " die große Zahl der legalen Waffenbesitzer ins Zwielicht zu setzen . " .
Der Mörder von Erfurt , Robert Steinhäuser , der mit 16 Morden sogar die Dimension von Littleton übertraf , besaß seine beiden Waffen , die Pump - Gun und den Revolver , völlig legal .
Er gehörte zwei Erfurter Schützenvereinen an , dem Schützenverein Domblick e. V. und dem Polizeisportverein , und verbrachte anscheinend einen Großteil seiner Freizeit mit intensivem Waffentraining .
Dies waren die vier großen Fälle der letzten Jahre , in denen Jugendliche zu Amokläufern wurden bzw .
im schulischen Bereich mordeten .
Sucht man nach dem kleinsten gemeinsamen Nenner , so wird man auf der Stelle fündig : Alle vier Mörder hatten bereits ein jahrelanges , intensives Training an realen Waffen hinter sich .
Auffällig auch die große Zahl legaler Waffen .
Man kann abschätzen , dass im Jahr 2000 lediglich bei 4,1 % aller Straftaten " legale " Waffen eingesetzt wurden .
Dagegen handelt es sich bei den Amok - Morden ( bis auf den Fall Adam Labus ) jeweils um legale Waffen , deren Lizenzierung über die Zugehörigkeit zu Sportschützenvereinen erfolgte .
Und von den 7,2 Millionen Schusswaffen in Deutschland sind nur 650.000 in den Händen von Sportschützen .
Will man die auffällige Überrepräsentanz der Jugendlichen mit Schießclub - Background bei den Amokläufern erklären , reicht der Zugang zu den Waffen als Erklärung allein nicht aus - es geht auch und zumal um die Ausbildung an den Schusswaffen .
Es bleibt kein anderer Schluss übrig als der , dass eine effektive Vorbeugung gegen solche Ereignisse nur möglich ist , indem man Jugendliche von Waffen fernhält , und zwar durch drakonische Verschärfung der Strafen für Eltern , die ihre Waffen nicht erfolgreich vor den Kindern wegsperren , und durch die Verwehrung der Aufnahme von Jugendlichen in Sportschützenvereine .
Ob solche Einschränkungen der Sportausübungen hingenommen werden können oder ob die Gefahr von Amokläufen unter allgemeines Lebensrisiko abzubuchen ist , das müsste die Politik klären .
Aber die Politik hat andere Faktoren ausgemacht :
" Die schrecklichen Ereignisse von Bad Reichenhall , Metten und Brannenburg haben uns aufgerüttelt .
Wir müssen alles tun , um Gewalt bei Jugendlichen zu unterbinden bzw .
zu verhindern .
Gewalt bei Jugendlichen hat immer ein ganzes Bündel von Ursachen , die vielfach auch im unkontrollierten Konsum von Gewalt verherrlichenden und schwer jugendgefährdeten Videofilmen und von sogenannten Killerspielen liegen .
Der Einfluss der Medien auf unsere Kinder und Jugendliche ist oftmals kontraproduktiv zu unseren Wertvorstellungen , die wir unseren Kindern vermitteln wollen , die gerade auch in den Schützenvereinen vermittelt werden . "
- Staatsminister und Ministerkandidat Huber am 31.3.2001 zum 50 - jährigen Jubiläums des Schützenbezirks Niederbayern .
Auch Kanzlerkandidat Stoiber sprach sich am 27.4.2002 umgehend für ein Verbot von Gewaltdarstellungen in Computerspielen aus .
Ob das nützen würde ?
Bei Peyerl wurden Computerspiele beschlagnahmt , es wurde aber nie bekannt gegeben , welche es waren .
Michael F. und Adam Labus scheinen keinen Computer benutzt zu haben .
Bei Robert Steinhäuser wurden jetzt Computerspiele beschlagnahmt , bei denen gewinnt , " wer sich mit Waffengewalt den Weg bahnt " .
Das kann Kingpin sein , Counter Strike oder Tomb Raider .
Das eigentliche Problem , die legale Ausbildung und der legale Besitz von Schusswaffen , wird aber nicht angegangen .
Oder nicht wirklich - während in Erfurt gemordet wurde , verschärfte der Bundestag das Waffenrecht minimal und zwei Unionsabgeordnete feierten ihren Erfolg , Schlimmeres verhindert zu haben : Die Pressemitteilung wurde inzwischen zurückgezogen :
Der erste Entwurf der Koalition war geprägt von Ideologie , Uneinsichtigkeit und Mangel an Sachkunde .
Rechtstreue Jäger , Schützen und Sammler sollten mit unsinnigen Verschärfungen der Vorschriften belastet werden , obwohl nach allen polizeilichen Erkenntnissen hierfür keine sicherheitspolitische Notwendigkeit besteht .
...
So konnten die sinnlose Waffenbegrenzung , die Meldepflicht für inaktive Schützen und die ständige Bedürfnisprüfung verhindert werden .
Die Aufbewahrungspflichten wurden nun praxisgerecht gestaltet .
Mit der Herabsetzung der Altersgrenze der Sportschützen für Luftdruckwaffen auf 10 Jahre wird der Jugend eine Chance auf Leistung und dem deutschen Schießsport Konkurrenzfähigkeit eröffnet .
Die mangelhafte Aufbewahrung ermöglichte das Morden von Brannenburg und Bad Reichenhall .
Dass sie zu früh mit echten Waffen in Kontakt kamen , scheint alle vier Mörder den Weg zu Tat gebahnt zu haben .
Doch hier auf Besserung von Seiten der Politik zu hoffen , ist mit Sicherheit vergebens : Stoiber , der gerne Gewalt in Computerspielen verbieten würde , ist Ehrenvorsitzender der " königlich privilegierten Feuerschützengesellschaft Wolfratshausen " , deren Homepage gleich demonstriert , mit welchen Waffen im beschaulichen Wolfratshausen scharf geschossen wird .

As noted else where , ruby 1.9.1 has n’t exactly bounded out of the gate .
That ’s not particularly surprising , considering 1.9.1 has been available for only a couple of months and requires changes to existing code .
In addition , there are a number of incompatible gems , giving rise to the isitrub19y website as a clearing house of information .
So despite the great efforts from the Rails team , the rest of the community is still lagging behind .
That ’s particularly true on Windows , where a new one - click installer is n’t yet available .
According to the latest market share stats from Net Applications , Windows controls 88 % of the desktop market .
I have no idea how many Ruby installations exist , and how they are divided by operating system .
But looking at RubyForge , by far and away the most popular download of all times is the Windows one - click installer with over 3 million downloads .
Luis Lavena has taken over stewardship of the one - click installer , and clearly needs a bit of help .
So although I have very little free time , I offered to pitch in as I could .
While Luis is concentrating on putting together a new version of the one - click installer using Mingw and msys , I thought I could help out by putting 1.9.1 through its paces on Windows .
My basic approach was to simply start with the basics :
Build ruby with Visual Studio 2008
Build the default extensions and libraries Ruby uses ( zlib , iconv , openssl , etc )
Run Ruby ’s unit tests
That was almost a month ago .
Thirty - nine patches later ( I have no doubt Nobu is getting sick of me ) , I just about have Ruby 1.9.1 ’s test suite running on Windows .
There a still a few remaining issues , in particular a couple of imap tests that hang .
As for Visual Studio , I ’m using it for two reasons .
First , it has a lights - out debugger that makes it much easier to track down and fix problems .
Second , its lets you compile instrumented executable and libraries that can detect incorrect API usage , heap corruption , stack corruption and mismatched calling conventions .
It quickly became obvious that no one had ever done that with Ruby , because it turned up a whole host of issues .
For example , the dl extension used the cdecl calling convention to call the Windows API instead of stdcall .
Or that there were a set of memory leaks in printf / sprintf .
The other thing that was bothersome was the huge number of compiler warnings generated by building Ruby .
See for your self – and then realize the original list does n’t include any of the warnings generated by building Ruby ’s extensions .
Cleaning up the warnings took a number of patches , but at this point most of them have been fixed .
And all credit to Nobu for working through my patches , fixing them and applying them since my knowledge of the Ruby runtime is fairly limited , thereby causing most of my patches to not be quite right .
Anyway , since its not all that obvious how to build Ruby on Windows ( with Visual Studio or Mingw ) , I ’ll see if I can put together a few posts that describe how to do it for anyone who wants to roll their own .

Ruby Polyglot : Talking with Erlang
Functional programming languages such as Erlang , Haskell , and Clojure have been gaining momentum over the last year and a half , promising us support for easy distributed , fault - tolerant , non -stop applications .
Arguably the most appealing aspects are the high - concurrency actor and message passing models , especially in the light of imposed limits by the GIL on the Ruby interpreter ( Concurrency is a Myth in Ruby ) .
However , working my way through Joe Armstrong ’s “ Programming Erlang ” , which is an excellent introductory book by the way , you quickly come to appreciate the lack of third party libraries that are available to any Ruby programmer .
Polyglot ( person ) ( from the Greek πολύ ς / po΄lis / and γλώττα / ΄ɣlota / ) , someone who uses two or more languages
Erlectricity bridge : Connecting Ruby and Erlang
Turns out , Scott Fleckenstein and Tom Preston - Werner have already solved this problem for us , allowing bi-directional data exchange between Erlang and Ruby via Erlang Ports .
As far as Erlang is concerned , this communication pattern is seen as direct communication with another Erlang process , which also means we can transparently invoke our Ruby interpreter whenever we need it !
To get started , gem install erlectricity : Erlectricity allows a Ruby program to receive and respond to Erlang messages sent over the Erlang binary protocol .
Hello World from Erlang , through Ruby
Erlectricity source provides a couple of great examples of interfacing Ruby and Erlang : echo server , generating charts with Gruff , and even chatting with the Campfire API .
In our case , we ’re going to connect Ruby and Erlang to create a “ Hello World tweet ” .
To do this , we ’re going to use John Nunemaker ’s twitter gem to avoid building an API client in Erlang :
require ' rubygems ' require ' erlectricity ' require ' stringio ' require ' twitter ' receive do | f | f . when ( [ : post , String ] ) do | msg | # connect to twitter & post Hello World id = Twitter :: Base . new ( ' username ' , ' pass ' ) . post ( msg ) . id f . send ! ( [ : result , " Tweet sent !
Status id : #{ id } " ] ) f . receive_loop end end
Our Ruby process will be invoked via Erlang and will process incoming messages by listening in the receive state .
In this case , we will only pattern match on a ‘ post ’ request with String .
Now the Erlang side :
- module ( twitter ) . - export ( [ hello_world / 0 ] ) .
hello_world ( ) ->
Cmd = " ruby twitter - erl.rb " , Port = open_port ( { spawn , Cmd } , [{ packet , 4 } , nouse_stdio , exit_status , binary ] ) , Payload = term_to_binary ( { post , << " Hello World ! ( from Erlang , through Ruby ) " >> } ) , % send command to Ruby script & wait for response port_command ( Port , Payload ) , receive { Port , { data , Data }} -> { result , Text } = binary_to_term ( Data ) , % print out resulting tweet io : format ( " ~p~n " , [ Text ] ) end .
twitter-ruby-erl.zip - Full source , connecting Ruby and Erlang
The Erlang code is slightly longer , but very straightforward .
We declare a hello_world function and open a byte - oriented port to the Ruby interpreter .
From there , we send the command and block , waiting for the response .
Now we can post our tweet :
Eshell V5.6.5 ( abort with ^G ) 1 > c( twitter ) .
{ok , twitter} 2 > twitter:hello_world ( ) .
<< " Tweet sent !
Status id : 1358682092 " >>
Polyglot future : Imperative +
Declarative programming
While a trivial one , this is an incredibly powerful example of polyglot programming .
Languages such as Erlang , and functional / declarative programming in general , are definitely here to stay and will occupy an important architectural niche moving forward .
However , one paradigm does not have to come at the cost of another , and in fact , it is most likely the combination of both OO and functional programming that will be the cornerstone of our future architectures and applications .
The AP is reporting that two satellites just crashed 500 miles above Siberia in the first - ever in - orbit collision of two spacecrafts .

" We knew this was going to happen eventually , " Johnson Space Center orbital debris scientist Mark Matney told reporters , in what I imagine was the most Onion - esque quote from a NASA scientist this year .
One of the crafts was a 1,235 - lb Iridium communications satellite sent up in 1997 , and the other was a 1 - ton Russian satellite launched in 1993 that was presumed to be nonfunctioning — and out of control .
NASA is pinning the blame on the Russians .

They still do n't know how many pieces of debris were generated from this event , nor were they clear on how it would impact the ISS that 's floating at about half that orbital height .
There 's a shuttle mission scheduled for Feb. 22 , which may be delayed .
Previous collisions have involved discarded pieces and parts , apparently .
This is the first time that two whole satellites have pulled off a no- loser chicken tourney . [ AP ]

The krona has stabilised since interest rates were raised last year
The central bank of crisis - hit Iceland has cut its interest rate to 17 % .
The rate cut is the first since Iceland agreed a $ 10bn financial aid package with the International Monetary Fund .
The Sedlabanki cut rates by one percentage point from 18 % , where they had remained since October on the recommendation of the IMF .
Iceland 's financial system collapsed in October under the weight of debt , leading to a currency crisis , rising unemployment and public protests .
Iceland 's economy is forecast to shrink by almost 10 % this year .
The country 's currency , the krona , has stabilised since the October meltdown .
The central bank raised rates by six percentage points in October to the record high of 18 % .

T
he idea behind writer / director John Hamburg ’s “ I Love You , Man ” was probably spawned from the same Hollywood meeting responsible for some of the worst films of the last few years .
You could even envision a bunch of fortysomething blowhards sitting around a Starbucks sipping on Chai Lattes while they discuss the buzz worthiness of the term “ bromance . ”
But for as manufactured as the story may seem , the film rises above all that to deliver the next great R- rated comedy .
It might contain more chuckles than laugh - out - loud moments , but thanks to the incredible chemistry of its two leads , “ I Love You , Man ” stands as one of the best buddy comedies since “ Swingers . "
Paul Rudd stars as Peter Klaven , a real estate agent looking to close his first major deal ( “ The Incredible Hulk ” star Lou Ferrigno ’s mansion ) and invest the money in a new property .
He ’s also just proposed to his girlfriend of eight months , Zooey ( Rashida Jones ) , and when she expresses her concern that he wo n’t have a best man for the big day , Peter agrees to go on a series of man-dates in order to find himself a best friend .
After having no luck on his outings , Peter is ready to give up when he meets Sydney Fife ( Jason Segel ) at his open house .
The two immediately hit it off , and before long , they ’re spending every day together .
Zooey could n’t be happier that her soon - to - be husband finally has a male friend to hang out with , but when the new bromance threatens Peter ’s relationship with her , he ’s forced to reassess his future .
“ I Love You , Man ” has all the markings of a Judd Apatow film ( great characters , quotable dialogue , adult humor ) without any of the expectations .
Granted , its two stars have Apatow to thank for their recent careers , but it ’s still nice to see someone other than him make a solid R- rated comedy .
Then again , the very reason those movies worked as well as they did is because of the people involved , and without Jason Segel and Paul Rudd , “ I Love You , Man ” could have been a disaster .
Segel only gets better with each new role ( no doubt a result of the experience he ’s earned working on “ How I Met Your Mother ” ) , while Rudd absolutely commands the movie as the charming comic lead .
Rashida Jones is also good but underused as every man ’s dream fiancé , while the rest of the cast features some of the best comic actors working today .
Andy Samberg offers some much needed depth to the character of Peter ’s gay brother , while Jon Favreau and Jaime Pressly nearly steal the show as a couple whose marriage hinges on angry hate sex .
Veterans like Jane Curtain and J.K.
Simmons get about as much screen time as some of the other actors ( including hilarious cameos from “ The State ” alumni Thomas Lennon and Joe Lo Truglio ) , but they make the film better nonetheless .
There are a few things about “ I Love You , Man ” ( like Lou Ferrigno ’s extended cameo or Peter ’s habit of making up words ) that are n’t as funny as they probably should be , but the rest of the movie is so spot - on that it hardly matters .
It ’s been awhile since I ’ve seen a movie about male bonding as good as this ( “ Sideways ” comes to mind ) , and though the story is pretty formulaic , co-writers John Hamburg and Larry Levin do their best to keep it as fresh as possible .
Of course , when you ’ve got an ensemble cast as big and as talented as this , it ’s not too difficult to see why the film is such a success .
This is the romantic comedy that guys have been waiting for , and though your wife or girlfriend would probably be more than happy to tag along , why not treat your best pal instead ?
Single - Disc Blu-Ray Review :
The special features on “ I Love You , Man ” are far from extraordinary , but it ’s the level of quality that ’s impressive .
The audio commentary with director John Hamburg and stars Paul Rudd and Jason Segel is so enjoyable that you ’ll forget you even have it on , while the making - of featurette evades the typical EPK structure by using interviews with the cast that actually tell you something about the film other than the characters they play .
Also included is a series of alternate takes ( think Judd Apatow ’s Line - O - Rama feature ) , extended and deleted scenes , and an 11 - minute (! ) gag reel .
It ’s too bad the movie already ran a little long , because there ’s some pretty funny stuff that never made the cut .
Turkey 's main Kurdish political party has appealed for international support after hundreds of its officials were arrested in a crackdown by Turkish authorities .
The Democratic Society party ( DTP ) has written to members of the European parliament asking them to speak out against the arrests , which follow the party 's surprise success in last month 's local elections .
The DTP , the fourth largest party in the Turkish parliament with 20 seats , fears that the arrests will radicalise the Kurdish minority and make a solution to the Kurdish problem even more elusive .
About 40,000 people have died in the 25 - year conflict between the Turkish authorities and the outlawed Kurdistan Workers ' party ( PKK ) .
The DTP insists that the campaign for Kurdish language and cultural rights be pursued through political means , but the Turkish military considers the party a PKK front .
The DTP almost doubled the number of municipalities under its control from 56 to 98 in last month 's elections and came first in 10 provinces in eastern and south - eastern Turkey .
The results were a blow to Turkey 's prime minister , Recep Tayyip Erdogan , and his Justice and Development party ( AKP ) .
The party won almost 39 % of the vote , eight points less than in a general election two years ago , and lost 15 mayoralties .
Erdogan had described the election as a referendum on his leadership and said that anything less than 47 % of the vote would be a failure .
The poll setback came despite a strong drive against the DTP in its strongholds in the south - east .
Allegations were made of unfair practices , including handing out washing machines and other gifts to voters to persuade them not to vote for the DTP .
Unable to defeat the DTP at the ballot box , the AKP was now resorting to rougher measures , analysts said .
" Before the election , the AKP were talking about having good relations with Kurdish regional governments , an economic development plan and some cultural reforms , " said Mesut Yegen of the Middle East Technical University in Ankara .
" But they wanted to do so from a position of strength ; they do not recognise the PKK and the DTP as legitimate actors .
Erdogan has not grasped the seriousness of the Kurdish question . "
A Turkish court last week sentenced the mayor of Diyarbakir , Osman Baydemir , and the mayor of Batman , Nejdet Atalay , to 10 months in jail for spreading PKK propaganda .
In condemning a Turkish military incursion against PKK bases in neighbouring Iraq in February last year , Baydemir had said that " neither soldiers nor guerrillas should die " .
For using the word " guerrillas " he was charged with " spreading PKK propaganda " and " inciting separatism " under Turkey 's strict laws on freedom of speech .
The DTP is also facing the threat of being shut down in a case before the constitutional court .
Analysts say it is hard to see how the latest moves against the DTP will not influence the case , even though the evidence has already been compiled .
Ahmet Turk , the president of the DTP , struck a defiant note at a talk at Chatham House in London last week .
He told journalists : " They may put me in prison , they may kill me , but the struggle for Kurdish rights will continue . "
Human rights groups have expressed concern at the targeting of the DTP .
" The secrecy order on the investigation prevents us from knowing what the precise evidence consists of , but this is not a very constructive approach to the issue of minority rights in Turkey , an area that has seen very little progress in its negotiations on EU membership , " said Emma Sinclair - Webb , a researcher for Human Rights Watch in Istanbul .
Britain , a strong backer of Turkey 's EU membership bid , said the arrests were a matter for the Turkish courts , but added that it supported pluralism .
In his recent “ What if … ” common - sense call to reject US military interventionism around the world , Republican Representative Ron Paul sadly failed to mention the military intervention rampant in the economy of his own district .
Using the search tool at the website governmentcontractswon.com , I managed to find that between 2000 - 2007 , tens of millions of dollars of defense contracts have been awarded every year to businesses in his 14th District of Texas .
Some examples by Zip Code follow ; each code lies within Congressman Paul ’s district :
( Partial List , Zip Code followed by dollars 2000 - 07 )
77590 $ 67,868,434
$ 67,868,434 77592 $ 154,858
77550 $ 2,112,329
77551 $ 217,746
77554 $ 1,665,942
77539 $ 883,327
77546 $ 270,639
77573 $ 2,028,275
That means that for at least four election victories of the eleven he ’s won so far , the plucky Congressman , an internet hero to people who hate the government that created the internet , has been happily bringing home the federal bacon and actually supports the local branch of the military - industrial complex he seems to have such a problem with .
Indeed , his district contains bedroom communities to the south of Houston , whose own defense contracting totals run to the hundreds of millions of dollars .
The people who keep sending Ron Paul to Washington are defense industry workers and management – tens of thousands whose livelihoods depend on the very military interventionism he says he opposes .
Huh .
What if Ron Paul ’s isolationist posturing was n’t just a load of Texas - brand Republican horseshit ?
What if the firebrand rouser of angry white people who dwell in the country ’s many remote areas actually meant what he said at the lectern ?
What if he acted on it ?
What if he insisted that the defense contractors in his district who profit from and enable runaway US hegemony , who build its weapons and systems and support , close their doors ?
What if he told them to move to another district ?
What if he adopted the slightest consistency in his positions ?
What if he quit pretending to be against US war machinery and moved to stop manufacturing it in his own backyard ?
Of course , he can’t .
And that is the truly insidious nature of the military - industrial complex that he is , after all , absolutely right to rail against .
The gargantuan work of spending an amount on defense that is larger than all foreign defense spending combined is a project spread out evenly across every state and every congressional district in the United States .
We are , and have been since 1941 , on a coast - to - coast war - footing economy that employs millions .
Practically nobody in Congress can stand up against the true nature of the problem without endangering their seats – base closures and factory closures mean lost votes .
And the factories are everywhere , just like in the Texas 14th District .
So practically all elected representatives keep their heads down on the problem , the decades drag on , and the wars of choice add up .
Injustice intensifies , the country becomes far poorer , and Ron Paul supporters post comments on YouTube blaming the problem on , of course , Jews .
I have a better idea .
Let me ask the Paulies reading this to contact the Congressman – preferably by FedEx or UPS so as not to use the Big Government Post Office – and urge him to capitalize off the head - start he has earned by opposing US interventionism .
Call for him to shut down defense contracting in the Texas 14th district .
Now .
Otherwise , Ron Paul is just another hypocrite .
What if he was n’t ?
no hurry ... .. has only been nockin for twinty minnuts .

Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin had to make a tough choice in filling a vacant slot on her state ’s Supreme Court : Appoint a woman who once served on the board of Planned Parenthood , or risk giving an environmentalist lawyer , also pro-choice on abortion , the chance to become an activist judge .
Mrs. Palin , a pro-lifer who ran as the Republican vice presidential candidate last fall , rankled social conservatives by choosing Anchorage Superior Court Judge Morgan Christen , the woman with Planned Parenthood ties , over Eric Smith .
Wendy Wright , president of Concerned Women for America ( CWA ) , said the appointment has “ caused many of us to take a step back .
We ’re surprised . ”
Members of the Alaska Family Council ( AFC ) , a nonprofit devoted to advancing socially conservative causes , encouraged Mrs. Palin to appoint Mr. Smith , and more than 100 people sent letters to the governor ’s office urging her to do so .
But Mrs. Palin ultimately chose Judge Christen and said “ I have every confidence that Judge Christen has the experience , intellect , wisdom and character to be an outstanding Supreme Court Justice . ”
“ When we looked into it , we felt Morgan Christen was probably the one who would be most in opposition to our issues , ” AFC President Jim Minnery said .
“ From everything we could tell , even though he was probably not in line with our values , he was the lesser of two evils . ”
He admitted , however , that Mrs. Palin was “ backed into a corner ” by the state ’s system for selecting judges , known as the “ Missouri Plan . ”
Alaska ’s constitution requires an independent panel to vet and then submit choices to the governor when positions on the court open up .
The only names the panel submitted for consideration were Judge Christen and Mr. Smith - neither an obvious conservative choice .
“ She did n’t have the ability to go out and pick anyone she wanted , ” said Palin communications director Bill McAllister .
Mr. Smith is a former executive director of a public interest environmental law firm that is working to get the Cook Inlet beluga whale listed as an endangered species .
The governor opposes the listing on grounds that the environmental protections that accompany the classification would hinder the state ’s energy development .
On the campaign trail , Mrs. Palin frequently cheered “ Drill , baby , drill ! ” to support increased energy exploration and recently unveiled a plan to build more power plants around Alaska ’s existing rail system .
Some conservatives have suggested Mrs. Palin should have rejected both candidates by sending them back to the panel .
Former Alaska Gov. Frank Murkowski employed a similar tactic to protest previous judicial candidates , but was unsuccessful in getting the panel to give him more choices .
Mr. McAllister dismissed that option , saying his boss “ followed the constitution ” and “ had to pick among two people , which is the way it is set up . ”
He noted that several other states use a similar process to choose judges .
Former Missouri Gov. Matt Blunt , a Republican who represented the state where the model originated , strongly opposes it .
Some conservatives do n’t see the Alaska Constitution as an excuse .
“ The fact she was n’t willing to stand up and fight this is something ( they ) will seriously question on the national stage , ” Family Research Council Action Vice President Tom McCluskey said .
Mrs. Wright of CWA said she ’d like to give Mrs. Palin the “ benefit of the doubt ” but said the Alaska governor will ultimately be held accountable if Judge Christen makes decisions hurting the pro-life cause .
“ That ’s the responsibility a person takes if they become governor or president , ” Mrs. Wright said .
“ They are responsible for their choices . ”
“ We ’ll be watching , ” she added .

Cosmonauts on the ISS say they are no longer permitted to use US facilities The International Space Station , once a place where astronauts would share food and facilities , is said to be embroiled in a Cold War - like stand - off .
A Russian cosmonaut has complained he is no longer allowed to use a US toilet as well as a US exercise bike .
Gennady Padalka , 50 , told Russia 's Novaya Gazeta newspaper the lack of sharing was lowering the crew 's morale .
The veteran cosmonaut said the problem was due to the ISS becoming a more commercial operation .
For several years after his first space mission in 1998 , Mr Padalka and his American colleagues worked in total harmony , he told the newspaper .
But space missions became more commercial in 2003 and Moscow started billing Washington for sending its astronauts into space , he said .
Other nations responded in kind , he added .
Space issues
" What is going on has an adverse effect on our work , " said Mr Padalka , 50 , a veteran of two space missions who is to be the station 's next commander .
Padalka complimented the quality of the US amenities on the space station Before he lifted off to join the ISS crew on Thursday , Mr Padalka had asked whether he could use a US gym to stay fit .
" They told me : ' Yes , you can . '
Then they said no , " Novaya Gazeta quoted him as saying .
" Then they hold consultations and they approve it again .
And now , right before the flight , it turns out again that the answer is negative . "
Worse still , the regulations now required US and Russian cosmonauts to eat their own rations , he added .
" They also recommend us to only use national toilets , " the newspaper quoted him as saying .
" Cosmonauts are above the ongoing squabble , no matter what officials decide , " he told the newspaper .
" It 's politicians and bureaucrats who can't reach agreement , not us . "
The situation may be exacerbated by an increase in the number of astronauts living on the ISS .
Until now only three astronauts lived on the International Space Station at any one time .
But last week , a Russian Soyuz rocket blasted off from Kazakhstan to ferry Mr Padalka and two other crew - members to the ISS .
It docked safely on Saturday .
While doubling the number of crew will allow more scientific research to be carried out , it will also mean there will be less room for visitors .
Among the new crew was US billionaire Charles Simonyi , 60 , a software tycoon who paid $ 35 m ( £ 24 m ) for his 13 - day trip , during which he will help with research projects and take part in live broadcasts with schools .

VINA DEL MAR , Chile ( Reuters ) - U.S. Vice President Joe Biden said on Saturday the United States would not lift the country ’s embargo on Cuba .
“ No , ” Biden told reporters at a meeting in Chile when asked if the United States planned to lift the embargo .
“ We think that Cuban people should determine their own fate and they should be able to live in freedom and have some prospect of economic prosperity , ” he added .
Several South American defense ministers this month urged President Barack Obama to lift the embargo on Cuba , saying such a move was crucial to improve U.S. ties with the region .
“ Obama and I made it clear during our campaign that we thought there ’s a need for transition in our policy toward Cuba , ” Biden added .
The U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation last month to ease restrictions on trade with Cuba and family travel to the island .
Supporters hoped the congressional action would be a first step toward reviewing and possibly reversing the decades - old U.S. policy of shunning Cuba .
Obama has made clear he favors relaxing limits on family travel and cash remittances by Cuban Americans to Cuba , although he has said the U.S. trade embargo should stay in place to press for democratic reforms .

The EU's Industry Committee has voted to agree the Commission 's proposed cap on calls home of €.40 a minute , and €.11 for text messages , but has undercut the Commission in asking for per-second billing and data rates of €.50 / MB wholesale .
The Industry Committee is made up of MEPs , and it is the Committee that takes recommendations from the Commission to the Parliament where they can become EU law , often amending them on the way .
In this instance the price of calls and texts remains as proposed by the Commission , but the rate for wholesale data is lowered and per-second billing is extended to the very start of the call .
The caps on roaming costs within the EU are intended to drift downwards over time , and the proposals from the EU Commission are part of that process , but did n't go far enough for the MEPs of the Committee .
The Commission recommended per-second billing for roaming calls within Europe after the first 30 seconds , and a wholesale data rate of € 1 / MB .
The Industry Committee has amended that to a proposal for wholesale data cap of €.50 , and per-second billing from the outset .
That data rate is what operators charge each other , but should be reflected in lower bills for anyone travelling within the EU .
The Committee did endorse the Commission 's recommendation that the price of voice calls should drop to €.40 per minute , by July 2010 , with incoming calls costing no more than €.16 .
The cap on text messaging , at €.11 , should come in a year earlier - at the end of June 2009 .
But calls from the Commission that regulation should be extended into 2013 were rejected by the Committee that reckons the EU should step back a bit and let the industry compete for a while .
The Commission also recommended a compulsory limit on spending while roaming - so operators would have to cut a connection before the bill rises beyond a specified level .
The MEPs of the Committee felt that on - screen warnings and / or text messages would serve , with some sort of authorising action necessary to avoid data being cut off at €50 .
The Committee also chucked voicemail into the mix - specifying that operators wo n't be allowed to pay to collect voicemail while roaming , after July 2010 .
These proposals now have to go to through informal negotiations , to ensure they are n't shot down when presented to parliament .
The results of those negotiations are voted by the Committee at the end of March , and the final proposal will appear before the Parliament around the end of April , after which we should be on track of cheaper phone calls , as long as we do n't venture outside the EU .
Attacks targeting Shiite pilgrims bound for the holy city of Karbala rocked Baghdad on Wednesday , leaving 20 dead and more than 60 injured , government officials said .
The attacks ended a monthlong lull in violence that accompanied Iraq ’s parliamentary elections , when security was at an all - time high in the capital .
The bloodshed also appeared to be timed to the climax of an annual 40 - day period of mourning for Shiite Muslim faithful , a period in which Sunni Arab insurgent attacks had become commonplace in the years after the 2003 U.S. - led invasion of Iraq .
The deadliest incident occurred at a busy bus terminal in Bayaa , in southern Baghdad , when two car bombs exploded , killing 18 and injuring 50 .
The bombs had been planted in parked cars near buses bound for Karbala , according to police and witnesses .
Ammar Hussein , 25 , said he and a friend had just arrived at the station looking for a mini- bus to Karbala .
Suddenly , he heard a loud explosion and everything around him turned black .

“ I lost consciousness , and when I woke up I saw that my left leg was bleeding , ” Hussein said .
“ I was taken to a hospital and was crying the whole time because I do n’t know what happened to my friend . ”
Hussein said he could not understand why he and other pilgrims were attacked .
“ What did I do to deserve this ? ” he said .
“ This is the doing of those who are cowardly and low . ”
Earlier in the day , a roadside bomb exploded in the northern Waziriya neighborhood , killing two Shiite pilgrims and injuring a dozen people .
Six of the injured were riding past the scene in a bus when the bomb detonated .

Thousands of pilgrims from throughout Iraq walk or drive to Karbala to mark Arbaeen , the end of a 40 - day mourning period for Imam Hussein , grandson of the prophet Muhammad .
Karbala is roughly 50 miles south of Baghdad , and streets leading in and out of the capital have been choked by throngs of pilgrims .
In past years , Sunni Muslim insurgents have carried out attacks on Shiite pilgrims and religious sites .
Wednesday ’s attacks also corresponded with a rotation of U.S. troops in Baghdad .
Throughout Iraq , terrorists have often stepped up attacks during such periods of transition .
At a transfer of authority ceremony at Camp Liberty in Baghdad on Tuesday , the 1st Cavalry Division took over responsibility for the Baghdad area of operations from the 4th Infantry Division .
The ceremony marked the third time the two Army units , based at Ft. Hood , Texas , have transferred control of the Baghdad area to each other .
Over the last 12 months , the 4th Infantry Division saw an 80 % drop in the frequency of attacks against civilians in Baghdad and surrounding areas , said Army Lt. Gen.
Lloyd Austin III , commanding general of the Multinational Corps in Iraq .

Elsewhere Wednesday , Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki received a special delegation from Iran , signaling closer ties between the two countries , which fought a war in the 1980s .
Maliki said talks with Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki were aimed at improving political , economic , trade and defense relations with Iran .
In particular , Maliki noted that Iraq is experiencing drought - related problems and that he hoped the two nations could work together on that issue .
A statement from Maliki ’s press office said that Mottaki congratulated Iraq on the success of its recent parliamentary elections .

" We 're All Keynesians Again " shouted the Wall Street Journal 's opinion page recently .
The collapse of the financial markets and the subsequent recession , depression , banana , or whatever you want to call it , has the intelligentsia screaming for government money as prescribed by John Maynard Keynes so many years ago .
And what with all college undergraduates receiving an economics education in Keynesianism and nothing but , no wonder government intervention is thought to be the cure for what ails the punk economy .
Of course the fact is that the current funk is the result of Keynesian policies , and more of it will just prolong the downturn .
But it was n't so long ago that Keynes was out of favor .
Back in 1983 , the hundredth anniversary of Keynes 's birth , Forbes magazine declared that it was not Keynes who knew the way , but another economist who shared the same birth year as Keynes — Joseph Schumpeter .
Instead of the government intervention that Keynesians demand to prop up the economy and failed businesses of all types , Schumpeter believed that capitalism is driven by entrepreneurs whose innovations replace old worn - out business models in a process he called " creative destruction . "
Keynes and Schumpeter were not only contemporaries , but also rivals who had a " distaste for each other 's work , " according to Harvard business professor Thomas K. McCraw , author of Prophet of Innovation : Joseph Schumpeter and Creative Destruction .
And the lives of the two economists could n't have been more different .
As McCraw describes , " Keynes grew up in the cocoon of the English upper middle class . "
He lived a sheltered life , with a father who was a respected economist at Cambridge University , and a mother who was the mayor of Cambridge .
His brother went on to be a well - known surgeon .
Keynes attended Eton and then Cambridge , where " his homosexuality was generally accepted as ordinary , " McCraw writes .
In contrast , Schumpeter 's life was anything but sheltered .
Born in Austria , his father died when he was four .
And by the time he married Elizabeth Boody ( his third wife ) , he had lived in nine cities and five countries , relocating his household twenty - three times .
After starting as an " academic boy wonder , " he published books in his twenties , had a brief career as Austria 's finance minister in his thirties , had a banking career , and earned a fortune that he subsequently lost in the stock - market crash .
Returning to academics , he moved to the United States and taught at Harvard .
But while he was world famous , Schumpeter was also penniless .
McCraw 's very readable account does n't focus on Schumpeter 's economic theories , but instead on the man and his tumultuous life , which included what the author describes as " the bumbling FBI 's investigation of [ Schumpeter ] and Elizabeth about the Office of Production Management 's rejection of her services . "
Despite the many tragedies he endured , Schumpeter " always behaved in public like a Continental bon vivant , " McCaw recounts .
He wore expensive tailored clothes and confessed that it took him an hour to dress .
He loved women and women loved him back .
In the author 's view , Schumpeter was constantly being saved by the women who loved him , putting " his well - being above their own . "
Schumpeter told many that he aspired to be the greatest economist , lover , and horseman in the world — but then would add that he was having trouble with the horses .
Although he was of Austrian descent and was a student of Eugen von Böhm - Bawerk , Schumpeter cannot be considered part of the Austrian School .
He never opposed government intervention like his classmate Ludwig von Mises .
But in addition to Schumpeter 's contributions in the area of entrepreneurship and innovation , his book History of Economic Analysis — which , if not for the efforts of Elizabeth Boody after his death , would not have seen the light of day — exposed Adam Smith as unoriginal and praised Turgot as the 18th century 's greatest economist instead .
Innovation is what raises living standards over time .
Businesses that do n't innovate will fail , and it is competition that drives that innovation .
Businesspeople are , " in a situation that is sure to change presently , " McCraw quotes Schumpeter from Capitalism , Socialism and Democracy , " standing on ground that is crumbling beneath their feet . "
But the busts that inevitably follow a central - bank - liquidity - induced boom must be allowed to liquidate unprofitable enterprises and outmoded business strategies as a windstorm fells rotted trees , clearing the way for new growth .
With the world economies currently experiencing a wicked downdraft that is correcting the malinvestments of the past decade , the new crop of Keynesians are stumping loudly for reflation .
Such was the case in 1933 during the first Great Depression .
" Discussions arose in many countries about public inflationary measures as a way to stop price slides , " McCraw writes .
" Having witnessed Austrian hyperinflation a decade earlier , Schumpeter believed policies of ' reflation ' to be a bad idea . "
Schumpeter shared F.A. Hayek 's view that " neither reflation or price stabilization would be effective . "
In a speech to the American Economic Association in 1948 , Schumpeter told an audience of Keynesians that Keynes was blinded by his ideology of stagnationism : underemployment equilibrium that required government stimulus to be overcome .
He went on to remind the audience that the heart of the capitalist process was its endless dynamism , which was the opposite of Keynesian stagnationism .
Schumpeter may not have been the strongest free - market advocate , but he would surely be dismayed by the current worship of Keynesian interventionism , which will ultimately stifle the entrepreneurial genius that drives capitalism and improved living standards .
President Barack Obama has finished the second leg of his international confession tour .
In less than 100 days , he has apologized on three continents for what he views as the sins of America and his predecessors .
Mr. Obama told the French ( the French ! ) that America " has shown arrogance and been dismissive , even derisive " toward Europe .
In Prague , he said America has " a moral responsibility to act " on arms control because only the U.S. had " used a nuclear weapon . "

Brazil 's president blamed " white people with blue eyes " for the world economic crisis and said it was wrong that developing countries should pay for mistakes made in richer countries , sparking accusations of racism .
President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva , who has criticized the European Union and the US for tariffs on products from developing countries and has advocated a bigger say for developing countries in decisions on the world economy , pointed a finger to Western bankers .
" This crisis was caused by the irrational behavior of white people with blue eyes , who thought they knew everything and now show they know nothing , " Lula da Silva said after a meeting with the UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown in the country 's capital of Brasilia .
Lula da Silva 's comments were widely reported in the press and drew charges of racism from message boards and CNBC viewers .

In the depression of the1890s , the term for a breadline was a Cleveland Cafe , named after the Wall Street puppet who turned the government over to JP Morgan , London , and their cross of gold .

In the 1930s , a shanty town was a Hooverville .
In this depression , the wretched victims of foreclosure by Obama ’s pals at Goldman Sachs , Citibank , and JP Morgan live and die in OBAMAVILLES .
The arrogant elitist in the White House does not care .
Obama is presiding over a $ 10 trillion bank bailout , all money down a rat hole .
Meanwhile , Obama ’s so - called anti-foreclosure program is an incentive payment bonanza for predatory subprime lenders – the Angelo Mozillos of Countrywide and their ilk , who sold subprime Adjustable Rate Mortgages which should have been illegal all along .
Want to stop foreclosures ?
It ’s easy : pass a law making foreclosure on any primary residence , family farm , or business a federal crime — for five years , or for the duration of the depression , whichever is longer .
Put a family out on the street , shut down a farm , close a factory , and the banker goes to Leavenworth .
Start with the great foreclosers — Dimon of JP Morgan , Pandit the Bandit of Citibank , Lewis of Bank of America , Blankfein of Goldman Sachs , and the other zombie bankers .
Do n’t let them destroy Detroit , Toledo , Stockton , or any other American city .

To get a recovery , wipe out the $ 1.5 quadrillion of financial derivatives like those of AIG , which have already cost US taxpayers $ 190 billion on the way to at least $ 400 billion .
Outlaw the hedge fund hyenas that bid up the price of gas in 2008 .
Re-regulate financial and commodity markets , and bring back the uptick rule and the ban on naked shorts at the SEC .
And for families facing foreclosure , play for time by saying the magic words : “ PRODUCE THE NOTE . ”
To throw you out on the street , the banksters have to show the original piece of paper you signed .
In many cases this has been securitized and sent to London or Zurich , and it may take months to find .
The predators may even forget about you and go on to more gullible targets – like the dupes who still believe in the inherent justice and infallibility of the non-existent “ free market . ”

Created in 1930 , with a banana cream filling , rather than the vanilla of today , Twinkies  love ’em or hate ’em  are about as emblematic as junk food gets .
With 39 ingredients , 150 shamelessly empty calories and , officially , a shelf life of about three weeks , the Twinkie is a cream - filled symbol of American culture .
Their mysterious longevity even earned them a joke in “ Wall - E , ” Pixar ’s postapocalyptic robot love story .
Hostess Brands was acquired in 1995 by Interstate and today employs 22,000 people in 41 bakeries .
But Interstate succumbed in September 2004 to various ailments , including the low - carb Atkins and South Beach Diets .
Burt P. Flickinger III of the Strategic Resource Group , a retail consulting firm , said Interstate faces stiff competition from rivals like Sara Lee .
In light of the recession , even Hostess , the cream in Interstate ’s Twinkie , might have to lower prices , he said .
Craig D. Jung , Interstate ’s chief executive , said the company was working to adapt to tougher times and healthier snacking .
It will expand its line of calorie - conscious snacks like Twinkie Bites , which have 100 calories a pack .

Several photographs taken by NASA ’s Phoenix Mars spacecraft show what look like water droplets clinging to one of its landing struts .
Some of the scientists working on the mission are asserting that that is exactly what they were .
They contend that there are pockets of liquid water just under the Martian surface even though the temperatures in the northern plains never warmed above minus 15 degrees Fahrenheit during the six months of Phoenix ’s operations last year .
The scientists believe that salts may have lowered the freezing temperature of the Martian water droplets to perhaps minus 90 degrees , or more than 120 degrees colder than the usual freezing temperature of 32 degrees for pure water .
Nilton O. Renno , a professor of atmospheric , oceanic and space sciences at the University of Michigan who proposed the hypothesis , was careful to say , “ This is not a proof . ”
How to Find True Love
Photo by Stock Photo
While “ How to Get Over a Breakup ” was the number one requested article topic I ’ve written on , it ’s not surprising that a close second is the topic of How to Find True Love .
Here ’s an email from one reader :
“ I ’ve realized that one of my main goals is to find a worthwhile and long term relationship .
I noticed you have entries on how to keep a relationship and on how to end a relationship so would you consider writing an entry on what you perceive to be the best way to find a worthwhile relationship .
How to avoid making the same mistakes , overcoming fears , keeping up motivation after failure etc . ”
– Gary ( Dublin , Ireland )
Regardless of our culture , our level of education or economic status , at the depth of all of us are the same desires - to love , to be loved , and to be happy .
Of course we could add other desires to this list , like money and wealth and fancy things , but when you drill into these things , the reason for wanting them is so that we can appear more desirable , and will hopefully be loved and accepted .
If love is something so fundamentally important to us , then why is it that we have so many issues and misunderstandings in the area of finding it ?
I think the answer is simple , that most of us have never been educated in this fundamental area of our development .
Chances are , you did n’t grow up with parents who were relationship experts , and we certainly did n’t study relationships in our high school curriculums .
For most of us , it ’s been an adventure in trial and error and learning through pain and heart - break .
But is there an easier way ?
In light of Valentine ’s Day approaching this week , I am going to touch on one of my favorite topics of all time : finding love .
Personal Story
I spent most of my time in my late teens and early twenties on finding love , or so I thought at the time .
In actuality I was seeking self - acceptance , approval and identity .
I was deeply insecure and had a great fear of being alone .
I jumped from relationship to relationship , all the while searching for myself .
But the act of seeking self - worth through my external relationships took me further from that which I longed .
I ’ve always been an ambitious person and in addition to my job , I ’ve often worked on side projects and other interests .
But whenever I found myself in a relationship , I would drop everything that was important to me and would focus exclusively on the person I was dating .
You see , I did n’t respect myself , and I thought that finding someone to love me was more important than anything else .
During these time - consuming romantic courtships , I was distancing myself further from my passions , my purpose and my true self .
Looking back , I had entered many of these relationships out of infatuation or loneliness .
It was the fear of abandonment or the guilt of obligation that kept me in these relationships .
I often got into and remained involved in relationships for the wrong reasons .
I would convince myself that no one else out there would love me , and so I settled .
Despite my surface appearance , I was deeply unhappy .
My freedom day came roughly two years ago .
In a state of deep depression over unsatisfied relationships and through a growing despise of my gross dependencies on them , a miraculous understanding came to me and I experienced a moment of clarity .
At that moment I made a vow to end the pain .
( Read my detailed journal entry from that day here . )
I started to devour as much material and wisdom as I could find on the topic of relationships , and studied ( and continue to study ) with relationship expert Alison Armstrong .
I have come a long way from being that insecure little girl , and have learned much about myself in the process .
Most importantly I discovered that once I started to truly love myself , and to focus on my own inner peace and wellness , true love came looking for me .
Problematic Relationship Patterns
Let ’s first look at some common relationship problems and why many romantic partnerships do not work out .
1. Ego , Fear , & Emotional Insecurities
As with material possessions or professional achievements , relationships give our ego a method by which to identify who we are to the outside world .
The problem is that we attach so much of our identity to the external appearance of our relationships that we lose touch with the parts of ourselves that are wise and conscious .
The attachment to this false identity leads to a feeling of desperation rather than fulfillment .
After all , without the relationship , or the job , or whichever other false identity we have chosen , who would we be ?
Besides the ego identification , it ’s easy to develop a dependency on companionship .
That independent person that we once were starts to evaporate .
Our mind becomes fogged and as our self - identification begins to attach itself to the other person , unconsciously or consciously , we become afraid to lose that person .
We become dependent on that person and fearful of loneliness .
Out of our emotional insecurities , we start to become needy and to seek out validation from our partner .
So , instead of focusing on the celebration of love and partnership , it becomes a game of how to protect ourselves from loss .
2. Communication of Needs
Out of a desire to avoid appearing needy and out of a fear of losing our partner , we start to filter what we say .
In doing so , we do not communicate our needs clearly , openly or bravely .
We somehow become convinced that our partner will magically know what to do to fulfill our needs .
When our needs are not met , we secretly blame the other person and begin to resent them .
When we are unhappy , our partner will pick up on the cues , and in turn , secretly resent us , thus starting a vicious cycle in the silent destruction of a romantic partnership .
So much of what needed to be said was not said , and bad feelings are bottled up and start to accumulate for both parties .
Have you ever had a friend come to you and complain about all of the things they are unhappy about with their partner ?
Those are the kinds of things they should be telling their partner , if they actually want a change .
Worse yet is when one partner openly communicates their needs only to find that the other party is simply not listening , or does not fully acknowledge what was said , or makes them feel guilty for having those needs .
3. Bad Fit and Settling by Default
Deep down , we are all really good people .
But this does n’t mean that any combination of two good people will make a good partnership .
There is such thing as a bad fit , and it is okay to admit it .
The best fits are ones where the most important values for both people are met .
They must have life goals that align with one another and have a mutual attraction , understanding , and level of respect for each other .
Both people must be committed to making the partnership their top priority .
Sometimes , even when we realize that our relationship is n’t a good fit , we justify staying in it with what seem like logical reasons .
We may feel that we wo n’t find another person who accepts and loves us as much as the current partner .
Or we may be afraid to be alone , so we simply settle by default .
Each time we are reminded of the bad fit , we brush it under the rug and distract ourselves with some other thought .
We may feel that we are doing a service to the other person by staying in the relationship , but in reality , we are hurting them by not being honest with them and ourselves .
And we are accumulating bad feelings and bad energy in our inner space .
Who Is Your Ideal Mate ?
We all have a rough idea of what our perfect partner is like : beautiful , or smart , or rich , or educated , or tall , or petite , or pale , or dark , or handsome , or fit , with this car , or with that house or whatever else that strikes our fancy .

The problem comes when we find ourselves in a relationship and we are constantly comparing our partners with this conjured - up ‘ perfect ’ person .
When that happens , we stop appreciating our partner for all the beautiful qualities they do possess .
The truth is this perfect person does not exist .
More importantly , we may not actually need all of these qualities in a partner to be extraordinarily happy .
What we need is to identify the most important qualities that we must have in order to feel satisfied and fulfilled ( more on creating a must - have list below ) .
By not having identified the must - have qualities in our chosen life partner , we end up settling , and since the person cannot give us the things we truly need , we start to resent them .
This will snowball into larger issues .
For example , if height is something that is really important to you , and your partner does not meet that height requirement , regardless of how much they try , they will never grow taller or shrink shorter , and this will bug you and affect your union .
In life , we will get random results if we have not specified what we want .
Identifying and understanding what it is that we need in a relationship , allows us to set clear intentions , and in doing so , moves us closer to realizing our intended desires .
Identifying Must - Haves
Here ’s a very affective exercise that I picked up from Alison Armstrong that will help you discover and identify the must - have qualities in your partner .
I highly recommend taking at least 10 minutes to go through this , even if you are presently in a relationship .
Grab a pen and some paper .
Find a place where you wo n’t be interrupted .
Turn off the phone , the TV , the computer .
Ready ?
Here we go :
Step 1 . The Perfect Image
On a blank piece of paper , list out all the qualities that your ideal partner will have .
What kind of characteristics and qualities do you truly desire ?
Be creative and open .
Use a bullet pointed list , not sentences .
List out as many as possible , and use as many pieces of paper as needed .
Be as specific as you can .
Get into details like physical attributes , values , lifestyle , views on money , spiritual beliefs , personality traits , hobbies , abilities , age , habits , profession , tastes , etc .
For physical attributes , include things like height , weight , body type , hair color , ethnicity , or anything that you would want if you had your choice in creating your ideal partner .
Step 2 . Minimum Requirements ( MR )
Minimum requirements are qualities you need from your partner , and without them , you will feel unwell or unsatisfied .
Go through each quality from step 1 and test it with this question :
“ Would I rather be alone than be with a person who was n’t [ insert quality ] ? ”
If the answer is yes , mark MR next to the quality , otherwise , leave it blank .
Do n’t worry if your list sounds superficial or ridiculous .
One MR item on my list is “ Great dancer with rhythm and groove ” , which may seem like a trivial or petty quality for some people , but is a deal breaker for me .
Step 3 . Screening MRs
Now , filter through the MR list , for each item with the MR label , ask the following question :
“ If a person had all the other qualities on my MR list , am I willing to let this quality go ? ”
If the answer is yes , cross out that MR .
The Selection Process
I believe it is crucial to identify and clearly communicate our relationship expectations and personal timelines early on in the dating phase .
So often , we get into relationships with silent expectations of a future event that is important to us , thinking that our partner will come around to it when the time is right , only to find out several years later that things will never work out the way we expected .
Some common unspoken issues of this nature revolve around marriage , children , financial goals , and even which city you settle down in .
First , be clear with yourself on these types of issues .
Understand what kind of commitment you are looking for in a relationship , how you feel about children and where you plan to live .
There are no wrong answers , but be honest and specific about what you are looking for in the current stage of your life .
Next , tell yourself that on all of your first dates , you will be clear with people about your relationship expectations and timeline , if any .
It can be a scary and awkward experience at first , but it will become less of a nerve racking experience over time .
And just think of all the time and emotional energy you are saving by being open from the get - go , instead of setting silent expectations that can lead to disappointment .

On my first dates with any guy , I found that telling them my expectations was pretty nerve - racking , especially for men I was really attracted to , since they could potentially run the other way .
I would begin to tell myself that this would be too much of a shocking conversation for most people to handle on a first date .
Why not just wait until date 5 or 6 , when I know that he really likes me ?
The answer is that by then I would have emotionally attached myself to this person and would then be in a situation where I would either have to settle for less than what I wanted , or break it off .
It would have been much better to have learned on the first date whether or not we were a good fit .
Personally , I was looking for a husband and to start a family .
I would tell them that I wanted to get married before I turned 30 and to start making babies within two years of getting married .
Oh , and I would also like to have two children .
“ Are you okay with that timeline ? ” I would ask them .
The men who were okay with my timeline stayed and the ones who were n’t went away .
No hurt feelings and everyone wins .
Many of us have latched onto this concept of finding “ the one ” person out there for us , and so we linger in every relationship that pops up , fearing that we might miss out on “ the one ” .
Think about the fact that there are 6.8 billion people on the planet .
Does n’t it make more sense that “ the one ” is more likely to be “ the one - hundred - thousand ” ?
I genuinely believe that there are a countless number of people out there who will be great fits for us , and it ’s just a matter of filtering through potential partners until we find one of them .
As such , communicating your desires , needs and expectations , ahead of time , becomes crucial .
For example , if having children is of utmost importance to you and your partner is set against having kids , then likely the relationship will not last and both parties are wasting time in the process .
Dating should n’t be about settling out of a fear that a better fit might not come along .
I believe that dating is about identifying the qualities you need in a person and in a relationship , and then “ filtering ” through as many people as it takes until you find someone who possesses all the important qualities that you need .
Have you ever had the experience of shopping for a car , and found that once you targeted in on the exact make , model , and color you wanted , you began to see that car everywhere ?
From my personal experience , I found that once I became clear with what I needed and expected in a partner and in a relationship , more eligible bachelors who had those qualities started showing up in my life .
Love Yourself First
As I mentioned in the article How to Overcome Breakups , the art of loving yourself is not only important in the healing process from love lost , but also in finding love .
I believe that we cannot truly allow others to love us , until we first love ourselves .
Another way of looking at this is to imagine each person in a relationship as a wooden stick .
If one person is independent and the other is dependent , it ’s like one stick is standing perfectly vertical and the second stick is leaning against the vertical stick .
If the vertical stick moves horizontally , the leaning stick will fall .
When two people are both independent and joined together through love , it ’s like two sticks standing vertically .
When they join together , they become a larger and stronger stick and they become interdependent and stronger .
If one stick moves horizontally , the other stick will move with it .
Practice loving yourself : take yourself on a date , do things that please and relax you , spend quality time with yourself , write love letters to yourself , practice saying and feeling “ I love you ” in the mirror .

Additionally , the practice of loving yourself makes you a more attractive person to the outside world .
When you truly love yourself , you will exude and spread a magnetic energy to those around you .
Before you know it , you will be surrounded by those attracted to you for who you really are .
Forgiving Our Ex’s
When we hold onto unresolved issues from previous relationships , they become emotional baggage in our future relationships .
I ’ve found forgiving your ex’s to be a liberating exercise that contributes to the wellbeing of yourself and your future relationships .
A few years ago I sat down with , or phoned , several of my ex-boyfriends , and apologized for hurt feelings I may have caused , and expressed and forgave them for my own hurt feelings from the relationship .
This experience brought closure to those relationships , removed the baggage , and allowed new friendships to develop .
A Few Words On Sex
For those of us who are sexually active , I would like to point out one thing .
When you have an orgasm , there is a chemical change that takes place in your body .
In particular , your body releases a hormone called oxytocin that binds you emotionally to the other person .
For a man , the effects of this hormone last for 48 hours .
For a woman , the effects last for 14 days .
This explains why , after having sex with someone who is clearly a bad fit for us , we can end up in a relationship with them , even if it ’s for a short amount of time .
Far too often , these relationships can turn into long term relationships that ultimately end badly .
It is recommended by relationship experts to not have sex during your dating and selection process unless you are okay with being emotionally bound to that person or having that person be emotionally bound to you for 14 days .
Alison recommends not having sex with someone unless they fit all the qualities on your MR list .
For more information on this topic , read chapter four of “ The Female Brain “ , by Dr. Louann Brizendine .
Parting Words
People often ask , “ Where should I go to find this person ? ”
The logical answer provided by most is to go to places where such a person would hang out , but this practice can often lead to disappointment .
My suggestion is to go through the exercises above to gain clarity on what you need and the types of relationships you want .
Then spend time practicing the art of self - loving , while being open to the idea of your ideal mate entering your life .
I would not actively seek it .
Instead spend your efforts on self development .
As with all things of the heart , there is an ingredient of magic in finding love .
There are no coincidences .
Everything happens for a reason .
Love is beautiful and unpredictable .
The best thing we can do is to start to become the most outstanding person possible .
The universe will know when we are ready , and when we are , true love will happen , unexpectedly .

This time , the topic was functional programming in general , and not just one language in particular .
It was a lot of fun to talk with those guys about a subject I ’m quite passionate about .
I also recently recorded a Channel9 interview with Erik Meijer on the same subject which should be posted soon .

Today is Presidents Day , and if you are looking to celebrate in the traditional manner , may I recommend making a mattress purchase ?
For some reason , Presidents Day is one of those holidays that seems to be accompanied by a sale on mattresses .
So to me , buying a mattress is a uniquely American way to celebrate a uniquely American Holiday .
What better way to pull this country out of a recession , then to have a sale on Sealy Posturepedics ?
When I think of mattresses , I think of the wacky mascots used by companies that make and sell mattresses .
Why these companies believe a cartoon mascot is required in order to sell us a Beauty Rest , I have no idea , but the results are often a bit amusing .
So logically enough , for Presidents Day I present to you a collection of those wacky mascots .
I ’m sure our founding fathers would be quite pleased .
One of the sexiest galleries we have done on this site eh ?
Serta is one of the only manufacturers of mattresses that picked up on the mascot trend of its distributors , and in 2007 they introduced the Serta Sheep .
Below are a few of their commercials :
Here are some additional assorted mattress commercials :
This is what happens when you pay morons to dance in a mattress costume :
… and a little something that is reminiscent of Terry Tate , this is a Gorilla tackling Mattress Man :
Lastly , I bring you the Mattress Man Commercial from Punch Drunk Love :
and the Original Mattress Man Commercial that the previous was parodying :
Yeah , I think we ’ve beaten this concept sufficiently to death .

RAWA News , February 2 , 2009
by Marc W. Herold
The New Year ’s first Afghan civilian killed by U.S/ NATO action was a boy named Marjan ( tr. Coral ) , killed on January 2nd .
( 1 ) The boy had allegedly wandered into a prohibited area in the Deh - Sabz district of Kabul .
Marjan was walking home with friends when “ international forces ” gunned him down .
The occupation soldiers got out of a white vehicle , shot Coral and sped away .
Marjan is only one of 73 - 88 civilian Afghans or tribal Pashtuns killed by the U.S/ NATO occupation forces during January 2009 .
Three days later , eight Afghan women , two children and two civilian men were killed by Australian forces in the Chora district of Uruzgan Province .
Much official ado has been made in Washington D.C. and in the U.S. corporate press about how the new Administration will be taking far greater care as regards Afghan civilians .
Data analyzed below for January 2009 suggests that the deadliness of the Afghan war for civilians under the Obama clock significantly exceeds that registered under the outgoing Bush regime .
Boys , women , girls , tribal leaders all have perished at the hands of the foreign occupiers .
During January 2009 , twelve U.S/ NATO forces ’ actions ( including one road accident where a MRAP military armored vehicle crushed an Afghan civilian car ) resulted in 73 - 88 dead Afghan civilians ( including five Pashtun tribes people in North Waziristan killed in a U.S. drone strike ) .
The following table presents details :
Incident date Location ( Province ) Civilian deaths January 2 Kabul city 1 January 5 Uruzgan 11 January 6 Laghman 17 January 19 Kapisa 15 - 19 January 21 / 22 Helmand 3 January 23 North Waziristan 5 January 23 / 24 Laghman 11 - 22 January 29 Kandahar 4 January 29 Herat 1 January 31 Paktika 1 January 31 / February 1 Ghazni 2 February 1 Helmand 2
Source : The Afghan Victim Memorial Project at http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mwherold/
Simple arithmetic reveals that the eleven days under the Obama clock were 18 - 50 % more deadly for Afghan civilians than the twenty days under the Bush regime .
Analysis by type of incident indicates the following :
Ground attack
Air strike Combined air & ground Traffic 8 for 54 - 58 3 for 18 - 26 none 1 for 1 Per attack : 6.8 - 7.3
Per attack : 6 - 8.7 - Per attack : 1
Whereas 7 - 8 civilians are killed per ground attack , air strikes kill between 6 - 9 civilians .
( 2 ) In other words , air strikes are not necessarily more deadly to civilians than ground attacks .
Air strikes are proving less effective too as Afghan resistance fighters shift tactics to dodge the airstrikes . ( 3 )
Data for January 2009 conforms to early civilian casualty data for 2001 insofar as relatively few civilians die per attack .
( 4 ) Of the twelve incidents during January , only three resulted in more than ten deaths .
Discussion
The centrality of the long - standing information war over what is really happening in Afghanistan takes on heightened importance with the election of Barack Obama .
Each side in the conflict – the Taliban and their allies and the United States with its NATO allies – has a direct interest in spinning the news to its own advantage .
Both sides do this on a daily basis .
On January 27 , 2009 CBS
News admitted such in a piece titled : “ U.S. Fights Information War with Taliban . ” ( 5 ) The concluding sentence read , “ U.S. success in this complex war depends as much on controlling the message as deploying the guns . ”
For now over three years , the United States has been devoting considerable resources to its information war . ( 6 )
The center - piece to this information war has become the extent of civilian casualties in Afghanistan .
Recognizing that the U.S/ NATO and the Taliban each have a direct interest in spinning the message as to the extent , the gender and age of civilian casualties to its own advantage , necessitates having a healthy skepticism of claims coming from either side .
Greater credence can be given to sources which are more independent , e.g. , Pahjwok Afghan News , Agence France Presse , the Afghan Human Rights Commission , the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan ( RAWA ) and the like rather than the more tainted ones like Associated Press , Human Rights Watch , UNAMA , Jihad Unspun , etc .
The Afghan Victim Memorial data base attempts to navigate safely ( as accurately as possible ) in this sea of conflicting assertions .
The number of airstrikes has been decreasing since the last third of 2008 . ( 7 ) On the other hand , recent deadly night - time raids by U.S. Special Forces ( which President Obama has stated he will rely more upon ( 8 ) ) have angered Afghans .
Even the Associated Press admitted that “ three recent U.S. Special Forces operations killed 50 people – the vast majority civilians . ”
( 9 ) In December 2008 , U.S. Special Forces killed at least six Afghan policemen and injured another thirteen . ( 10 ) A report published by the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission castigated foreign forces ’ ground attacks in Kandahar Province .
( 11 )
The report noted
The combination of abusive behavior and violent breaking and entry into civilians ’ homes in the middle of the night stokes almost as much anger and resentment toward pro-government forces as the more lethal air strikes .
Afghan villagers ’ reactions to U.S/ NATO strikes may be viewed on a rare video put out by Al Jazeera .
Increasingly , we find independent analysts asking whether Afghanistan is going to be Obama ’s Iraq .
( 12 ) An even more prescient view has been recently articulated by Gwynne Dyer , author of War .
The Lethal Custom , who argues that Obama is on the verge of going down in history the LBJ way ? ( 13 )
There is not a lot in common between President John F. Kennedy and President George W. Bush , but they were both ideological crusaders who got the United States mired in foreign wars it could not win and did not need to win .
They then bequeathed those wars to presidents who had ambitious reform agendas in domestic politics and little interest or experience in foreign affairs .
That bequest destroyed Lyndon Johnson , who took the rotten advice of the military and civilian advisers he inherited from Kennedy because there was n't much else on offer in Washington at the time .
Obama is drifting into the same dangerous waters , and the rotten advice he is getting from strategists who believe in the ' ' war on terror ' ' could do for him , too .

Bongs are filled with water at the bottom to make the smoke easier on the lungs , some variations are to add ice for a cooler smoke or to use other liquids ( although if alcohol is used it filters out the THC , defeating the purpose of smoking any marijuana )
Bongs can be made at home with simple household items and come in many variations .
A few are listed below :
The Basic Water Bong
This is a simple water bong used in the way described above .
See also Water Bongs .
The Gravity Bong
This bong uses a half bottle put into water and is slowly pulled up making the smoke very quickly enter the lungs of the user .
In this case the water is not used to filter the smoke but to create a consistent flow of smoke .

The Bushmans Bong
This is a bong that can be made on the run , it ’s simply a can with holes in it and smoke through the opening at the top .
The weather at Razi Elementary School was depressing -- a driving winter rain mixed with occasional hail that soaked prospective voters as soon as they stepped out of their cars .
Inside the school , local politicians fretted about the possibility of a record low turnout here in Israel ’s second - largest Arab city , and among Arab voters nationwide .
On the streets , a protest against a right - wing Israeli politician serving as an election supervisor here briefly turned violent .
Farouk Mahajiny , an official of the Democratic Front for Peace and Equality , a party that includes Arabs and Jewish socialists and has three seats in the Knesset , or parliament , worried that participation here might not top 30 % .
“ This is a serious danger to all the Arab parties , ” Mahajiny said .

At the end of the day , however , Arab politicians said they were thrilled that exit polls indicated turnout of at least 50 % -- close to the 56 % who turned out in 2006 and enough to ensure that Arabs would keep their voice in the Knesset .
Israel ’s 2006 conflict with the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah , the recent three - week offensive in the Gaza Strip and a week of violent Arab - Jewish clashes last fall in the mixed city of Acre have helped sharpen the sense of alienation among the one - fifth of Israel ’s citizens who are Arabs .
Among Jews , tension with Arabs has partially fueled the rise of ultranationalist candidate Avigdor Lieberman , who advocates forcing Arab citizens to take a loyalty test .
Lieberman succeeded in getting the two most prominent Arab parties , Balad and United Arab List - Taal , temporarily pulled from the ballot .
The ruling was later overturned by the Supreme Court .
Party leaders here feared that Arab frustration could lead many to support fringe parties , boycott all elections or abandon the idea of democratic involvement in the Jewish state .

Voter participation among Israel ’s 1.4 million Arab citizens has always lagged behind that of Jewish voters , and the turnout in 2006 represented a drop of 21 percentage points from elections a decade earlier .
In Umm al Fahm , the figure is generally even lower because of long - standing boycott campaigns by a pair of powerful local political movements , the Islamic Movement of the North and the Sons of Our Land .
Election day in Umm al Fahm , population 43,000 , began amid tense confrontation .
Residents had been up in arms for days over the national electoral committee ’s decision to allow extreme right - wing politician Baruch Marzel to serve as a polling place supervisor here .
At dawn , crowds had gathered at the city ’s main entrance , blocking traffic and outnumbering the local police forces , participants said .

“ Every car that passed , we would inspect it to make sure [ Marzel ] was n’t in it , ” said Anas Mahajiny , 19 .
Police commanders decided to block Marzel ’s entry , citing a possible threat to public safety .
The protesters dispersed .
Then word spread that the police had led another right - wing politician , Aryeh Eldad , through back roads to Razi Elementary to serve as Marzel ’s replacement .
A second crowd gathered .
Five people were arrested and several injured in a confrontation with police , including Anas Mahajiny , who sported a fresh pink wound on the back of the head .
Eldad left the school after less than an hour , as the crowd threw rocks at his police convoy , witnesses said .

Around the corner from the school , Abdel Rahman Moustafa ’s grocery store was open for business .
He was n’t voting .
“ I do n’t see the necessity of closing my store and standing in line for an hour , ” Moustafa said .
“ If I thought it would make a difference , I ’d do it . ”
“ There ’s a trend of disillusionment with politics , ” said Ahmad Sa’di , a political science professor at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev .
“ They believe the system is incapable of including them . ”
But as the polls closed Tuesday night , those fears proved to be exaggerated ; turnout appeared to be high enough for all main Arab parties to at least maintain their current numbers in parliament .

In light of the dire predictions , many were willing to declare the day a resounding victory .
“ This is a clear and unequivocal statement against boycotting , and an expression of faith in us , the Arab leadership , ” Ahmed Tibi of the United Arab List - Taal said in a radio interview .
“ Nobody expected this , ” said Farouk Mahajiny by telephone late Tuesday night amid the sound of raucous cheering .

Nature ’s Wrath : Humans Be Nice !
The human kind is the supreme ruler of the planet Earth .
Top of the food chain , the most intelligent and powerful being .
We are so full of ourselves that we never stop to think about the consequence .
Why should we ?
We are so mighty that nothing can hurt us !
On the other hand these pictures tell a completely different story .
Just some examples of nature ’s display of its might .
Indeed there is a force that is more powerful than anything we can ever build .
Who knows , maybe these are just the warning signs of a planet that has had enough of us and is about to banish us from the face of Earth .
Anyway , these are fun to watch .
Denise Finkel is suing Facebook , Inc. and four former classmates of University of Albany student for defamation .
Finkel claims that comments intended to embarrass and humiliate her were posted on the popular social networking site .
Filed on February 24 , 2009 in New York Supreme Court , Finkel states her reputation and character were greatly injured by comments posted in a private group implying she has AIDS , uses drugs , and engages in deviant behavior , like bestiality .
Denise Finkel was a victim of a growing Internet trend called cyberbullying .
She is suing both Facebook for $ 3 million in damages , and the classmates ' parents , citing negligence .
Horrific Over - The - Top Discussion
Mark Altschul , Finkel 's attorney , said that the comments went beyond normal teasing .
He said the horrific discussion on Facebook was ' over - the - top ' .
( Source : splc.org )
One of the defendants created the group in late January 2007 and included about six members at Oceanside High School on Long Island , New York .
Members of the group referred to themselves and other classmates as numbered ' cents . '
Finkel is never named in the group , but the comments and photos reveal that she is referred to as the 'eleventh cent . '
Section 230 of the Federal Communications Decency Act
Section 230 of the Federal Communications Decency
Act states that providers of an interactive computer service cannot be treated as the publisher or speaker of its users ' content , and protects social networking sites like Facebook from liability for their users ' content .
Attorney Mark Altschul 's claim is that Facebook is more than just a conduit for users ' content .
When approached with printed pages from the Facebook site , he noticed that each page contained a copyright mark at the bottom .
He says the copyright mark represents authorship .
Altschul states that " they are claiming that they are the owner of the page and the author of the page by having the [ copyright mark ] . "
In contrast , he pointed out that Google displays a copyright mark on its homepage but not on the pages that contain the search results .

The suit 's decision could have massive ramifications for the administration of social networking sites , which in the past have been mostly laissez - faire .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - A push by the world ’s leading emerging economies to dislodge the dollar as the dominant global reserve currency appears to be gaining momentum even as a weakening greenback adds further urgency to the discussion .
China on Monday added its voice to a growing international chorus seeking the replacement of the dollar as the main reserve currency , urging for an overhaul of the global monetary system to allow for wider use of Special Drawing Rights ( SDRs ) allocated by the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) .
Chinese central bank chief Zhou Xiaochuan said the SDRs , created by the IMF as international reserve assets in 1965 , could be used as a super - sovereign reserve currency , eventually displacing the dollar .
His comments come a week after Russia said it would put forward a proposal for the creation of a new reserve currency issued by international financial institutions at the G20 meeting in April .
Russia said it had the broad support of its fellow BRIC countries -- Brazil , India and China -- as well as South Korea and South Africa for its proposal .
The push underscores growing concerns among emerging - market leaders about the long - term value of the dollar .
The dollar saw its biggest weekly slide since 1985 .DXY last week after the Federal Reserve 's decision to buy long - term government debt raised the specter of oversupply in dollars .
That emerging economies -- among the largest dollar holders in the world thanks to strong export revenues -- want to diversify reserves away from the dollar is not only sensible but inevitable , argues Jerome Booth , Ashmore Investment Management research head .
“ The unknowns are how fast and the disruption this may cause , ” Booth said .
DOLLAR RISKS
China , which has the world ’s largest foreign - currency reserves at close to $ 2 trillion , would be especially keen to avoid a widespread dollar sell - off .
Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said earlier this month that he was worried about China ’s heavy exposure to the United States -- which , taking into account its US Treasuries and other bond holdings , is estimated to represent about a two - thirds of its reserves .
Any Chinese move to reweight its reserves portfolio could be destabilizing to the value of the greenback because of the level of market scrutiny .
“ As soon as you sell - off a part of your reserves , people will expect you to sell the rest so the value of everything you have would plummet , ” said Jon Harrison , emerging foreign exchange strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort .
SDRs , which have a value based on a basket of key international currencies , also serve as the unit of account of the IMF and some other international organizations .
“ If you really believed that ( the SDR adoption ) was going to happen , you ’d want to sell the dollar and buy other currencies that would be part of the SDR basket -- euros , yen and perhaps the pound , ” said Dresdner ’s Harrison .
China ’s
Zhou has said global acceptance of a new reserve currency would take a long time , and would be “ a bold initiative that requires extraordinary political vision and courage . ”
Russia , which has significantly reduced the dollar ’s share of its own reserves in recent years in tandem with the 2005 introduction of a euro / dollar basket for tracking the rouble , has signaled it does not expect to see any reforms rising from the Group of 20 nations meeting in London on April 2 .
WATCHING EACH OTHER
Still , Russia and China ’s push for a global super - sovereign reserve currency could have resonance beyond the corridors of power in the developing world -- possibly even in Washington .
Adopting a super - sovereign reserve currency such as SDRs could do away with the global imbalances of recent years that allowed the United States to run up large twin budget and external deficits while export - oriented emerging economies accumulated dollar - denominated reserves .
This global imbalance has been blamed for the cheap borrowing costs in the U.S. that contributed to subprime mortgage bust that triggered the global credit crunch .
A United Nations panel of experts this week is set to recommend the world ditch the dollar as its reserve currency in favor of a shared basket .
Avinash Persaud , a member of the UN Commission of Experts on International Financial Reform , said the creation of something like the old Ecu -- or European currency unit -- as a hard - traded weighted basket was one of the recommendations that would be delivered to the U.N. on Wednesday .
Politics will determine the timing of any diversification moves , Ashmore ’s Booth said .
“ Central banks are watching each other ... Many countries may want to start a senior dialogue with the new US administration before selling their Treasuries , ” he said .
Eigentlich wollte ich zu den aktuellen Geschehnissen und der Reaktion von Medien und Politik darauf ja schweigen .
Es ist alles so vorhersagbar und so weit weg von den wirklichen Problemen , die gerade gelöst werden müssen , daß mich nur noch ein Gefühl geistigen Unwohlseins ergreift , wenn ich das Gefasel lesen muss .
Das intellektuelle Equivalent zum Post - McDonalds - Bauchgefühl ; Kotzen wäre eine erwägenswerte Option .
Was ich aber heute lesen musste war dann doch zu viel .
In den letzten Monaten hätte man fast das Gefühl haben können , daß die Berufspolitikerkaste so langsam im Internet - Zeitalter ankommt .
Selbst Wiefelspütz ist jetzt stolz selbst einen Browser bedienen zu können .
Leider war diese Beobachtung ein Irrtum .
Kaum ergibt sich auch nur der Hauch einer Gelegenheit wird “ das Internet ” zur Inkarnation aller Übel der Gesellschaft .
Selbstverständlich muss erstmal recherchiert werden , ob ein Amokläufer sich im Internet verewigt hat , und da wird dann allerorten auch gerne auf einen primitiven
Fake hereingefallen , weil es passt ja einfach zu gut .
Schade nur das da nicht mehr “ böses Internet ” war als ein paar Ballerspiele und ein bißchen Porn .
Das muss dann natürlich hochgehyped werden , weil sonst passt ja das Schnittmuster nicht mehr .
Und wenn das böse fiese Internet sich dann auch noch lustig macht über die fortschrittsmäßig zurückgebliebenen Regierungsgestalten , dann wird es halt zensiert und unter Kontrolle gebracht und familienfreundlich disneyfiziert .
Porn gibts in Deutschland nur noch nachts und gegen Vorlage des Personalausweises .
Weil das war ja früher auch so und früher war alles besser .
Wer schiessen will soll gefälligst in einen ordentlichen doitschen Schützenverein gehen und richtig killen lernen , weil Ballerspiele sind einfach zu gefährlich und müssen verboten werden .
Und die Online - Medien , allen vorran das ehemalige Nachrichtenmagazin aus Hamburg machen fröhlich mit :
“ Nach dem Amoklauf von Winnenden verstärkt sich die Diskussion über ein Verbot von Gewaltvideos und kinderpornografischen Angeboten im Internet . ”
Lieber Spiegel , nur nochmal zum mitmeisseln weil ihr offenbar zu betriebsblind seid , um noch was mitzubekommen : was wir hier sehen ist im Kern ein klassischer Generationenkonflikt .
Die uns derzeit Regierenden betrachten das 21 .
Jahrhundert als den Hort des Bösen .
Statt Probleme zu lösen werden sie besser per Netzzensur und Verdrängung ausgeblendet .
Statt massiv Geld und Energie in Bildung und Jugendförderung zu investieren , wird es zum Verbrennen in Zockerbanken geschaufelt .
Und statt mal das Kind beim Namen zu nennen folgt die ach so unabhängige und neutrale Medienzunft erstmal blind hechelnd der sensationskompatiblen BKA - Kanzleramtslinie , statt selbst zu recherchieren und zu analysieren .
Mit diesem Ansatz sind die Medien Teil des Problems , nicht der Lösung .
Wie wäre es mal mit progressiver Meinungsbildung statt pseudo - neutralem Sau- durchs - Dorf - treiben , lieber Spiegel ?
“ Merkel sagte , man dürfe nicht nur mit der Freiheit des Internets argumentieren .
“ Ich gehöre , ehrlich gesagt , zu denen , die immer wieder überlegen : Kann man nicht doch etwas tun ? ”
Der Ansatz ist klar : das Internet muss gezähmt werden .
Der Staat will gern die Technologien benutzen um den Bürger von der Wiege bis zur Bahre unter seine Fittiche zu nehmen , mit staatlich bereitgestellter e-mail , e-Government , Gesundheitskarte , Vorratsdatenspeicherung und Inhaltsfiltern gegen verbotene Bits .
Unkontrollierte digitale Freiräume werden abgeschafft .
Und wer aufmuckt , bei dem findet sich dann schon was um ihn mundtot zu machen .
Als ich “ We lost the War Welcome to the World of Tomorrow ” geschrieben habe , waren einige Elemente der zukünftigen Krisen noch nicht so klar wie sie heute sind und klangen vielleicht ein bißchen weiter hergeholt als sie heute erscheinen .
Das ist der Lauf der Dinge , heute sind viele Probleme offensichtlicher .
Die Einsicht , die sich massiv verstärkt hat ist , daß meine Annahmen über die Motivation und die Mechanismen des Umbaus der Gesellschaft korrekt waren .
In einem seltenen Moment von Offenheit hat einer der Chefarchitekten des angstgetriebenen Sicherheitsstaates , der beamtete Staatssekretär im BMI August Hanning , seine Weltsicht in einem Interview dargelegt .
( Daß das Interview ausgerechnet von “ wird schon nicht so schlimm mit dem Überwachungsstaat , nun habt auch mal nicht so ” - Christian Rath geführt wurde ist schon ganz schön bizarr … )
Es darf keine Bereiche geben , in denen der Staat nicht auf potenziell Tatverdächtige zugreifen kann .
Diesen Satz hätte auch der chinesische Innenminister sagen können .
Oder Erich Mielke .
Kombiniert mit der Grundgesetz - Allergie seines Ministers ergibt sich das Bild einer Sicherheitsdiktatur , die sich zum Ziel gesetzt hat ausschliesslich durch ihre eigene Sorgfalt und Zurückhaltung gebremst zu sein .
Um es nochmal ganz klar zu sagen :
Ich habe keinerlei Grund darauf zu vertrauen , daß der Staat mit seinem Instrumentarium zurückhaltend und sorgfältig umgeht .
Die Vorkommnisse der jüngsten Zeit sind eine sehr deutliche Warnung , daß der Staat im Gegenteil keine Hemmungen hat , abweichende Meinungen mit grundlosen Ermittlungsverfahren und Hausdurchsuchungen ( und sei es nur wegen Filesharing ) mundtot zu machen und hartnäckige Störer zu schikanieren , bis sie aufgeben .
Wie weit es mit der “ Zurückhaltung ” her ist lässt sich prima bei Käfighaltung von G8 - Protestierern und den diversen Pseudo - Terrorismusverfahren konkret beobachten .
Die Vorbereitung auf die kommenden Krisen durch Errichtung eines allmächtigen Sicherheitsapparates mag ein natürlicher Impuls sein .
Vielleicht würde ich an Hannings Stelle ähnlich agieren , angesichts von Wirtschaftskrise , Migrationsdruck und absehbarem Klimaelend .
Die Abschaffung und Unterdrückung effektiver gesellschaftlicher Kontrolle des Apparates und die Stigmatisierung von abweichenden Meinungen als “ Kinderporno - Schützer ” und ähnliches sind jedoch durch nichts zu rechtfertigen .
Insofern empfinde ich Merkels Gefasel als existenzielle Bedrohung .
Wenn es nur noch darum geht Vorwände und Anlässe für die Einschränkung von Informations - und Meinungsfreiheit zu suchen sind wir keine Demokratie mehr .
Kinderporno - Server nicht abzuschalten , sondern sie weiterlaufen zu lassen , um damit Zensurinfrastruktur durchzusetzen ist eine aktive Handlung zur Abschaffung der demokratischen Grundprinzipien .
Ein Innenminister , der das Grundgesetz und das Verfassungsgericht für lästige Störfaktoren hält , betreibt die Abschaffung der verfassungsmäßigen Ordnung .
Tut mir leid , anders kann ich es langsam nicht mehr formulieren .
The Israeli Military is disputing Palestinian claims that most of the people killed in the recent fighting in Gaza Strip were civilians .
The IDF said Thursday that an internal inquiry found that 1,166 people were killed in the three - week offensive that ended in January .
It said 709 were Hamas militants , and just under 300 people , including 89 children aged 16 and 49 women , were civilians .
Angles Palestinians : Final Gaza toll shows 960 civilians killed Reuters Palestinian Center for Human Rights says 1,434 people killed during Operation Cast Lead , including 239 police officers , 235 ' fighters , ' group accuses Israel of ignoring difference between combatants and civilians Palestinians : Final Gaza toll shows 960 civilians killed
An IDF statement released Thursday did not provide a list of the fatalities but said its figures are based on information from intelligence sources , and that the names were thoroughly cross-referenced and examined .
The Palestinians said 1,417 people were killed , including more than 900 civilians .
The heavy civilian toll sparked an international outcry .
" During the operation the army targeted Hamas , not the residents of Gaza , but the fighting took place on a complex battlefield ; Hamas gunmen purposely positioned themselves in the heart of civilian areas , " the IDF Spokesman 's Unit said .
" The army made every effort to avoid civilian casualties , including the distribution of flyers and broadcasts that warned residents ahead of attacks on specific areas . "
Earlier this week Southern Command chief Major - General Yoav Galant commented for the first time on Operation Cast Lead and the ethical dilemmas that accompanied it .
" I 'm proud that we have such a moral army , which respects international law , " Galant said during an event in honor of the Medical Corps .
Galant spoke of the extensive preparations carried out ahead of the operation , and of Hamas ' attempts to involve civilians in the fighting .
" The Palestinian gunman held his arms cache in his home , came out to fight and then went back to the house believing that we will not target him there , " he claimed .

According to Microsoft , Windows 7 will not include Blu-ray movies support out of the box and Blu-ray support will be provided by PC makers or BRD drive producers .
Windows Media Center has ability to play BD movies but only with additional extensions from BD software .
But Windows 7 will have support for reading and burning BD data disks .
So the story from XP ( without DVD support out of the box ) is continued .
Blu-ray playback under Windows 7 will require the installation of third party media software .
By refusing to licence the Blu-ray playback decoder for Windows 7 , Microsoft is pushing the costs onto PC makers who will generally obtaining Blu-ray licenses bundled with Blu-ray drives .
There are expectations for a licence price drop by 40 % soon , so the fees for the new licenses will be US $ 9.50 for a Blu-ray player and US $ 14 for a Blu-ray recorder .
Making Blu-ray
Disc will cost 11 US cents for read - only , 12 US cents for recordable discs and 15 US cents for rewritable discs .

A Strange Case of Double Standards
Another child has died from male circumcision in England - apparently the third such death in 25 months - and boys ( from babies to teenagers ) are being regularly treated in hospitals for serious injuries or infections resulting from ritual genital cutting .
NORM - UK , the charity concerned with the foreskin , calls on the government to implement fully the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and give both boys and girls protection against ritual wounding - in all its forms .
Nine week old Celian Noumbiwe died as a result of a wilful wounding , commanded by his parents .
He ’s the latest in a list of children to die in this way , and for every Celian there are around 100 who are treated for life threatening injuries but who survive .
The injury and death figures for this particular type of wound are in fact rather comparable to those for dog bites .
In the last 25 months it ’s understood that 3 children have died * following it and thousands overall will have required some form of follow - up treatment for issues such as blood loss , persistent pain or infection .
The police have taken photographs of some of the injuries , which presumably then were filed away , as the government has made it clear no prosecutions can result .
In fact the government has said that anyone is free to inflict this on a child , anywhere any time .
In a recent letter to NORM - UK Department of Health said that the only way in which this kind of wounding could result in a prosecution is if the perpetrator had , “ pretended to be a doctor ” .
This would mean that the mechanic who burned off part of a 3 year old ’s body with a soldering iron ( as reported in September on More4 news ) apparently acted perfectly legally …
So what is it that makes us turn our faces away when a child spends a period in hospital because adults burned him or cut him , or when a baby bleeds to death in his cot over a long lonely night ?
The answer is a fear of criticising religious practice .
The excision of around 50 % of a child ’s penile skin is considered a duty in two large religious groups and we do n’t like to talk about either the direct harm or the collateral damage … because doing so might offend .
We ’re even careful to construct the statistics so that the deaths simply disappear .
When NORM - UK asked the Department of Health about circumcision deaths in late 2007 they told us , “ the Office Of National Statistics holds mortality statistics and these data show no evidence of death where circumcision was listed as the secondary cause ” .
It ’s easy to see how this result is achieved – just as Haringey ’s ex-Children ’s Services Director knew , hitting targets is all about what you choose to measure .
So for example when in 1991 Raju Miah had the most sensitive part of his genitals excised , and never woke up , the death was recorded as ‘ narcotic poisoning ’ ( i.e. an overdose of anaesthetic ) .
Not a circumcision related death then .
Neither apparently was the death of baby Boma Oruitemeka in London in 1990 from severe haemorrhage after circumcision ( without anaesthetic ) .
In this case the Coroner Dr Douglas Chambers was almost endearingly frank about his own reasons for avoiding the issues : “ I ’m not going to stir up that hornet ’s nest ” he said , “ oh no thank you not at all . ”
In Ireland in 2005 , hearing the case of baby Callis Osaghae , Judge Kevin Haugh ( the late ) drew the lines more clearly .
He instructed the jury to put their “ white western values ” aside .
So dutifully they did , finding the man who razored off one of the most blood and nerve rich areas of the baby ’s body not guilty of reckless endangerment .
Fourth generation genital cutter Osagie Igbinidion walked free from court complaining of the “ immense pain and distress " he had gone through during the trial process .
Callis had no chance to tell of his pain and distress – he had died in 2003 with not a drop of blood left in his body .
Although the humanists spoke up for Callis , those concerned with human rights - and more particularly child rights - generally remain silent in such cases .
They like to think that ( male ) genital cutting injuries are a competency issue and not intrinsic to the practice .
Yet complications have been recorded in as many as one in two boys , deaths are regular in both developed and less developed nations ; and the intent of the surgery is - as the sage Maimonides admitted - a reduction in sexual pleasure .
Long - standing human traditions are clearly important .
Yet the belief system or habits of one person cannot over - ride the absolute rights of another – be they one day old or 100 years old .
So we do n’t allow the ritual facial scarification or even tattooing of a minor and we ’ve banned all ritual female genital mutilation practices from small incision to radical excision .
We ’re stepping up action against forced marriage , and we ’ve criminalised those who would not ‘ spare the rod ’ or even the heavily applied hand .
All this is scripture , tradition , belief , culture and hadith notwithstanding .
So if that mechanic had put down his tools and spanked the boy hard as a punishment for crying he could have faced prosecution for common assault .
The NSPCC campaigned for this new law , and in fact want it taken further so that any and every smack is classified as assault – as does the Children ’s Commissioner for England Sir Al Aynsley - Green .
Yet they will not campaign to protect boys from sacrificial genital cutting , or even to have the use of anaesthesia or sterile medical equipment made compulsory .
When asked why , they cite , “ the sensitivity of the issue ” .
We call on the NSPCC and the government to end this shameful relativism , and start applying the values we have all agreed : every child matters and human rights , including the right to bodily integrity and personal autonomy , are universal .
* We have been unable to ascertain the details of the death which apparently occurred in London in Summer 2008 after a male circumcision .
It seems likely that over the years there have been others which , like this one , simply pass ‘ under the radar ’ .
The third death - that of baby Amitai Moshe on 9th February 2007 - comes to inquest at Hornsey Coroners Court , London on 20th April 2009 .

Amid the clamour about the death of baby Jaden Mack in a dog attack , and the continued reverberations of the ‘ Baby P ’ case , another child death was reported rather quietly earlier this month .
Nine week old Celian Noumbiwe died as a result of a wilful wounding , commanded by his parents .
He ’s the latest in a list of children to die in this way , and for every Celian there are around 100 who are treated for life threatening injuries but who survive .

The NSPCC campaigned for this new law , and in fact want it taken further so that any and every smack is classified as assault – as does the Children ’s Commissioner for England Sir Al Aynsley - Green .
Yet they will not campaign to protect boys from sacrificial genital cutting , or even to have the use of anaesthesia or sterile medical equipment made compulsory .
When asked why , they cite , “ the sensitivity of the issue ” .
We call on the NSPCC and the government to end this shameful relativism , and start applying the values we have all agreed : every child matters and human rights , including the right to bodily integrity and personal autonomy , are universal .
*We have been unable to ascertain the details of the death which apparently occurred in London in Summer 2008 after a male circumcision .
It seems likely that over the years there have been others which , like this one , simply pass ‘ under the radar ’ .
The third death - that of baby Amitai Moshe on 9th February 2007 - comes to inquest at Hornsey Coroners Court , London on 20th April 2009 .

Creative people are crazy
February 25 , 2009 By Paul Wagorn
When I was a child , a doctor once told me that he suspected that I might have attention deficit disorder – ADD ( or ADHD as it ’s now called ) .
He went on to say “ .. but , only a touch of it .
Basically enough to make you creative ” .
I suspect that he was joking at the time , but it always made me wonder .
I was reminded of this recently when I dug up a report based on research by Professor Arnold Ludwig of the University of Kentucky .
Dr. Ludwig studied over 1000 “ original thinkers ” in a wide array of professions – art , music , business , science , politics and sports .
In his research spannig close to 10 years , he studied these people ’s mental fitness , their chosen professions and the releationships between their mental health and career selection .
What he found was interesting : Crazy people have jobs that rely on creativity .
The results from his study ( “ Method and Madness in the Arts and Sciences ” ) showed that :
9 out of 10 poets studied had diagnosable mental disorders (!)
77 % of fiction writers had mental disorders
74 % of theater people
73 % of painters and other visual artists
68 % of musicians ( which I think is dead accurate based on my own experience of being in bands ! )
This is compared to 18 to 29 % for sports , scientists and business people .
Many studies have shown higher rates of depression in creative people as well ( how depressing ! ) .
So , the question that begs to be asked is what is the causative relationship ?
Are creative people crazy , or are crazy people creative ?
Dr. Ludwig says :
“ Mental illness is not the price people pay for their creative gifts … creative people who are mentally ill find themselves , almost by default , in the arts rather than in business or the other sciences . ”
Ok , so being creative does n’t make us crazy …
Whew , we dodged that bullet .
What this does mean , however , is that we may have to deal with more off - kilter - ness from our co-workers and professional relationships if we work in a creative field .
Tell us what you think – do you agree with Dr. Ludwig ’s findings , or do you just think he ’s crazy being creative ?

Maybe the differ ( a ) nce between madness and normality is not that hard and fast as is supposed by late western civilization ( whatever that means ) .
In the past the creative talent had to literally go against the grain and so it was an uphill battle .
It was not like the postmodern condition where for the first time in history you find young people opting for conservatism ( which is sooooo boring ) .
The indifference towards the mad , sick and slightly in - sane that you find today where at best they are put for life on drugs and at worst shut up in a lunatic asylum boinking off the walls in a straitjacket is a pathetic and truly soulless sight for sorry eyes .
Was n't it R.D. Laing who said somewhere that we are all rapists and murderers ( and God knows what else ) even in this clinically sterilized and static bank - like clockwork society of the contemporary age .
Madness and creativity are kissing cousins that can't get enough of each other .
Their surgical separation is not an easy task .
Better to let nature do the healing than the psychiatrist 's couch .
The former hardens you with its elemental forces while the latter only makes you an obese specimen going round in circles .
I'm a journalist , poet , creative writer , playwright , and basically anything you can think of that is associated with w o r d s .
They are my best friends .
I also sketch on occasion and take crazy - genius photographs & I concur , creative people are crazy , crazy people are creative .
Whichever way works for you , works for me .
I am currently working on a play and in my " crazy " mind , hard core inspiration only comes to me when I am in touch with spirits from an outside world .
Yeah , I know it sounds koo - koo and I probably am ... but I truly do believe that I was according to Lady Gaga " born this way ! "
With that being said , we ( creative folk ) can't help the way we are .
It is what it is ... we are who we are and let 's hope we make magic with our creative gifts , inspire others , make people happy and try to stay as sane as we possible can .
I have seen Temple at a couple of conferences and she is just wonderful .
Her honesty is very refreshing and more effective than many other so called experts .
I also come away from her presentations feeling inspired to learn more about Autism and do better .
A wonderful movie I would highly recommend is " Temple Grandin " .
It is about an autistic woman who actually went on to revolutionize an industry ( I wo n't spoil it by telling you which one ) .
She recently was a speaker at TED .
She explains that autistic people just see the world in a different way and think a different way .
Anyone interested in this subject will love this movie - Tammara AcerraSo yeah thanks guys , i feel a little better nowwow .
Soooo i have just recently come to terms ( out of denial ) with the fact that i am a compulsive / pathological liar , i have bad ADD i have bipolar disorder , have always suffered with depression .
What has caused me the most turmoil is my fucking MESS with relationships like worse than anyone , so i think i might have borderline personality disorder too god knows .
But this all makes sense .
My father is a well acclaimed artist and hes bonkers and I 'm insanely creative , im a writer , so hmmmm .
Im 23 next month and have always promised myself that this is just temporary and that ill be superb in the next few months when i just stop doing what is deemed so wrong , and start doing whats right , but i have lost all mean of tust in myself .
I have this unmistakable pattern of actions i commit that show me what i want to be and what i am are not only opposite but sanity seems unreachable and the whole thing seems out of my control .
Ha and im left handed , Sundial .
Ive been consciously not so much subconsciously ( but who knows ) trying to tolerate the fact that some of my disorders are permanent , no matter how much i deny it even now while im typing im saying to myself that it really isnt permanent but my research tells me otherwise .
But what this article triggered in me is a good thing i think , see cause i have a massive self loathing problem , but if i had never been the least bit crazy , would i have ever been the least bit creative ?
Would i have been brilliantly creative ?
My creativity is one of my most solid traits I hold as safe haven for my ravenously ill judgemental psyche .
And if being " normal " would make me alot more uncreative , it almost makes being me woth it .
And Michael Sevilla i like your angle .
the source of creativity and craziness is one and the same ... a fault in the filtering process .
while not exactly peaceful this chaos is an ideal ocean for catching big fish if you have the right equipment .
most philosophers and poets have ridden the dangerous waves and believe me they have built out of the shipwrecked remains of their once stable lives the rafts that have kept them afloat .
its all just a matter of thought management .
or striking a delicate balance between selectivity and schizophrenia .
open the floodgates too much and u have a full - fledged nervous disorder on your hands .
use drugs and you bump off the creative activity .
maybe a mystic and a schizophrenic differ only in the fact that the mystic never says that he is a schizophrenic and hence is never labeled in the first place .
All crazy people definitely want this to be true !
I 'm raining my hand for sure ;-) thanks for your share `` and I think these numbers are crap , only 18 % of businessmen have mental disorders ?
BS .
Narcissistic Personality Disorder mixed in with control issues is a REQUIREMENT for management too !
i love umbrellas very much

he may be right but i think creative people are not crazy but " people " think thry are crazy simply because they are creating new ideas which seems abnormal for them because they do not nknow what deas " creativity " mean .

it is seen in music as well , for example amadeus and syd barrett .
2 musicians so original and talented for their time that it was almost as if their brains could n't handle it .
the result was a downward spiral into ' madness ' .
i'm around a lot of creative people all the time .
i've concluded that everyone in the world is a bit crazy , creative people 's crazy is just far more interesting to be around .

The percentage for bloggers is probably 98 % , with the other 2 % being the ones who are too boring to read .
( Spoken as a blogger myself , mind . )

Another angle : creative people are " crazy " because of the way they see the world - different / uniquely than non-creative people .
Perhaps it is this view point , the inferences , the connections , etc ... that lead others to think they are crazy when all they are doing is seeing something ( or creating something ) that others cannot possibly contrive until once the process is done .

Interesting point - I think there are also more left handed people in the arts - and they are supposedly more " creative " too .

If you 've ever noticed that your vintage games look horrible on your top - of - the - line 1080 p LCD TV , you are n't hallucinating .
An NFG forums member has assembled a fantastic , in - depth explanation for this ugly phenomenon .

I 'll spare you too many technical details , but the main issue at hand is resizing .
CRT screens are capable of scaling hard - edged , necessarily proportional images — like old game sprites — more gracefully and convincingly than LCD or plasma screens , because they are n't displaying on a fixed grid of pixels .
Resizing or stretching an image does n't require a new set of pixels to be illuminated , as is the case with more modern display technologies .
More importantly , early consoles were providing an image that was optimized for consumer CRTs , so " resampling " ( technically not the right word for the process , but you get the idea ) was n't necessary .
A modern fixed - pixel screen with a high resolution has to somehow resize the image to fit on its grid , because nobody wants to play a 4 - inch games of A Boy and His Blob on a 52 - inch flat screen .
One option is resampling , which is essentially the same thing you do when you resize an image in Photoshop .
This is fine for some images , but renders hard - edged pixel art as a blurry mess .
The other option is hard - scaling , which preserves edge fidelity by simply multiplying rows and columns until the image is the right size , leaving you with an often ugly approximation of the meticulously - drawn sprites that gave early console games such a distinctive aesthetic .
So there you go .

obviously if she was raped it was because she was n't " right with God " and the little " interracial baby " is her penance , right ?
How exactly do you know god 's will ?
Maybe it was his will for you to accept changing times .
Let 's stick with your book for a moment though , near the beginning , when god breathed life into Adam .
Does n't that imply life begins at breath then ?
I 've seen the pro-life crap about we had Hitler , Stalin , etc. , but where were the good ones of that grandeur ?
and God says they were aborted .
That bugs me for several reasons .
If god plans everything , why 'd he plan to abort those ones ?
For that matter , why did he plan to give us the knowledge to be able to abort ?
What about Mozart , Picasso , Da Vinci , etc. ?
You know , all those people who contributed to great cultural advancements ?
Were n't they good enough for you ?
And if you really wanna go down that road , is n't it possible guys far worse were aborted ?
Maybe Hitler would 've had a crazy buddy that would have been enough of an influence to tip the war , but he was aborted .
You can not use could be as an argument because anything / could / be .
Your god / could / be .
Ca n't we take these Imperial Order ( yay for references ) asshats who are so unhappy with the way the country is headed and banish them off to some new country all their own , let them do themselves in and the rest of the world can live happily enough ?
From a Circular Bookshelf to another with a bench , meet fifteen modern bookshelves .
1 The Infinity Bookshelf
Created by the dutch conceptual artist Job Koelewijn , the shape of the Bookshelf is a lemniscate , a figure 8 and the mathematical symbol of infinity , which perfectly represents the notion of the infinite potential and everlasting power of books .
2 The Circular Bookshelf
There are lots of unusual bookshelf designs but no other one where you can “ roll ” up with a good book .
This circular bookshelf by designer Zhdanova Irina also comes with a set of sofas that can be stored as a matching ring .
3 The Bookshelf with a Bench
This design might look cool for the eye , but it is n’t sure that you can stay too relaxed in that space .
The Shelves with a Bench was designed by Stanislav Katz , a designer from Latvia with lots of playful ideas .
4 The Pulse Bookshelf
Swedish designer Måns Salomonsen created this awesome pulse bookshelf shaped like a heartbeat in an electrocardiogram .
5 The Bookman
The Bookman is a bookshelf in the shape of a man .
This highly decorative piece of furniture –and sculpture– was designed by East Anglian artist Kazmierz Szmauz , who also designed similar pieces such as the CDMan , the DVDMan and Videoman .
The Bookman holds about 100 books .
6 The Inverted Bookshelf
The inverted bookshelf turns your living room upside down as it hangs all of the books from the bottom instead of supporting them from below .
It ’s a satisfying optical trick and does n’t damage any of the books .
7 The Chair Bookshelf
This bookshelf / chair was made by Elie Nehme and Mani Mani , a couple of young canadian designers from the Fishbol Design Atelier .
8 The Movement Bookshelf
Created by Samulnoli , the Movement Bookshelf is about hugging your books .
It includes an arrangement of bent nails which can be shaped in the form of legs and arms acting as book holders .
9 The Sexy Bookshelf
There is absolutely no doubt that sex sells like nothing else on the planet and is the most searched item on the Internet .
Designer Arun Kumar Francis took that obsession a step further and nailed it on the living room in the form of a cool little bookshelf .
The bold and innovative design borrows quite obviously from the three letter word and the design has a very uncomplicated and ergonomic feel about it .
10 The Equation Bookshelf
The Equation Bookshelf was designed by Marcos Breder .
You can put together the books that you need immediately between ( parentheses ) – the focal point of the bookshelf – and set others between [ square brackets ] and {braces} .
11 Lovely Rita Bookshelf
The Lovely Rita can live as a single shelf or be repeated endlessly by combining additional units , becoming a bookshelf of any length .
12 The Neverending Bookshelf
The Neverending bookshelf was made out of corian by Italian designers Luca Nichetto and Andreoli .
13 The Staircase Bookshelf
Tom Sloan at Levitate Architects came up with a neat solution to a storage problem in this London Victorian apartment :
He created a ’ secret ’ staircase , hidden from the main reception room , to access a new loft bedroom lit by roof lights .
14 The Autumn Bookshelf
Autum is a shelving system that gives a new take on the standard bookshelf .
It is uniquely designed to give the effect of a leafless tree .
The bookshelf measures 25Wx100Dx200H in a single unit , but it can be paired with more to make it larger as shown above with 3 units .
A wonderful idea by designers David Sanchez & PCM .
15 The Rainbow Bookshelf
This is an impressive example of organizing books by color .
A great way of changing the whole aspect of a bookshelf using just a little bit of creativity .

Among TTC workers , membership in the province 's so - called $ 100,000 Club jumped by 200 people in 2008 .
Transit officials say that number will continue to grow as the system expands .
Some 588 TTC staff earned $ 100,000 or more last year , qualifying them for the province 's annual salary disclosure list .
That number includes 62 drivers and 21 station collectors , the people who staff subway fare booths .
One driver , Hing Lee – about whom the TTC released no details – was paid $ 117,922 .
Operators and collectors who earn that much do so by working copious amounts of overtime , said TTC spokesperson Brad Ross .
Without the overtime , those jobs pay only about $ 60,000 annually .
The TTC , like many transit systems , budgets for overtime – about $ 21 million on $ 934 million in salary and benefits this year .
" We anticipate overtime .
Individuals who choose to work overtime do so because they wish to .
It saves the system money to pay and budget for overtime ( rather than ) hire additional bodies and pay those benefits .
You would n't see those names on this list , necessarily , but it would cost the system more money at the end of the day , " said Ross .
Some of the overtime is the result of boosting service .
Last year , the TTC put more buses on the road to cope with increasing ridership , and it recently extended the hours of bus operations to match the subway .
This year , the TTC will hire about 950 drivers .
Most of those will be replacing retirees , but the number includes 373 new operators , cleaners and other maintenance workers .
Also , 175 workers will be hired for a streetcar overhaul and Transit City projects .
" We always have to budget for overtime .
There are illnesses , there are unforeseen circumstances where we need to pay overtime , and it really has nothing to do with hiring .
...
" The option is to hire far more people than you actually need at the end of the day , and ( that would ) cost the system much more money , " Ross said .
TTC chair Adam Giambrone said the use of overtime is " a common technique used on any transit property . "
Growth in overtime has n't exceeded the growth in wages in recent years , but overall it does grow along with wages and as the system operates more buses , he said .
The going rate for transportation engineers and designers is in the $ 100,000 - and - up range , he added .

If the so - called " sunshine list , " created in 1996 , were indexed to 2008 dollars , the equivalent earnings today would be about $ 130,000 .
" That would eliminate every collector and operator , " Giambrone said .
" If that $ 100,000 threshold was adjusted , we'd be looking at approximately 60 people on that list today . "

Some Atlantic cod fisheries could drop by 50 % by 2050
The world 's fish stocks will soon suffer major upheaval due to climate change , scientists have warned .
Changing ocean temperatures and currents will force thousands of species to migrate polewards , including cod , herring , plaice and prawns .
By 2050 , US fishermen may see a 50 % reduction in Atlantic cod populations .
The predictions of " huge changes " , published in the journal Fish and Fisheries , were presented at the AAAS annual meeting in Chicago .
Marine biologists used computer models to forecast the future of 1,066 commercially important species from across the globe .
" The impact of climate change on marine biodiversity and fisheries is going to be huge , " said lead author Dr William Cheung , of the University of East Anglia in the UK .
" We must act now to adapt our fisheries management and conservation policies to minimise harm to marine life and to our society .
" We can use our knowledge to improve the design of marine protected areas which are adaptable to changes in distribution of the species , " he told the conference .
Sinking feeling
The world 's oceans are already experiencing changes in temperature and current patterns are changing due to climate change .
Existing patterns of catches will change
To quantify the likely impact on sea life , Dr Cheung and his team developed a new computer model that predicts what might happen under different climate scenarios .
While scientists have made projections of climate change impact on land species , this is the most comprehensive study on marine species ever published .
" We found that on average , the animals may shift their distribution towards the poles by 40 km per decade , " said Dr Cheung .
" Atlantic cod on the east coast of the US may see a 50 % reduction in some populations by 2050 . "
The invasion of new species into unfamiliar environments could seriously disrupt ecosystems , the researchers warn .
Some species will face a high risk of extinction , including Striped Rock Cod in the Antarctic and St Paul Rock Lobster in the Southern Ocean .
Sea-saw
But of course , as fish migrate polewards , fishermen in some areas will see their stocks increase .
The model predicts an increased catch in the North Sea - benefiting fishermen from Nordic countries .
But fishermen in tropical developing countries will suffer major losses in catch .
The socio-economic impact could be devastating , according to another study published recently in the same journal .
Thirty - three nations in Africa , Asia and South America are highly vulnerable to the impact of climate change in fisheries , according to scientists from the World Fish Centre .
Of these , 19 were already classified by the United Nations as " least developed " because of their particularly poor socioenomic conditions .
" Economically , people in the tropics and subtropics likely will suffer most , because fish are so important in their diets and because they have limited capacity to develop other sources of income and food , " said Edward Allison , director of policy , economics and social science at World Fish .
" We believe it is urgent to start identifying these vulnerable countries , because the damage will be greatly compounded unless national governments and international institutions like the World Bank act now to include the fish sector in plans for helping the poor cope with climate change . "

TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Resource - poor Japan just discovered a new source of mineral wealth -- sewage .
A sewage treatment facility in central Japan has recorded a higher gold yield from sludge than can be found at some of the world ’s best mines .
An official in Nagano prefecture , northwest of Tokyo , said the high percentage of gold found at the Suwa facility was probably due to the large number of precision equipment manufacturers in the vicinity that use the yellow metal .
The facility recently recorded finding 1,890 grammes of gold per tonne of ash from incinerated sludge .
That is a far higher gold content than Japan ’s Hishikari Mine , one of the world ’s top gold mines , owned by Sumitomo Metal Mining Co Ltd , which contains 20 - 40 grammes of the precious metal per tonne of ore .
The prefecture is so far due to receive 5 million yen ( $ 55,810 ) for the gold , minus expenses .
It expects to earn about 15 million yen for the fiscal year to the end of March from the gold it has retrieved from the ashes of incinerated sludge .
“ How much we actually receive will depend on gold prices at the time , ” the official said .
Some gold industry officials expect prices this year to top the all - time high above $ 1,030 per ounce set in 2008 , on buying by investors worried about the deepening economic downturn .

Brown last night dismissed calls to surrender his £ 123,000 a year pension when he is forced to stop being prime minister next June .
Mr Brown was defiant in the face of City outrage despite the UK government 's annual operating loss of £ 100bn , rising to £ 1.5 trillion when the write - down of its banking assets is taken into account .
The prime minister said : " I 've been building up this pension since I became an MP , it 's all completely legal and now you want to take it away because I 've been catastrophically bad at my job and you 're looking for a scapegoat .
What gives ? "
He added : " Yes I 've been in charge of financial regulation for 12 years , yes I encouraged the housing bubble , and yes I pissed billions up the wall giving pointless jobs to Labour voters , but I fail to see what any of this has to do with me being incredibly well off . "
Brown's £ 3 m pension pot is expected to cast the spotlight on the extravagant retirement packages of other failed politicians including Alistair Darling 's inexplicable £ 1.7 m and the £ 1.5 m awarded to John Prescott for being a national scandal for 10 years .
Meanwhile Margaret Beckett has a fund worth £ 1.7 m , something called ' Hilary Armstrong ' has £ 1.2 m and Tessa Jowell has £ 1 m even though no - one has the faintest idea what any of them actually did .
Critics insist Mr Brown has a moral duty to hand back his pension fund as he will inevitably receive a multi-million pound advance for two volumes of eye - gougingly tedious memoirs which will end up in the bargain bucket at WH Smith within a fortnight .
Martin Bishop , head of pension rows at the Institute for Studies , said : " It 's a fascinating dynamic .
The politicians blame the bankers , the bankers blame the politicians , and the ordinary taxpayer is down on all fours with a confused look on his face , being fucked at both ends . "

1. Slackware — the classic .
Main release is very stable .
You can use Slackware - Current to keep up with changes .
2. Arch Linux — possibly the most optimized binary distribution available .
Similar to Slackware in structure , but simpler than Slackware in what it comes with — not a whole lot .
This is not simple as in newbie simple , it is simple in terms of containing only the basics ; you add what you want and put together config files yourself .
You can learn on this system because the documentation is very good , but you must be willing to read and research before you start out or you will not get very far .
This is a great distro , but it is only designed for people who want to have complete control and set things up their way .
Pacman is the fastest binary package manager , period .
3. Debian — another classic with Debian , you can get a rock solid stable version , which is awesome for server environments , but gets old quickly for desktop users .
Debian
Testing is a more reasonable compromise , but can still be aged .
Debian
Sid is unstable , provides cutting - edge software , but is known to have broken packages from time to time .
The sidux distribution is a Debian offshoot that same Sid irregularities and gives
Sid some mood stabilizing medicine so that he wo n’t “ blow up the toys ” any more — translation : sidux WORKS and is an awesome distribution for running cutting - edge stuff that works .
Arch and Debian are near the forefront here .
4. Gentoo — one of the classic source based distributions .
The project has recently fallen on hard times , but people who want to build their own source code based system still frequently turn to Gentoo .
5. Sabayon — a Gentoo offshoot that makes initial entry into the source based distro space a bit easier initially .
I ’ve not worked with this one much and I ’ve heard mixed reports .
Advocates say that it is easy to install initially , is fast , and has the same advantages as Gentoo .
Detractors complain about quality issues , some of the same complaints that I ’ve heard with Gentoo .
In Conclusion
Gentoo and Sabayon , without a doubt , result in the potential to create highly optimized systems .
Perhaps you do n’t think about that as an outcome with Slackware or Debian , but the fact of the matter is that with all five of these systems , if you so choose , you can go to source code and build or rebuild portions of your system .
Therefore , all five of these systems have the geek factor , the ability to take what comes in the base system and turn it into something very distinctive , and very YOU .
Frankly , I find most Linux distros to be very good , but even if they are n’t , out of the box , I can turn them into something good .
However , some systems are more suited , as configured , for various tasks .
Some make the best Live CD systems for speed , others make good toolchest systems , some make good desktops , others make good servers .

The flints were found in a ploughed field near Biggar Archaeologists have discovered the earliest evidence of human beings ever found in Scotland .
The flints were unearthed in a ploughed field near Biggar in South Lanarkshire .
They are similar to tools known to have been used in the Netherlands and northern Germany 14,000 years ago , or 12,000 BC .
They were probably used by hunters to kill reindeer , mammoth and giant elk and to cut up prey and prepare their skins .
The discovery conjures up a picture of wandering groups of hunters making their way across dry land where the North Sea is now , after the end of the Ice Age .
The details are revealed in the latest edition of British Archaeology magazine .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The editor , Mike Pitts , said the finds were " the most northerly evidence for the earliest people in Britain " .
Similar finds have been made in England , but they have mostly been south of the river Humber .
Up until now , the earliest evidence for humans in Scotland has come from sites such as Cramond , near Edinburgh .
Waste pits and discarded hazelnut shells found there have been dated to about 8,500 BC .
Tam Ward , from the Biggar Archaeology Group , which carried out the dig , said : " To push Scotland 's human history back by nearly 4,000 years is remarkable .
" We did n't set out to do that , " he added .
" What we wanted to do was tell the story of the landscape . "
He warned that " a lot of people wo n't believe this .
Not until they see the hard evidence " .
" But it 'll be great fun proving them wrong .
We 've got the physical objects , so we can just put them down on the table and say argue with that " .
This pointed flint would have been used as an arrow head
At first the flints were thought to date from the Neolithic period - about 3,000 BC .
But their true significance was later realised by Torben Ballin , an expert in stone finds , and Alan Saville from the National Museums of Scotland .
Mr Saville told BBC Scotland : " There would have been a temporary camp site where the flints were found , so there 's a faint possibility that there might be post holes and waste pits there . "
He added that the chances of finding that evidence were " fairly slim , but we live in hope " .
He said the diggers from Biggar were planning to go back to the site in the summer to explore it further .
Historic Scotland provided some funding for the work .

G webpage hacked · 2008 - 12-15 10:02 by Wladimir Palant
Did I already mention that running a web server is dangerous ?
Well , it was only one part of the picture .
Each server gets lots of automated requests trying to find vulnerabilities in the scripts that are installed ( SQL injection vulnerabilities got particularly popular lately ) .
But servers also get lots of requests on SSH and FTP ports trying to guess user names and passwords .
So you better do n’t use passwords that can be easily guessed using a dictionary attack .
Even better , do n’t use any passwords at all .
A recent victim of this attack is Filterset .
G webpage ( http://pierceive.com/~test/), apparently it uses a weak password for one of the FTP accounts .
Two days ago , somebody used that account to upload a defacement web page and a PHP script that should give the attacker full control over the site .
The only reason we do n’t see that server sending spam or scanning for vulnerabilities in other servers — that FTP account was n’t allowed to run PHP scripts , lucky us .
If somebody can reach Graham Pierce somehow , please do ( Filterset .
G forum is abandoned and full of spam ) .
How do I know all this ?
Easy , the access statistics for pierceive.com are accessible to anybody who knows the address .
That ’s one more thing you better do n’t do if you are running a web server .

Stephen Hawking ’s lecture , a signature event of The College Commons
If you ever fall into a black hole , do n't give up .
There is a way out !
Celebrated physicist , Stephen Hawking , delivered an inspiring speech to a full house in Bovard Auditorium on March 10 .
USC College Dean Howard Gillman kicked off the event by introducing Nick Warner , professor of physics , mathematics and astronomy .
Hawking was Warner ’s academic adviser while he studied at the University of Cambridge .
Warner said that Hawking has contributed greatly to popularizing science with his successful book A Brief History of Time , which sold 10 million copies and focuses on black holes and the big bang theory .
With a lifetime spent studying cosmology and black holes , Hawking ’s scientific prowess has also been captured by Hollywood in “ Star Trek , ” “ Futurama ” and “ The Simpsons ” television shows .
“ Hawking has completely changed the way scientists think about black holes by first showing they are real natural phenomena and then giving us remarkable new insights into how quantum theory implies that they must evaporate , ” Warner said .
Hawking ’s lecture focused on black holes , a term coined by American physicist John Wheeler .
Hawking discussed the history of black holes beginning with British physicist John Michell in 1783 , who suggested that there might be “ Dark Stars ” whose gravity is strong enough to trap light and prevent the stars from being seen from far away .
Two Americans , Albert Michelson and Edward Morley , proved that the speed of light is invariant and does not depend upon where it comes from .
Therefore , Michell ’s picture of Dark Stars is not entirely correct .
Next , Albert Einstein weighed in with his theory of relativity where space and time are no longer independent entities , but rather different directions in four - dimensional space - time .
Einstein ’s theory demonstrates that space - time is curved by the presence of matter .
Hawking said it is like putting a heavy ball on a rubber sheet , the sheet bends and if you increase the weight of the ball then eventually , at a critical mass and size , the ball will make a bottomless hole in the sheet that particles can get into , but not out of .
Stars do the same to the curving of space and time , and at a critical mass and size a star will collapse into a black hole .
From outside a black hole , you cannot tell what is inside .
Hawking noted that you can throw television sets , diamond rings or your worst enemy into a black hole — he is humorous as well as brilliant .
All the black hole remembers is the total mass and the state of rotation .
The boundary of a black hole is the event horizon where gravity is strong enough to pull light back .
Hawking likened it to going over Niagara Falls in a canoe .
If you are above the falls , you can get away if you paddle fast enough .
But once over the edge you are lost , there is no way back .
Hawking also described how he discovered that particles could slowly leak out of black holes and release energy .
A miniature black hole of the mass of a mountain could generate enough power to supply the world ’s energy needs .
However , the energy would be difficult to harness as the power could not be maintained in a power station .
It would drop through the floor and end up at the center of the Earth .
Scientists have searched for miniature black holes but to no avail .
Hawking said this is a pity as he would have garnered a Nobel Prize .
However , if a black hole is found through the Large Hadron Collider at CERN ( the world ’s largest and highest - energy particle accelerator ) , he interjected humorously , he will get a Nobel Prize after all .
Hawking also described how black holes seem to conflict with one of the fundamental ideas of science , namely determinism :
That is , given enough detail about the state of the universe at present one can predict the future and reconstruct the past .
The fact that black holes can absorb matter and then emit something completely different means that black holes appear to undermine determinism .
However , Hawking believes he has found a resolution in the ideas of Richard Feynman , who believes that quantum theory involves looking at all possible alternative histories .
This perspective also supports the idea that if you fall into a black hole , you may come out in another universe .
If there is a large hole and if it is rotating , you may pass through it and into another universe .
So , you can not come back to our universe .
Though Hawking said that he is keen on space flight , he is not willing to transport himself to another universe .
Hawking said that the message from his talk is that black holes are not the eternal prisons once thought .
If you feel you are in a black hole , do n’t give up .
There is a way out .
Warner and his colleagues selected questions from high school and USC students to ask Hawking following his talk .
Warner said “ The questions were superb , sophisticated , subtle or simple , but important .
Even a question was posed to Dr. Hawking ‘ Stephen , why are you so cool ? ’ ”

" Architect " is a swear word .
March 18 , 2009
Ah ! that 's it !
I 've often wondered what people really mean when they said ' Architect ' while talking about software .
None of the literal meanings seem to capture the way the word itself is applied in this context .
But I think I 've hit the thing on the noggin at last .
A ' swear word ' is a word whose literal meaning differs wildly from its contextual intent -- and whose intent can be bent to suit a great many contexts .
Take ' F ---' , for example .
The word has a literal meaning , something like ' To copulate vigorously ' -- but in actual use , the intent is generally bent to suit the context .
For example , when I hit my thumb with a hammer I say " F ---! " and in that context the meaning is : " It hurts a lot when I hit my thumb with a hammer . "
Or , when I get a flat tyre I say " F ---! " and it means , " This flat tyre is an unexpected interruption to my day that will cause undue expense and wasteful exertion . "
The quickest way to say all that is simply " F --- ! " .
Now imagine there is a guy in your organisation whose coding skills are terribly out of date , but who is not capable of performing any managerial duties .
If someone asks you , " Who is that guy ? " then you probably wo n't waste your breath by saying , " Him ?
A guy whose coding skills are terribly out of date , but who is not capable of performing any managerial duties . "
Instead you 'll permit yourself to emit a nasty little swear word and simply say , " Him ? Architect . "
Ouch !
Now , just say you work with an impractical fool with an over - inflated sense of self - importance who destroys whatever thing he touches , never ceasing to bring layers of accidental complexity to even the simplest of contrivances , but who is , thankfully , kept out of harm 's way by being assigned the task of writing grandiose - titled corporate documents that no one is ever expected to read .
When someone asks you who that guy is , you draw your breath in deep , and prepare to say :
" Him ?

"
So , again , you 'd just curse and say " Him ? Architect ? "

HONG KONG ( Reuters ) - The U.S. government plan to rid banks of toxic assets will rob American taxpayers by exposing them to too much risk and is unlikely to work as long as the economy remains weak , Nobel Prize - winning economist Joseph Stiglitz said on Tuesday .
“ The Geithner plan is very badly flawed , ” Stiglitz told Reuters in an interview during a Credit Suisse Asian Investment Conference in Hong Kong .
U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner ’s plan to wipe up to US $ 1 trillion in bad debt off banks ’ balance sheets , unveiled on Monday , offered “ perverse incentives , ” Stiglitz said .
The U.S. government is basically using the taxpayer to guarantee against downside risk on the value of these assets , while giving the upside , or potential profits , to private investors , he said .
“ Quite frankly , this amounts to robbery of the American people .
I do n’t think it ’s going to work because I think there ’ll be a lot of anger about putting the losses so much on the shoulder of the American taxpayer . ”
Even if the plan clears banks of massive toxic debt , worries about the economic outlook mean banks could still be unwilling to make fresh loans , while the prospect of a higher tax burden to pay for various government stimulus plans could further undermine U.S. consumers , he said .
Some Republican lawmakers have also expressed concern over the incentives offered by the government , which could end up providing private investors with more than 90 percent of the funds to buy the troubled assets .
But President Barack Obama has said the plan was critical to a U.S. economic recovery ,
Stiglitz , a professor at New York ’s Columbia University and a former World Bank chief economist , also urged G20 leaders at their London summit next month to commit to providing greater resources to developing countries and said China should be given bigger voting rights in the International Monetary Fund .
“ The voices of developing countries , and countries like China that will provide a lot of the money , are not heard . ”
China would be hard pushed to reach its targeted 8 percent economic growth this year , but the important thing was that at least the Chinese economy was still growing , he said .
Stiglitz welcomed China ’s proposal on Monday for an overhaul of the world monetary system in which Zhou Xiaochuan , governor of the People ’s Bank of China , said the IMF ’s Special Drawing Right has the potential to become a super - sovereign reserve currency [ ID : nPEK184558 ] .
Stiglitz has long called for the U.S. dollar to be replaced as the only reserve currency .
Basing a reserve system on a single currency whose strength depends on confidence its own economy is not a good basis for a global system , he says .
“ We may be at the beginning of a loss of confidence ( in the U.S. dollar reserve system ) , ” he said .
“ I think there is support for some sort of global reserve system . ”

BBC News , Nahr al - Bared , Lebanon
Some Palestinians worry they will never see their homes rebuilt The United Nations has laid a foundation stone at the Nahr al - Bared camp in northern Lebanon to mark the formal start of reconstruction there .
The Palestinian refugee camp was destroyed in heavy fighting between Islamist militants and the Lebanese army in 2007 .
Some 400 people died and 30,000 Palestinians were displaced .
But there is not enough money to rebuild completely , and some of its residents booed as work began .
As the first stone in the reconstruction of Nahr al - Bared was laid , some Western diplomats admitted the occasion was not as positive as the organisers had hoped .
The UN 's relief agency for Palestinian refugees ( Unwra ) has only managed to raise $ 43 m ( £ 31 m ) to rebuild the camp - a tiny fraction of the $ 430 m needed .
We have no right here ... we need life
Palestinian refugee Lebanon 's rich neighbours in the Gulf have not delivered the funds they pledged .
Only 50 m ( 165 feet ) away from the VIP guests , several hundred Palestinian refugees booed from behind barbed wire .
Displaced by last year 's fighting between the army and the Islamic militants , these refugees now live in the areas around the camp , surrounded by the rubble of their homes .
They say they worry about whether the international community will ever find the money to rebuild their homes .
Time bomb
But even if they do , Mahmoud , like many here , says it will not solve their problems in Lebanon .
" This is not life , this is not life .
We need to change this country .
We have no rights here , we have no rights .
We need life .
Where is the life ?
Here , no life . "
There are more than 200,000 Palestinian refugees in Lebanon , living in 12 camps across the country .
Palestinians have been here for more than 60 years - since the creation of Israel - but they are still barred from at least 70 professions , have no access to state education or healthcare , and cannot move freely or buy land .
These conditions turn the Palestinian camps into a breeding ground for extremism , a time bomb which will inevitably explode according to a recent report by the think tank , the International Crisis Group .
The ruins of Nahr al - Bared stretch along the Mediterranean coast and are a reminder of how violent the dissent bred inside these camps can be .

Artist iri5 ’s “ Ghost in the Machine ” is a series of portraits that connect music with visual art by making use of old cassette tapes as medium .
When I first saw Neatorama ‘s post about the project I thought it was just a cheap trick .
But after taking a closer look at the portraits , the simplicity and accuracy of the portraits changed my mind : I am now officially blown away .
Here ’s Hendrix on tape :
Joy Division ’s Ian Curtis gets a more elaborate treatment :
And here ’s the immortal Bob Dylan :
I want to try and recreate the Dylan portrait , but I know I ’ll only end up making black clouds .
Check out “ Ghost in the Machine ” as well as iri5 ’s other series on Flickr .
So I am going to do something that nobody on the Internet is doing lately : post a review of the Kindle 2 after having only used it for three days .
Shocking , yes , I know .
I had never even seen a Kindle of either model before getting the Kindle 2 .
I had , though , thought about getting an eInk device for some time .
The $ 359 Kindle 2 price tag caused me significant pause , though in the end I went for it due to the 30 - day return policy .
On the surface , I thought that it would be weird to have a Kindle .
After all , how often am I away from the computer ?
And there ’s a small local library a few blocks from where I work .
But I had a hunch it might turn out for me like my iPod did : something that did n’t sound all that useful from reading about it , but turned out to be tremendously so after having actually used it .
Turtleback Delivery
I ordered my Kindle 2 with standard shipping , which meant that it went by FedEx Smart Post .
Here is my SmartPost rant .
There are two words in “ Smart Post ” that are misleading .
I once had an item take literally a week to make it from St. Louis to Kansas .
That is , I kid you not , slower than the Pony Express ran in 1860 .
This time , my Kindle made it from Kentucky to Kansas in a mere five days .
Oh , and it spent more than 24 hours just sitting in St. Louis .
The Device
Overall , the device is physically quite nice .
It is larger and thinner than I had imagined , and the screen also is a bit smaller .
It is usually easier to hold than a paperback , due to not having to prevent it from closing too far at the binding edge .
The buttons are easy to press , though I could occasionally wish for them to be easier , but that ’s a minor nit .
The Screen
The most important consideration for me was the screen .
The eInk display as both stunningly awesome and disappointing .
This is not the kind of display you get on your computer .
Or , for that matter , any other device .
It is n’t backlit .
It reacts to light as paper does .
It can be viewed from any angle .
And it consumes no power to sustain an image ; only to change it .
Consequently , it puts up a beautiful portrait of a famous author on the screen when it is put to sleep , and consumes no power to maintain it .
The screen ’s response time is n’t anywhere near as good as you ’d expect from a regular LCD .
It flashes to black when you turn a page , and there is no scrolling .
On the other hand , this is not really a problem .
I found the page turning speed to be more than adequate , and probably faster than I ’d turn the page on a real book .
The resolution of the display has the feeling of being incredible .
The whole thing provides a far different , and in my eyes superior , experience to reading on an LCD or CRT screen .
My nit is the level of contrast .
The background is not really a pure white , but more of a light gray .
This results in a contrast level that is quite clearly poorer than that of the printed page .
At first I thought this would be a serious problem , though I am growing somewhat more used to it as I read more .
Reading Experience
Overall , I ’ve got to say that it is a great device .
You can easily get lost in a book reading it on the Kindle .
I ’m reading David Copperfield for the first time , and have beat a rather rapid path through the first five chapters on the Kindle already .
And that , I think , is the best thing that could be said about an ebook reader .
It stays out of the way and lets you immerse yourself in your reading .
The Kindle ’s smartly - integrated Oxford - American Dictionary was useful too .
One thing about a novel written 150 years ago is that there are some words I just have n’t ever heard .
“ Nosegay , ” for instance .
You can move a cursor to a word to see a brief pop -up definition appear , or press Enter to see the entire entry .
This is nice and so easy that I ’m looking up words I would n’t have bothered to if I were reading the book any other way .
A nosegay , by the way , is a bouquet of showy flowers .
Buying Experience
The Kindle has a wireless modem tied to the Sprint network on it .
The data charges for this , whatever they may be , are absorbed by Amazon in the cost of the device and / or the books you buy for it .
This turned out to be a very smart piece of engineering .
I discovered on Amazon ’s Kindle Daily Post that Random House is offering five mostly highly - rated sci- fi books for free on the Kindle for a limited time .
So I went over to the page for each , and made my “ purchase ” .
It was only a click or two , and I saw a note saying it was being delivered .
A few minutes later , I picked up the Kindle off the kitchen counter .
Sure enough , my purchases were there ready to read .
Impressive .
This level of ease of use smells an awful lot like Apple .
Actually , I think it ’s surpassed them .
You can delete books from the Kindle and re-download them at any time .
You can initiate that operation from either the PC or the Kindle .
And you can also browse Amazon ’s Kindle store directly from the device itself .
I have n’t subscribed to any magazines or newspapers , but I gather that they deliver each new issue automatically the moment it ’s released by the publisher , in the middle of the night .
I pre-ordered the ( free to Kindle ) Cook ’s Illustrated How - to - Cook Library .
It makes me way happier than it should to see “ This item will be auto - delivered to your Kindle on March 26 ” in the order status .
Free Books
Amazon ’s Kindle library has a number of completely free Kindle books as well .
These are mostly out - of - copyright books , probably sourced from public etext places like Project Gutenberg , and converted to the Mobipocket format that is the Kindle ’s native format with a minimum of human intervention .
As they are free , you can see them in Amazon ’s library if you sort by price .
And , of course , Amazon will transfer them to the Kindle wirelessly , and maintain a copy of them in your amazon.com account .
Unfortunately , as with free etexts in general on the Internet , the quality of these varies .
I was very annoyed to find that many free etexts look like they were done on a typewriter , rather than professionally printed .
They do n’t use smart quotes ; only the straight ones .
When reading on a device that normally shows you a faithful print experience , this is jarring .
And I spent an inordinate amount of time trying to find a copy of Return of Sherlock Holmes that actually had the graphic figures in Dancing Men .
Ah well .
Your Own Content
Amazon operates a mail server , username@kindle.com .
You can email stuff to it , and it will convert it to the Kindle format and wirelessly upload it to your kindle for a fee of $ 0.10 .
Alternatively , you can use username@free.kindle.com , which does the same thing at no charge , but emails you back a link to download the converted work to install via USB yourself .
I tried it with a number of PDFs .
It rejected — about a dozen times from only my single mail message — a PDF containing graphic images only .
However , it does quite well with most text - heavy PDFs — notably doing an excellent job with Return of Sherlock Holmes from bookstacks.org — the only source I found that was both beautifully typeset and preserved the original figures .
Unfortunately , the PDF converter occasionally has troubles identifying what should be a paragraph , particularly in sections of novels dealing with brief dialog .
I have also sent it some HTML files to convert , which it also does a great job with .
You can also create Mobipocket files yourself and upload them directly .
There is a Mobipocket creator , or you can use mobiperl if you are Windows - impaired or prefer something scriptable on Linux .
The device presents itself as a USB mass storage device , so you can see it under any OS .
There ’s a documents folder to put your files in .
You can back it up with your regular backup tools , too .
And it charges over USB .
Web Browser
I have n’t tried it much .
It usually works , but seems to be completely down on occasion .
It would get by in a pinch , but is not suitable for any serious work .
The guys over at XKCD seem to love it ; in fact , their blog post was what finally convinced me to try the Kindle in the first place .
Final Thoughts
I ’ve ordered a clip - on light and a “ leather ” case for the Kindle .
The light , I believe , will completely resolve my contrast complaint .
The leather case to protect it , of course .
I can’t really see myself returning the Kindle anymore .
It ’s way too much fun , and it ’s making it easier to read more again .
And really , if Amazon manages to reach out to a whole generation of people and make it easy and fun for them to read again — and make a profit doing it , of course — they may move up a notch or two from being an “ evil patent troll ” company to a “ positive social force ” company .
Wow , never thought I ’d say that one .

Were there once habitable planets long ago around stars that are now dead ?
A team of astronomers have found evidence that between 1 - 3 percent of white dwarf stars are orbited by rocky planets and asteroids , suggesting these objects once hosted solar systems similar to our own .
White dwarf stars are the compact , hot remnants left behind when stars like our Sun reach the end of their lives .
Using data from the Spitzer Space Telescope , an international team of astronomers have determined that asteroids are found in orbit around a large number of white dwarfs , perhaps as many as 5 million in our own Milky Way Galaxy .
The atmospheres of these white dwarf stars should consist entirely of hydrogen and helium but are sometimes found to be contaminated with heavier elements like calcium and magnesium .
The new observations suggest that these Earth - sized stars are often polluted by a gradual rain of closely orbiting dust that emits infrared radiation picked up by Spitzer .
Presenting his team ’s findings at the European Week of Astronomy and Space Science conference at the University of Hertfordshire , Dr. Jay Farihi of the University of Leicester said that the data from Spitzer suggest that at least 1 in 100 of white dwarf stars are contaminated in this way and that the dust originates from rocky bodies like asteroids ( also known as minor planets ) .
In our Solar System , minor planets are the left over building blocks of the rocky terrestrial planets like the Earth .
“ In the quest for Earth - like planets , we have now identified numerous systems which are excellent candidates to harbour them , ” said Farihi .
“ Where they persist at white dwarfs , any terrestrial planets will likely not be habitable , but may have been sites where life developed during a previous epoch . “
The new findings indicate the dust is completely contained within the Roche limit of the star — close enough that any object larger than a few kilometers would be ripped apart by gravitational tides ( the same phenomenon which led to the creation of Saturn ’s rings ) .
This backs up the team ’s hypothesis that the dust disks around white dwarfs are produced by tidally disrupted minor planets .
In order to pass this close to the white dwarf , an asteroid must be perturbed from its regular orbit further out – and this can occur during a close encounter with as yet unseen planets .
Because white dwarfs descend from main sequence stars like the Sun , the team ’s work implies that at least 1 % to 3 % of main sequence stars have terrestrial planets around them .
Perhaps the most exciting and important aspect of this research is that the composition of these crushed asteroids can be measured using the heavy elements seen in the white dwarf .
Farihi sees this as a crucial step forward .
“ With high quality optical and ultraviolet observations ( e.g. the Hubble Space Telescope ) , we should be able to measure up to two dozen different elements in debris - polluted white dwarfs .
We can then address the question , “ Are the rocky extrasolar planets we find similar to the terrestrial planets of our Solar System ? ”

If you 'd like a reading on how the economy is affecting the average San Franciscan , you could call an economist .
You could study wages and layoffs .
You might even graph the rise of foreclosures .
Or you could stop into the Provident Loan Association on Mission Street behind the Old Mint .
" It 's heartbreaking , " said manager Ben Shemano .
" We have people bringing in their last treasures , filled with unrealistic hopes and expectations . "
Shemano and others at Provident do n't like to think of it as a pawn shop .
There are no handguns , toaster ovens or electric guitars in the window .
The store - which deals in jewelry , silver and fine art - was founded by the city 's financial bigwigs in 1912 to combat runaway loan sharking .
For generations it has been the place to go when a piece of jewelry happened into your hands through inheritance , good luck or a broken heart .
" For years I developed a cozy little business with engagement rings , " Shemano said .
" The engagement did n't work out , someone wanted to go to Mexico , so they sold it . "
Things changed about a year ago .
People are n't coming in for spare cash any more .
This is financial life and death .
" This is the worst I have ever seen , " said managing partner Joseph Chait .
He would know :
His late father took over the business in 1965 ; his wife 's grandfather started working there in 1952 .
Chait has been there since 1971 .
" We are seeing more people who , if they are not at the end of their rope , they are close to it .
They are just trying to stave it off . "
Customers come through the door in a sad , daily procession .
They are close to default on their mortgage , car payments or their kid 's tuition .
They have made the wrenching decision to quite literally sell the family jewels .
Shemano said they tell stories about a piece of jewelry or silver , how it has been in the family for generations .
With every telling , the imagined value tends to grow .
" You 've got to pop bubbles sometimes , " Chait said .
" They tell you , ' I remember this silver tea set from when I was little . '
And you have to say , ' Well , it 's worth $ 40 . ' "
At times there are tears - " about once a week or twice a month on average , " Chait said .
Other times reality is slow to sink in .
Chait recalls a woman who wanted cash for her silver and gold Rolex watch .
She needed the money , she said , to make her Lexus payment .
" They are looking to get money to solve their problems , " Chait said .
" We 're the lenders of last resort . "
Most of the customers are hoping for one of those " shoe box " stories .
Chait said a fishing buddy once brought in a shoe box full of old jewelry from his grandmother .
One piece included a blue stone that Chait said " might be worth something . "
It turned out to be a sapphire set in a piece made by a famous designer .
It sold for $ 30,000 .
It usually does n't work out that way .
Last week a woman came in with more than a dozen items .
She told him several of the pieces had been custom crafted .
She had sky - high appraisals .
Shemano took a look at what she had .
Before he met her eyes , he knew she would be disappointed .
" It was just a nightmare , " he said .
" She asked for the number , and it was just devastating to her . "
She told him how she'd had an impressive job with an international firm that went belly - up .
Her investments went south , and now she and her husband had rented a three - bedroom home with two other couples .
The plan was to sell the jewels , get a little cushion and hope for an economic uptick .
Surely , she thought , her grandmother 's prized pearl necklace would fetch a nice price .
" It 's always Grandma 's pearls , " Shemano said .
" They bring in these high appraisals .
But how can you price for a secondary market when there is no secondary market ? "
The woman quietly packed up her jewelry and said she 'd like to get some other bids .
Shemano , as he often does , provided her with a list of others in the city who deal in jewelry .
Twenty - four hours later , the woman was back .
She 'd take the offer , she said .
Hey there , time traveller !
This article was published 15/3/2009 ( 4216 days ago ) , so information in it may no longer be current .
A 56 - year - old man was taken to hospital in critical condition after he was run over by a car while helping a woman practise parallel parking on Maurepas Crescent about 3:30 p.m. on Saturday , police said .
The man was was pinned under the vehicle , driven by a 47 - year - old woman , as the car reversed .
Emergency crews lifted the vehicle off the man .
The drug war is based on a repugnant assertion : that you do not have ownership over your own body ; that you do n't have the right to decide what you 'll do with your body , with your property and with your life .
The position of the drug warriors is that you should be in jail if you decide to do something with your body that they do n't approve of .
This is an abomination of everything that America is supposed to stand for .
As long as this country continues the drug war , you are not free .
At the root , then , those that force the drug war on you are enemies to your freedom .
If you are concerned at all about liberty , the economy , the Constitution and the power of the Federal Government - you cannot ignore the US government 's longest and most costly " war " - the War on Drugs .
But no matter how long it lasts , how much is costs , how many lives are disrupted , and how much it fails - the war rages on .
Why ?
Well , because Federal " authorities " do n't care what your local laws are , they do n't care what your personal choices are , and they do n't care what reason you have for your choices .
All they care about is their own power .
Period .
In this ongoing drug war , you are always treated as a suspect and your neighborhood is much less safe .
You are searched at airports and your bank accounts are spied on .
While drug users who are no physical threat to anyone but themselves are put in jail , the prisons become more and more overcrowded , resulting in the early release of violent criminals on a regular basis .
If you love your freedom and you want your city to be safer , this psychotic war on drugs must be ended - now .
Understandably , many Americans are afraid that ending the drug war will result in countless drug addicts , including children .
In reality , though , that 's just what we have now !
On top of it , we generally do n't even consider the people who are addicted to federally - approved drugs to be drug addicts .
According to a 2004 CDC report , almost one - half of Americans use at least one prescription drug .
It should be obvious , then , that the drug war has done nothing to reduce Americans ' use of drugs - it 's simply to control which drugs people use , and who can make a profit from them .
So what 's really going to be different - can our nation 's addiction to drug use get any worse ?
It 's doubtful that legalizing all drugs could make things any worse , but even if it does , then so be it .
People will always do plenty of things that are bad for them , and there 's no reason to put them in prison for it .
Think about all the things that you do which are bad for your own health and well being - should the government outlaw those too ?
People eat too much fast food and they forget to floss every day .
They watch too much TV and they do n't count their calories .
They stay up too late and they spend too much .
And , guess what else ?
People swallow , snort , shoot and smoke drugs that are both legal and illegal - and it's not going to stop .
A free society just would n't force you , under the threat of punishment , to be " good " to yourself all the time .
That was the job of your parents - unless , of course , you want the feds to be your new " daddy . "
In all seriousness , though , if we are ever going to have a nation that respects the Bill of Rights , of which the Ninth and Tenth Amendments may be the most important , the DEA and the entire drug war must be eliminated .
If not , what 's going to be next ?
Orwellian telescreens in our homes and a state - mandated morning exercise routine ?
That would most assuredly keep the cost down on the coming national healthcare system .
Wo n't that be nice ?
Every day that the war on drugs continues is another day of injustice ; another day of spending countless billions to lock people up that do n't behave the way the bureaucrats want them to behave .
It 's time to bring this multi-billion dollar attack on your liberty to an end .

The Consumer Economy Is n't Coming Back
At the risk of confirming my critics ’ dumbest charge — that I am a “ doomer ” — the mandate of clarity requires me to ask : to what state of affairs do we expect to recover ?
If the answer is a return to an economy based on building ever more suburban sprawl , on credit card over - spending , on routine securitized debt shenanigans in banking , and on consistently lying to ourselves about what reality demands of us , then we are a mortally deluded nation .
We ’re done with that , we ’re beyond that now , we ’ve crossed the frontier and left that all behind , and we ’d better get our heads straight about it .
I maintain that there are countless constructive tasks waiting to occupy us on a long national “ to do ” list for rebuilding a national economy , but they are way different than the ones currently preoccupying government and the mainstream media .
The Obama White House , Congress , and The New York Times are hung up on exercises in futility — “ rescuing ” banks and insurance companies that cannot be rescued ( because they are hopelessly trapped in “ black hole ” credit default swaps contracts ) , and re-starting a “ consumer ” binge that was completely crazy in the first place , based , as it was , on a something - for - nothing standard - of - living .
Meanwhile , if the buzz on the blogosphere is a measure of anything — and I think it is — then a new consensus is forming out there about where to start doing things differently .
Unfortunately after less than two months in office , President Obama finds himself awkwardly behind - the - curve on this .
It begins with the understanding that a general bank rescue is hopeless and , going a step further , that the people who caused the train wreck of “ innovative ” securities have to be prosecuted .
The public ’s collective voice on this is muted but growing .
It has been muted by the general air of blackmail that the banks have used to enthrall policy and opinion — the “ too big to fail ” idea — in effect holding the nation ’s future for ransom .
Last week , New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo hauled Bank of America chief Ken Lewis into his office to explain who , exactly , received an aggregate several billion dollars in bonuses late in 2008 after the US Treasury forked over billions of dollars in TARP money to his bank .
That was a good start .
Mr. Lewis , being lawyered - up to the max , had the temerity to reply that answering the question would compromise his ability to keep talented people in his employ .
For that impertinence alone , Mr. Lewis ought to be dragged over fifteen miles of broken chardonnay bottles behind a GMC Yukon — but that is not how we do things in American jurisprudence .
To be more realistic , a simple indictment would be in order , and then Mr. Lewis can answer this question , and a few others , in the comfort of an air - conditioned courtroom .
Ultimately , that might lead to Mr. Lewis becoming the wife of a bodybuilder in one of New York State ’s houses of correction — a just outcome that would go far in rejiggering the nation ’s expectations about how people in authority ought to behave .
And such an outcome might lead to the conviction of many other brides - to - be from the Wall Street debutante pool .
Now it has come to light , just last week in the wake of AIG ’s latest bail - out , that previous AIG bail - out money to the tune of $ 50 billion was distributed to a set of banks including Goldman Sachs ( former employer of then Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson and then New York Federal Reserve Governor Tim Geithner ) , plus Morgan Stanley , Merrill Lynch , Mr. Lewis ’s Bank of America , and a long list of European banks with operations in the USA .
Since the transactions took place in New York State , the investigation of these irregularities alone could solve the unemployment problem here if NY Attorney General Cuomo were given a free hand in hiring staff to depose everyone involved — including the hiring of caterers to bring in coffee and meals for round - the - clock proceedings .
All of this raises another awkward question : where is United States Attorney General Eric Holder in this situation ?
Surely the federal statutes offer some grounds for inquiring about the misuse of Treasury funds — and many other issues arising from Wall Street ’s stupendous orgy of misbehavior .
What I ’m hearing out in the blogosphere is a growing clamor to call people to account before we are really able to move on to the massive task - list that awaits us in rebuilding our economy .
The bigger question for now is whether any of these authorities will act effectively before the public simply goes apeshit and starts burning down Greenwich , Connecticut .
The dangerous shift in public mood is liable to occur with shocking swiftness , in the manner of “ phase change , ” where one moment you see a bewildered bunch of flabby clown - citizens vacuously enraptured by “ American Idol , ” and the next moment they are transformed into a vicious mob hoisting flaming brands to the window treatments of a hedge funder ’s McMansion .
The moment of opportunity for avoiding that outcome is looking sickeningly slim right now .
Another thing that President Obama can set into motion anytime — and pull himself back to the head of the curve of leadership — is to either by executive order or by proposal to congress , shut down the credit default swap system for a period of time while procedures are drawn up to place all these dubious contracts in a “ clearing ” market , where the holders of them will have to come clean about what they ’re sitting on .
The lack of this procedure is allowing zombie banks to hold the United States hostage for never - ending bailout ransoms .
None of these banks are going to survive another six months anyway , so the basic blackmail motif that the whole money system will collapse if ransoms are not paid is a bluff that has to be called sooner or later in any case .
So Mr. Obama might as well get on with it .
Once these two matters are dealt with — an earnest start - up of prosecutions and disabling the credit default swap blackmail racket — then perhaps a stressed - out and impoverished public might be induced to not go apeshit and instead get on with the mighty task of rebuilding our nation along lines that have a plausible future .

Lately on the Net started appearing gossips about the new North - American currency “ Amero ” which would , as people say , come to replace Canadian and American dollars together with Mexican peso and would become one and only currency in North America .
Some photos of actual amero bills and coins appeared on different near world - conspiracy blogs and youtube channels
Well , in Russia they stepped bit further and think that the currency would be called not Amero but Lunaro , or Lunar if to be exact , and probably it would replace not only Northern American currencies but all currencies on Earth and even , probably , on Moon .
That ’s what they call the real New World Order .
And yes , there are some secret bill samples that leaked and we can publish those , like , rare shots .
A human wearing the Honda helmet managed to control the robot Asimo without moving a muscleAn elaborate electronic helmet that allows the wearer to control a robot by thought alone has been unveiled by researchers in Japan .
Scientists at the Honda Research Institute demonstrated the invention today by using it to move the arms and legs of an Asimo humanoid robot .
To control the robot , the person wearing the helmet only had to think about making the movement .
Its inventors hope that one day the mind - control technology will allow people to do things like turn air conditioning on or off and open their car boot without putting their shopping down .
The helmet is the first " brain - machine interface " to combine two different techniques for picking up activity in the brain .
Sensors in the helmet detect electrical signals through the scalp in the same way as a standard EEG ( electroencephalogram ) .
The scientists combined this with another technique called near - infrared spectroscopy , which can be used to monitor changes in blood flow in the brain .
Brain activity picked up by the helmet is sent to a computer , which uses software to work out which movement the person is thinking about .
It then sends a signal to the robot commanding it to perform the move .
Typically , it takes a few seconds for the thought to be turned into a robotic action .
Honda said the technology was not ready for general use because of potential distractions in the person 's thinking .
Another problem is that brain patterns differ greatly between individuals , and so for the technology to work brain activity must first be analysed for up to three hours .
The project will also benefit from miniaturisation to make the helmet wearable on the move .
At the moment it comes attached to computer equipment the size of a domestic refrigerator .
The demonstration is the latest by the diminutive robot Asimo , which stands slightly higher than four feet ( 130 cm ) tall .
The multimillion - pound machine has already been taught to walk , talk and fetch drinks .
It notched up a world first last year when it conducted the Detroit Symphony Orchestra .
One double bass player likened the experience to being conducted by a metronome .
Asimo , which stands for Advanced Step In Innovative Mobility , is one of a very few robots that can walk reliably on two legs .
It is fitted with twin cameras in its head and is powered by 34 individual motors .
Honda hopes that by 2020 the robot will be cheap enough , and capable enough , to help pensioners and nurses with simple tasks .

But sometimes in our haste to find a villain in every situation , we wind up painting some people as cackling cartoon villains when they were really just random guys , or even pretty awesome .
Here are a few names you might want to give a second chance :
Hitler .
Stalin .
Ivan the Terrible .
We all love these guys .
Which is to say , we hate them and everything they stand for , but we 're secretly glad they existed .
Otherwise we'd have to learn about the cultural and political tensions behind world history , as opposed to boiling it down to " there was a bad guy who made crap happen because he was evil . "
6 Genghis Khan
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
You Know Him As :
Genghis Khan was a barely - coherent fount of animalistic violence , who tore across Asia with his horde of barbarians laying waste to every village in his path , killing the men , raping the women , eating the children , killing and raping the livestock , burning everything down then raping and eating the ashes , etc .
Anything that fits under a modern white person 's notion of " pillage , " Khan did while laughing a guttural , jackal - like laugh .
But in Reality :
What would you think of a guy who brought all the gangs of South Central Los Angeles together into one happy community ?
Well , deepen the grudges by about a millennium and expand the whole thing to cover one and a half million square miles , and you 've got the task Genghis Khan achieved before he was even famous .

Back in the day , Mongolia was just a bunch of scattered nomadic tribes who would wander around , kill each other , wander around some more and basically be laughably irrelevant on a global scale .
Then Genghis came along and united the entire clusterfuck in a couple of decades .
And if you 're wondering if his " peace talks " were conducted by a thousand burly men with clubs , sorry , Genghis was always more of a politician than a psychopath .
He attracted the allegiance of other tribes by spreading the word that life under his rule was crazy awesome .
He did away with the sacred Mongolian tradition of " Fuck the soldiers , just fuck ' em " by allowing defeated enemies to join , giving the men a share in the spoils of war and basing promotions on merit rather than politics .
Soldiers had never been treated so well by a commander before , or if you think about it , since .

So once he 'd turned Mongolia into one big happy family , his next job was to keep them that way .
He figured if the people were left to their own devices they'd get antsy and just drift back into the wandering around and killing each other for lack of a better idea , so he arranged activities to keep them organized , like massive hunts or conquering all of mainland Asia .
Seriously , that 's a leading theory , that Genghis had his armies invade everything in sight as some kind of team - building exercise .
Beats the shit out of softball .

Para apoyar a la econom�a mexicana , la Junta de Gobierno del Banco de M�xico decidi� reducir en 75 puntos base la tasa de inter�s interbancaria a un d�a , para situarla a un nivel de 6 % .
La modificaci�n result� por encima de la proyecci�n del mercado que estimaba una disminuci�n de 50 puntos base .
Al presentar el anuncio de pol�tica monetaria , el Banco de M�xico dio a conocer que en el informe sobre la inflaci�n , correspondiente al primer trimestre del 2009 que se publicar� a fin de mes , se dar� a conocer un nuevo pron�stico de la actividad econ�mica para los pr�ximos dos a�os , as� como de la inflaci�n .
Banxico asegur� " que los distintos indicadores econ�micos apuntan a una fuerte contracci�n de la econom�a y del empleo durante los �ltimos dos trimestres , lo que resultar� en una ca�da anual del PIB en 2009 substancialmente superior a la anticipada por banco central " .
Agreg� que se prev� una inflaci�n en descenso que ser� m�s pronunciada a partir del mes de mayo .
El banco central asegur� que vigilar� estrechamente el balance de riesgo y sus acciones de pol�tica monetaria futura ser�n congruentes con la situaci�n econ�mica y con la nueva trayectoria de la inflaci�n y el logro de la meta de 3 % para el final de 2010 .

The Power of
Positive Huging Card
Over 3 Million Sold
How many hugs do you need ?

In the answer to The AP 's counterclaims we filed yesterday , we included a dozen examples of AP photographs
The AP sells , which consist almost entirely of the copyrighted artwork of Fairey and other artists .
Today ,
The AP issued a statement accusing Fairey of " making attacks " on The AP and " deliberately omitt[ing ] " the " newsgathering context in which the various images were generated and in which they are used . "
The funny part about this is Fairey does n't allege The AP 's photos are illegal or infringing , much less " attack " The AP .
The point is very simple :
The AP applies an obvious double - standard .
It is happy to sell , through its image licensing database , photographs that are really just bare copies of artists ' work , yet it condemns Fairey for using an AP photograph in a far more creative , transformative , expressive and defensible way .
Fairey 's allegations do n't say the AP should n't be allowed to do what it does .
These allegations -- and the AP 's response -- just demonstrate
The AP demands wide leeway for its use of other artists ' work , but insists that others , like Fairey , are entitled to much less leeway .
As for " newsgathering , " The AP misses the point again .
While the photographs may have originally been taken for the purpose of newsgathering , they are presently for sale on The AP 's image licensing database as a commercial product for " professional photo buyers . "
So let 's get this straight :
We 're not alleging The AP 's photographs infringe anyone 's rights , or demanding The AP stop doing the excellent work it does .
We simply contend The AP should have to play by a consistent set of rules .
We contend fair use should apply broadly -- for everyone .
If The AP 's bare copies of other artists ' work are protected by fair use , then Fairey 's significantly more transformative and expressive work has to be , too .
If Steve Schmidt is for same - sex marriage , can Senate Republicans be far behind ?
Well , yes .
We do n’t expect establishment Republicans in Washington — or establishment Democrats , for that matter — to suddenly endorse gay marriage .
But in a possible sign of the momentum of the gay - marriage movement , Mr. Schmidt , who was a senior adviser to the Republican presidential nominee , Senator John McCain , last year , is promoting gay marriage this afternoon .
He endorsed same - sex marriage last month , in an interview with the Washington Blade .
Today , Mr. Schmidt , who also served as a top Bush aide , discusses the subject with the Log Cabin Republicans , a group that supports gay rights .
According to CNN , he will call on conservative Republicans to drop their opposition at a lunchtime speech in Washington .
Mr. Schmidt , who has a sister who is a lesbian , plans to say that there is nothing about gay marriage that is un-American or that threatens the rights of others and that in fact it is in line with conservative principles .
“ There is a sound conservative argument to be made for same - sex marriage , ” Mr. Schmidt plans to say , according to speech excerpts obtained by CNN .
“ I believe conservatives , more than liberals , insist that rights come with responsibilities .
No other exercise of one ’s liberty comes with greater responsibilities than marriage . ’ ”
His remarks come in the midst of a flurry of legislative and judicial activity advancing gay marriage in various states .
In the last two weeks , Iowa and Vermont have approved same - sex marriage , joining Connecticut and Massachusetts .
The movement appears to be picking up steam in other states too , including New York , where Gov. David Paterson introduced a bill on Thursday to legalize gay marriage .
In his interview with The Blade , Mr. Schmidt said he voted against California ’s Proposition 8 , which ended same - sex marriage in that state .
Mr. McCain supported the measure and has opposed gay marriage .
But Mr. Schmidt , who said he has never agreed “ 100 percent ” with any candidate for whom he has worked , is undeterred .
“ I ’m personally supportive of equality for gay couples and I believe that it will happen over time , ” he told The Blade .
“ I think that more and more Americans are insistent that , at a minimum , gay couples should be treated with respect and when they see a political party trying to stigmatize a group of people who are hard - working , who play by the rules , who raise decent families , they ’re troubled by it . ”
He said that his views had been shaped by the presence of a gay person in his family .
He did not disclose his sister ’s identity but said she accepted her sexual orientation .
“ I think one of the most tragic things in the world [ is ] when people are closeted and are denied their sexuality and this incredibly important part of their lives and the destructive potential of that action , ” Mr. Schmidt told The Blade .
“ And I ’ve come to believe over time that , as Dick Cheney said , freedom for everybody means freedom for everybody . ”
Mr. Cheney has a lesbian daughter .
It would be a watershed moment in American politics if other Republicans began supporting gay marriage , just as it would be if President Obama joined some of his fellow Democrats and got on board .
In last year ’s presidential campaign , Mr. Obama said he believed marriage should be between a man and a woman , but he also said he opposed a constitutional amendment to protect traditional marriage .
“ Historically we have not defined marriage in our constitution , ” Mr. Obama said in August at a forum at the Saddleback Church with Mr. McCain .
“ It has been a matter of state law .
That ’s been our tradition . ”
He did say he supported civil unions .
“ I do n’t think in any way this affects my core beliefs about what marriage is , ” Mr. Obama said .
“ My faith is strong enough and my marriage is strong enough that I can afford those civil rights to others . ”

From Dr. Steven Jones ;
A back - scattered electron ( BSE ) image featured in the newly published paper .
Formally published in a peer - reviewed Chemical Physics journal , today :
“ Active Thermitic Material Discovered in Dust from the 9/11 World Trade Center Catastrophe ” by Niels H. Harrit , Jeffrey Farrer , Steven E. Jones , Kevin R. Ryan , Frank M. Legge , Daniel Farnsworth , Gregg Roberts , James R. Gourley and Bradley R. Larsen
The paper ends with this sentence : “ Based on these observations , we conclude that the red layer of the red / gray chips we have discovered in the WTC dust is active , unreacted thermitic material , incorporating nanotechnology , and is a highly energetic pyrotechnic or explosive material . ”
In short , the paper explodes the official story that “ no evidence ” exists for explosive / pyrotechnic materials in the WTC buildings .
What is high - tech explosive / pyrotechnic material in large quantities doing in the WTC dust ?
Who made tons of this stuff and why ?
Why have government investigators refused to look for explosive residues in the WTC aftermath ?
These are central questions raised by this scientific study .
The peer - review on this paper was grueling , with pages of comments by referees .
The tough questions the reviewers raised led to months of further experiments .
These studies added much to the paper , including observation and photographs of iron - aluminum rich spheres produced as the material is ignited in a Differential Scanning Calorimeter ( see Figures 20 , 25 and 26 ) .
The nine authors undertook an in - depth study of unusual red-gray chips found in the dust generated during the destruction of the World Trade Center on 9/11/2001 .
The article states : “ The iron oxide and aluminum are intimately mixed in the red material .
When ignited in a DSC device the chips exhibit large but narrow exotherms occurring at approximately 430 ˚C , far below the normal ignition temperature for conventional thermite .
Numerous iron - rich spheres are clearly observed in the residue following the ignition of these peculiar red / gray chips .
The red portion of these chips is found to be an unreacted thermitic material and highly energetic . ”
The images and data plots deserve careful attention .
Some observations about the production of this paper :
1. First author is Professor Niels Harrit of Copenhagen University in Denmark , an Associate Professor of Chemistry .
He is an expert in nano - chemistry ; current research activities and his photo can be found here :
http://cmm.nbi.ku.dk/
Molecular Structures on Short and Ultra Short Timescales
A Centre under the Danish National Research Foundation The Centre for Molecular Movies was inaugurated 29th November 2005 , at the Niels Bohr Institute , University of Copenhagen .
The Centre is made possible through a five year grant from the Danish National Research Foundation ( see e.g. www.dg.dk).
We aim to obtain real time “ pictures ” of how atoms are moving while processes are taking place in molecules and solid materials , using ultrashort pulses of laser light and X - rays .
The goal is to understand and in turn influence , at the atomic level , the structural transformations associated with such processes .
The Centre combines expertise form Risø National Laboratory , University of Copenhagen , and the Technical University of Denmark in structural investigation of matter by synchrotron X - ray based techniques , femtosecond laser spectroscopy , theoretical insight in femtosecond processes , and the ability to tailor materials , and design sample systems for optimal experimental conditions . ”
We understand that the Dean of Prof .
Harrit ’s college , Niels O Andersen , appears as the first name on the Editorial Advisory Board of the Bentham Science journal where the paper was published .
2 . Second author is Dr. Jeffrey Farrer of BYU .
http://www.physics.byu.edu/images/people/farrer.jpg
3 . Dr. Farrer is featured in an article on page 11 of the BYU Frontiers magazine , Spring 2005 : “ Dr. Jeffrey Farrer , lab director for TEM ” ( TEM stands for Transmission Electron Microscopy ) .
The article notes : “ The electron microscopes in the TEM lab combine to give BYU capabilities that are virtually unique … rivaling anything built worldwide . ”
The article is entitled : “ Rare and Powerful Microscopes Unlock Nano Secrets , ” which is certainly true as regards the discoveries of the present paper .
4 . Kudos to BYU for permitting Drs. Farrer and Jones and physics student Daniel Farnsworth to do the research described in the paper and for conducting internal reviews of the paper .
Dr. Farrer was formerly first author on this paper .
But after internal review of the paper , BYU administrators evidently disallowed him from being first author on ANY paper related to 9/11 research ( this appears to be their perogative , but perhaps they will explain ) .
Nevertheless , the paper was approved for publication with Dr. Farrer ’s name and affiliation listed and we congratulate BYU for this .
We stand by Dr. Farrer and congratulate his careful scientific research represented in this paper .
5 . Perhaps now there will finally be a review of the SCIENCE explored by Profs .
Harrit and Jones and by Drs. Farrer and Legge and their colleagues , as repeatedly requested by these scientists .
We challenge ANY university or established laboratory group to perform such a review .
This paper will be a good place to start , along with two other peer - reviewed papers in established journals involving several of the same authors : Fourteen Points of Agreement with Official Government Reports on the World Trade Center Destruction Authors : Steven E.

SACRAMENTO , Calif . -
The national wave of auto dealership closures has come crashing down on thousands of people who are on the hook for used - car loans that dealers were supposed to absolve .
When a car buyer still owes money on a vehicle he is trading in , the dealer promises to pay off the outstanding loan , then resells the vehicle .
But as more dealers go out of business , some are sticking consumers with the bill .
Lenders can then go after the previous owner who thought the debt was paid , or repossess the car from the new owner who assumed it came with clear title .
" It 's devastating for people when it happens because they have two car payments and they can't afford them , " said Rosemary Shahan , president of Consumers for Auto Reliability and Safety , a Sacramento - based nonprofit that lobbies on behalf of vehicle owners .
" Their credit is destroyed for no fault of their own because the dealer defaulted . "
Regulators in California and other states , including Florida , Iowa and Washington , are seeing a surge in consumer complaints .
They warn the problem is sure to grow this year because of the deepening recession and continued trouble in the auto industry .
About a quarter of all car buyers are vulnerable because they still owe money on their trade - in or lease when they buy another vehicle , according to industry tracker Edmunds.com .
It 's become more common for a driver to owe money on a trade - in as people stretch their car payments over six or seven years to make them more affordable .
Inga and Brian Randle of Elk Grove , a Sacramento suburb , are among those who got burned .
In 2006 , they bought two 2001 Mercedes vehicles , a CLK430 convertible and an E320 sedan , finding out afterward that the small Sacramento dealer had not paid off the previous owners ' liens .
Creditors called , and the Randles found they owed $ 40,000 on the old loans .
" I stopped paying on both of those loans because I could n't afford to keep paying .
It 's a huge stain on my credit - and I had very good credit , " Inga Randle said .
" Our life has really been affected by what 's going on here . "
The Randles now drive 15 - year - old vehicles they own outright .
Brian Randle is working more overtime to rebuild their savings , and the couple has been dragged into the dealership 's bankruptcy proceedings .
A few states have programs that require dealers to post substantial insurance bonds to repay victimized car buyers .
Consumers in states with no such program , or a poorly funded one , have little recourse but to sue and hope for at least a small slice of the assets if the dealer has filed for bankruptcy .
Authorities have brought charges in rare cases where they have proof of intentional wrongdoing , but local prosecutors , motor vehicle departments and state attorneys general are paying more attention as the problem grows .
California state Sen. Ellen Corbett , a Democrat from San Leandro , has introduced legislation that would require dealers to prove they are paying off a vehicle 's lien before transferring the title .
That 's already a requirement in some states , said Jason King , spokesman for the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators .
Corbett 's bill would require auto dealers to post bonds as high as $ 250,000 with the California Department of Motor Vehicles so liens could be paid off if a dealership collapses .
" It 's becoming a serious problem because the consumer , through no fault of their own , may be facing financial ruin just because they purchased a car , " Corbett said .
California is hit particularly hard because it has the nation 's largest auto market , more dealers going out of business , and more buyers who owe money on their trade - ins .
DMV spokesman Mike Marando said the agency had 319 open investigations on dealers for failing to pay off liens or register a vehicle as of December , up from about 200 cases at the same time a year ago .
It fielded 1,655 vehicle - transfer complaints against dealers from July to September , nearly double the number of consumer complaints for the same period in 2007 .
Complaints also are rising in Florida .
Between March 1 and Sept. 1 , 2008 , Florida officials deemed valid 103 complaints regarding auto dealers ' delinquent loan payments .
By comparison , there were 37 confirmed complaints during the same period in 2007 .
Florida also received more than 1,886 confirmed complaints of delays in title transfers during that five - month period in 2008 , compared with 900 a year earlier , said Ann Nucatola , spokeswoman for the state 's motor vehicle department .
Data regarding auto loan defaults are not compiled nationally , but other states have similar problems , according to the National Automobile Dealers Association , National Consumer Law Center , prosecutors and private attorneys who are suing bankrupt dealerships .
Washington state created a task force in October after an agency that oversees dealer licenses saw a 4 percent increase in complaints against dealers who failed to transfer titles .
Officials are having trouble helping consumers who still owe money on trade - in vehicles if a dealer defaults , said Mary Lobdell , an assistant attorney general for the state .
For now , they are advising consumers to hire attorneys and seek a share of the dealer 's $ 30,000 bond .
" The problem is once they 've gone out of business , there 's no money .
You can't get blood from a turnip , " Lobdell said .
Nevada Department of Transportation investigator Gordon Rogers said he is dealing with about four cases a month , double the number of a year ago .
More than 5,000 new and used car dealerships closed nationwide last year , according to industry groups .
That includes 450 in California .
" Unfortunately , with this economy , we can expect to see a growing number of dealers go out of business in the next year , " said Iowa Assistant Attorney General Bill Brauch , who heads the National Association of Attorneys General auto working group .
" I think there are going to be problems around the country with consumers having to be made whole and consumers having to eat significant costs . "
Iowa , like California , requires dealers to post a $ 50,000 bond , but some states ' bonds are as low as $ 5,000 .
Even $ 50,000 is often too little to cover defaults , Brauch said .
California lawmakers took an extra step by creating a Consumer Recovery Fund in 2007 , with money coming from a $ 1 fee on each vehicle sold .
Ohio , Virginia and West Virginia also have restitution funds , according to the National Consumer Law Center and the Ohio attorney general 's office .
But California 's fund cannot be used yet because the state is still forming the agency that will consider claims and distribute the money .
Consumers are left to sue the dealer , which typically has declared bankruptcy and has no money to reclaim , said Armando Botello , a spokesman for the California DMV .
He said the state can suspend the dealer 's license or refer the dealer to local prosecutors but cannot recover buyers ' money .
Before they land in trouble , used - car buyers should insist on seeing a vehicle 's title to make sure it has no liens , consumer advocates say .
They also say buyers offering trade - ins should first pay off the loan themselves if possible , or deal only with high - volume dealers who are part of a larger auto group and thus are less likely to fold .
" You 've got to check out the dealer 's financial health as best you can if you 're going to let them handle your vehicle resale , " said Jesse Toprak , executive director of automobile industry analysis for Edmunds .

The Jean Dale : Prelude to a Memory
by Robert B. Dance
The classic North Carolina Core Sounder , Jean Dale has come to the end of it's working days , and now rests out of the water at Harkers Island , North Carolina .
There are several classic designs of working boats that originated on the coast of North Carolina , and the Core Sound Sink Netter ranks as among the very best of those designs .
The boats took hold in the 1930s , and were refined and built into the 1950s .
Of those examples of Core Sounders , the most beautiful I have seen is the Jean Dale .
The Jean Dale was built in 1946 .
I first saw the boat in the 1960s , and immediately began to use it in my paintings .
WoodenBoat magazine ( Jan / Feb 2003 ) ran an article by Michael B. Alford titled , " The Core Sounders " which gave a comprehensive history of the design featuring photographs and several of my painting sof the Jean Dale .
At that time , I also tried to raise funds for the boat 's restoration by offering a print of the Jean Dale .
Then Before Unfortunately , efforts to raise money for the Jean Dale 's restoration have not equaled the task at hand .
The Jean Dale is rapidly deteriorating on dry land , and soon will be beyond the point of possible restoration .
Should this happen , a prime example of the American workboat will be lost forever .
This boat deserves to be preserved as a particularly beautiful rendition of the adage that , " Form follows function " in American design .... " if it looks good , it probably works good " .
Hopefully , funds can be found to preserve this noteworthy boat , so that it may rest in a museum to be seen by those who appreciate American maritime heritage .
Note : The Jeal Dale Restoration is now complete !

Proceeds from the sale of the limited edition prints " The Jean Dale " & " Cape Lookout Classics " purchased at the museum will contribute to the continued upkeep and care of the restored Core Sound Sink Netter ' Jean Dale ' .
Restoring the Jean Dale Artist Bob Dance works on a painting of the Jean Dale .
Noted North Carolina maritime artist Bob Dance remembers his first encounter with the Jean Dale : " It was in the late '60s , and my family used to vacation at Morehead City , " Dance explains .
" I would explore the whole area looking for subject matters to paint .
On Harkers Island one day , I saw the Jean Dale for the first time at the very end of the island .
It was the first Core Sound sink netter I had ever seen .
I regard it as one of the three or four classic North Carolina boats . "
Dance also witnessed the decline of wooden boat - building .
" I noticed that the tradition was tapering off on Harkers Island .
The younger people were moving away .
That tradition has to be passed down from father to son or a good friend .
These boats were no longer being built on the island .
I decided to start photographing and painting the Jean Dale because the boat was so beautiful .
I 've always thought that something that looks good works well - form follows function .
Things that look lousy usually do n't work too well , " Dance said .
" Take that boat from ' The Perfect Storm . '
That was an ugly boat , and it turned over at sea ! "
Dance has featured the Jean Dale in many of his paintings over the years .
" I have painted that boat well over a dozen times - maybe 20 or 25 times - in a variety of settings , " he said .
" I would come back every summer to photograph and paint the boat .
Through all those years , you regard something you are familiar with as a friend . "
Like a faithful friend , the Jean Dale continued to ply the waters of Core Sound until the late 1990s , when Harry Lewis ' health began to fail .
The boat that came to represent so much of the region 's boat - building tradition ended up docked and decaying at a Harkers Island harbor .
After Lewis ' death his family donated the Jean Dale to the Core Sound Waterfowl Museum in September 2000 for restoration and to preserve island traditions .
But the aged boat badly needs repair .
Besides suffering from weathering , its basic design had been altered :
The doghouse up front had been removed , and a modern cabin had been built , changing the traditional lines of the boat .
That 's when Dance came up with an idea to help raise funds for the restoration .
" When I saw that it had been donated to the museum , I thought I should try to do something to help raise the money for the restoration of the boat , " he said .
" It looks like it needs a lot of work .
A lot of people , besides me , are donating their time to this project . "
In what has ubiquitously been named the " Jean Dale Project , " Dance decided to paint an original painting of the Jean Dale and sell limited - edition prints with the profits going to the museum for the restoration .
Others in the community have chipped in .
Workers from East Bay boatworks used heavy equipment to lift the Jean Dale and haul the boat to the museum .
And an anonymous donor provided money for a concrete pad and framework to keep the boat in dry dock .
Clarence Willis , along with other locals , is helping to restore the Jean Dale - providing labor and a lifetime of knowledge of a boat he helped build .
It 's going to be a costly undertaking - requiring $ 60,000 just to build a roof to protect the aging boat from the elements , especially rainwater , which is the bane of any wooden boat .
" She 's failing fast , " Clarence Willis explains .
" It 's going to take a lot to bring her back to the way she was . "
But if anyone can do it , the people of Harkers Island can .
Despite her graceful lines , the Jean Dale was constructed strictly as a working boat in the 1940s .
Handcrafted of longleaf pine and juniper planks , the sink netter was built to handle the rigors of year - round commercial fishing as evidenced by these photos of the boat in the late 1960s on Harker 's Island .
The Jean Dale
What do you know about the Jean Dale ? "
I yell above the sounds of circular saws and hammer beats .
The September sun is retreating westward toward Beaufort , and the salt - laden air of Core Sound is thick all around .
Clarence Willis drives one last nail into a juniper plank and motions for his helpers to knock off for the evening .
Tanned island men silently pack up their tools amid the sawdust and lumber and disappear in the fleeting light , leaving me alone with Willis and his son , Junior .
" What you want to know about her ? "
Willis asks back sheepishly , arms folded , with an old hammer in the crook of one arm and his strong back leaning squarely against the bow of the unfinished wooden skiff .
He looks me over with the distrust of a stranger bearing beads for a one - sided trade .
I understand his distrust .
Here on Harkers Island , I 'm considered a " dingbatter , " an outsider .
And it 's folks like me - in Willis ' and most other natives ' views - who 've changed this island , its people and their way of life .
" She is a Core Sound sink netter , right ?
One of the last of her kind left ? "
I know enough to ask the right questions .
" She was just another fishing boat - the Jean Dale .
There was a time when there were 50 or 60 boats like her on this island , " Willis responds matter - of - factly .
" But there ai n't many left anymore . "
His 71 - year - old blue eyes flash back to the past , and I know he knows more .
His leathered arms unfold and relax as he continues .
" She was a good sea boat built for Harry Lewis back in the early ' 40 s " Willis explains as he lays down the hammer on a sawhorse .
" She was a real fishing boat , maybe 40 foot long .
Harry worked her year - round - shrimping and pulling nets , " he said .
" Sank twice and caught afire once , but they did n't give up on her . "
And the Jean Dale did n't give up either .
The planked boat , built of heart pine and juniper , was fished nearly continuously for 50 years , Willis explained , bringing back loads of shrimp , gray trout , spot and sea mullet to Harkers Island .
Once ,
Harry sank her off Brown 's Island in rough seas with a heavy load of jumbo croakers - maybe 120 to 125 boxes full .
" It brigged up on him ; and with so much weight , the stem went down .
But they raised her and got her dry in a day or two and went back at it again . "
Harry Lewis was the sole owner of the Jean Dale .
And when he got too old to fish her , his grandson took up fishing the boat for a while .
" She did n't owe Harry nothing , " Willis said .
" She had well paid for herself . "
" Who built the Jean Dale ? " I blurt out , guessing that Willis knows much more .
" Brady Lewis built her , along with some other men on the island .
And I helped work on the Jean Dale when I was young , " he explains .
" Brady Lewis - well , he 's the one that started this ( boat - building ) mess with the flared bow - ' flow'r ' we call it , and he taught me too .
I quit school when I was 13 and started working for Brady .
At first , he would just let me hold the planks .
But he got to where he would trust me more to cut the planks . "
Famed boat - builder Brady Lewis crafted the Jean Dale , with the help of others including Clarence Willis ( above ) who was a teen - ager at the time .
Now in his 70s , Willis is working with others on Harker 's Island to restore the historic fishing boat .
Famed boat - builder Brady Lewis crafted the Jean Dale , with the help of others including Clarence Willis ( above ) who was a teen - ager at the time .
Now in his 70s , Willis is working with others on Harker 's Island to restore the historic fishing boat .
The Jean Dale was indicative of the " Harkers Island boat , " Willis explained .
She was narrow , long and graceful with a distinctive flared bow - made famous by Brady Lewis - and a low transom and a rounded stern to prevent the fishing nets from hanging up when they were pulled in by hand by a three - man crew .
She had a fairly flat bottom for a shallow draft to navigate the waters of Core Sound .
But the flared bow , with just enough dead rise , helped cut the waves offshore in heavy seas .
" The narrower the boat , the more dead rise , " Willis said .
" A narrow boat was a better sea boat .
But you did n't let her get side - to in rough seas .
You took your waves head - on .
And the round stern worked good for pulling in the sink nets , " he added .
The Jean Dale was fitted with a six - cylinder Chrysler gasoline automobile engine and had a 22 - inch wheel ( propeller ) , Willis explained .
But she could make 18 to 20 knots in good conditions at 3,400 rpm's .
And she had a distinctive " doghouse " up front where the captain could pilot her in rough conditions .
Brady Lewis - considered by many the father of North Carolina boat building - is credited on Harkers Island with developing the flared - bow boat .
He devised a simple mathematical formula to lay up the narrow juniper planks in various widths in nearly seamless perfection to create the distinctive bow shape .
" He just got it in his head , the flow'r , " Willis said .
" Besides , it makes a prettier boat anyhow . "
Before the days of modern fiberglass , Brady Lewis taught Willis and many others on the island how to work out the calculations for the graceful curves of wood .
In his nearly 60 years as a boat - builder , Willis has built hundreds of wooden boats , from skiffs all the way up to 70 - footers .
But he 's never touched fiberglass and never will .
" Ca n't stand the stuff .
In my opinion , it makes a sorry boat - too easy to bust her with fiberglass .
Wood is much stronger .
I would n't even try to guess at the number of wood boats I 've built .
I 've retired twice from it , but then somebody on the island wants me to build 'em a boat . "
That 's where this 24 - footer he 's working on came from .
The plans themselves are not written down - each one comes from Willis ' head , just like his teacher , Brady Lewis , did it .
But too few builders work with wood anymore .
Willis wistfully thinks back .
" I wish it was back like it was 20 years ago .
There 's too few working in the fishing now , and wood and materials are too expensive .
There 's still some juniper left , but no heart pine .
And everybody wants fiberglass now .
Used to be people made boats for people who used boats to work and earn a livin ' .
Then the big people - the moneymen - got into it with fiberglass .
Naturally , the dingbatters came in too .
They put the damper on us and wooden boat - building . "
History of the Core Sounder Built as a commercial workboat , the clean lines of the Jean Dale , with its flared bow and rounded stern , represent a pinnacle in North Carolina boat building , explains Mike Alford , former curator of maritime history at the North Carolina Maritime Museum .
And the lasting popularity of the flared bow made famous by the wooden boat - builders on Harkers Island and Core Sound has spread up and down the East Coast and is still found in an exaggerated form in the modern fiberglass fishing boats of today .
The Core Sounders , as this class of boat was called , once dotted the small harbors of Harkers Island and nearby coastal communities .
Sleek and gleaming white , they had a low , graceful sheer that swept up to a smart , flared bow , while the aft end terminated in a low , almost dainty round stern , Alford explained .
There was a simple low cabin forward that sheltered a galley , a couple of berths for the crew and a bad - weather steering station .
Directly over the station a hatchlike windowed box allowed the helmsman to poke his head up and look around .
Built on the island , and in a few nearby mainland communities , they ranged in length from around 35 feet to more than 40 and were powered by single engines .
" In the building of boats , there is a general maxim that changes occur slowly and only when necessary , " Alford said .
" Probably nothing ever overhauled the boat builder 's status quo more significantly , or as rapidly , as did the advent of the internal combustion engine . "
The story of the Core Sounder began when the fishing community began to accept gasoline engine power as a viable alternative to sail .
In North Carolina that was near the end of the first decade in the 20th century .
Three decades later , the Core Sounder emerged .
Although elements of its design and construction can be traced back to sailing craft , the Core Sounder represents what might be considered the perfection of a power - driven hull , explains Alford , not as the end result of a series of modifications to sailing hulls .
Boat - building has always been a major interest in North Carolina since its earliest days as a colony .
Prior to the Civil War , boats built with logs were the rule .
Following the war , two boat types dominated inshore fish - ery and commercial activities in the state .
The round - bottom shad boat , with its versatile sprit-main and jib rig , prevailed in the northern sounds - the Albemarle , Pamlico and Croatan .
Core Sound , to the south , was the stronghold of the sharpie - a flat - bottomed immigrant from Connecticut .
By the late 1800s , sharpies were found as far south as Wilmington and Southport , and as far north as the sounds extended .
But Core Sound was their stronghold .
By the early 1930s , with powered boats everywhere , the new challenge was a demand for " bigger and better " boats that could navigate the shoal sounds , contend with summer squalls and venture into deep - sea fishing grounds .
Enter the Core Sounders .
Brady Lewis and those who learned from him began producing the first of the Core Sounders in the 1930s .
Earlier versions were typically built on a 4 - to - 1 ratio of length - to - beam , and were powered by engines of 115 horsepower or less .
Just before World War II and immediately after , boats experienced a trend that saw horsepower double in a short time , and length - to - beam ratios began a downward trend toward 3 - to - 1 .
The Jean Dale represents the best of the postwar boats , Alford said .
She is simple and clean , and has all the features in the appropriate proportions that give the Core Sounders their distinctive look : low freeboard , saucy bow flare and a graceful round stern .
By the early ' 50s , the use of larger and faster engines resulted in less graceful proportions .
Deeper and more robust , the round stern was no longer the sweetly balanced end of a sleek , easily driven hull .
At the same time the flared bow sections grew more and more extreme .
But the Jean Dale had the grace and charm that well - balanced elements of design give to a boat .
Prints for Planks
The restoration of the Jean Dale is a major financial undertaking for the Core Sound Waterfowl Museum , explains museum director Karen Amspacher .
" We 've consulted with the Smithsonian and the North Carolina Maritime Museum on methods for restoring the boat , " she said .
" Our main goal is to restore the Jean Dale for nomination as a historic vessel to the National Register of Historic Places . "
That means replacing rotted planks and restoring the pilothouse to its original configuration - no minor feats considering the cost of labor and wood .
The museum also wants to build a roof to protect the boat from the elements , and there are plans to eventually have exhibits and a teaching area to share the legacy of boat building w ith the public .
To raise funds for the $ 100,000 restoration project and subsequent upkeep of the boat , the Core Sound Museum has teamed up with artist Bob Dance to offer special reproductions of his painting " The Jean Dale " ( above ) and Dance 's painting " Cape Lookout Classics " .
Proceeds from " The Jean Dale " edition prints were provided for the boat 's restoration and proceeds from the sale of the " Cape Lookout Classics " edition will continue to benefit both the the Jean Dale and the Museum .
To see the restored Jean Dale , visit the Core Sound Waterfowl Museum on Harkers Island , North Carolina .

DID YOU KNOW THAT ARTISTS CANNOT DEDUCT CHARITABLE
CONTRIBUTIONS TO CAUSES LIKE THE JEAN DALE RESTORATION ?
Artists ' Fair - Market Value Deduction Bills
Making the Case to Congress to Treat Artists Like All Other Taxpayers BACKGROUND
In 1969 when Congress repealed legislation allowing artists , writers and composers to take a fair - market value deduction for their works donated to a museum , library or archive , it essentially deprived Americans of their cultural patrimony .
As a result , works donated by artists to nonprofit institutions dramatically declined .
While artists can no longer donate works for a fair - market deduction , collectors who own those works can take the fair - market value deduction when they donate to a nonprofit institution .
IMPACT OF THE CURRENT LAW
When artists do not have the same incentive to donate that other taxpayers enjoy our heritage is often sold abroad or goes into private collections .
For example : Igor Stravkinsky planned to donate his papers to the Music Division of the Library of Congress the month the tax reform act of 1969 was signed into law .
Instead , the papers were sold to a private foundation in Switzerland .
The Museum of Modern Art in New York received 321 gifts from artists in the three years prior to the repeal , in the three years following repeal the museum received 28 works of art from artists — over a 90 % decrease .
The biggest loser was the Library of Congress , which annually received 15 to 20 large gifts of manuscripts from authors .
In the four years after repeal it received one gift .
PENDING LEGISLATION
Identical bills have been introduced in the House and Senate .
Congressmen Amo Houghton ( R - Corning , NY ) and Ben Cardin ( D - Baltimore , MD ) introduced H.R. 1598 " Artists ' Contribution to American Heritage Act " and Senators Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) and Robert Bennett ( R - UT ) introduced S. 694 " Artist - Museum Partnership Act " .
Both bills have broad bipartisan support , with over 50 House members cosponsoring and seven senators .
The Senate passed the bill last year , but the House did not accept it .
ACTION NEEDED
We urge Congress to : Cosponsor H.R.1598 or S. 694 .
Ask Reps. Bill Thomas ( R- CA ) , Chair of the Ways and Means Committee and Charles Rangel ( D - NY ) , Ranking Democrat on the committee to help move H.R. 1598 to the House floor .
Ask Senators Max Baucus ( D - MT ) , Chair of Finance Committee and Charles Grassley ( R- IA ) , Ranking Republican on the committee to move S. 694 to the Senate floor .
Pass this long - overdue legislation and restore nation ’s cultural heritage to the American public .
TALKING POINTS
As federal support for arts and cultural institutions declines , the tax code should encourage donations from our most creative citizens for future generations to enjoy .
Most nonprofit institutions have no acquisition funds to purchase creative works and must rely on donations .
The tax code strives for " horizontal tax equity " — equal treatment to all similarly situated taxpayers .
Artists should be treated as any other taxpayer donating a work of appreciated property CLICK HERE TO WRITE YOUR REPRESENTATIVE AND URGE THEIR SUPPORT OF H.R. 1598 " Artists ' Contribution to American Heritage Act " AND S. 694 " Artist - Museum Partnership Act " !

Five years ago , when JoAnn ’s Alzheimer ’s was first diagnosed , I could n’t imagine anything less fair .
At the time , I composed a mental list of all the people I knew who could lose their minds without anybody noticing , scores of people whom I ’d never heard say one original thing .
While my grandmother , on the other hand , was the genius of the cocktail party , a brunette version of our fellow Texan Ann Richards , who always seemed poised with a staggering , stiletto quip .
As a young artist in New York , I ’d spent years trying to find my voice .
When I did , it was my grandmother ’s .
To this day , I ’ve never liked anything I ’ve created that did n’t somehow remind me of her .
So the fact that my clumsy development and slow self - discovery was occurring just as her decline began felt like a tragic bargain .
I was finding my voice just as she was losing hers .
The only certainty about Alzheimer ’s is that it ’s characterized by uncertainty :
There is no definitive test , no definitive diagnosis .
But in July several years ago , after undergoing a gruesome but unserious operation , my grandmother began to exhibit signs of the disease .
It was as if her anesthesia never lifted .
I now believe she suffered a mini- stroke mid-operation  an event that frequently “ ignites ” incipient Alzheimer ’s  but by the time I formed this suspicion , it was too late to test .
So throughout that year , as my grandfather and I accompanied her to a legion of new doctors , each of whom mentioned the possibility of Alzheimer ’s , my grandmother grew ever more foggy , sometimes hilariously so .
“ The wonderful thing about Alzheimer ’s , ” she would say , unfurling her arm like Bette Davis , “ is that you always live in the moment . ”
Like many Southern women of her generation , my grandmother had been a stifled lady prone to fits of drape - drawn depression , medicated with Champagne and Streisand .
Q : What is the Geithner Plan ?
A : The Geithner Plan is a trillion - dollar operation by which the U.S. acts as the world 's largest hedge fund investor , committing its money to funds to buy up risky and distressed but probably fundamentally undervalued assets and , as patient capital , holding them either until maturity or until markets recover so that risk discounts are normal and it can sell them off -- in either case at an immense profit .
Q : What if markets never recover , the assets are not fundamentally undervalued , and even when held to maturity the government does n't make back its money ?
A : Then we have worse things to worry about than government losses on TARP - program money -- for we are then in a world in which the only things that have value are bottled water , sewing needles , and ammunition .
Q : Where does the trillion dollars come from ?
A : $ 150 billion comes from the TARP in the form of equity , $ 820 billion from the FDIC in the form of debt , and $ 30 billion from the hedge fund and pension fund managers who will be hired to make the investments and run the program 's operations .
Q : Why is the government making hedge and pension fund managers kick in $ 30 billion ?
A : So that they have skin in the game , and so do not take excessive risks with the taxpayers ' money because their own money is on the line as well .
Q : Why then should hedge and pension fund managers agree to run this ?
A : Because they stand to make a fortune when markets recover or when the acquired toxic assets are held to maturity : they make the full equity returns on their $ 30 billion invested -- which is leveraged up to $ 1 trillion with government money .
Q : Why is n't this just a massive giveaway to yet another set of financiers ?
A : The private managers put in $ 30 billion and the government puts in $ 970 billion .
If we were investing in a normal hedge fund , we would have to pay the managers 2 % of the capital and 20 % of the profits every year .
In this case , the private managers ' returns can be thought of as ( a ) a share of the portfolio's total return proportional to their 3 % contribution , plus ( b ) a " management incentive fee " of ( i ) 0 % of the capital value and ( ii ) between 0 % ( if the portfolio returns 3 % per year ) and 9 % ( if the portfolio returns 10 % per year ) -- much less than hedge - fund managers typically charge .
the Treasury is only paying 0 % of the capital value and 17 % of the profits every year . [ 1 ]
Q : Why do we think that the government will get value from its hiring these hedge and pension fund managers to operate this program ?
A : They do get 17 % of the equity return .
17 % of the return on equity on a $ 1 trillion portfolio that is leveraged 5 - 1 is incentive .
Q : So the Treasury is doing this to make money ?
A : No : making money is a sidelight .
The Treasury is doing this to reduce unemployment .
Q : How does having the U.S. government invest $ 1 trillion in the world 's largest hedge fund operations reduce unemployment ?
A : At the moment , those businesses that ought to be expanding and hiring cannot profitably expand and hire because the terms on which they can finance expansion are so lousy .
The terms on which they can finance expansion are so lazy because existing financial asset prices are so low .
Existing financial asset prices are so low because risk and information discounts have soared .
Risk and information discounts have collapsed because the supply of assets is high and the tolerance of financial intermediaries for holding assets that are risky or that might have information - revelation problems are low .
Q : So ?
A : So if we are going to boost asset prices to levels at which those firms that ought to be expanding can get finance , we are going to have to shrink the supply of risky assets that our private - sector financial intermediaries have to hold .
The government buys up $ 1 trillion of financial assets , and lo and behold the private sector has to hold $ 1 trillion less of risky and information - impacted assets .
Their price goes up .
Supply and demand .
Q : And firms that ought to be expanding can then get financing on good terms again , and so they hire , and unemployment drops ?
A : No .
Our guess is that we would need to take $ 4 trillion out of the market and off the supply that private financial intermediaries must hold in order to move financial asset prices to where they need to be in order to unfreeze credit markets , and make it profitable for those businesses that should be hiring and expanding to actually hire and expand .
Q : Oh .
A : But all is not lost .
This is not all the administration is doing .
This plan consumes $ 150 billion of second - tranche TARP money and leverages it to take $ 1 trillion in risky assets off the private sector 's books .
And the Federal Reserve is taking an additional $ 1 trillion of risky debt off the private sector 's books and replacing it with cash through its program of quantitative easing .
And there is the fiscal boost program .
And there is a potential second - round stimulus in September .
And there is still $ 200 billion more left in the TARP to be used in other ways .
Think of it this way : the Fed's and the Treasury 's announcements in the past week are what we think will be half of what we need to do the job .
And if it turns out that we are right , more programs and plans will be on the way .
Q : This sounds very different from the headline of the Andrews , Dash , and Bowley article in the New York Times this morning : " Toxic Asset Plan Foresees Big Subsidies for Investors . "
A : You are surprised , after the past decade , to see a New York Times story with a misleading headline ?
Q : No .
A : The plan I have just described to you is the plan that was described to Andrews , Dash , and Bowley .
They write of " coax[ing ] investors to form partnerships with the government " and " taxpayers ... would pay for the bulk of the purchases ... " -- that 's the $ 30 billion from the private managers and the $ 150 billion from the TARP that makes up the equity tranche of the program .
They write of " the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation will set up special - purpose investment partnerships and lend about 85 percent of the money ... " -- that 's the debt slice of the program .
They write that " the government will provide the overwhelming bulk of the money — possibly more than 95 percent ... " -- that is true , but they do n't say that the government gets 80 % of the equity profits and what it is owed the FDIC on the debt tranche .
That what Andrews , Dash , and Bowley say sounds different is a big problem : they did not explain the plan very well .
Deborah Solomon in the Wall Street Journal does , I think , much better .
David Cho in tomorrow morning 's Washington Post is in the middle .
[ 1 ]
Too many people are saying that this was too much of an apples - to - oranges comparison .
What the private investors get is not a management fee -- it is an equity return , proportional to their equity participation .
On the other hand , the private investors do get the ability to borrow non-recourse at a subsidized interest rate -- and the fact that the government 's debt investment is non-recourse makes it very equity - like .
My preferred way to cut the Gordian knot is to say that the " management fee " the privates are getting is the difference between the profits they will get and the 3 percent of the profits from the portfolio that their putting up 3 percent of the money should get them -- which I calculate , assuming that the government charges an interest rate of 3 percent ) to vary between 0 percent of the profits ( if the portfolio yields only 3 percent per year ) to 9 percent of the profits ( if the portfolio yields 10 percent per year ) .

The Constitution and Marijuana
...by Ed Denson
For years people have asked me what the constitution has to do with marijuana .
Last month I had to give a presentation at the Environmental Law Conference and much of it had to do with that topic .
Here 's some of it .
By the way , I 'm not a lawyer yet and this is not legal advice .
Marijuana has several aspects .
Its easier to follow things if we talk about 4 of them : hemp , ganja , medical marijuana and pot .
Hemp :
By hemp I mean cannabis grown for its non-psychoactive properties .
Bird seed , hemp cloth , that sort of thing .
The constitutional issues around hemp were well set out in Harrelson v Kentucky not long ago .
Harrelson ( or his lawyer ) said they were arbitrary and overbroad laws .
The idea is that even if the government can outlaw psychoactive use of marijuana it should not outlaw non-psychoactive use just because it is too lazy to tell the difference .
Like many constitutional legal problems the decision here is a balancing act .
What 's balanced is :
How important is the outlawed " legal " conduct vs. how important the government 's reason for outlawing it is , and how much trouble it would be to write the law right in the first place .
Harrelson won his case .
That 's partly because Kentucky , which is a major marijuana growing area , not only joined the other states in outlawing cultivation ; they even outlawed possession of hemp in any form - like the shirt I am wearing as I type this .
Harrelson is a hemp merchant when he is not a movie star .
He said it was not only a major imposition on his rights to not let him grow hemp , but it was worse yet not to let him sell it .
The government responded that pot is very bad , and hemp growing would make enforcing the law against psychoactive pot almost impossible .
Harrelson got an expert to say it was easy to tell hemp from pot and impossible to hide pot among the hemp plants , therefore the cops would have no trouble in enforcing the anti-pot laws .
He said that hemp is best made from low THC cannabis which is no good as pot .
Hemp cannabis is visually different , raised differently ( grown close together for stalks rather than far apart for buds ) , and any attempt to grow high THC plants around the low THC hemp would result in cross pollination and make the pot useless .
The judge found that the Kentucky law was arbitrary and overbroad .
Although Kentucky 's law was an especially stupid one , there is no reason that such constitutional arguments could not prevail elsewhere .
Hemp cultivation is well on its way to being legal , but not because of courts .
The definition of marijuana is being changed in the legislatures to exclude hemp .
Ganja :
I am referring to the religious use of cannabis as use of ganja , in this article .
Your right to use ganja and stronger psychedelics religiously probablly finds its legal expression strongest under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act ( RFRA ) of 1993 .
The constitutional question here involves so - called laws of general applicability .
The question is : when a law passed for some reason not related to making problems for religion , does in fact make problems for religion , what changes : the religious person , or the law ?
If that sounds abstract let 's talk about a good example involving free expression .
Indiana passed a law forbidding public nudity .
Some exotic dancers in a private club were arrested and sued .
They said nude dancing was expressive and therefore constitutionally protected .
The Supreme Court said that it would not like it if a law were passed saying you cannot express yourself by dancing nude ; but this law was just a general law about public nudity that was not aimed at the dancers and their form of expression .
So tough luck for them .
They would have to give up that last square inch of expression and keep slightly clothed because Indiana 's interest in protecting the public morality was very important and the dancers interest in that last square inch was not .
In the early 1990s the Supreme Court applied the same test to religious freedom and came to the same conclusion : if the law just happens to make it impossible for you to live according to your religious beliefs , find some new beliefs , because the government does n't have to change the law .
There was a big uproar and the Congress overwhelmingly passed the RFRA of 1993 .
Its quite short and it says that when the law prevents you from living according to your religious beliefs , the law has to change ( usually ) .
The courts hate this law .
And by and large they have refused to follow it .
They narrowed it down to only applying when the law affected a sincerely held belief that was central to your religion .
However to the credit of the courts , you do n't have to be a member of an organized religion , and your belief does n't have to make sense .
You might believe , for instance , that the mothership is behind the Hale - Bopp comet and eating toxic applesauce is a great way to beam yourself up .
The question is not verity , it is sincerity .
The Heaven 's Gate 39 did not violate any laws .
There are gazillions of cases invoking the RFRA of 1993 .
Usually in vain .
A California court told Gregory Peck ( not the actor ) that his Isreal Zion Coptic Church could use ganja as a sacrament , and he could possess it , but he could n't grow it or buy it .
This decision is downright spooky when you consider the parallel arguments about medical marijuana .
Most cases seem to involve prisoners unable to follow the practices of their religious beliefs .
The courts generally could care less .
They find that prison discipline would collapse if anything beyond generic chapel occurred .
Some cases , however , involve established churches who violate zoning laws - usually by feeding the poor or some other charitable act which upsets the neighbors .
By and large the courts have favored the churches over the zoning laws .
So we have the most bizarre outcome of all .
The government is suppressing religion on all fronts , the jails are filled with religious prisoners whose cases cry out for justice , and the case that comes before the Supreme Court to allow it to determine if the RFRA of 1993 is constitutional involves a church in Texas which wants to expand its building .
It is in an area zoned for historic preservation and the government does n't want it to get bigger or to change anything in the building facade .
Oral arguments have been heard and now we are awaiting the pronouncement of the fate of the RFRA of 1993 .
If it is upheld , there is still an enormous distance to go before there is actual religious freedom involving the use of psychoactives in the USA .
If you use ganja or LSD religiously you are more likely to be a martyr than a winner if you go to court .
Medical Marijuana :
This is now legal under California law .
Unfortunately we do n't just live under California law .
We also live under Federal Law .
This is called the " dual sovereigns " doctrine .
If one does n't get you , the other will .
So the first constitutional issue that comes up is basically one of states rights .
Can California legalize marijuana ?
Can Hawaii legalize gay marriages ?
On the other hand , could Arkansas segregate its school system ?
When the question is : who is in charge here ?
The answer is almost always : the Feds are in charge here .
There are practical problems for the Feds which have left them muttering threats at doctors rather than taking any direct action to enforce the prohibition of medical marijuana .
They have threatened to get any doctor who prescribes or possibly who even discusses medical marijuana with a patient .
That leads us to the second constitutional issue : can doctors and patients talk candidly about illness and treatment ?
Or can the Feds tell doctors what to say ?
A group of doctors and patients have sued the Feds on this issue .
It 's way too soon to know what the outcome will be but Federal District Judge Fern Smith issued a TRO telling the feds that they could not sanction Doctors for actions taken while the TRO was in effect .
The issue arises because under California law a doctor may " recommend or approve " a patient 's use of medical marijuana .
If he does , then the patient can use the medical marijuana .
So can the patient 's caregiver .
Whatever a caregiver is .
That 's the next legal issue , and its a California issue .
What is a caregiver ?
Is it only the devoted spouse or child who has spent 10 years treating an ailing relative ?
Or is it also the good people who operate the local Cannabis Buyers Club ?
The clubs have turned out to be the way that most medical marijuana is supplied in practice .
Are they patient networks ?
Are they caregivers ?
Or are they outlaws ?
Are they criminal conspiracies to violate the marijuana laws ?
And if the clubs are caregivers , what are the people who grow marijuana for the clubs ?
Are they caregivers too ?
The clubs think so .
They are issuing contracts which attempt to transfer caregiver rights to the contract cultivators .
Lord only knows if this will work .
Its sensible , but will the courts support it ?
Look at it from the Feds point of view .
Who would you rather prosecute : a dying patient using a few ounces of marijuana , the doctor approved to alleviate the effects of radiation who owns no assets to seize , or a perfectly healthy person with 49 plants that they intend to sell , growing on land they own , who can not name the person that they are " caregiver " to ?
The states ' rights issue , and the California constitutional issues are joined by the same issues that industrial hemp raises : can the Federal Government pass laws which are arbitrary and overbroad since they include medicinal marijuana in their prohibition of psychoactive pot ?
Pot :
Which brings us to pot -- plain old recreational use of the mildly psychoactive herb .
The constitutional issues here are far reaching but do n't stand much chance in court under the present legal climate .
For instance it is generally considered the state government 's sole right to legislate morality .
The Feds need some other reason to pass laws , and that reason has to be listed in the US Constitution .
What listed power lets them regulate home grown marijuana for personal use ?
Probably the power to regulate interstate commerce .
The fiction that everything that happens affects interstate commerce has permitted the astounding extension of Federal law into everyday life .
That fiction got a setback at long last when the Supreme Court threw out the Federal law against carrying guns near a school .
The justices thought it was a great idea that the schools not be war zones ; but most of them just could n't link gun-free schools to interstate commerce .
The government was shocked .
However its a long step from this decision to a real restoration of the powers Congress has usurped over many years to the States or to the People .
Such a journey will upset many an applecart , and is not likely to happen in a hurry .
Still as the philosopher said , the longest journey begins with a single step , and this case might have been that step .
With pot , as with hemp , ganja , and medical marijuana , the temptation is to make the argument that prohibition is arbitrary and overbroad .
The argument would be that pot use certainly does n't hurt any one so how can it be illegal .
However the argument for how serious the loss to the individual caused by the law is legally weakest when it comes to pot .
After all we are not talking about money , God , or relieving pain here .
We 're just talking about fun , and protecting your right to have fun is not a high priority in the American legal system .
Constitutional law is expensive law .
It costs a fortune and takes forever .
That gives us some stability as a society .
It also means that wrongs can go on for decades unabated .
I 'm sure that there are other constitutional issues that could be argued regarding marijuana .
I would be very happy just to see a couple of these litigated .
May it happen in my lifetime .
“ We recognized the incredible pain receiving this false encouragement caused , " she continued .
" It was not our intent . ”
“ I take full responsibility for the error , ” said Brown , who was in the office Monday until midnight preparing an apology and answering e-mails and phone calls from disappointed students and their parents .
“ We accessed the wrong database .
The University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill , Cornell University and Northwestern University ’s prestigious Kellogg School of Management have experienced similar goof - ups in recent years , but the UCSD incident Monday was by far the largest .
The applicants had been denied admission by the university earlier in the month .
Someone accidentally sent the e-mail to the entire applicant pool of 47,000 although it was intended for only the 18,000 students who got in , Brown said .
UC San Diego Admissions Director Mae Brown said this morning that an “ administrative error ” was responsible for a bogus e-mail that went out to 28,000 students congratulating them on their admission and welcoming them to the campus .
One parent , who asked to remain anonymous because he did n’t want to intensify his daughter ’s college admissions stress , called it a “ colossal screw - up ” and said the family had been thinking of attending “ Admit Day ” Saturday , as the e-mail encouraged them to do , before learning the invitation was fake .
“ It was kind of a shock , ” he said .
The mistake was all the more dire because this year is shaping up as one of the toughest in recent years at San Diego and other UC campuses .
In response to a UC - wide enrollment cap ordered because of the state ’s budget crisis , San Diego reduced its freshman enrollment target by 520 students , to 3,775 , Brown said .
The campus , like many throughout the United States , handles most of its application process online .
Brown said the e-mail mistake would be reviewed , but she doubted the university would back off from communications technology .
“ All our research tells us students are most comfortable with online communications , ” she said .
“ Ouch ! ” said Barmak Nassirian , associate executive director of the American Assn. of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers , when he heard about the failure .
“ I feel terrible for the applicants . ”
“ This is a source of constant worry at colleges , " he said .
" They use extremely sophisticated systems of communication from the front end of applications all the way to alumni relations for all kinds of high - stake business , and bad things can happen all the way . ”
Nassirian said , however , that the advantages of technology outweigh the risk , and he doubted colleges would go back to paper - based systems .
Brown said she and her staff would spend the day answering every phone complaint and e-mail from parents and students .

Rep. Peter Hoekstra writes in Pravda the WSJ op - ed pages :
Congress Knew About the Interrogations
It was not necessary to release details of the enhanced interrogation techniques , because members of Congress from both parties have been fully aware of them since the program began in 2002 .
We believed it was something that had to be done in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks to keep our nation safe .
After many long and contentious debates , Congress repeatedly approved and funded this program on a bipartisan basis in both Republican and Democratic Congresses .
At some point they are going to figure out that for most of us , we do n’t care if the person has a ( R ) or ( D ) behind their name when they were instituting a policy of torture .
That is what is so depressing ( to me , at least ) about the Ari Fleischer ’s and the Thiessen ’s of the world .
They honestly seem to think this is nothing more than a partisan witch - hunt , the same old Washington gotcha poltics .
It is n’t .
When you torture people , you have crossed a really clear line .
Innocent people are dead .
Lives have been ruined .
Our international reputation has been destroyed .
Yes , the Bush administration will get most of the blame , but that is because they were in charge and they did this , not because of what party they happen to belong to .
If Jane Harman and Nancy Pelosi knew about this and ok’d it , they are just as culpable .
The magic numbers spin before our eyes .
No one can grasp the scale of the handouts , or understand how public money that did n't exist - could never exist - for hospitals or schools or public toilets begins to flow as soon as bankers fall to their knees .
We are punch drunk , reeling , uniquely vulnerable - because none of it makes sense any more - to demands from every species of scrounger .
So prepare yourselves , ladies and gentlemen , for the worst scam of all .
It 's another reward for failure , but this one offers no prospect of rescuing the economy .
Thanks to its cunning disguise as an environmental measure , we seem willing to be conned .
I want to show you why we should resist it .
I 'm talking about the scrappage payments being proposed by almost everyone linked to the motor industry : the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders , most of the big car firms , the AA , and the unions .
Lord Mandelson is said to be a fan .
They argue that drivers should be paid around £ 2,000 a head to scrap their old cars and buy new ones .
As well as saving the jobs of hundreds of thousands of workers , this , they say , will catalyse a low - carbon transport revolution .
It 's bunkum .
Let 's start by getting a misconception out of the way .
The media are reporting the proposal as a subsidy for switching to smaller , more efficient cars .
But the manufacturers have called for no such thing .
The model they keep referring to is Germany's .
Here drivers are being offered € 2,500 to trade in cars at least nine years old for new models .
The only requirement is that the new cars meet the Euro 4 standard on exhaust emissions .
This is another way of saying all cars : since 2005 every new car on sale in the EU has to meet this standard , which has nothing to do with CO2 .
So £ 2,000 from the government could help you trade in your old Citroen C1 for a new Porsche Cayenne .
There is a simple way of working out whether a green subsidy is worthwhile : how much does it cost to save a tonne of carbon dioxide ?
No one appears to have done this yet so , if you 'll bear with me , I 'll attempt it here .
I 've had to make a few assumptions where data do n't exist , but it gives us a rough idea of what we are exposing ourselves to ( all the sources , as usual , are on my website ) .
Let 's imagine that the average age of the scrapped cars is 12 years .
In 1997 new cars in the UK produced an average of 189.8 grams of CO2 per km .
If they 've since become 10 % less efficient , their average output will be 208g / km today .
Cars manufactured this year will put out an average of around 160g / km , which means a saving of 48g / km .
This translates - with a mean annual driving distance of 16,500 km - into a cut of 792 kg / car / year .
Assuming that drivers are each paid £ 2,000 , that 's a cost of £ 2,525 for every tonne of CO2 avoided , divided by the average age of the cars on the road - 4.9 years .
You 'd get almost as much value for money by reclassifying £ 10 notes as biomass and burning them in power stations .
The management consultancy McKinsey has calculated the costs of saving CO2 by other means .
We could do it for £ 3.50 a tonne by investing in geothermal energy , or £ 9 if we put our money into nuclear power plants .
Mini hydroelectric schemes would save money as well as carbon against normal electricity prices .
So would energy efficiency : switching from incandescent lightbulbs to light - emitting diodes , for example , saves £ 80 for every tonne of CO2 you cut .
I would have liked to give you some transport comparisons , but McKinsey does n't publish figures for public transport or for promoting walking or cycling ( a McKinsey consultant would n't be seen dead on a bus ) .
Nor , as far as I can discover , does the government .
The carbon payback for other projects - creating better cycle lanes in towns and coach lanes on motorways , helping children to walk to school , better enforcement of speed limits , better timetabling for buses - is likely to be hundreds or thousands of times higher than any returns from the scrappage scam .
In fact I have grossly overstated the scheme 's value for money .
My rough figures take no account of the rebound effect : when driving costs you less ( after buying a more efficient car ) , you are likely to travel further .
Nor have I considered the fact that many people would have bought new cars anyway , which means they 'll be given the money for nothing .
Without this subsidy , others might have stopped driving altogether and started cycling or using public transport instead : in this case the scrappage scheme will have raised their emissions .
Nor did I calculate the carbon costs of manufacturing the new cars .
A paper published in 2000 by the journal Transportation Research comes to even grimmer conclusions : that replacing old cars with new ones increases carbon pollution .
Because between 15 % and 20 % of a car 's emissions are produced during its manufacture , the optimal age for a car , the paper says , is 19 years .
( The average age of the UK's fleet is 4.9 years ) .
If the paper 's assumptions hold ( they may be out of date now ) , it would make more sense for the government to pay us to keep our old bangers on the road .
Low - carbon transport ?
Pull the other one .
Scrappage schemes are nothing but handouts for car firms , resprayed green to fool the incautious buyer .
The motor trade wants the money because it 's collapsing .
Some companies - notably Vauxhall and the rest of the General Motors group - are in imminent danger of insolvency .
So the question changes : should we support them regardless of their impact on the environment ?
No .
State aid rules forbid scrappage schemes from discriminating between cars made here and cars made abroad .
So , given that British car plants assemble only around 15 % of the vehicles sold in this country , and given that the motor industry is highly automated and has vast capital costs , this subsidy is likely to be just as bad at saving jobs as it is at saving carbon .
Every pound we spend on driving is a pound withheld from the alternatives , many of which ( such as buses and trains ) employ far more people for the same amount of money .
This leaves only the value of preserving the industry for its own sake .
It is hard to think of a less deserving cause .
The motor companies have repeatedly failed to anticipate trends in demand .
They have carried on producing thunderous gas guzzlers long after the market collapsed .
Every so often the bosses wring their hands about jobs , put out the begging bowl , get the money , then shaft their workers anyway .
Like the bankers , they have wrecked their own industry .
And like the bankers , they want the rest of us to pay .

The US Naval Air Warfare Center funded a patent application , published two weeks ago , with the innocuous title of “ Military Training Device ” .
The device turns out to be a suicide vest simulator for the Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System ( MILES ) training system .
The proposed MILES equipped “ explosive ' ” clothing .
The original MILES system was developed in the 1980 ’s to provide a realistic force - on - force training system for the US Army .
The system utilized an array of sensors on soldiers clothing , equipment and vehicles .
When a blank cartridge is fired from a MILES equipped rifle , the laser is activated and transmits information about the shooter , his weapon and ammunition .
If a laser hits a sensor , the software calculates if the shot was a kill based on the range and what ammunition was being used .
MILES is in use by many armed forces including the Australian , British , Czech , Irish , Israeli , Turkish and Canadian armies .
M4 with MILES gear attached .
Camp Shelby Joint Force Training Center .
From Wikipedia .
The patent application , number 20090053679 , describes a system where clothing is covered in light generating devices , such as LEDs , that when activated broadcast the appropriate MILES codes for a kill over a wide area .
Sensors in the “ blast ” zone would then calculate the distance from the “ explosion ” and see if it resulted in a kill .
Previous simulation systems for suicide bombers have just generated smoke and sound effects .
The Kill Logic
The system also allows for defensive action against suicide bombers .
Sensors would also be placed on the bomber and certain hits would be able to disable the bomb – something the Israelis have demonstrated is possible in real life .
Bomber armed with M16 ?!?!
The patent goes out of its way to be politically correct .
The words “ suicide bomber ” are only used once .
From the patent , emphasis mine :
[ 0040 ]
In act 112 , electrical circuit 18 disables offensive capabilities of military training device 10 .
In the particular embodiment described above in which multiple integrated laser engagement system 14 includes light generating devices 16a as well as light detectors 16 b , light generating devices 16a may be inhibited from further operation until the current military training maneuver is completed .
In this manner , a particular trainee simulating a suicide bomber may be disabled from inflicting damage to other trainees .
This is a very interesting system and I look forward to seeing it develop .
Providing training with this level of realism can only help the troops stationed in parts of the world where suicide attacks are likely to happen .
Many thanks to Daniel Watters for the information .

Rocket Fuel Chemical Found in Baby Formula EPA deems perchlorate levels safe , but advocacy group says public is at risk .
April 3 , 2009  --
When a parent puts a bottle of baby formula to a child 's lips , the parent might not know exactly what ingredients are in that thick , nutritionally packed mix .
But rocket fuel ?
That 's not an ingredient many expect to find .
A study by government researchers released Thursday tested 15 different brands of formula and found a chemical -- also found in rocket fuel -- contaminating every single one .
While the levels of the chemical , perchlorate , have been deemed safe by the Environmental Protection Agency , some worry public health is at risk .
Scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tested the formula for the presence of perchlorate , a chemical used as the main ingredient in solid rocket fuel .
It 's a worry because perchlorate can interfere with the production of thyroid hormones by inhibiting the absorption of iodine .
The CDC study found cow 's milk - based formula contained more perchlorate than that made with soy or other ingredients .
The two brands with the highest levels -- more than double that of the other milk - based products -- command 87 percent of the market share for infant formula .
The report does not specify the brand names of any formula tested .
Perchlorate has been found in the water supplies of 35 states and has been detected in everything from vegetables to milk .
In the case of dairy , the rocket fuel in the water flows into grass , which is eaten by cows , and is then passed along into milk .
The perchlorate was found in levels within a range that 's been deemed safe by the Environmental Protection Agency .
CDC researchers write that " this is reasssuring at first glance , " but add that it could be problematic because drinking water in 26 states has high perchlorate levels .
So , mixing contaminated powdered milk with contaminated water in those places could result in a dangerous exposure .
" The widespread penetrance of these products , and the potential for utilization of water for reconstitution that has even minimal concentrations of perchlorate , " the researchers write , " suggest that a significant number of infants consuming bovine milk - based [ powdered infant formula ] with lactose , will have perchlorate doses in excess of the [ recommended limit ] . "
Advocacy Groups Says Risk Is Understated
The Environmental Working Group , an organization that advocates for stricter limits on a variety of chemicals , contends EPA 's recommended limit is set " too high to protect public health " and understates the risk .
" Perchlorate contamination of drinking water is a very serious concern , particularly for infants , " said Dr. Anila Jacob , an Environmental Working Group scientist .
Dr. Sheela Sathyanarayana , a pediatrician who works on environmental health issues at Seattle Children 's Hospital and at the University of Washington department of pediatrics , said it 's difficult to say whether this sort of exposure is dangerous .
" Considered in isolation , these perchlorate concentrations in formula are not concerning for child health , " Sathyanarayana wrote in an e-mail to ABC News .
" The reason that some may be concerned about health effects to children is that there are several sources of perchlorate in our environment ... and , therefore , the cumulative dose of perchlorate to an infant may be much higher than that found in the formula . "
" That being said , " she added , " the most well - respected studies ( only a handful exist ) on perchlorate contamination have not found any link between perchlorate contamination in water and health impacts in children .
Therefore , we truly do not know if this kind of contamination may be leading to health problems or not . "
Another professor of pediatrics , Keith - Thomas Ayoob of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine , considers the findings " disturbing " and " a wake - up call to municipalities to clean up their water supplies , if at all possible . "
At her confirmation hearing in January , EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson agreed to take another look at the safety of perchlorate .
The study appeared in the March 2009 issue of the Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology .
The CDC study is based on a handful of samples bought in one city and includes the caveat : " The results of this study may not be relevant throughout the United States . "
Still , Ayoob told ABC News , " This is a perfect example of how polluting one area of the environment can be magnified . "
" It 's not causing harm to the animals or most consumers , but you can see how the effect can be magnified , " Ayoob said .
" If we get rid of the perchlorate , then the infants , their parents , all consumers , and even the cows and the farmers will be better off and happier . "

I did n’t think the Democrats were stupid enough to start talking about reimposing the Fairness Doctrine .
But I was wrong .
For those not up - to - date with the Fairness Doctrine controversy , it goes back to the late 1960s when the FCC began to push radio and television stations to air material about controversial matters including some consideration for both sides of the issue .
The justification for this government interference was that with a very limited amount of media channels available , and with the airwaves owned by the public and merely licensed to the media companies profiting from them , this was a reasonable request and a necessary one in order to encourage an informed citizenry .
By the late 1960s , the powerful corporate forces in the right - wing movement had begun to bankroll a conservative movement at this point – giving enormous amounts of money to create advocacy groups , think tanks , magazines , and other means of pushing conservative messages .
One of their goals was to eliminate the Fairness Doctrine – and in 1987 they succeeded .
At right about this time with no more obligation to be fair or present both sides of controversial issues , right - wing talk radio took off .
Simon Rosenberg publicized this sequence of events – and Steve Rendall at Commons Dreams gives an overview of the liberal take on this history which is worth a read .
Since then , conservative talk radio has mobilized the conservative movement – and perpetuated quite a few lies and distrortions .
In this context , you can see why some Democrats want to bring back the Fairness Doctrine .
After all , if Steve Marlsburg , nemises of this blog , can use the public airwaves to talk for two hours about how Barack Obama is evil and no good people can support him and go on and on supporting this with one lie after another distortion , would n’t everyone benefit from a bit of the other side getting a word in edgewise ?
And if a handful of media titans control almost all of the media , the concentration of power in their hands ensures that opinions they agree with are aired – and oftentimes , that opinions they disagree strongly with are not aired .
In this context , Bill Clinton mused about reimposing the Fairness Doctrine on a liberal radio show ; Democratic Senator Stanbow wants hearings on something like a Fairness Standard ; Senator Tom Harken was quoted on another liberal talk radio show saying , “ We gotta get the Fairness Doctrine back in law again ; ” and a number of other Senators and Congressman have similarly suggested something be done to restore “ fairness ” to the radio .
Barack Obama though made it clear during his campaign that he did not support this – and reiterated his opposition again after he took office .
And with good reason : reimposing the Fairness Doctrine might sound like a decent idea given the above history .
But there are some major reasons not to :

Cops : Man squatted in vacant Sugar Grove mansion 8 months
The Sugar Grove Township house where a homeless man was squatting for eight months until his arrest this week .
Sugar Grove police say a man who took up residence in a vacant , lakeside mansion for eight months apparently had no trouble settling in .
When officers went to arrest him Wednesday , they found the $ 700,000 house stocked with living room furniture and two big- screen TVs .
" Pretty gutsy , " said Sugar Grove Detective John Sizer , who has been on the case for the better part of a year .
" He definitely moved up . "
Steven Hathorne , 41 , formerly of Aurora , is charged with the theft of $ 1,400 in water from the village of Sugar Grove and criminal damage to government property , both felonies .
His bond was set at $ 250,000 .
Sizer said officials have suspected Hathorne was living in the house on the 100 block of North Buckingham Drive in the Prestbury subdivision since last summer , after the home was foreclosed upon , but it took months to get permission from the mortgage company to enter the property .
He said Hathorne told neighbors he was in the process of buying the house .
" It was obvious somebody was living in there .
But we can't just charge into someone 's house without the owner 's consent , " Sizer said .
In earlier attempts to vacate the house , Sugar Grove public works officials shut off the water meter and put a lock on it - twice .
Each time , Hathorne cut off the lock and turned the water back on using a 10 - foot tool police found in the home 's three - car garage Wednesday , Sizer said .
Officers also found a cloak that had been used to cover the water meter , apparently so village officials could not use a mobile electronic device to take a reading without entering the property .
Eventually , detectives were able get cooperation from the mortgage company , and Kane County Sheriff 's deputies served Hathorne with a notice to vacate Wednesday morning .
He was arrested at the scene .
Sizer said the house is in unincorporated Sugar Grove Township but receives its water from the village .
The gas and power also were turned on .
" There may be more of this going on , " Sizer said .
" We 've got anywhere from 60 to 80 vacant houses in towns that we patrol .
It 's surprising the number of times we 're finding these homes unsecured .
It 's a concern of ours . "
So far , Sizer said , Hathorne has been uncooperative with police .
The theft charge is a Class 2 felony with a standard sentencing range of three to seven years in prison or probation .
Hathorne was being held in the county jail Thursday pending an April 30 court appearance in front of Judge Jordan T. Gallagher .

The topic of the day is whether there ’s some imbalance or unfairness between the government ’s treatment of the automakers and the finance sector .
And one frequent response from readers has been that at the end of the day the bankers have a viable business model and the automakers do not .
And that dictates different treatment .
Now , I ca n’t imagine any way to ask for more trouble than to get into comparisons between the troubles of the automakers and the banks , with all the differences between them .
As we know , US automakers have been in relative decline for three or four decades ( judged in terms of market share vs. imports ) and absolute decline for a while .
But I ’m curious about how much we know about the business model and viability of the banks .
Surely , banks as such are n’t going anywhere .
But these institutions ?
One reader writes : “ One easy answer to this question is that the banks have a viable
business model .
They simply need to stop taking so much risk , and they ’ll be immensely profitable given the current interests rates they ’re borrowing at . ”
But high levels of risk are at the root of the big banks ’ high profits ( at least until recently ) and also of the current mess .
So it ’s not immediately clear to me how you just fiddle with the risk variable and that does n’t leave the whole system fundamentally changed , with very different profit levels .
It ’s not precisely the same .
But you could also say that all the automakers have to do is start selling more cars .
Not so easily done .
You ca n’t risk your cake and eat it too .
Just to anticipate a lot of email responses .
I ’m certainly not saying that the current crisis means that banking is no longer a viable business .
But these kinds of banks — at this rough size , at these levels of leverage and risk , and at these levels of sustained profitability — is that still a viable model ?
Is a healthy one for the country ?
Which brings me to a different but somewhat related point .
When do we downsize these banks ?
A key part of the crisis , perhaps the key part of the crisis is that these banks were so big that we could not let them endure the normal fate of failed businesses , which is to fail .
So when do we break them up into more smaller entities ?
Yes , we ’ve got our hands full now .
But companies always fight being broken up .
So it ’ll be much harder if and when these companies struggle back to some level of health .
So when does that happen ?
The economy is still sinking , but some economists see a rate of decline that is less precipitous than before .
If that ’s the case , it could mean the longest recession in US history is beginning to bottom out .
A slower rate of decline is essential because production of goods and services has been in a steep dive since last fall .
Although any lessening of the economic fall probably wo n’t affect the unemployment rate immediately , it could boost sagging consumer and business confidence and help the stock market , which is often a harbinger of economic improvement .
“ We ’re still declining , but we can see the valley down below , ” says Sung Won Sohn , an economist at California State University , Channel Islands .
Some signs of a better economy include :
• The rate of decline of industrial production has been moderating since December .
This is in large part because companies have finally reduced inventories to manageable levels .
• Prices are rising for some key commodities such as copper , which is used by the housing industry .
• Since last fall , the cost of shipping by oceangoing freighters has tripled – up from very low levels .
That ’s a sign of better global economic activity .
• Some surveys are finding that the consumer mood is brightening .
This has translated into higher spending over the past three days .
• Construction of new housing rose 22.2 percent from January , the Commerce Department reported Tuesday .
Such activity is still down 47.3 percent below a year earlier , but at least the trend line is in a positive direction , if it holds .

The Fed to meet
The developments preceded a Federal Reserve Board meeting this week , in which the economy and interest - rate policy will be discussed .
The Fed has already lowered short - term rates to almost zero , so it is not expected to make any changes to interest - rate policy .
Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has said in recent weeks that the Fed will continue to use nonconventional ways to stimulate the economy .
“ Obviously , there will be no change in interest rates , but we will be looking for any changes in wording on the economic outlook , ” says Scott Brown , chief economist at Raymond James & Associates , a brokerage house , in St. Petersburg , Fla .
“ Will they say anything about whether they expect the economy to recover this year , as Mr. Bernanke said on ‘ 60 Minutes ’ on Sunday , or in 2010 ? ”
A sense that the worst of the downturn could be over is one reason the Dow Jones Industrial Average has shown some gains over the past week .
The markets have also benefited from some improvement in the stock prices of banks .
Last week , Citigroup and Bank of America executives said their firms have been profitable for the first two months of the year .
Banks are key
Profitable banks and a stable financial system are essential for the recovery to begin , Bernanke said Sunday on “ 60 Minutes . ”
“ We ’ve seen some progress in the financial markets , absolutely , ” he said .
“ But until we get that stabilized and working normally , we ’re not going to see recovery . ”
If the financial system is stabilized , he added , “ we ’ll see the recession coming to an end probably this year . ”
A key early indicator is industrial production , says Nariman Behravesh , chief economist at IHS / Global Insight in Lexington , Mass .
In December , this monthly indicator dropped 2.4 percent , but the declines have been less severe since then : 1.9 percent in January and 1.4 percent in February .
“ What ’s been happening is that companies had fairly high inventories , then they slashed prices , and now inventories are at more manageable levels , ” says Mr. Behravesh .
Now that inventories are lower , expectations are building for some improvement in the economy as companies start to rebuild depleted stockpiles .
“ We could get a pretty good rebound in industrial production , ” Behravesh predicts .
Some key commodities , used in producing goods , are also starting to revive .
Copper prices are up about 25 percent this year , bolstered in large part by buying from China , according to Bloomberg News .
The news service says China has also taken advantage of low prices to stock up on aluminum , zinc , corn , and cotton .
“ The recent stock market rally has sent speculators , betting the worst is over , back into copper , oil , and other commodities , ” says Phil Flynn , director of research at Alaron Trading in Chicago .
“ There is an expectation of seeing demand come back a little bit . ”
Consumers conflicted
Some surveys indicate that consumers see this is a good time to buy a car or a house .
But “ then they add , ‘ This is a good time , but I ’m so uncertain about my job and my income prospects , I have to put that on hold , ’ ” says Richard Curtin , director of the Reuters / University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers in Ann Arbor , Mich .
“ Consumers are rethinking how long they should keep their cars , and that holding period is lengthening . ”
Consumers ’ mood , however , may be brightening somewhat .
Over the past week , the Gallup ’s Consumer Mood Index rose from - 120 to - 90 .
“ That ’s an enormous change , ” says Dennis Jacobe , Washington - based chief economist for the organization .
“ We ’re now at the best level since last September . ”
Improvement in the consumer mood is translating into higher spending , according to Gallup , which tracks spending ( except for housing and autos ) on a daily basis .
“ Over the last three days , we ’ve seen an increase in the spending index , ” says Mr. Jacobe .
“ It takes a few days for the improvement in the mood index to have an impact on spending . ”
The government was accused last night of hiding behind claims of a threat to national security to suppress evidence of torture by the CIA on a prisoner still held in Guantánamo Bay .
An unprecedented high court ruling yesterday blamed the US , with British connivance , for keeping the " powerful evidence " secret , sparking criticism from lawyers , campaigners and MPs , who claimed the government had capitulated to American bullying .
Two senior judges said they were powerless to reveal the information about the torture of Binyam Mohamed , an Ethiopian - born British resident , because David Miliband , the foreign secretary , had warned the court the US was threatening to stop sharing intelligence about terrorism with the UK .
In a scathing judgment , Lord Justice Thomas and Mr Justice Lloyd Jones said the evidence , and what MI5 knew about it , must remain secret because according to Miliband , the American threats meant " the public of the United Kingdom would be put at risk " .
The judges made clear they were unhappy with their decision , but said they had no alternative as a result of Miliband 's claim .
Their ruling revealed that Miliband stuck to his position about the threat to the UK even after Barack Obama signed orders two weeks ago banning torture and announcing the closure of the Guantánamo Bay prison camp .
Last night Miliband seemingly backtracked on his office 's submission , saying there had been no threat by the US to break off intelligence co-operation .
" It 's American information and it is for the Americans to decide whether to publish their information , " Miliband told Channel 4 television .
Clive Stafford Smith , director of Reprieve , the legal charity and human rights group which acted for Mohamed , said last night : " The US is under a legal duty to investigate the crime of torture , not to suppress evidence that it happened ...
For the foreign secretary to give in to these illegal demands by the Bush administration is capitulation to blackmail , pure and simple . "
Yesterday 's ruling was the latest in unprecedented court hearings into the abduction of Mohamed , who was seized and held incommunicado in Pakistan in 2002 before being secretly renditioned to Morocco , where he says he was tortured .
He was subsequently flown to Afghanistan before being sent to Guantánamo Bay .
He has been on hunger strike and the US and UK are discussing his possible return to the UK .
The ruling , studded with thinly disguised attacks on the attitude of the foreign secretary and the American authorities , came after the judges last year invited the Guardian and other media groups to overturn Miliband 's refusal to disclose information in the documents given to him by the US .
In a telling passage , the judges said : " Given [ the documents ' ] source and detail , they would ... amount to powerful evidence " .
None of the contents at issue could possibly be described as sensitive US intelligence , they said .
In further stinging comments they said : " Moreover , in the light of the long history of the common law and democracy which we share with the United States , it was , in our view , very difficult to conceive that a democratically elected and accountable government could possibly have any rational objection to placing into the public domain such a summary of what its own officials reported as to how a detainee was treated by them and which made no disclosure of sensitive intelligence matters .
" Indeed we did not consider that a democracy governed by the rule of law would expect a court in another democracy to suppress a summary of the evidence contained in reports by its own officials ... relevant to allegations of torture and cruel , inhumane , or degrading treatment , politically embarrassing though it might be . "
The judges said yesterday : " It is plainly right that the details of the admissions in relation to the treatment of [ Mohamed ] as reported by officials of the United States government should be brought into the public domain . "
They urged the Obama administration to reconsider the US position and also said that parliament 's intelligence and security select committee must investigate the case in line with extended powers the committee had been granted by Gordon Brown .
But the judges noted that the committee meets in private and the prime minister can censor its reports .
The judges also emphasised that , as the Guardian reported last year , Jacqui Smith , the home secretary , had asked the attorney general to investigate possible " criminal wrongdoing " by MI5 and the CIA over Mohamed 's treatment .
A spokesman for Lady Scotland , the attorney general , said last night the matter was " still under consideration " .
In earlier rulings judges described the American attitude in the case as " deeply disturbing " .
Miliband is expected to stand by what he told the high court , in a Commons written statement today .
He is also expected to repeat the government 's condemnation of torture .
A spokesman for the US state department said : " The US thanks the UK government for its continued commitment to protect sensitive national security information and preserve the long standing intelligence - sharing relationship that enables both countries to protect their citizens .
The US investigates allegations and claims of torture ... such as those raised by Binyam Mohamed . "
Shami Chakrabarti , director of Liberty , said last night : " Despite best efforts to shine a light on the grubbiest aspects of the ' war on terror ' , the Foreign Office has claimed that the Obama administration maintained a previous US threat to reconsider intelligence sharing unless our judges kept this shameful skeleton in the closet .
We find this Foreign Office allegation ... surprising . "
David Davis , the former shadow home secretary , said it implied that torture had taken place and British agencies may have been complicit .
( CNN ) --
By most accounts , the showdown was pretty brutal .
Many declared Jon Stewart , right , the victor in his face - to - face with Jim Cramer on " The Daily Show . "
Many watching Thursday night 's " Daily Show " on Comedy Central felt that comedian - turned - media - critic Jon Stewart held bombastic financial guru and CNBC " Mad Money " host Jim Cramer 's feet to the fire .
And Cramer flinched .
Stewart , known for his zany , satirical take on the news , was serious as he took Cramer 's network to task for what Stewart viewed as their " cheerleading " of corporations at the heart of the nation 's current economic crisis .
And despite the title of his financial show , Cramer came off as less mad and more apologetic .
Watch Stewart vs. Cramer »
" If it was a prize fight , they would have stopped it , " said Howard Kurtz , the " Washington Post " media critic and host of CNN's " Reliable Sources . "
" I was stunned that Jim Cramer kind of did a rope - a - dope strategy and did n't really defend himself against Jon Stewart 's assault . "
Kurtz is very familiar with the style of both men .
He has appeared on " The Daily Show " and is the author of " The Fortune Tellers : Inside Wall Street 's Game of Money , Media and Manipulation , " in which Cramer is featured .
Kurtz said Stewart " made clear at the outset that he was n't going for laughs " and displayed very much the same passion for holding the media accountable as he did when he appeared on , and denounced , CNN's " Crossfire . "
Watch the debate on " Reliable Sources "
" When I went on [ Stewart 's ] show last year , he was so wound up in ripping the media that he went on for another 10 minutes , knowing full well that we were out of time , " Kurtz said .
" Stewart , as funny as he can be , is a very trenchant media critic who cares passionately about this stuff , and we saw that Thursday night . "
i Reporter David Seaman of New York said he was surprised at the vigor with which Stewart " attacked Cramer 's credibility . "
Check out David 's iReport
The public wants answers as to how the country got into such financial distress , and viewers really want someone to answer for the mess , Seaman said .
" People want to see a lot of the financial gurus on a shish kabob , being skewered , " Seaman said .
" It 's really important to hold people accountable , and as we saw last night , Jon Stewart is a bit of a wild card , so if you are n't living up to expectations , he may call you out . "
David Brancaccio , host and senior editor of " Now on PBS , " commended Cramer for his bravery in going on the show , though he said he was surprised that the brilliant founder of TheStreet.com seemed ill - prepared for Stewart 's very thoughtful questioning .
Brancaccio , the former host of American Public Media 's " Marketplace " radio program , echoed the comments of many in that he found the exchange visibly uncomfortable for the usually showman - like Cramer .
" You have the comedian as journalist , and you have the financial journalist as clown , in that on his show , Cramer 's goofing around and plays the clown , " Brancaccio said .
" What a role reversal . "
Brancaccio said Stewart 's show has emerged as an important vehicle for media criticism .
Thursday night 's show marked an important moment in journalism , especially financial reporting , Brancaccio said .
" It 's really important that tough questions are asked , because when tough questions are n't asked , we end up with Enron , " he said .
" It 's interesting that the tough questions came from Jon Stewart , brilliant comedian that he is . "
Brancaccio thinks the episode may serve as a cautionary tale for those in the media who do n't do their due diligence .
White House approves of smackdown
" I do n't think any financial journalist wants to be in Cramer 's position , " Brancaccio said .
" I think [ journalists ] may redouble their efforts to be dispassionate reporters asking the tough questions . "
Steve Krakauer is associate editor of TVNewser.com , one of the leading blogs about the television news industry , and said comments at his site have been mixed about the show .
Although some thought it was one of the best interviews they had ever seen , others found Stewart arrogant and said his outrage might have been a bit staged .
Krakauer said the question now is where Cramer -- who has said he plans to make some changes to his show -- goes from here .
Krakauer said he doubts that there will be a complete overhaul of " Mad Money . "
" I can't see things drastically changing , " Krakauer said .
" ' Mad Money ' is one of the most successful shows on CNBC .
Despite what has been written about Jim Cramer , the things he 's gotten incorrect and the calls he has made , he 's still popular and one of the most entertaining for people who are interested in that type of financial news . "
If anything , Cramer 's appearance on " The Daily Show " may have just stoked the flames .
Comedy Central 's
Web site played it up with clips from the show that it called " an historic moment in basic cable . "
The topic is such a hot one that Kurtz will lead " Reliable Sources " with it Sunday , with journalist Tucker Carlson , radio show host Stephanie Miller and " Baltimore Sun " television critic David Zurawik as guests .
" Beyond the entertainment value , and we are not above that , this is a really important moment for holding financial journalists accountable , " Kurtz said .
" It may have taken Jon Stewart to blow the whistle on some of the hype and shortsightedness at America 's top business news channel , but those failings were repeated throughout the business press , which stumbled badly in reporting on what turned into a huge financial meltdown . "

Hi , all .
Quaid here with a look at the newest DC animated feature film , The Green Lantern .
First Flight .
In case you had n’t noticed , I ’m not very much of a comic book guy .
I ’ll read the occasional graphic novel and have picked up a comic once or twice , but most of my superhero knowledge comes from animated series and movies .
Please do n’t stone me .
So my first exposure to the Green Lantern was in DC ’s excellent Justice League : The New Frontier .
Of all the new characters I discovered with that movie , Green Lantern was by far the most interesting .
I love the idea of the epic and powerful superhero , and his powers seemed very familiar but , because they stem from the ring , more defined and interesting than some other heroes .
I love what DC is doing with these movies .
I ’ll be seeing this one as soon as I can .

The plan to return astronauts to the Moon by 2020 will continue , despite calls for the agency to go to asteroids or Mars ( Illustration : NASA )
NASA will stay on track to return humans to the Moon by 2020 , according to an overview of President Obama ’s 2010 budget request released on Thursday .
Recently , various groups – including Apollo astronaut Buzz Aldrin and the space advocacy group the Planetary Society – have called for NASA to send astronauts to new destinations , such as asteroids .
But the budget request backs a plan developed under the Bush administration to retire the space shuttle by 2010 and develop a system to return humans to the Moon by 2020 .
However , the document does not specify whether the Moon return will be accomplished by NASA ’s Constellation programme , which aims to build a crew capsule called Orion and rockets called Ares to replace the shuttle .

Obama ’s transition team was reported to have raised questions about the programme ’s Ares rockets , which have been plagued by design concerns that include excess vibrations .
Some argue that existing rockets , such as the Atlas V or Delta IV currently used to loft spacecraft , would be better alternatives , while others back a new design .
‘ Proceed as you were ’
NASA ’s former chief , Mike Griffin , was a staunch supporter of the Constellation programme , but he resigned in January and his successor has not yet been named .
“ The budget does n’t say a whole lot about any specific system , ” says John Logsdon , a space policy analyst at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington , DC .
“ I would n’t interpret the absence of the words ‘ Constellation ’ , ‘ Ares ’ , and ‘ Orion ’ one way or another .
That ’s really up to the the new management team , when it gets there . ”
Indeed , NASA is planning to stay the course – at least for now .
“ The direction we have at the current time is , ‘ Proceed as you were , ' ” says agency spokesperson Stephanie Schierholz .
Under the proposed budget , the agency would receive $ 18.7 billion in 2010 .
Combined with $ 1 billion in funding provided in an economic stimulus package signed into law last week , NASA would get $ 2.4 billion more than it did in 2008 .
Climate change
“ It ’s a nice number , ” Logsdon told New Scientist .
“ Between the proposed increase and the stimulus package , NASA ’s $ 2.4 billion [ would leave it ] better off than it was last year . ”
The budget would also likely be a boost over 2009 funding levels .
The agency ’s 2009 budget has not yet been settled .
NASA has been operating at 2008 funding levels under a continuing resolution since October 2008 .
But on Wednesday , the US House of Representatives passed an omnibus bill to fund NASA for 2009 .
It calls for a $ 360 million increase in the agency ’s human exploration budget , which includes $ 2.9 billion for the Constellation programme .
NASA ’s science budget would decline $ 200 million from 2008 levels .
The US Senate is now considering the bill .
Climate change research and monitoring tops the list of funding highlights in the overview of NASA ’s budget request , but the budget for specific agency programmes is not included .
A detailed budget request is not expected before April .

I remember when I first brought you home from Aaron 's house , back in Cleveland .
I wonder how many of that first batch of parts I put into you were hot ?
I 'm pretty sure the video card was .
Whatever , I got a good price .
You were beautiful .
You were n't so strong then , but when we realized that your insides had slowed down , and I updated you to a dual Pentium II motherboard you were the cat 's meow and you have n't slowed down a bit since .
After that you became my desktop ( desk - under ) machine .
Yeah , that was when we first moved to VA back in 2000 !
I remember that around then I upgraded you to some crazy amount of RAM , I think doing that was the first time I 'd ever seen 256 M on a single stick .
It was when work gave me a laptop that you really came into your own .
Pacific .*********. net was what the world knew for its SMTPd and FTPd , but I knew a softer side .
I knew a Pacific.int that was an NFSd , and an SSHd .
You were my $ HOME .
We even had a Telechat - ng port we kept open for a little while .
I might be rollin ' off to the night - shift with that hot Dell Latitude , but I always kept a screen ( 1 ) session running with you .
I remember how happy you were when you first fell in NTP synch with Panama.int in early 2001 .
You had two disks and a quiet fan then .
As you matured , you became an important member of your network .
You were reliable ( thanks to the UPS hanging off your Si0 ) so you were elected to serve as syslogd .
After you realized how useful you could be to your community , you were hungry for more , so I fed you six giant 9 GB disks and that SCSI - II RAID card I got from Ted .
The most expensive part of the whole project were the SCSI - I : SCSI - II adapters and the damn cables .
But wow , you looked good .
You were a server to be proud of .
You had processing power , storage space , and enough RAM to be a desktop ( well ... not as much by that point ) .
You would run PERL scripts and cron( 8 ) stuff for me all day .
That 's how we snagged that one domain for LB 's friend , remember ?
Good times !
But things were never the same between us after the move .
We had lived apart in the same house for so long when you had that basement bedroom all by yourself , that we did n't really know each other any more .
While you were in storage you got cold .
And when you finally came back to live with me , I had n't realized how loud you 'd become as your fans aged .
And six SCSI disks , well .
When we last were sleeping together you only had two , I 'll say it like that .
When we moved into this little townhouse , we just could n't share space like the old days and you moved on .
Emotionally , I mean .
I see now that you do n't really belong in this network anymore .
I mean , for one thing , you 've got a cord .
The world is a wireless place and you 're just not equipped for that .
You could change , but you do n't want to .
You do n't really belong to me anymore .
So go , be free .
Be free to someone who loves old hardware , or who needs a 36 GB RAID array .
Be with them .
Start a new relationship .
I hope you find a perfect match .
I 'll be genuinely happy for you .
With you .
I mean , we 'll still be friends , right ?
But , Pacific , for the love of space itself , DON'T JUST SIT THERE MOPING SILENTLY AT THE TOP OF MY STAIRS FOR ANOTHER WEEK !
Move on !
Let ME move on !
I will never forget the times we had .
I will always cherish those memories .
In my heart I will hold the time we spent together very dear .
I do not feel affection for you today , but I will always love you .
always .
Goodbye , my friend .
May your current be constant and your carrier be clear .

As President Barack Obama announces plans to withdraw US troops from Iraq , thousands of young Ugandans are increasingly desperate to be sent to the war - torn country .
Already , the Ugandan government says there are more than 10,000 men and women from this poverty - stricken East African nation working as private security guards in Iraq .
Hired out to multibillion - dollar companies for hundreds of dollars a month , they risk their lives seeking fortunes protecting US Army bases , airports , and oil firms .
The war in Iraq is the most privatized conflict in history .
Since the invasion in 2003 , the US Department of Defense has doled out contracts worth an estimated $ 100 billion to private firms .
Covering a vast range of services from catering to dry cleaning to security , one in every five dollars the US spends in Iraq ends up in the pockets of the contractors , according to a report by the Congressional Budget Office .
Increasingly these jobs have been outsourced to developing countries .
It is clear why the US contractors came to Uganda .
As an impoverished former British colony , the country is awash with unemployed and English - speaking potential recruits .
Its pliant government was an early member of President Bush 's " coalition of the willing , " and with a lingering 20 - year insurgency , it also has a glut of experienced army veterans , who made up the initial contingent of Ugandans in Iraq .
More important , hiring Ugandans is cheap .
Since the first Ugandans were sent to Iraq in late 2005 , competition from other developing countries in Africa and the Indian subcontinent has seen the government cut the minimum wage from $ 1,300 to $ 600 a month .
That compares with the $ 15,000 that one industry insider estimated an American guard could make each month .
Nevertheless , competition is fierce , and for those Ugandans who land a job , Iraq can prove a bonanza .
Paul Mugabe is back in Uganda for a month .
For the past year , the sinewy , nervous young man has been guarding the American Camp Diamondback at the airport in the northern Iraqi town of Mosul , and soon he will be heading to Baghdad .
" It 's not like Uganda .
You sweat and sweat and sweat , " says Mr. Mugabe , a former soldier in the Ugandan Army .
" It is the most dangerous place in the world .
It 's even worse than Congo . "
With the money he 's earned during those 12 months , back in his village Mugabe has built himself two houses , bought a bar , and increased the herd of cows his father left him to 30 .
" You should see the size of my banana plantation , " he smiles .
When he returns from another year in Iraq , he should have saved enough money to cover a wedding and the traditional bride price needed to find a pretty wife , he says .
But despite his nascent business empire and hopes of love , the fact that he is putting his life on the line to help US companies make massive profits is not lost on him .
" If I am earning $ 600 a month and these companies are making billions , it is not fair , " he says .
For Uganda , however , another country 's war on a continent far away has proved to be lucrative .
" The Iraq opportunity brings in about $ 90 million dollars , whereas our chief export , which is coffee , brings in around $ 60 or $ 70 million a year , " says the former state minister for labor , employment , and industrial relations , Mwesigwa Rukutana , now minister of higher education .
That figure is mostly made up of remittances .
But domestic criticism has been fierce , with some equating the system to human trafficking or slavery .
Reports of abuse , ranging from poor conditions and changeable contracts to sexual assault , have appeared in the media .
" Unlike in the past when there was the slave trade , no company comes here and recruits anyone against their wishes .
It is willing worker , willing employer , " Mr. Rukutana says .
" If anyone thinks the conditions there are bad or that he is going to be exploited , no one is compelling him to go . "
Rukutana says that only one Ugandan has been killed in Iraq , while others say more have died .
If anyone understands some of the hardships of working in Iraq and the industry it 's spawned , then it is Moses Matsiko .
Mr. Matsiko has spent nearly four years working for a US firm in Afghanistan and Iraq .
In late 2006 , a convoy he was escorting through the town of Fallujah was ambushed .
He was shot seven times but survived .
Two American colleagues he was with were killed .
But far from shy away from the dangers of Iraq , Matsiko has embraced its opportunities .
In 2007 , he started his own company to train and send guards to Iraq and now has over 1,200 in the country .
" My experience in Iraq is that despite having been shot seven times , it is very great , " he says .
President Obama 's withdrawal plans have cast a shadow of doubt over his future business plans .
But that has just forced Matsiko to start looking opportunities elsewhere .
" If all goes well , then I hope to be sending people to Afghanistan in the near future , " he smiles .
In the wake of Microsoft shutting down their flight sim operations , I have seen a significant up - tick in FlightGear inquiries and requests for help .
Several companies that previously delivered Microsoft based simulation products have approached me with interest in migrating or interfacing their products to FlightGear .
At least a couple of these organizations are ready to pay for some consulting time to help move their projects forward .
The level of interest I am seeing is well beyond what I can handle personally .
There is real interest , real need , and real opportunity here .
It would be a shame to ignore it .
I am proposing the idea of organizing a formal group of FlightGear developers who ( a ) have an interest in doing periodic consulting work , ( b ) have ( or in the future may have ) available time to devote to consulting work , and ( c ) have some knowledge and experience with FlightGear .
FlightGear skills could range from knowledge of internal structures , knowledge of communication and interfacing , ability to do custom installation and configuration of FlightGear , 3D aircraft and airport modeling , 2D graphics , hardware design and interfacing , flight dynamics , flight control , etc .
As we all know , the skill set that goes into a project like FlightGear covers an immense range and no single person can know or do it all .
This FlightGear consulting group would be formed underneath the umbrella of Airborne Technologies , Inc. Several years ago I met the president of Airborne Technologies ( ATI ) , became involved with one of their UAS projects , and I have now have become a part of the company .
ATI is an established business in Alaska and has a long history with aviation and technology .
We are involved with a number of projects that share common base technologies that include both hardware and software development for remote sensing type work .
By acting as a central business entity , ATI would coordinate and offer structure and consistency surrounding FlightGear consulting activities .
An established business presence is able to attract and leverage projects by adding value through hardware development , project coordination , training , and project support .
The types of needs and requests I am starting to see have proved to be difficult to address with FlightGear 's current informal support structure .
Organizations can have needs that go far beyond a few mailing list questions , and they are willing to pay appropriate compensation to the right person for assistance .
The proposed structured and professional approach will bode well , I believe , for FlightGear development and could potentially offer a substantial amount of paid work for interested developers .
The purpose of this email is to gauge developer interest and start the ball rolling .
Adding your name to our list of potentially interested developers does not lock you into working only through ATI exclusively .
There 's no problem if individuals and companies currently or in the future wish to make their own private arrangements .
But I think it is important that we move quickly to gather a list of interested developers so we can try to address several immediate needs and be better positioned to provide paid support needs in the future .
If you think you might be able to make some time in your schedule once in a while for a paid consulting job and have any of the range of FlightGear skills , I would love to hear from you .
Even if you are n't available today and just have a few questions , I 'd love to hear from you !
Thanks !!!

David Attenborough is a passionate Darwinian , and sees evolution as the cornerstone of all the programmes and series he has ever made .
Here , he shares his personal view on Darwin 's controversial idea .
Taking us on a journey through the last 200 years , he tracks the changes in our understanding of the natural world .
Ever since Darwin , major scientific discoveries have helped to underpin and strengthen Darwin 's revolutionary idea so that today , the pieces of the puzzle fit together so neatly that there can be little doubt that Darwin was right .
As David says : ' Now we can trace the ancestry of all animals in the tree of life and demonstrate the truth of Darwin 's basic proposition .
All life is related . '
David asks three key questions : how and why did Darwin come up with his theory of evolution ?
Why do we think he was right ?
And why is it more important now than ever before ?
David starts his journey in Darwin 's home at Down House in Kent , where Darwin worried and puzzled over the origins of life .
He goes back to his roots in Leicestershire , where he hunted for fossils as a child and where another schoolboy unearthed a significant find in the 1950s , and he revisits Cambridge University , where both he and Darwin studied and where many years later the DNA double helix was discovered , providing the foundations for genetics .
At the end of his journey in the Natural History Museum in London , David concludes that Darwin 's great insight revolutionised the way in which we see the world .
We now understand why there are so many different species , and why they are distributed in the way they are .
But above all , Darwin has shown us that we are not set apart from the natural world and do not have dominion over it .
We are subject to its laws and processes , as are all other animals on earth to which , indeed , we are related .
From the you - can 't - be- serious department : Savana Redding was a 13 - year - old honors student at a small Arizona middle school .
In math class one morning the principal ordered her to pack up and follow him to his office .
The principal interrogated her about a planner Savana had lent a friend , and a few ibuprofin pills sitting on the principal 's desk , which were found in the planner .
Savana knew nothing about the pills .
The principal then ordered her to the nurse 's office for a strip search .
Over ibuprofin pills .
Not that it would make a difference if she were carrying crack .
She was 13 .
She was being ordered to strip .
Her parents were never notified .
Savana did not consent to the search but complied in humiliating details .
She was forced , literally , to shake her bra and her underwear , exposing herself in front of the nurse and an assistant .
Nothing was found .
I do n't know what 's more perverse :
The principal 's zero - tolerance stupidity over ibuprofin pills , the degrading search , or the fact that nine U.S. Supreme Court justices will hear this case next month to decide what limits , if any , there should be on school authority .
But this is n't authority .
It 's criminal abuse -- of authority , of the child , of human dignity .
How do we come to this ?
Stupid question , considering the accumulating record of a society where ideals of justice and humaneness mix with the basest controls in the name of discipline and order .
They 're close relatives , those school officials who order a 13 year old strip searched , to those who have children Tasered , or to police officers who now use that instrument of torture as a routine means of subjugation , or to prison guards who do the same with restraining chairs .
When the barbaric becomes routine , it 's called protocol .
What should be denounced and forbidden is accepted and debated .
The distance has vanished from there to a government so willing to torture , and a public so willing to implicitly accept that dissolution of principles , if it 's willing to debate it .
" Why ca n't we send them to be tortured ? " George W. Bush had wondered about terrorism suspects in the early days of his war , according to a new book by Patrick Tyler , The New York Times ' chief diplomatic correspondent .
" Stick something up their ass ! "
Bush got his wish in the by - now familiar litany of terrorist behavior in the name of fighting terrorism -- torture and rendition , secret prisons , Guantanamo , Abu Ghraib , the systematic policy of brutality approved from the top that muscled up the wars ' enforcers .
That 's all revolting enough .
But it 's all been offshore , an outsourcing of depravity over there so we would n't have to be depraved over here -- the unspoken parallel to Bush 's dismal rationale of " fighting terrorists over there so we would n't have to fight them over here . "
That 's assuming that depravity can be so neatly segregated so the rest of us can go about our civilized pretensions untroubled .
But those excesses were n't exceptions .
They were variations on everyday norms at home that made them possible .
Abu Ghraib was bad .
Our domestic prison system is worse , from the unspoken torture of the solitary confinement of thousands ( as The New Yorker 's Atul Gawande argues in the current issue ) to the stunning yet apathy inducing fact that 7.3 million Americans are in prison , on parole or under probation .
It 's a $ 47 billion - a - year industry , the opposite of " corrections , " that exceeds China 's entire military budget .
Can that many Americans be so disproportionately more lawless than any other people on earth ?
On its face , the answer is no .
Americans are n't .
Their criminal justice system is -- the same system , unique in the world , that imprisons 13 year olds for life , carries out executions by conveyor belt ( an average of 60 a year since 2000 ) and turns petty marijuana inhalers into felons swelling prison cells and budget deficits .
There is no off - shoring of these betrayals of civilized behavior , no way to segregate them from what we are as a culture and what we 've made possible , abroad or in our own justice system and Taser - charged streets , and even our zero - tolerant schools , as Savana and many like her find out every day .
In " Star Trek IV : The Voyage Home , " the crew of the Enterprise travels back from the 23rd century to 1986 America , either to save the planet or save the whales .
There 's a wonderful scene toward the end where Captain Kirk , Spock and Dr. McCoy are trying to save Chekov from the claws of 20th century health care .
Dr. McCoy can't believe the hospital 's wards of barbarism .
To a woman on dialysis : " Dialysis ?
What is this , the dark ages ?
Here , swallow one of these . "
Chemotherapy ?
" Sounds like the ( expletive ) Spanish Inquisition . "
One of these days , I hope not so far as the 23rd century , we 'll look back on this decade 's epidemic of institutional sadism with as much horror as Dr. McCoy looked at 20th century medicine .

Each month ( and often more frequently than that ) we take a look at trends in social networking , by the numbers .
Recently , we ’ve focused on Twitter ’s astronomical growth - now up better than 2,500 percent in one year - and Facebook ’s climb to become top social network over MySpace .
However , this month there are a few other trends within the numbers – provided by Nielsen Online – that highlight some other storylines within the social media space , as well as continue to put meat behind the trends we ’ve been covering over the past few months .
Here are some notable developments from March :
Ning , which recently announced that more than one million social networks have been created using its service , is currently the 2nd fastest growing social networking property .
Its traffic is up 283 percent year - over - year , and it now reaches a total of 5.6 million people in the US .
Bebo , which we recently reported saw a one month surge of nearly 50 percent on the heels of a redesign and AIM integration , has grown 148 percent in the past year , and now reaches more than 6.1 million people in the US .
This is significant because Bebo is known mostly for being big overseas , but insignificant in the US .
The next few months will tell us if this was a one - time pop thanks to AIM integration or a continued trend thanks to some innovative things Bebo is doing with Socialthing .
Linked
In continues to be one of the quickest growing social sites and has more than doubled its size in the past year .
It now reaches better than 15.8 million people in the US , ranking it 3rd in total size behind Facebook and MySpace .
It ’s no doubt being buoyed by the weak economy and high unemployment as people turn to the site and their connections to find work .
As for “ the big three , ” the story remains much the same :
Twitter is now growing at a mind - boggling 2,565 percent .
In total , it reached more than 13 million people in the US during the month - and that 's just on its website ( i.e. - not counting clients like TweetDeck or Seesmic Desktop ) .
Next month will likely see this total continue to swell , thanks to huge mainstream media events like Ashton Kutcher versus CNN and Oprah jumping onto Twitter .
Facebook continues to extend its lead over MySpace .
In March , it saw 69.1 million visitors , versus 55.9 million for the News Corp - owned social networking site .
In fact , MySpace was the only social networking site measured in the Nielsen survey that saw its traffic decline year - over - year .
So , while not much changed at the top of the social media landscape in March , there are certainly a few new storylines emerging that will be worth watching going forward .
The full report – sorted by growth rate – is embedded below :

Stevie Wonder ‘s Superstition is definitely one of the funkiest songs on the planet – It was released way back in 1972 on the Talking Book album and climbed up the UK charts quickly .
Stevie came up with the song by playing the original funky drum beat that starts the track and humming a melody over the top of it .
Superstition was originally intended for Jeff Beck as a thank you for the guitarist ’s help on the awesome Talking Book album , but when Motown heard it they released Wonder ’s version as a single .
The song finally got popular in the US when Stevie toured with the Rolling Stones , thereby introducing the Stevie Wonder to a largely white audience , and grabbing Stevie ’s first number one hit since 1963 .
It ’s of course the signature Clavinet part that just oozes the funk .
In fact it was Superstition that really put the Hohner Clavinet on the map in funk / soul music .
A lot of keyboard players instantly tried to cop the part , but it seemed impossible to play .
Even Stevie himself never really played it properly when he played live .
It was later revealed that the Clavinet part actually consisted of two separate parts , panned hard left and right , creating the amazing polyrhythmic funk monster over which the main melody bounces .
Stevie was really into synthesizer technology at the time , so the bubbling bass line was also produced by the Clavinet fed through a synthesizer .
Still , getting the Clavinet part EXACTLY right has been elusive for pretty much every keyboard player on the planet , and the exact recorded parts have been somewhat of a mystery .
Until now .
An engineer has acquired the master recordings and has dissected Stevie Wonder ’s multitrack masters of the song .
Through the use of Protools , he was able to isolate all the tracks to get a listen to the infamous Clavinet parts .
Ready for this ?
In reality , it ’s actually 8 Clavinet parts !
Pretty interesting .
It sounds like some of the grooviness is created with delays and echoes on the effect tracks .
It would have been nice to hear each part in isolation , and I ’ve written to the author to try and get a copy of the sound files .
I ’ll update this post if I hear back from him , so please subscribe to email alerts to stay up to date .
Here ’s a treat : it ’s Stevie Wonder and his band doing a smoking version of Superstition on Sesame street .
I love how the one kid in the background is grooving out like crazy and all the other kids are standing there seemingly bored out of their minds .
Superstition has been covered countless times by other bands , most famously by Stevie Ray Vaughan and Jeff Beck , but Mel Torme also has a pretty interesting version of it on his Live At The Maisonette album from 1975 .
In case you actually want to learn how to play the song , the sheet music is available for free ( UPDATE : link down ) .
We actually did another story a while back in Beatles Hard Days Night mystery chord solved , using Fourier transforms to figure out the parts .
Check it out here if you ’re interested .
Here ’s Stevie and most of the band actually recording the song .
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) -- Wells Fargo wants taxpayers to know their investment is already paying dividends ... literally .
The San Francisco - based bank said Monday it paid a $ 371.5 million quarterly dividend to the U.S. Treasury on the preferred shares the bank issued to the government in last fall 's banking industry rescue .
Wells ( WFC , Fortune 500 ) , which got $ 25 billion from Treasury last October in the first installment of the Troubled Asset Relief Program , or TARP , also said that it has been lending money aggressively even as the economy sputters .
" Last quarter alone , we made $ 22 billion in loan commitments and $ 50 billion in mortgage originations , " Wells finance chief Howard Atkins said in a midmorning press release Monday .
He added that this is almost three times what the Treasury invested in the bank .
What banks are doing with the money the Bush administration 's Treasury Department showered on them beginning last fall has become a major issue on Capitol Hill .
Congressional Democrats are demanding that any further aid to the financial industry come with strict terms for how much recipients of TARP funds must lend , how much they can pay their executives and how they keep track of where the money is going .
The Obama administration has signaled it is receptive to those ideas , saying for instance that future recipients of any " exceptional " government aid would have to cut their quarterly dividend to a penny a share .
But the full terms of any future assistance remain unclear .
Last week , Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) -- the troubled Charlotte - based lender that , like rival Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) , has received two infusions of federal funds -- became the first big bank to say it would track and disclose its lending and investing activity across 10 key areas .
Wells ' dividend payment to Treasury is n't unusual , though the bank appears to be the first financial titan to announce the payout in a press release .
Firms that received aid under the TARP capital purchase plan agreed to issue the government preferred shares paying a 5 % dividend for the first five years and 9 % thereafter .
The government also got warrants to buy common stock in the future .
In Wells ' case , Treasury got warrants to buy 110 million Wells shares -- equivalent to about 3.3 % of shares outstanding -- at $ 34.01 each .
But bank shares have been in free fall the past few months .
The KBW Bank Index has lost half its value since mid-October .
Wells , despite reporting better - than - expected results last week and saying that it will not need more TARP money , has been no exception .
The stock was trading around $ 18.83 in midday action Monday , which means the taxpayers ' warrants have lost about $ 1.7 billion of their value on paper .

Acupuncture in the BMJ
A new review appeared in the BMJ today .
It is by Madsen et al. , from the Nordic Cochrane Centre , Copenhagen .
Here are the conclusions .
The analgesic effect of acupuncture is small and cannot be distinguished from bias resulting from incomplete blinding .
The analgesic effect of placebo acupuncture is moderate but very variable as some large trials report substantial effects .
The effect of acupuncture seems to be unrelated to the type of placebo acupuncture used as control .
The results confirm , yet again , that there is essentially no difference between “ real ” acupuncture and sham acupuncture .
All that talk about meridians and Qi really is so much mumbo jumbo .
The average effect ( the diamond at the bottom ) is essentially zero .
It has often been supposed that acupuncture is a theatrical placebo , but because of the placebo effect it produces more pain relief than ( non-blind ) controls .
This study confirms that there is likely to be such an effect , but it also finds that the size of the placebo effect is too small to be useful to patients .
Here is the comparison between sham acupuncture and no acupuncture at all .
The results of different trials are very variable , but the average effect ( diamond at the bottom ) favours sham acupuncture over no acupuncture at all .
But how big is the effect ?
The numbers along the bottom of the graph are ‘ standardised mean differences ’ .
The average value of - 0.42 ( 95 % confidence limits - 0.6 to - 0.23 ) between ‘ no acupuncture ’ and ‘ sham acupuncture ’ corresponds to a difference of about 10 points on a 100 point scale .
This difference is big enough to be real , in the sense that it is n’t just chance .
But is it big enough to be useful to the patient ?
Probably not .
Madsen et al conclude
“ a consensus report characterised a 10 mm reduction on a 100 mm visual analogue scale as representing a “ minimal ” change or “ little change ” .
Thus , the apparent analgesic effect of acupuncture seems to be below a clinically relevant pain improvement . ”
This makes nonsense of the Pittilo report .
Notice that these results , yet again , make nonsense of the proposals in the gamma- minus Pittilo report , to pseudo - regulate acupuncture , and to have degrees in the subject .
Cochrane reviews of Acupuncture : and a bad report from BBC
Two new Cochrane reviews appeared last week , Acupuncture for tension - type headache , and Acupuncture for migraine prophylaxis .
You ca n’t blame subeditors for the appalling title of the BBC ’s report on Acupuncture ‘ works for headaches ’ .
The content is pretty misleading too .
( The link is to a version saved at 19.35 on 21 January 2009 . ) .
Furthermore , like far too many of the BBC reports , it is anonymous .
One has no idea to blame
This is important , if only because the BBC news site is so influential .
Twelve hours after posting the misleading title has been copied all round the world .
In the Guardian , Ian Sample had a much better report , Even ’fake ’ acupuncture reduces the severity of headaches and migraines .
Sadly the print edition had the title “ Acupuncture aids migraines , researchers
find ” , but that can be blamed on subeditors who have a problem with reading ( in fact Sample had seen neither title ) .
The BBC report seemed to call for a complaint .
This is what I sent .
I wish to complain about the report on acupuncture at http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7838231.stm
The title itself was highly misleading “ Acupuncture works for headaches ” is precisely the opposite of what was shown , namely that it is no better than sham acupuncture controls .
The article goes on to say “ The traditional explanation of its effects involves tapping into a network of “ meridians ” around the body to regulate the flow of an energy called “ chi ” .
Acupuncture points are located at various positions along these meridians . ”
It is not said that there is n’t the slightest reason to think this is true ( or even means anything ) , and that the work which is being reported is strong evidence that it ’s not true “ Acupuncture is still regarded as a “ complementary ” therapy , but is increasingly being viewed as a potential mainstream treatment for certain conditions , such as chronic pain ”
That is wrong .
University of Salford , for example has just closed its acupuncture course after a number of us have pointed out that it is teaching things that are n’t true “ The endorsement by the Cochrane Collaboration is likely to lead to further calls for it to be made more widely available on the NHS ” It is exactly the opposite of an endorsement .
It is one more nail in the coffin of acupuncture as generally understood .
This article , I contend , is partial and misleading .
Unfortunately it is anonymous .
Follow - up
Today ’s BBC report on the BMJ paper is almost as partisan as the one that I just complained about .
“ Confusion on acupuncture benefit ” exaggerates greatly the amount of confusion .
Worse still , it quotes only two well - known advocates of acupuncture , people who make their living from it .
No independent scientific voice is to be heard .
One of those cited is Adrian White .
He is described as “ a researcher into acupuncture at the Peninsula Medical School ” .
There is no mention of the fact that he is also Editor in Chief of the journal Acupuncture in Medicine .
The other person who is quoted is Mike O’Farrell , the chief executive of the British Acupuncture Council .
What do you expect him to say ?
I ’ve just sent another complaint , about today ’s BBC report .
The more the merrier .
The BMJ itself published an editorial on the Madsen paper .
It seems very odd that they should have chosen the editors of the BMJ - group journal , Acupuncture in Medicine , to comment on a paper that sounds the death knell for the subject from which they make their living .
Needless to say , the editorial attempted to wriggle out of the obvious conclusions .
Worse still , the Health editor of the BBC web site referred to the editorial in his defence , in response to my complaint .
Channel 4
News does a lot better than the BBC , or the BMJ editorial , with its report Acupuncture ‘ fails to relieve pain ’
“ Claims that acupuncture can relieve pain have been undermined by the results of a new study . ” “ senior researcher Asbjorn Hrobjartsson said : “ Our findings question both the traditional foundation of acupuncture … and the prevailing theory that acupuncture has an important effect on pain in general ” . “
The Daily Telegraph also , like almost everyone else , did better than the BBC , with “ Acupuncture ‘ has almost no effect in relieving pain ’ ”
“ The pain relieving effects of acupuncture are so small that they may be clinically irrelevant , according to a review of research into the treatment . ”
Even Metro , the free London Newspaper , is more accurate then the BBC .
They carry a short report “ Acupuncture ‘ has no medical point ’ . ”
“ The pain - relieving effects of acupuncture compared with a placebo are so small they may be clinically irrelevant . ”
New review puts in doubt traditional foundation of acupuncture .
Believe it or not , that is the title of the report on Madsen et al from the Prince ’s Foundation for Integretad Health !
Do n’t get too excited though .
They have n’t even bothered to look at the original paper , but merely cite the dreadful BBC report .
Much prominence is given to the acupuncturists , White and O’Farrell , and the important finding is n’t mentioned at all .
Another gamma minus .
Why do drug companies strive to produce erectile dysfunction drugs instead of anti-malaria drugs ?
Because the former is more profitable .
After all , drug companies are profit seeking organizations .
Right ?
Enter OneWorld Health , the first nonprofit drug developer .
Through partnerships , like this one with drug giant Roche , OneWorld Health gains access to drug compounds that may be helpful in combating “ neglected diseases ” ( those diseases that affect many people , but which are unprofitable to develop drugs for – ie .
they affect people who cannot pay enough for the drugs to make them profitable ) .
For - profit drug companies can let OneWorld Health search their collections of chemical compounds in search of possible medicines for neglected diseases or if a drug company has an indentified compound they can donate it to OneWorld Health for development .
Of course , another model would be for drug companies to set up “ dot-org ” divisions akin to Google.org to create drugs for neglected diseases and chalk up the costs as part of their corporate philanthropy .
But without the internal motivation to put a dot - org model in place , it seems to me that having OneWorld Health operate as an external dot- org works better because rather than relying on the drug companies to take action , OneWorld Health has a mission focused motivation to make things happen .
Jed Emerson argues in his Blended Value thesis that all organizations produce a blend of financial and social value .
Maybe organizations like OneWorld Health can identify situations , like neglected diseases , where for - profit players are letting social value lay dormant due to low levels of associated financial value and work with the for - profit players to “ liberate ” this social value ?
OneWorld Health is an organization to watch not simply for their own efforts , but to see whether a dot - org model can be brought to the for - profit sector rather than waiting on them to embrace Google ’s lead .
