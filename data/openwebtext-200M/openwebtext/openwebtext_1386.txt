In testimony before the House Intelligence Committee today , National Intelligence Director Dennis Blair told representatives that American citizens can be assassinated by the US government when they are oveseas .
Blair said the comments were intended to “ reassure ” Americans that there was a “ set of defined policy and legal procedures ” in place and that such assassinations are always carried out by the book .
Rep. Pete Hoekstra ( R – MI ) inquired about the procedures involved , asking what the legal framework was under which Americans could be killed by the intelligence community .
Blair insisted that under no circumstances would Americans be assassinated overseas for criticizing the government , adding “ we do n’t target people for free speech . ”
Rather they are subject to assassination when the government decides they are a threat and when they “ get specific permission . ”
Exactly who was giving that permission was unclear .
The question has been increasingly important as the Obama Administration attempts to help the Yemeni government assassinate Anwar al - Awlaki , a US - born cleric who is not accused of any crimes by the US government .
The administration maintains that secret evidence exists linking Awlaki to terrorism .
There seems to be a chilling lack of oversight in the procedure behind these killings , however , Blair ’s assurances against politically motivated assassinations aside .
The US has killed Americans in overseas attacks before , but only as “ collateral damage . ”
It has never admitted to explicitly assassinating an American citizen before , though it seems that the policy is in place and such killings are only a matter of time .
CLEVELAND , Ohio --
The
ran afoul of state building code regulations when they removed all the drinking fountains from
, according to state officials .
The Cavs likely will reinstall the fountains at the end of the month , team spokesman Tad Carper said in an e-mail after declining to be interviewed .
The announcement came a day after The Plain Dealer reported that the team had removed the fountains , forcing fans to wait in concession stand lines to get free cups of water .
Carper said in the e-mail that the team was considering reinstalling the fountains because the peak of flu season was coming to an end .
He said in interviews last week that the team removed the fountains to protect fans from bacteria and viruses that cause illnesses like H1N1 flu .
The fountains have been gone the entire Cavs season , which started Oct. 27 .
They were unavailable during the Ringling Bros. & Barnum and Bailey Circus , which was held the prior weekend .
Health officials say that water fountains are not a health threat if they are cleaned regularly , and few fans bought the explanation .
Many speculated that the Cavs removed the fountains to drive up sales at concession stands , where bottles of Aquafina sell for $ 4 .
" It 's clearly an opportunity to sell more drinks , " said Cleveland City Councilman Tony Brancatelli .
" If there were health reasons , we'd be taking fountains out of every school and institution . "
Current state building code requires one fountain for every 1,000 occupants , Matt Mullins , the spokesman for the Ohio Department of Commerce , which oversees the Board of Building Standards .
" It 's a requirement to have those water fountains , " Mullins said .
Cleveland 's Building and Housing Department , which enforces building codes in the city , did not become aware that the team removed the fountains until after The Plain Dealer 's story .
When David Cooper , deputy director of Cleveland 's Building and Housing Department , looked into the issue this week , he found that the Cavs had not received city approval to remove water fountains .
The arena is required to have 18 of them , which met requirements at the time , Cooper said .
Removing the fountains without approval could carry penalties , but that is unlikely to happen .
" If they do come into compliance there would be no reason to asses penalties , " Cooper said .
Mayor Frank Jackson 's spokeswoman , Andrea Taylor , said the Cavs are not getting special treatment .
" The whole idea ( of code enforcement ) is that if someone is not in compliance we work with them to get them into compliance , " Cooper said .
Before the Cavs can reinstall the fountains , they have to apply to the city for a permit .
Cooper said that the department could examine and approve this sort of application the day it is submitted .

The O! penis prankster himself
in Omaha City Weekly
By Elle Lien
As promised , here are excerpts from an interview I recently conducted with artist Scott Blake .
Blake 's amorous encounters with area O !'s have been stirring up controversy in the local art community .
Describing himself as an " evil conevil " of the art community , Blake has taken to violating the O! public art sculptures with a 7 - foot penis .
Blake collaborated with Caitlin Martella on the project .
Martella also participated in the interview .
One caveat .
The views expressed by Martella and Blake in the interview are not necessary shared by me , the interviewer , or the City Weekly .
I wanted to make that clear , because this is an opinion column .
Blake and Martella express dissatisfaction with the Omaha art scene and insist that there is n't a place for their work in our community .
I may dislike the O!'s and their cookie cutter format and thinly veiled marketing agenda , but I think there are some pretty terrific things happening in terms of art in Omaha - Brigitte McQueen 's Pulp , RNG , Bemis , Tugboat Presents , Nomad , Espana ...
All of this hits head on the main complaint that Blake has about art in Omaha - that if you want to do something , you 're going to have to make it happen yourself .
Ummm , yeah .
OK , the interview ...
How do you feel about public art in Omaha ?
Martella :
Well the thing is , I think this encourages the poor art scene , that they give the artists this cookie cutter project and then say , " Here you go city , have some shit . "
Blake :
For me something is better than nothing .
Martella : Picky people go hungry , is what my mom always said and I said fine .
And then I just did n't eat .
Blake : Maybe it is enriching , but I think we can do better .
And I think Caitlin and I did that .
I think they were pretty bad , and ...
Martella :
We personalized them .
So where did the idea to f*** the O !'s come from ?
Blake : I think everybody had the idea .
It just was begging for it .
I think a lot of people have the dumb ideas , but I think I 'm the only idiot stupid enough to go and do it .
Where does your hatred for the O! come from ?
Blake : I hate all art .
It started for me in art school when they did n't want me to be an artist .
I was studying computer art to become some sort of George Lucas " Star Wars " - type animator .
That is what art has become .
And there is no real place for someone like myself to get started .
You have to kind of go out and do it on your own .
That 's sort of what we did .
We did it on our own .
It cost like $ 200 for us to make that penis .
I mean really , I love art , but at the same time it is like art is sort of becoming , hmm , I mean , I love it so much that is why I would do this .
Why are the O !'s so offensive to you ?
Blake :
They 're just like cookie cutter Mickey Mouse and you know they 're not so offensive , it 's really just the idea and how much money was spent on them .
I think people see the O !'s and then say " OK , we have art in Omaha . "
But where 's my art in Omaha ?
Martella :
It 's disillusioning I think .
People are like , " Oh yeah , we support art , we have art all over the place .
Art this , art that , " but it 's not true .
You go to art events and nobody shows up .
It 's a sad state of affairs .
And you think that art would be such a big scene because we have such a big music scene .
We have people that genuinely appreciate creativity and ingenuity , but at the same time we have a lot of artists that are feeling unrecognized and unappreciated .
Blake :
Where are the art galleries in Omaha ?
Where do I show my art in Omaha ?
I 'm not really that concerned with being a " local " artist , because I am having a pretty good time hanging out here in Vienna , but when I come back to Omaha , there are zero - point - zero opportunities for me to express myself .
In a way I kinda acted out .
I wanted to do something that would get people 's attention .
To say , " look at me , look at me " and I know that is childish , but in a way that is what art is .
Do you think the point of the O !'s was to promote art in Omaha , or just to promote Omaha in general - used as a marketing tool ?
Blake : Stop doing this cookie cutter crap .
The Chamber of Commerce does n't give Conor Oberst a song list and say , " Here , play these songs , " or tell him to make up a song about Omaha and then we 'll give you a stage .
So it 's not really that there is n't a physical space , it is that there is n't a scene ?
Blake : I do n't think it is necessarily an Omaha problem .
I think it may be a worldwide state of affairs and Omaha is just where I happen to call home right now .

I do n't know that much about censorship aside from it supposedly protects the children .
I believe it just protects the censoring society 's morals and perspectives .
However , this outlook becomes a bit sticky when I consider the censorship of pornography and art .
There are some artists out there who make incredibly pornographic styled art , but who hang in mainstream galleries .
( I 've gotten my head round this one by pointing at money . )
Similar images would live in Playboy magazine and be called pornography .
I find some pornography offensive , but there 's certainly offensive ' art ' out there , too .

It 's really interesting how at the same time the hatred for Eve developed , the worship of Mary / Madonna developed .
But the Madonna was always clothed heavily and henceforth none of the female FIGURE could be seen in her depictions , and it seems that upon developing that terrible dichotomy of ideals for women ( the terribly evil Eve and the terribly religious / subservient Mary ) , everything about the female other than subservience was reviled and encapsulated * within* the female figure -- I feel like the female figure lost all of any positive connotations / traits it may have had before this at this time .
Do you think that 's true ?
( lol that latter half of my comment was just inferences drawn from observations from a really incomplete examination of art history and a much more rigorous study of religion xD ; )
I totally agree with you on this subject , btw .
I feel like most societies today feel the female figure is more aesthetically pleasing in its entirety than the male 's in its entirety .
I do n't find it a positive thing for either sex -- men are considered humorous or awkward - looking in their natural states , while having such a high appreciation for the female figure invariably leads to a higher objectification of women , imho .
That could just be me , although I 'm pretty sure I 'm at least touching on something there with some types of art .
I think it 's great to find the human figures beautiful , but if we find only females beautiful and males just funny - looking it starts to smack of something sinister that I can't place my finger on .
I * do * think part of why female nudity is more acceptable is because you do n't get full shots of the vagina in most female nudity , whereas a penis is always exposed when the man is naked , you know ?
Unless my understanding is incorrect , shots showing the vagina more explicitly than seen from the front while the woman is standing are considered as pornographic as a naked male .
( I 'm probably missing a lot of art , though e_e )

Re : vaginas - I was under the impression that a few artists , like Georgia O'Keefe , painted flowers as a subtle reference to vaginas .
' Cos you can't have a vag on display in an art gallery , oh no !
It has to be shrouded in mystery !
I went through an obsessive period of drawing vagina / flowers in a sketchbook which I called my vag book .

I can't say who this is more offensive to , though .
It does imply that the male form is somehow more vulgar , inappropriate , or ugly and therefore not as deserving of artistic representation .
But it also implies that women are works of art -- which are , at the end of the day , things , because a statue , a painting , or a photograph are just things -- and therefore also " just things " to be looked at and awed over and then passed by .
Or maybe I 'm overanalyzing things and getting distracted by the lady with the gorilla head in the picture in magna_carter I never understood the censorship thing .
Honestly , a naked human body is a naked human body .
I think the male and female forms are both beautiful , each in different ways , but still beautiful and still deserving of being called art .
It 's utterly ridiculous that a drawing of a naked man -- just naked , not even aroused - - would be called pornography .
No , it 's just a naked man .
Quit freaking out .

I am VERY upset about the way the bodies of men and women are portrayed on film .
Not only are breasts shown in almost every horror or action film but the only time you really see a man naked is in an art house flick or in a comedy ( because women could NEVER find a naked man attractive ) * glowers *
According to films women are IMMEDIATELY naked as soon as they walk into a room .
How many times have we all seen the movie where as soon as the girl walks into another room she starts to remove clothing ?
I can think of eight examples this very moment and more are coming to me all the time .
Not only that but they wander around topless and bottomless while their male counterparts are clothed decently .
And all business deals ?
Shady , especially , but not always , have to take place in a strip club .
Where the girls usually act in ways strippers can not or would not do ( case in point , a mock - umentary I watched at a film festival a few years ago , film crew walks into a strip club , girls are straddling a fat man .
Most are topless .
The manager starts to tell them the camera can't come in because it 's illegal but relents when he learns who they are .
The girls get up and start making out with each other and pole dancing for the camera .
I can assure you that NO stripper would be ok with that .
They all have damn good reasons for wanting no cameras around )
But seriously ?
To prove how street savvy , how much of a loser , or how awesome a guy is they always have to end up in a strip club .
For no reason .
And that 's the crux of my complaints .
Give us a reason and give us male nudity and maybe then I wo n't complain .

It 's one of the biggest sources of anger between myself and my boyfriend .

Did Photobucket really say " inappropriate " and " pornographic " ?
As a fellow artist in love with the nude figure , this has got me all kinds of pissed off , mainly because of the mistaken idea that nudity is always sexual in nature .
I suspect that your female nudes were n't slapped down because they are more generally accepted as " art " due to their prevalence in art history .
As for why , I have no facts , only sneaking suspicions about male control of the art world .
Basically , I think it 's because everyone enjoys viewing the female form , but a lot of men and some women just can't stand to look at a penis , even if it 's flaccid and obviously not the focal body part .
But that 's just my theory .
And yes , that would be sexist .
It 's a ridiculous mindset , one that I have to battle with rather frequently from the general public .
( Have you ever tried to teach people about cave frescoes in India without showing breasts or genitalia ?
It 's nigh impossible ! )
Ratings and objections to nudity should n't be about the amount of skin that is exposed ; it should be about the situation the nudity is in .
Anyone can be completely naked and it have nothing to do with sex .
How is this a bad thing ?
It 's natural .
You might want to write to both Photobucket and Myspace and ask them to explain their rulings , pointing out that all of your images were artistic celebrations of the human form and none of them were sexual or suggestive in nature .
I doubt you 'll actually be able to reason with them , but if nothing else it 'll be interesting to see what drivel they come up with .
In the meantime , I suggest getting a sketchblog to upload your work on .
Vox seems to be pretty accepting of artistic nudes as long as they 're labeled as " not for the public stream " -- that keeps it out of the random feeds and away from the search bots .
I 'm not sure about Wordpress and Blogger 's policies , though I 've seen full nudity on both .
If you need to vent , drop me a line .

I do n't know if this is true or not but maybe the reason males are n't shown nude anywhere is because the people making the movies , drawings , ect. are mostly males .
It could be Homophobia or and ego stroke for males to see the female form more .

The idea that the human body is by default pornographic is totally absurd and that the male body is more ' pornographic ' than the female when both are equally naked is both hilarious and infuriating !
Do both the sites you mentioned have actual notes in their ToS about the posting of nudes ?

This is a topic that I think about a lot , as I 'm an art history major with a focus in representations of the female body .
I think there are a lot of potential reasons , but here 's one that makes a lot of sense to me .
In the act of viewing a nude body , we are in a way objectifying it .
It becomes an object to be viewed , and it is in that way disempowered , just an object , a thing whose purpose is to be viewed , and for the viewer to enjoy .
If we accept that sexism has run rampant in art ( and I 'm sure some people do n't agree with that , it 's a personal opinion ) , then it makes sense to me that the people who are in power would not want their bodies to be objectified or disempowered .
Thus , women 's bodies are more easily objectified than men's .

As somewhat of an artist , with daughters who aspire to possible careers in art , I had to respond to this post .
My oldest has quite a few nudes posted around on the net , and as far as I know , has never had any problems with the nudity issue , but then again her taste in nudes and art tend to run the hermaphrodite road right now rather then the classical male or female nude , so that might be the difference .
A class action suit against photobucket might need be in the works ?? ;) :D :X.....
My personal rule when it comes to whether something is deemed porny or not is pretty much to do with the intimacy of the artwork itself ... if you have somebody naked looking directly at you , it denotes a much more personal relationship to the viewer imho , then if the gaze is not a direct one
I welcome all comments and questions on this ....

we actually discussd this in my class .
we decided that eye contact is indeed a little more " porny " ( hah =D ) and we also came to the conclusion that some kind of subtle concealing of certain body parts seemed more pornographic than just full frontal nudity .
the male nudes were definitely not by any means pornographic , but very obviously male as well .
i think it was just the penis shot that did it for them since i had a front view of the model at the time .

Sexism affects all of us .
It is offensive to both men and women .
All sexism is .
Yes , often times it is one sex that is being denigrated , but the underlying message inherent in sexism is that there is a certain way that men should act and a certain way that women should act and never the twain shall meet .
This dichotomous thinking limits the options of both sexes .
And that sucks ... for everyone .

( And , yes , there are things that children should n't see ) .
I think a big part of it is how men and women are conditioned to view the opposite sex , and their own sex .
Our culture has promoted women as objects ( of beauty , sex , etc. ) for a very long time .
At the same time , men are promoted as caregivers , protectors , people with careers , etc .
We 're all used to seeing the female as a sexual object , men and women , regardless of our own sexual orientation .
Example : Mens ' magazines usually have women on the cover .
Presumably because those women are sexually desirable to the heterosexual male .
And sex sells .
Womens ' magazines usually have other women on the cover .
Not because they are trying to sell lesbian sex , but because women have grown up viewing the female body ( their bodies ) in a sexualized context .
As a society , we do n't have the equivalent for males .
Men do n't grow up seeing images of the male body in a sexualized context .
Not that society should start sexy - ing up the male image .
We should stop treating women as only sex objects .
But at the same time , we need to accept that both forms can & are beautiful , particularly in a lot of artistic settings .

it blew my mind how really tiny things like parting your lips , arching / hunching your back , partly closing your eyes , etc. etc. can be the difference between sexy and pretty .

I 've got my AA in art !
This reminds me of my life drawing class .
We had both male and female students and when we had a nude female model everything was calm .
Anyone who complained was invited to leave the class .
When we had a nude male model some of the students went up in arms and even went as far as to complain to the dean .
I recall when showing up early for class hearing my teacher shout " Idiots ! " from his office .

My theatre teacher actually told me that the reason they show boobs and stuff in film is because there 's a rule when censoring stuff that no plumbing ( that 's the word he used lol ) can be shown .
A man 's plumbing is external which is why penises can't be shown but a woman 's is internal so it 's fair game .

that seems to be the general consesus around here , and i guess it makes sense under that logic .
i still call a bullshit card , though ; P
E.O. Wilson , native son of Mobile and Harvard professor emeritus , is at it again , this time in a new incarnation as a novelist .
Not content with two Pulitzer Prizes for scientific writing or the acclaim garnered by his memoir , " The Naturalist , " the 80 - year - old is publishing his first work of fiction , a novel titled " Anthill . "
In the inner workings of an ant colony , Wilson sees shades of humanity .
The various subdivisions of labor mirror our own , with garbage men , soldiers , carpenters , explorers , morticians , nurses and even laggards who must be forced to work .
Wilson uses those similarities to his advantage , painting a picture of the human world as little more than ant society writ large .
" That 's explicitly what I had in mind .
This is the story of three independent worlds , which nevertheless coexist in time and space , " Wilson said , referring to the ant world , the moneyed world of Mobile society and the blue - collar existence in small - town south Alabama .
" Ants are the most warlike of all creatures .
They are constantly at war .
Does that sound familiar ? "
Wilson said , chuckling .
" I did n't have to stretch to find the similarities between humans and ants .
There are immense differences , but the similarities are instructive . "
As one of the pre-eminent scientists of the last 100 years , Wilson is credited with developing a new way of understanding the natural world called sociobiology .
Essentially , it explains the strange evolutions of myriad creatures by looking at the advantages and repercussions of social interactions between animals .
His world view , he happily acknowledged , was borne out of a childhood spent in Evergreen , Pensacola , Bay St. Louis and Mobile , where he lived in his great - great - grandfather 's house ,
the first erected on Charleston Street .
The professor is a grand raconteur whose conversations wind from topic to topic at great speed .
" You have hit on a deadly combination , " he warned midway through a phone call from his Massachusetts home .
" I am a Southerner , a storyteller and a Harvard professor .
That 's a sure recipe for boredom if you are not careful . "
The rollicking new novel opens with its protagonist on the wrong end of a shotgun wielded by a crazed hermit and later features pistol - packing evangelical Christians , who are more than a touch wicked .
Wilson said he fell in love with the " Godlike " power of the novelist as opposed to the scientific writer he has been all his life .
He delighted in " creating and carrying this whole world around in my head " and bringing it to fruition .
He also enjoyed describing " the magic forests of Alabama " to readers who have never known them .
Along the way , Wilson delivers some of the most rhapsodic nature writing of his career , particularly in a section devoted to the rise and fall of several ant empires within an area the size of a tennis court .
Titled " The Anthill Chronicles , " that section was excerpted in the New Yorker magazine .
" That 's a novella within the novel , a break for the reader , " said Wilson , who has studied ants since he was a teenager in Mobile .
" I wanted the reader to know what it would be like to be an ant , how ants see the world , never mind how humans see ants . "
Its overarching theme of survival is one that Wilson has turned to more often in recent years , suggesting again and again that many creatures are doomed to extinction unless humans change their ways .
" People do n't realize that Alabama is one of the most amazing places in the world .
There are 358 species of brackish and freshwater fish in Alabama .
That 's unparalleled .
It leads in turtle species , in the number of mollusks , it has an amazing number of mammals , " he said .
" Dauphin Island is one of the 10 best birding sites in the world .
The Mobile - Tensaw Delta , one day people will realize that it is one of the most pristine areas in the country . "
Wilson , once a paperboy for the Press - Register , is at work on a book about Mobile .
It will include recollections from his childhood and trace the city 's history since the arrival of the earliest French explorers , he said , revealing connections between early settlers and the people here today .
Wilson said he spends much of his time these days writing .
He has had 30 books published , with " about six more in the can ready to go . "
What fuels his prolific output ?
" I 'm 80 years old , " he said .
" I 'm racing to get it all done before I go ga - ga . "
" Anthill " will appear in local bookstores in late March , Wilson said .
He plans to come to the area April 14 - 16 for several book signings .
NASA Internal memo : Message from the NASA Administrator : Feb. 3 , 2010
Status Report From : NASA HQ
Posted : Wednesday , February 3 , 2010
On Monday , Feb. 1 , the Obama Administration launched a bold and ambitious new space initiative that invests in American ingenuity to propel us on a new journey of innovation and discovery .
This new effort will enable our nation to explore new worlds , develop more innovative technologies , foster new industries , strengthen international partnerships , and increase our understanding of the Earth , our solar system , and the universe .
In anticipation of the President�s new vision for NASA , I have been working closely with the NASA senior leadership team to ensure that we are ready to take on the opportunities we have been given .
Early last fall , I asked Deputy Administrator Lori Garver to lead an Institutional Readiness Project ( IRP ) that focused on improving the area of institutional management .
She and the IRP Team can be credited with surfacing progressive ideas that culminated into recommendations for organizational changes .
Accordingly , I have notified the Congress that I intend to implement some organizational changes at NASA .
The changes align with my previously stated goals of :
( a ) embracing national priorities that align with NASA capabilities , ( b ) empowering NASA to pursue and implement new direction , and ( c ) streamlining functions and aligning roles and responsibilities with program execution .
First , as we pursue a new direction , we must invigorate NASA�s long tradition of innovation and scientific discovery .
To help with this , I have created two new positions that will report directly to me :
- A Chief Technologist , who will lead a new Technology Innovation Office and provide a much - needed interface to our external stakeholders and to our industry , government , and international partners .
The Chief Technologist will lead a new Technology Innovation Office ( TIO ) that includes the existing Innovative Partnerships Program .
- I have appointed Dr. Robert D. Braun from the Georgia Institute of Technology as Chief Technologist .
- A Chief Scientist , who will serve as my principal science advisor in addition to being the primary NASA interface to the national and international science community .
The Chief Scientist will provide independent guidance and assessment of Agency level strategic plans , budgets , and long - range scientific vision , ensuring that the interrelated scientific endeavors are widely regarded as scientifically and technologically well founded and appropriate to achieve NASA�s mission .
Second , to streamline the way we do business and to ensure that we �invest in what we need and sacrifice what we don't� through strategic maintenance and investments in infrastructure , I am consolidating a number of mission support and business functions under a new Mission Support Directorate that will report directly to my Office .
- I have asked Dr. Woodrow Whitlow , Jr. , from the Glenn Research Center to serve as Associate Administrator for the new Mission Support Directorate .
While additional changes have been made to the structure , I wanted to outline these major changes in my communication to you .
Finally , I want to express my confidence in you , the NASA staff .
Though organizational change can promote improvement , it is the people who must make it all work .
And , it will be you who will realize the President 's vision .
I am confident in you and grateful for your continued contributions .
Charles F. Bolden , Jr.
NASA Administrator

If you finally get sick of Modern Warfare 2 come winter , Activision has you covered : Call of Duty 7 will be ready for the holiday season .
Kotaku is reporting that in today 's quarterly earnings call , Activision Blizzard claimed it will " continue annualizing " the FPS cash cow .
In the same call , CEO Bobby Kotick hinted that there may be a subscription fee in Call of Duty 's future , stating , " If you think about the successes we have had in other categories on subscriptions , you can get a sense of the direction we want to take that franchise . "
So , how excited are you about a new Call of Duty game every year , possibly with a monthly subscription plan attached : very excited , super excited , or very super excited ?
, or one - in - a - billion , is the famed number given for the maximum probability of a catastrophic failure , per hour of operation , in life - critical systems like commercial aircraft .
The number is part of the folklore of the safety - critical systems literature ; where does it come from ?
First , it ’s worth noting just how small that number is .
As pointed out by Driscoll et al. in the paper , Byzantine Fault Tolerance , from Theory to Reality , the probability of winning the U.K. lottery is 1 in 10s of millions , and the probability of being struck by lightening ( in the U.S. ) is more than a 1,000 times more likely than
So where did come from ?
A nice explanation comes from a recent paper by John Rushby :
If we consider the example of an airplane type with 100 members , each flying hours per year over an operational life of 33 years , then we have a total exposure of about 107 flight hours .
If hazard analysis reveals ten potentially catastrophic failures in each of ten subsystems , then the “ budget ” for each , if none are expected to occur in the life of the fleet , is a failure probability of about per hour [ 1 , page 37 ] .
This serves to explain the well - known requirement , which is stated as follows : “ when using quantitative analyses .
. . numerical probabilities .
. . on the order of per flight - hour . . . based on a flight of mean duration for the airplane type may be used .
. . as aids to engineering judgment .
. . to. . . help determine compliance ” ( with the requirement for extremely improbable failure conditions ) [ 2 , paragraph 10.b ] .
[ 1 ] E. Lloyd and W. Tye , Systematic Safety : Safety Assessment of Aircraft Systems .
London , England : Civil Aviation Authority , 1982 , reprinted 1992 .
[ 2 ] System Design and Analysis , Federal Aviation Administration , Jun. 21 , 1988 , advisory Circular 25.1309 - 1A .
( By the way , it ’s worth reading the rest of the paper — it ’s the first attempt I know of to formally connect the notions of ( software ) formal verification and reliability . )
So there a probabilistic argument being made , but let ’s spell it out in a little more detail .
If there are 10 potential failures in 10 subsystems , then there are potential failures .
Thus , there are possible configurations of failure / non - failure in the subsystems .
Only one of these configurations is acceptable — the one in which there are no faults .
If the probability of failure is then the probability of non-failure is
So if the probability of failure for each subsystem is then the probability of being in the one non-failure configuration is
We want that probability of non-failure to be greater than the required probability of non-failure , given the total number of flight hours .
Thus ,
which indeed holds :
is around
Can we generalize the inequality ?
The hint for how to do so is that the number of subsystems ( ) is no more than the overall failure rate divided by the subsystem rate :
This suggests the general form is something like
Subsystem reliability inequality :
where and are real numbers , and
Let ’s prove the inequality holds .
Joe Hurd figured out the proof , sketched below ( but I take responsibility for any mistakes in it ’s presentation ) .
For convenience , we ’ll prove the inequality holds specifically when but the proof can be generalized .
First , if the inequality holds immediately .
Next , we ’ll show that
is monotonically non-decreasing with respect to by showing that the derivative of its logarithm is greater or equal to zero for all So the derivative of its logarithm is
We show
iff
and since
iff
Let , so the range of is
Now we show that in the range of , the left - hand side is bounded below by the right - hand side of the inequality .
and
Now taking their derivatives
and
Because in the range of , our proof holds .
The purpose of this post was to clarify the folklore of ultra-reliable systems .
The subsystem reliability inequality presented allows for easy generalization to other reliable systems .
Thanks again for the help , Joe !

A new report estimates that one - fifth of the detainees who have been released from the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , have resumed extremist activity , a Defense Department official said Wednesday , a figure that intensifies the debate over the prison .
The Pentagon report on the released detainees remains classified and officials refused to discuss it publicly .
But Pentagon Press Secretary Geoff Morrell acknowledged the numbers had risen since April , when the department said about 74 former detainees -- about 14 % of those released -- had returned to hostile action against the United States .
The Pentagon method for counting former detainees who once again have taken up arms remains contentious .
Conservatives argue that it undercounts the number of terrorists who have returned to the battlefield , whereas liberals say previous lists were inflated and included detainees who were wrongly arrested or were involved in local , not international , disputes .
The new estimate comes on the heels of an announcement by the Obama administration that it would halt Guantanamo transfers to Yemen .
Republicans are pushing for a more expansive moratorium -- in particular , demanding that the U.S. stop sending detainees to Saudi Arabia .

President Obama last year ordered the Guantanamo Bay detention center closed , but the shutdown -- which was to have occurred by this month -- was postponed when the administration encountered difficulties in sending detainees back to their home countries or transferring them elsewhere .
Obama wants to send the remaining detainees to a prison in Thomson , Ill. , the site of a state prison that the administration would like to purchase and operate as a federal prison and military detention center .
The George W. Bush administration released an estimated 500 detainees from Guantanamo Bay .
Obama has transferred several dozen .
Senior members of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula , the group that claimed responsibility for the attempted Christmas Day bombing of a U.S. - bound jetliner , are former detainees at Guantanamo , including Saeed Ali Shahri , a Saudi who is the group ’s second - in - command .

White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said Wednesday that he did n’t know if the decision to halt repatriation of Yemeni detainees had anything to do with the perceived likelihood that they would join up with extremist organizations .
“ We never have a plan to transfer anybody either to a home country or to a third country that we have reason to believe will present a security situation for us or for that country , ” Gibbs said .
Human rights organizations and lawyers for some of the detainees believe the Pentagon ’s recidivism statistics are inflated .
“ I take a jaundiced view of those numbers , ” said attorney Marc Falkoff , whose clients include Guantanamo detainees .
“ They do n’t identify the recidivists or what they did wrong . ”

Although human rights groups have not seen the new Pentagon report , several reviewed the list released in April .
At least two people were placed on that list for making statements critical of the U.S. , critics said .
Another was classified as a recidivist after being arrested for allegedly being involved in an uprising in the predominantly Muslim town of Nalchik , in southern Russia .
“ A guy who was beaten up by the Russians for participating in an armed rebellion -- that is not tantamount to returning to the battlefield to fight Americans , ” said Stacy Sullivan , a counter - terrorism advisor with Human Rights Watch .
But Charles Stimson , a scholar at the conservative Heritage Foundation , criticized the Pentagon list for not including more names .
“ Why is it that nobody is surprised that career criminals have a recidivism rate above 90 % , yet people act with shock and disbelief when committed jihadists have a recidivism rate of 20 % ? ” Stimson said .

Stimson , a former deputy assistant secretary of Defense for detainee operations in the Bush administration , added , “ I have every reason to believe it is very conservative and the actual number is substantially higher than 20 % . ”

Paying drug addicts to be sterilised is exploitative and wrong , say critics of just such a scheme that runs in the US .
Jane Beresford talks to the woman behind Project Prevention .
If you call Project Prevention 's helpline it's likely that Barbara Harris , the founder of this US based organisation , will answer the phone .
A warm and vivacious grandmother , her aim is to give $ 300 to as many drug and alcohol addicted women as possible .
The deal ?
That they receive long term contraception or sterilisation to prevent them having children she believes they are unable or unwilling to care for .
Funded through private donations , her organisation is non-profit making .
Project Prevention , started in 1997 , says it has paid money out to 3,242 addicts , or clients as it prefers to call them .
Most of them were women and 1,226 were permanently sterilised .
Thirty - five men have had vasectomies .
Barbara Harris and family , including her four adopted children
To get the money people have to show evidence that they have been arrested on narcotic offences , or provide a doctor 's letter confirming they use drugs .
Fresh documents are then required to show the medical procedure has actually taken place .
Ms Harris is driven by her own experience .
She fostered , and then adopted , four children born to the same crack - addicted woman in Los Angeles .
Taylor was the second she took in .
" He could n't keep food down and his eyes looked like they were going to bulge out of his head , " she says .
" Noise bothered him , light bothered him , he just could n't sleep .
FIND OUT MORE ...
You can hear Fergal Keane talking to Barbara Harris on Taking a Stand , on Tuesday , February 9 , on Radio 4 at 0900 GMT .
Or listen to it BBC iPlayer .
" My husband and I had to take shifts with him .
He would sleep 10 minutes , wake up screaming .
I was just angry at his mom , I thought how could somebody do this to a baby ? "
Her stand has drawn fierce opposition .
Critics , such as US group National Advocates for Pregnant Women ( NAPW ) , accuse Ms Harris of spreading " dangerous propaganda " .
They say what she does is social engineering , defining one category of people - addicts - as unsuitable to have children .
The scheme has been compared to eugenic sterilisation in the US during the 1930s and the Nazis ' programme of eugenics , which led to the extermination of Jews and the murder of many gypsies , the mentally ill , and homosexuals .
Such comparisons are rejected by Ms Harris , who says the criticisms do not concern her .
" It does n't matter , " she says .
" I 'll do anything I have to do to prevent babies from suffering .
My heart is with the children .
I do n't believe that anybody has the right to force their addiction on another human being . "
Chance after chance
She has also been accused of being racist , targeting poor black communities with her promotional campaigns .
Ms Harris says this is ironic as she is married to a black man .
" I have a large family and I 'm the only white face in my family .
We have 10 kids and they are all black , some are bi-racial .
It 's not about race to me . "
And according to their own figures , which have n't been independently verified , over half Project Prevention 's clients are white .
Offering money to addicts is clearly not a solution to the problem , say critics .
Ms Harris herself admits the money she pays out is probably spent on drugs .
So why not use her resources to lobby for measures to help stop women turning to drugs in the first place - or better treatment programmes when they do ?
Critics have accused Ms Harris of exploiting addicts " I do a survey on every one that comes into the programme , " she says .
" Most of them started using drugs when they were 11 , 12 , 13 years old .
And all of them have been in and out of drug treatment programmes , in and out , in and out .
" So people tell me that I should be focusing on drug treatment not birth control but drug treatment is just a gamble you know .
Women go in there , they get off drugs , they go back on drugs but that does n't keep them from getting pregnant .
" If they feel so strongly about it then they need to start an organisation that does what they are telling me to do .
I am concentrating on women who are addicted to drugs who are getting pregnant over and over again .
That is really my focus . "
Organisations like NAPW do n't deny the problems of mothers and fathers who are addicted , but argue that many do get clean and become loving parents of healthy children .
Also , having a family is one of the most valued parts of many people 's lives .
By removing that , or the possibility of it , does she not remove a powerful incentive for an addicted person to get clean : the hope of that better life ?
' Heartbroken '
" These women have a chance every time they give birth to a child , " says Ms Harris .
" They are told if they go into drug treatment they can get their child back .
They are given chance after chance after chance .
" And drugs are more important , but at the very least we can stop them from giving birth to children whose lives may end up the same as theirs . "
She takes an extremely hard line , but says she does feel sympathy for the mothers living in poverty .
" If anybody believes that these women having multiple babies that are taken away is a good thing for these women , they are wrong , " she says .
She talks of one woman who had 13 children taken into care before she finally got off drugs .
When she was clean she was unable to contact any of them .
" She was heartbroken .
She did n't know where they were , they were gone " .

None of the men or women who receive the money are forced to approach Project Prevention .
The critics seem to have little regard for the children who either live in neglectful homes or are taken into care .
Any adult is free to be an addict if they choose but they should not be able to subject their children to addiction and more life outcomes .
Angela Willson , Oxford , UK
Part of me completely agrees that there are some people out there who should not be able to have children , they cannot afford to look after them and some times do not want them either .
Personally , I have never wanted kids and have been met with a negative attitude from friends , family and even health professionals when I have asked about sterilisation .
Of course I understand that if you are under the influence of any substance you can make decisions that you live to regret .
Surely it would be better not to have kids you do n't want and then look into adoption later in life than having a child that will end up suffering because you did n't really want it or cannot afford to keep it .
Boris , Ilminster , Somerset Typical mudslinging by her detractors , I note .
I do n't remember the nazis giving the subjects of their eugenics policy either the choice or any sort of benefit for being exterminated .
If that is the best argument which can be marshalled against this lady , it suggests that she is probably in the right .
Dr J , West Yorkshire UK
No , they should be given help to reform , not be permanently deformed
Keith Waters , Ely Fully agree .
There needs to be an economic incentive to prevent babies being born into what are essentially hopeless conditions .
We spend millions on social care after the child is born , paying someone so they can spend the money on cigarettes / alcohol / drugs is fine PROVIDING they in return have no more children .
Sounds like a win - win to me .
J Mullins , Brentwood , Essex
We need a sensible debate about this sort of thing .
It seems to me that the women who breed the most are often the least suitable people to bring up children .
The cycle goes on and society does n't want and can't afford the results
Richard , Cardiff People quite rightly call this social engineering , but the current tax and benefit system is a form of social engineering as well .
This particular " experiment " states that all people who are biologically able to have children should be allowed to have children .
I do n't think this argument has any more validity than Project Prevention 's one .
Let 's have a proper discussion about child rearing , rather than slinging the Eugenics accusation at anybody who dares to commit to a solution .
Graham Halsey , London Reprehensible .
This is coming from the right place in her head , but is skewed by her own experience and also the general attitude in the USA that people on drugs are BAD PEOPLE .
It 's the same with their jail policy which has a 0 percent rehabilitation rate mainly because they do n't rehabilitate offenders .
It 's clearly exploitation and an attempt at social engineering which will clearly fail because it does not solve the underlying socio- economic problems that drug abuse is created by or creates .
Krystan Honour , Leeds Seven years ago I got clean after finding out I was pregnant with my first daughter .
I am the only woman I 've ever met that got and stayed clean for a pregnancy .
I know that I am an exception to the norm .
In my years of using I witnessed much pain and suffering inflicted on children with addict parents , ranging from neglect to emotional , physical and even sexual abuse .
Mrs. Harris is nothing short of a hero and the work that she 's doing is truly a blessing .
Addicts do n't abuse substances because they innocently tried them once and became hopeless slaves .
Addicts use in an attempt to compensate for a fundamental lacking and the truth is that most of them are n't going to change anytime soon , if at all .
Anyone that would criticize Mrs. Harris ' work obviously has little to no personal experience to speak from .

The contraceptive is available only on prescription A recently licensed type of emergency contraception may offer women protection from pregnancy even when taken five days after sex .
Scottish researchers found that ulipristal acetate worked well after the three - day limit of the most commonly used drug , levonorgestrel .
At present ulipristal - unlike levonorgestrel - is only available with a prescription .
The British Pregnancy Advisory Service welcomed the study .
Emergency contraception uses hormones to either prevent the release of an egg by the ovary in the hours after sex , or stop it implanting into the the womb .
Levonorgestrel is available from pharmacies , either with a prescription , or sold directly to over - 16s .
It offers a longer time window for use than the traditional , emergency contraception pill
Ann Furedi , BPAS
A study by specialists working for NHS Lothian tested the effectiveness of levonorgestrel and ulipristal ( which was licensed for use last year ) using a sample of more than 1,600 women from the UK , Ireland and the USA .
A total of 2.6 % of the levonorgestrel group became pregnant despite taking the drug , compared with 1.8 % in the ulipristal group .
In a much smaller group of women who received emergency contraception more than three days after sex , there were no pregnancies among women who had taken ulipristal compared with three pregnancies among those taking levonorgestrel .
The levels of side effects were roughly the same in both two drugs .
' Time window '
However , researchers said that the newer drug cannot be sold ' over - the - counter ' at pharmacies because it did not yet have the established safety record of levonorgestrel .
Ann Furedi , chief executive of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service described the new type of drug as " exciting news " .
She said : " It offers a longer time window for use than the traditional , emergency contraception pill .
" Different hormones are involved to the ones traditionally used in contraception , so it may be that these will prove to have other contraceptive uses in future .
" However , accessibility is key to the uptake of any time - sensitive medication and since this pill is not currently available over - the - counter and is significantly more expensive to buy than the traditional ' morning after pill ' , it may be that many women who could benefit from it are not able to access it .

Still on the road with a Vaio P instead of a full - on computer , so I 'll be brief : Amazon.com can kiss my ass .
Shorter version : they 're engaging in monopolistic practices that damn well ought to be illegal , in an attempt to use their near - monopoly position to fuck over authors and bring publishers to heel .
Longer version : google on " Amazon " and " Macmillan " .
Hint : Tor , who publish my Merchant Princes books , are part of Macmillan .
And I 've got a new book in that series coming out in six weeks ' time .
Srsly .
They can fuck right off .
As of now , I 'm not sending them any more trade .
If you follow the ' buy my books ' links in the sidebar to the right , you 'll notice that they do n't go to Amazon any more .
This is the third time I 've done this in 12 months , and this time it 's personal — they 've gone too far .
A full , detailed explanation of the story behind the current pissing match will follow on Sunday or Monday , but right now I 'm too livid to type and I do n't want to break my netbook .

Fun facts
The military had spies in the White House during the Nixon administration .
Alexander Haig , a general , ran the country for all practical purposes while Nixon melted down .
Other little known facts :
1 . Haig controlled the White House safe that held the notorious Watergate tapes which brought Nixon down
2. Bob Woodward , the famous Washington Post journalist who broke the Watergate story , was a Yale grad , a Navy officer , a likely NSA officer , and a briefer to Alexander Haig when he was in the military .
Small world is n't it .
For more info on this see the book " Silent Coup " by Gerald and Deborah Strober .
It 's a distinct possibility that the US military wanted to get rid of Nixon and went ahead and did it .
Some advocate that going barefoot is better for the health and strength of your feet .

Today we 're going to let our dreadlocks down and take a rational , science - based perspective on a trend that seems , at face value , like just another nonsense hippie claim from the " anything natural is good , anything modern is immoral " crowd :
The idea that we'd all be better off being barefoot .
Whether you run marathons or give boardroom presentations , barefoot advocates claim that barefoot , the way we evolved to walk and run , relieves and prevents orthopedic injuries .
I 'll freely confess that the first time I heard this claim I scoffed , it bears so many of the red flags of pseudoscience .
These red flags include the implication of a medical / industrial conspiracy to keep us injured by selling us expensive shoes and orthopedic treatments , and of course the ever - present all - natural fallacy .
But what grabbed my attention was that I also noted that products like expensive running shoes also sport a major red flag that I 'm keenly aware of .
Until extremely recently in the history of our species , nobody had expensive running shoes , or even any shoes at all , and we did just fine .
I 'm reminded of how I always smirk when I see new parents paying double for special baby apple juice in the supermarket :
Even today , most babies in the world are lucky to get a twig and a dirt clod to eat each day , yet they grow up fine .
Do I , the product of millions of years of evolution creating a bipedal animal optimized for walking and running barefoot on the savannah , really need a $ 100 pair of super - duper running shoes to make my feet work properly ?
My default answer for such questions , based on evolution , is " probably not " .
So I believe this barefoot question does deserve a really close look .
Logically , the argument in favor of going barefoot — both for everyday locomotion and for athletes — is a compelling one .
It is a fact that that 's how our feet evolved to work .
Record setting runners like Zola Budd and Abebe Bikila have proven that barefooters are perfectly capable of competing at the highest levels of the sport , no shoes needed .
A friend of mine visited Africa and brought back pictures of the feet of some guy who never wore shoes his whole life .
They did n't much look like human feet , more like great big thick gray leather pads .
He could probably walk on any kind of surface at any temperature without the slightest inconvenience .
And forget worrying about arch support ; he had no discernible arches .
If you do n't mind looking like a hobbit , his way of life might not be so bad .
Go anywhere , anytime , with no concerns and no stability problems .
After all , that 's exactly how the overwhelming majority of Homo sapiens have lived their entire lives , throughout our entire 500,000 year history , and how some do still today .
There are quite a few websites advocating the barefoot way of life ( like Barefooters.org and RunningBarefoot.org ) .
Most of the benefits they tout have to do with freedom , comfort , and the carefree lifestyle .
But they also cite some health benefits .
One 1949 study published in The Journal of the National Association of Chiropodists found that bare feet avoid most risks of foot fungus .
Over 100 Chinese rickshaw coolies were interviewed , all of whom trotted all day every day on hard pavement pulling a rickshaw with bare feet , and aside from some temporary pain and swelling when they began their careers , none reported any foot problems .
The study concluded " Shoes are not necessary for healthy feet and are the cause of most foot troubles , " though it does appear that this conclusion is probably premature , based on this data alone .
Ill - fitting and restrictive footgear was claimed to be particularly at fault , but since modern Nikes are not best described as " ill - fitting and restrictive " , it may be hard to translate the 1949 conclusion to today 's runners .
The principal medical claim put forward by the barefoot proponents is that wearing shoes weakens the muscles in your foot , through disuse .
While this sounds like it should be obviously true , it does not appear to have been thoroughly studied or proven .
And there 's a good argument that the opposite might be true .
When you wear a shoe with a sole of average thickness , around 22 mm , the lateral leverage angle on your ankle is significantly increased , which , logically , should make it more prone to injury ; and requires greater strength in the muscles and tendons that stabilize the ankle to compensate .
A search of the literature reveals that most researchers complain of a lack of good studies comparing injury incidence between barefoot runners and shod runners , so it 's premature to make any kind of authoritative statement that either barefoot running , or running shoes , help prevent injuries .
If you hear this claim made by either side , that claim is not yet supported by a good body of research .
But what has been established pretty clearly is that running barefoot keeps you more up on your toes , closer to the stride of animals , while shoes let you strike harder with your heel .
This means ( and nobody really disputes this ) that shoes make you run in an unnatural way ; or at least with a stride that 's notably different from that which our ancestors evolved .
This heel - to - toe stride encouraged by shoes does appear to be correlated with pronation , but the link is not necessarily causal .
It 's easy to imagine how constant landing on the heel could cause cumulative stretching of the ligaments and eventually roll the foot inward toward the arch .
However , whether this cause exists or not , it 's not clear that such pronation is a problem .
There does n't seem to be any proven correlation between pronation and injury incidence .
But the claim that feet are weakened by frequent shoe wearing are everywhere , and are easily believed , since it sounds so logical .
In response , shoe manufacturers have been quietly entering the arena , making less shoelike shoes .
The Vibram FiveFingers is basically a glove for your foot , providing little more than a thin sole to protect you from sharp objects .
Vibram says " Stimulating the muscles in your feet and lower legs will not only make you stronger and healthier , it improves your balance , agility and proprioception . "
The Vivo Barefoot is slightly more conventional looking but has no rigid structure and only a thin puncture - proof sole .
The benefits Vivo claims for going barefoot is that it " Strengthens the muscles in your feet ; realigns your natural posture ; feeling the ground stimulates sensory perception ; and flexes your feet as nature designed . "
All of these claims , I think , have to be regarded as marketing messages .
They are not the result of proven research .
They sound satisfyingly logical , and some of them may well be true ; but at this point , we do n't know that they are .
Yes , we did evolve wearing bare feet , but that does n't necessarily mean it 's the best thing to do .
That evolution has made us into bipeds that walk and run barefoot across the savannah is not a perfect argument that we 're well adapted to do so .
There are many examples in nature of creatures who evolved detrimental traits .
The giraffe 's laryngeal nerve runs all the way down its neck into its chest , loops around its aorta , then runs all the way back up to its larynx ; making it absurdly long and prone to many types of failure .
The Irish elk developed antlers so large that the energy required to grow them exceeded the available food sources and the species became extinct .
The mating ritual of the Kakapo flightless parrot is more likely to attract a predator than a mate .
The retinas in all vertebrate eyeballs are inside - out , creating an unnecessary blind spot .
The list goes on forever .
The point is that evolution does not create perfectly adapted creatures ; it creates adequate creatures .
The human body too is full of evolved points of failure , and we 've learned to fix many of them .
If shoes do indeed improve our ability to walk , they would be just one of many examples where we 've used medical science to improve our bodies ' inherent weaknesses .
Our appendix does n't seem to serve much purpose except to potentially kill us , so we 've developed the appendectomy .
Wisdom teeth try to force too many teeth into too small of a jaw , so we routinely remove them .
Nearly everyone has bad eyes , so we correct our vision .
Orthopedically , our knees ' lateral retinaculum exacerbates many knee problems , so some modern knee surgeries include a routine severing of this structure .
There is other anatomical evidence that the human transition to bipedality is not a very complete one .
Walking upright has left human females with a pelvis that , relative to other primates , does n't allow much room for the birth canal .
This makes giving birth more dangerous for humans than it is for the great apes who knuckle walk .
And then there 's this strange foot we have .
While nearly every other animal on the planet walks on its fingers and toes , we lay one additional segment down and walk on our ankles , and even crawl on our wrists as babies .
Trading one joint for extra surface area was fine for gripping tree branches , but it makes little sense for walking on flat ground .
Among other things , it leaves us with one fewer joint to absorb twists , making us more prone to ankle and knee injuries .
So is there a clear , science - based verdict on the barefoot issue ?
From my research , I conclude that the jury is out ; but any benefit that may be found by either wearing shoes or going barefoot is likely to be small , and to differ widely among different people , based on their habits and their anatomy .
The most interesting revelation , for me , was that barefoot running does indeed appear to be a perfectly viable option for both athletes and casual joggers .
The only real risk is puncture injury , which you can solve by either developing feet like that African guy , or by getting some of those barefoot - wannabe shoes .
Once you get past some initial pain and swelling , similar to what the rickshaw coolies went through , you 're probably no more or less likely to develop any significant injuries than if you were to wear shoes .
Zola Budd , by the way , is long retired but still runs tens miles per day in her native South Africa .
But things have changed for her .
" I no longer run barefoot , " she told the UK Guardian in 2005 .
" As I got older I had injuries to my hamstring .
I found that wearing shoes gives me more support and protection from injuries . "
But hers is only one data point , and is anecdotal .
We just need a few thousand controlled data points before science can make such a declaration .

Money plays a central role to life in EVE .
I ’ve been kind of cavalierly throwing around numbers about money , like in this post about Hulkageddon .
What does 200B ISK in damage actually look like ?
When I lose a Battleship , how much is that setting me back ?
How many Logistics ships could you buy instead of one Dreadnaught ?
Hopefully this diagram will answer some of those questions .
It ’s a really huge image , and I suggest you view it first at a high level to get a sense of the scale , and then zoom in and check out each individual ship .
If you want to buy a copy of your own , or tinker with the source graphics yourself , you can find details here .
I ’ve also tried to explain a bit about what all those different kinds of ships are for .
Hopefully this will be a good reference for when I talk more about blowing up enemy ships , and what the economic implications are for players .
There are a lot of assumptions behind this image .
It ’s actually quite hard to get definitive ship price values , both because prices fluctuate and vary substantially by where in the universe you buy something , and because there is no one way to equip a ship .
This makes my values hardly exact , and I ’ve tried to use the complete lack of significant figures to show how fuzzy they are .
In the end , the values are basically the market value for each hull at Jita , plus the price of the fittings off the TGRADS killboard .
I felt like this was as accurate as I could reasonably get , without doing a really deep survey of average fittings and fitting costs , or a close look at the contract market for fitted ships .
Producing this image has been a much larger project than I expected when I started .
I ’ve leaned a lot on my house - mate Jon Chambers for editorial and graphical advice .
I ’ve also made extensive use of Davik Rendar ’s wonderful renders of EVE ships from the side .
The Marshmallow Test
Guidelines and attitudes to live by
People will often feel inclined to explain to you why the numerous constraints in their lives have prevented them to achieve the their goal .
They have so much else going on in their lives .
A job , a girlfriend , social events to attend .
Time - consuming hobbies .
A car that needs fixing or some other project of critical importance .
Those are the reasons why they 're out of shape or have attained only mediocre results .
For them , the idea of losing body fat or attaining muscle is about time .
The notion that you have to spend hours in the gym and meticulously plan your diet every day is accepted as a truism .
They think that if they could just find enough time , they 'd easily get a physique comparable to a front - cover fitness model .
But life gets in the way .
When a conversation reaches that point , and in my experience it often does , I try to terminate the discussion or switch to another topic .
I have a very low tolerance for such drivel .
Some of my most successful clients are very busy people .
They get in excellent shape , despite managing a business , family and many other obligations .
In fact , I 'm convinced that having too much free time is counterproductive .
Surely it would be logical to assume that unlimited time for cardio , training and cooking would equal better results and make fat loss a walk in the park ?
Not so .
How can this paradox be explained ?
In the early 1970s , a psychologist named Walter Mischel conducted an experiment involving four - year - olds .
He placed each child in a room , where they sat down at a table .
In front of them , a marshmallow .
Mischel then made each child an offer .
He could eat the marshmallow right away or wait for a few more minutes and receive another one .
Almost everyone decided to wait .
Mischel then left the room for twenty minutes .
While a few of the four - year - olds were able to resist the temptation for up to fifteen minutes , many lasted less than one minute .
Others just ate the marshmallow as soon as Mischel left the room .
This was a test of self - control .
If the child wanted to achieve the goal of receiving another marshmallow , then he needed to temporarily ignore his feelings and delay gratification for a few more minutes .
What this study showed was that some children at the early age of four were much better at this than others .
What I found interesting are the strategies the successful children employed in order to endure the experiment .
They kept themselves distracted .
Covered their eyes , played with their hands or just entered a trance - like state where it seemed they were lost in their thoughts .
Their attention was elsewhere .
The failed strategy of the unsuccessful children was the complete opposite of that ; in essence , they fixated on the marshmallow almost as if attempting to stare it down , actively fighting the temptation .
How does this translate to the various strategies used by the fitness crowd ?
When some people are dieting , they are DIETING .
They treat it like a full - time job and they 're in the gym every day , sometimes twice a day .
Their spartan diet is meticulously planned and carefully dispensed throughout the day .
They are the ones that fixate on the marshmallow .
Others take a more balanced approach .
Diet and training is part of their life , but it blends in beautifully .
They are the ones that tries to forget about the marshmallow .
It 's background noise to them .
I 'll give you a concrete example to show you what I mean .
Some people schedule a weekly cheat day , which usually involves a day on the weekend when they can eat what they want .
In practical terms , this often means that they pig out and end up on the couch in a torpor - like state .
This day becomes the high point of their week .
They restrict calories severely throughout the week in order to allow themselves the cheat day .
Their training typically includes hours of cardio .
On Thursday they start planning their shopping list for Saturday and on Friday they lie sleepless in giddy anticipation of the forthcoming food fest .
They are fixating on the marshmallow , making it the center of the world .
I could give you a similar example when it comes to training .
The overly enthusiastic young guy embarking on a 6 - day - split that ends up overtraining and sick or hurt .
He too was fixating on the marshmallow .
The solution then is to stay distracted .
You should n't buy into the myth of what it takes to achieve your goals .
Do n't get me wrong , it takes dedication .
Sweat , yes .
But that needs to be maintained as a regular , long - term commitment .
And that 's impossible to do if you 're constantly thinking about it .
It needs to be part of your daily routine , but it needs to blend in .
Again , background noise and balanced .
Or else you wo n't last .
If you 're too fixated on the marshmallow , you 'll eat it sooner or later .
In this context it means you 'll screw up your diet and / or training , burn out and lose all motivation .
The more physical and mental energy you invest in your training and diet , the more likely you are to fail .
And that 's why some of the busiest people are the most successful ones when it comes to reaching their physique goals .
They have other things to think about . *
Spend too much time focusing on your goal and you will end up sabotaging yourself .
This may not hold much ground in other areas of life where , in order to be successful , focus and time investment is of critical importance ; such as building a business , managing a large corporation or becoming a highly - competitive elite athlete .
But it 's definitely one that applies to diet and strength training for the average Joe .
Stay distracted .
Have hobbies .
Have a life .
If diet and training become the sole focus of your daily routine , the road to your goals will feel like a very long road indeed . *
Commitment and dedication dispensed over a longer time period is superior to more focused efforts .
The latter has a higher rate of failure and greater chance of backfiring on you and is why people fall off the wagon .
This is my personal experience , but it 's also backed up by studies .
A good example of this are the numerous reformed health enthusiasts that pop up after New Year 's Eve .
They go at it hard for a few weeks , but are often back into their old patterns of sporadic training and a sub par diet by February .
Another example is the rebound that many competitors experience after contest dieting .
Avoid this with a balanced approach without extremes .*
Most people will not benefit from more than four training sessions per week when attempting to gain muscle mass . *
The great majority should n't be in the gym more than three times per week when cutting .
You do n't need the gym for cardio .
Go outside .*
Use checkpoints to help you focus on long - term and not short - term progress *
Never attempt to train yourself into a caloric deficit .
Do n't spend hours on the treadmill .
Diet comes first , cardio second .
The dumbest fat loss strategy ever devised is used by people that wake up early in the morning before going to work to do cardio and follow that up with " recovery shake . "
Congratulations , you just wasted two hours of your life .
Cardio is good for cardiovascular health , but most people use cardio as a fat loss tool - and force themselves through regimens that are n't very conducive to their daily routine ( or mental sanity ) .
Next time , skip the shake and the cardio .
Sleep two hours longer , but skip breakfast and fast until lunch time .
This way you can create the same caloric deficit with the added bonus of feeling more rested and having saved more time .
You 'll be much better off . *
Intermittent fasting is an easy way to create a calorie deficit .
Your " cardio " is to stay productive during the fast and work .
If you do n't have a job , work on projects that are important to you .
Learn .
Read books .
Write .
Do n't sit around and brood about your diet or what you have in the fridge .
Final note : I first learned about the marshmallow test in
How We Decide by Jonah Lehrer .
A good read if you 're interested in human behavior and psychology .
It 's interesting to note that the marshmallow test predicted future success in many other areas of life .
When a follow - up study on each child was done twenty years later , it was found that children who waited longer also had better academic success and less behavioral problems than the ones who ate the treat sooner .
You ’ve got to love white people .
They ’re so very white .
Especially in South Africa .
You see , I ’m something of a connoisseur .
One day I woke up , thought about the fact that about 80 % of our country is black , and examined my life .
I looked at the friends that filled my photo albums , the people who had married into my family and my fellow customers at all the bars , clubs and restaurants I frequented .
And I realised I was surrounded by white people .
If Bruce Willis was around this is the point where I would stage whisper to him : “ I see white people — and they do n’t know that they ’re white ! ”
Ah , white people .
I could write reams about the stuff white people like , but somebody already has .
I ’ve run the gamut of white people variations growing up in freshly post - apartheid Pretoria , offering me examples both frightening and hilarious .
From the parents of friends who looked at me over the braai and coolly announced that “ things were better before , ” to the adorable old grannies that would press chilli sauce on me at lunch , assuring mortified friends that “ they like that sort of thing ” .
But it was only later in life , when I came across the “ enlightened ” white person that I discovered my favourite kind … the white liberal .
To catch this particular breed you have to hang out at the right places .
Think Asian fusion restaurants , music festivals and Kloof Street in Cape Town .
To spot them use my handy guide to Stuff White Liberals Say and Do :
White liberals , and white people in general , do n’t think they ’re white .
Growing up in a world where whiteness parades as normality means that you ’re made damn sure at an early age that you ’re black , coloured , Chinese , or anything other .
White people however , especially in South Africa , sort of stumble upon the uncomfortable fact that they ’re also raced individuals late in life , and then spend the rest of the time forgetting it .
You ’ll notice this by how they ’re refer to any white person as a man , woman , girl , boy or child and everyone else by their race , eg .
“ So this black dude walks in … “ .

White liberals never accept that they ’re , you know , white white .
That ’s because generally they were the alternative and misunderstood kids growing up who later went on to litter various media , advertising and entertainment industries with their self - referential pseudo irony .
They ’re so consumed by their perceived sense of otherness within their own race that they ca n’t begin to fathom that they enjoy any sort of position of privilege and power .

In any conversation about apartheid , white liberals will immediately and loudly bring up the fact that their parents were forced to join the army .
As if this fact mitigates generations of economic and political advantage .
As if life is a neat game of tag where you can shout “ Nix ! ” and invoke some sort of blanket amnesty , instead of the messy web of power it really is .

White people are very used to hearing the sound of their own voice .
A white liberal friend once told me he had been to an academic conference where a paper was presented on the best responses to white guilt .
It was lauded for positing silence , and listening , as a solution .
I waited to respond to this interesting idea but my friend spoke about it without pause for about ten minutes without allowing me a word in edgewise .
Eventually I left mid-sentence to get a drink .

White liberals who love Africa are the funniest .
Look for the pale male donning an African print shirt and rocking out to Johnny Clegg .
To be honest , the only actual black man I know who wears African shirts is Madiba .
And he ’s , you know , Madiba .
Funny thing about this kind is that they ’ll wax lyrical about the African dream but never quite bring themselves to date an actual black woman .
I guess they leave that to the European tourists .

White liberals never , ever , think it ’s weird that they have no good black friends .
In fact , if you bring this up they ’ll think you ’re being racist .
Then they ’ll whinge about how hard it is to meet black people .
So there you go .
Happy hunting .
To be fair there are lots of good things about white liberals .
There ’s a reason I ’m friends with so many of them .
And , of course , not all liberals are as annoying as I ’ve described .
In fact I feel really bad for all the perfectly aware and sensitive white people out there who have the impossible task of making up for the rest of the race .
So help them out .
Go hug an annoying white liberal today .
And remind them that they ’re white .
Read Verashni ’s response to the uproar this column caused here .
A cougar attacked a B.C. family 's golden retriever Saturday night after the dog stepped in between the cougar and an 11 - year - old boy .
Police , who later shot the cougar dead , credited the 18 - month - old dog -- Angel -- for saving the boy 's life .
Austin Forman had gone to retrieve some firewood outside his family 's home in Boston Bar , about 200 kilometres northeast of Vancouver .
That 's when the cougar began to charge across the yard at the boy .
" I was really scared .
At first , I did n't know it was a cougar .
I thought it was another dog , " Austin told CTV News on Sunday .
" As soon as it went underneath the light , I saw that it was a cougar .
I knew at that moment , I had to go inside . "
Angel , who had been at Austin 's side , engaged the cougar , which was slightly larger than Angel .
Austin , meanwhile , ran into the house and screamed , " A cougar is eating Angel ! " his mother , Sherri Forman , recalled in a phone interview with ctvbc.ca .
Forman said she had to get Austin to repeat himself a few times because he was so shaken .
Forman said she looked out the window .
She could n't see anything but could hear Angel wimpering .
" To feel so helpless , I knew I could n't do anything , " she said .
She called her father - in - law , who told her to call 9 - 1 - 1 .
RCMP Const .
Chad Gravelle was nearby and was on scene within a minute .
The officer found the cougar under the back porch and heard the dog cry out as the cougar chewed on its neck , police said .
The officer fired two rounds into the cougar 's rear end , but the cougar continued its attack .
The officer closed in to within five feet and shot the cougar again , killing it .
Even after it was killed , the cougar 's jaws were clenched on Angel 's face , Forman said .
Angel was silent for a few moments but then took in a big gasp of air and got up .
Forman said Angel was recovering Sunday with a local animal caregiver .
The dog has numerous puncture wounds around her head and neck , as well as a swollen eye .
Forman said before the attack , Austin had come into the house to tell the family how cute it was that Angel had been following him around .
" She must 've known something was up , " Forman said .
Last week , when Angel was frolicking in the snow , family members called her a " snow angel , " Forman said .
" Now , she 's our guardian angel . "

One year after his election , Barack Obama 's approval rating is lower at this stage than for any US president since Eisenhower .
So why has the optimism surrounding his victory disappeared so suddenly ?
The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Friday 29 January 2010
The name of a no- alcohol drinking spot that was set up in Lexington app­eared as All Bar None ; the " All " was wrong
Every Wednesday at 4.30 pm they come : a small steady human trickle rolling down a ravine in Prestonsburg , eastern Kentucky ­towards the Town Branch church .
They come in pick - ups , on foot , alone and with families .
Some stop for just a few minutes .
Others linger .
They come for food and warm second - hand clothes .
They come because desperation in this part of America has become a routine part of life .
More than a quarter of the families in Prestonsburg live in poverty ; half of the children in Floyd County , where it is situated , are on food stamps .
This ­Appalachian coal mining area has never been rich .
But no one can remember when it has ever been this poor either .
It sits on the old Route 23 – the country music highway of which Dwight Yoakam ( a Floyd Country native ) sang in Readin ' , Rightin ' , Route 23 .
It was the road that took people north to factory jobs in places such as Detroit and Cleveland and " the good life they had never seen " .
Now those cities are broke and there 's nowhere left to go .
" We 're getting more and more ­people coming here as time goes by , " says Tom Price , who helps administer the church 's Feed My Sheep pantry .
" The bottom 's just fallen out of it all . "
He blames it on Barack Obama .
" Is there a direct correlation [ between Obama 's victory and the region 's bad times ] ?
I do n't know .
But I do know a lot of people are hurting . "
A week may be a long time in politics .
But a year has not been enough for the Democratic president to meet the expectations of his candidacy , deal with the situation he inherited or defuse the barbed charges of his detractors .
For many the change that Obama promised when he was inaugurated a year on Wednesday has ended up being a change for the worse .
Unemployment is rising , houses prices are falling , unpopular wars are still raging .
After 100 days only Ronald Reagan had higher approval ratings for his first few months in office than Obama .
But as his first year draws to a close nobody has had lower ratings at this stage since Dwight Eisenhower .
Keith Bartley , Floyd County 's Democratic chairman , says one key reason why Obama 's such a tough sell here is because of the effect of his cap and trade policy on the coal industry .
Lt Governor Daniel Mongiardo , the Democratic frontrunner in Kentucky 's senatorial race later this year , says he would not want Obama to come and stump for him on the campaign trail , particularly because of his environmental policies .
" With some of the positions he has taken , especially on coal , no .
He certainly can't come into eastern or western Kentucky and help .
Nor would I want him to . "
But the disenchantment goes beyond one region or one industry .
The official narrative of Obama 's inauguration – the fairytale most of the US media told itself and that the international community wanted to believe – was that after a ­rancourous campaign a divided country came together to celebrate the historic election of its first African - American president .
The reality was always quite different .
The editor of the Grayson County News Gazette in Leitchfield , a small town 230 miles west of Prestonsburg , recalls that the day after the election much of the area wore sombre faces .
The week he was elected gun sales across the country leapt about 50 % compared with the same period the year before .
For all of his aspirations for bipartisanship , after the first three months Obama had the most polarised early job approval ratings of any president in the past four decades .
The gap between how Democrats and Republicans rated him at this stage was greater than George Bush Jr's in 2001 and twice as high as Richard Nixon 's during the height of the Vietnam war in 1969 .
This was partly because Democrats loved him so much – but it was also because so few Republicans were willing to give him a hearing .
Obama did n't create that partisan divide , he inherited it .
Not only has he not been able to cure it , but his presence seems to have exacerbated it .
Truth be told they never really liked Obama much in Floyd County .
He won only 5 % of the vote against Hillary Clinton 's 94 % in the primaries .
But until recently they did love Democrats .
In the 2004 election John Kerry won the county with a 25 - point margin .
In 2008 , John McCain took it by 2 points – the first time a Republican had won Floyd in living memory .
That 's to say following hurricane Katrina , the failure in Iraq , the collapse of the economy and the unravelling in Afghanistan , a sizeable portion of Floyd 's voters took a look at Obama and decided that this time , for the first time , they would turn their back on the Democrats .
Back at the Feed My Sheep food ­pantry Cindy Hernandez has just picked up her groceries and is rifling through the secondhand clothes .
She has no doubts about why Obama struggled in a county that is 98 % white .
" That 's because Obama was black .
Let 's get real , " she says with a laugh .
" You mean people are prejudiced in eastern Kentucky ? " asks Tom Nelson , the church 's pastor who seems genuinely upset by what she said .
" You do not believe that ? " replies Hernandez .
" I know some are , but not altogether , " says Nelson .
Fearing I should get the wrong impression Nelson suggested I talk to Price .
" I voted for McCain , " says Price .
" Because , well I voted for the old white guy .
At least he 's American . "
A few days earlier , the chairman of the Republican party in Jackson County , Arkansas , insisted electing Obama is destroying America in the same way electing Nelson Mandela destroyed South Africa .
" Handing it over to the wrong people . "
To ask where racism ends and politics begins in all of this is to set up a false dichotomy – America 's politics has always been steeped in race and racism is a political force .
The psychic scars of centuries are not removed in one election or as a result of one person .
Indeed they may be deepened and made even more raw as a result of them .
The movement that has emerged to oppose him is almost exclusively white .
In Little Rock , Arkansas , a city that is 40 % black in a state that is 80 % white , an anti-tax Tea party rally of several hundred had not one black attendee – apart from an anti-abortion speaker .
The doubts they have cast about his Christianity and his birthplace ( some claim Obama was n't born in America ) are really proxies for race – a bid to cast him as the ultimate " other " .
At an anti-healthcare reform rally in Washington in September several racist placards were spotted .
One bore a picture a lion and the words , " The zoo has an African lion and the White House has a lyin ' African " ; another said " ' Cap ' Congress and ' trade ' Obama back to Kenya " .
But while racism might inform the intensity and shape the nature of the attacks on Obama they do not drive them .
Obama 's administration has raised taxes on the rich , expanded public spending , pledged to withdraw troops from Iraq and argued – if only halfheartedly – for universal healthcare .
Conservatives have good reasons to be against him that have nothing to do with race .
" It 's hard to specify a single source for the opposition , " says Rev Wendell Griffin , a Baptist pastor and judge in Arkansas .
" Part of the opposition to Obama is philosophical .
There is in every society a strand of thought that glories in the myth of rugged individualism [ and ] he challenges that notion .
He believes that the idea of a government is to have a concern not just for the individual but for the society as a whole .
Some people do n't like that . "
Griffin went on to list racism , economic desperation and the fact that he is no longer an underdog as other reasons .
His rightwing dissenters may be eccentric and racially exclusive but they have also proved highly effective .
They have a populist message that excoriates Bush and the bank bailouts as well as Obama and a TV channel – Fox News – to which they are devoted and which is happy to promote their work .
A recent poll showed that if the Tea party – a ­protest movement set up earlier this year to rally opposition to the stimulus bill and " big government " – were a party it would beat the Republican party .
Every week a " 9/12 " group meet at the non-alcoholic All Bar None in Lexington , Kentucky .
This was an initiative started by Fox presenter Glenn Beck , in order to return America to the values of patriotism and godliness that he says America embraced the day after 11 September .
Fourteen showed up the night I was there .
A straw poll revealed that none of them blamed Obama exclusively for America heading in the wrong direction , with all preferring to blame the entire political establishment .
Half believed Obama is a Muslim , just one thought he 's a Christian and the overwhelming majority thought he was a communist , socialist and Marxist .
None believe that he was born in America ; most said they did not know .
" A lot of information about Obama 's background is missing , " says Abigail Billings .
" The media in America is not doing any research .
They 're not asking any questions .
They 're not reporting any longer .
They 're now opinionated talk shows .
They 're no longer offering factual news coverage . "
They all watch Fox News .
Many on America 's left are also ­disgruntled with Obama .

A Detailed Account of the Life Story of the late Sun Lun Gu Kyaung Sayadaw ( This detailed life story is a record of what was heard from the mouth of the late Sun Lun Gu kyaung Sayadaw of Myingyan . )
It is the inherent nature of an Ariyā to be obsessed with a persistent desire for escape from the perilous round of rebirths , characterized by constant perishing of mental and material phenomena .
One such Ariyā to be , faring in SaÑsarÈ ’s innumerable existences , happened to be born as a parrot during the time of Kassapa Buddha who appeared in the Bhadda - kappa ( the present world ) which is blessed by Five Buddhas .
One day , the parrot happened to meet Kassapa Buddha .
Being endowed with innate wisdom , he knew that it was a Noble Personage .
He was inspired to pay homage to the Buddha .
He offered a fruit to the Buddha respectfully with his wings touching each other above his head .
The Buddha out of compassion accepted the bird ’s gift and said , “ May all your wishes come to fulfillment ” .
The parrot watched the Buddha with revered eyes as the Buddha departed , his little heart full of joy , uttering “ O , what a good deed I have done ! ”
Since the donee was the Buddha himself and the donor made his gift with strong conviction , the resultant was bound to be fruitful .
The parrot was reborn in the good destinations of the seven planes of sensual existence under glorious circumstances .
After faring in a number of Celestial realms , he was reborn in the human world as a great Tikicchaka Physician ( N.B .
The Sayadaw once said : “ Those who had met me during my existence as a great Physician will come to me now and take up the practice of Dhamma under me . ” )
During the time of Gotama Buddha , the great Physician was reborn as the famous Barr-mai Sayadaw , mentor to King Man|hā of Thaton , Thuwanna Bhumi , the great patron of the Buddha ’s Teaching .
After passing away from that existence , the future Sun Lun Sayadaw was reborn as a child of U Thant and Daw Tok of Sun Lun village in the southern part of Myingyan Township in Upper Burma .
( N.B. During the British administration the country was divided into Upper Burma and Lower Burma , the upper region being still under Burmese King . )
At the time of conception , the father had a dream in which a man of noble appearance came to his house and asked for permission to stay in the house .
U
Thant told that man , not to stay with his family because he was very poor .
Although he refused many times , the stranger insisted to stay , and at last had to agree .
The family took the dream as auspicious .
The mother Daw Tok after nine months of pregnancy , in the tenth month give birth to the child , the future - Sun Lun Sayadaw , at the few minutes before 4 am on the second waning day of Tabaung ( March ) in 1239 ME , which was the year 2421 of the Sāsanā Era .
The child had a particularly bright appearance .
At the time of naming him , with the usual washing of the hair , in view of the good omens , he was named Maung Kyaw Din ( Meaning Master Famous ) .
( U Thant and Daw Tok had three children ; Ma Thinn , Ko Kyaw Din and Ko Aung Khaing ) .
Ko Kyaw Din was placed under the Min-Kyaung Sayadaw of Myingyan for his education .
He was a dull pupil and did not get far in his studies .
So his father U Thant found him a menial post like his , in the office of the Deputy Commissioner of Myingyan .
When Ko Kyaw Din grew up , he married Ma Shwe Yi of his native village .
The couple begot four children but three died in infancy and only a son by the name of Ko Shein ( a ) Ko Kan Nyunt survived to this day .
Ko Kyaw
Din thought that his work as an office - boy in government office held no good prospects and resigned the job at the age of thirty .
He worked as a cultivator in the family estate , a dry patch of land .
One day , one U San Tin , said to achieved occult powers and was patronized by the ( four ) Great Guardian Kings of Catumahārāja DevÈs Realm , came to him and recited some strange prophetic words without any context .
His words roughly might be translated that :
“ Amai Bok ’s skeins got tangled , who ’s there to clear up this mess ?
The shuttle moves along amidst the threads of skeins .
The ruined stump of the pagoda emits rays !
Ma Khway is dressed in the beautiful longyi of ‘ Pondaw ’ design with a green fringe and a checkered blue .
The weaver ’s gear made of ‘ Kyun - bo ’ teak puts forth a sound that can be heard from a distance of ten thousand Y|janās . ”
U San Tin then explained his words as follows :
“ The skeins that are tangled get entangled when put to the loom , is n’t it ? ”
“ Yes , of course ”
“ That being so , U Kyaw Din , the tangled skein called Avijjā ( Ignorance ) by far more tangled than the skeins , will have to be disentangled by you with Sati ( Mindfulness ) .
A weaving factory will appear south of Sun Lun Village .
When it does , you will have to promote the Sāsanā at Kyun - bo - pin - kone .
When you take up the work of promoting the Sāsanā , there will be two teak pillars there .
The meaning of the old stump of the pagoda emitting rays fore - tells the emergence of practice of the Buddha ’s Teaching that has so far been forgotten by the people ” .
“ Oh , all humbug , my friend , ” retorted U Kyaw Din .
“ Just wait and see ” said U San Tin .
That year , they purchased another plot of cultivable land .
At the beginning of the raining season U Kyaw Din and Daw Shwe Yi went to their field to clear it up to start ploughing .
U Kyaw Din said to his wife : “ We shall sow sessamum in our field this year .
If we reap a yield of fifty baskets we shall offer a thousand lights at the pagoda ” .
Daw Shwe
Yi replied , “ Why fifty ?
If we get forty baskets we will make an offering of one thousand lights ! ”
“ Good , Ma Shwe Yi , ” said the husband , let us be true to our word .
At our offering we wo n’t have a procession with music as is the custom .
In case the girls in the procession got their jewellery lost , it would mean botheration for us .
Let ’s make it a simple affair ” .
A few days later , they sowed sessamum seeds in the field .
When the seeds sprouted there was no rain at the beginning of the rainy season and the tiny plants withered .
Fortunately , they survived till the rains come .
Other fields were not so fortunate : the plants did not survive .
U Kyaw Din ’s fields yielded forty baskets of sessamum - exactly forty !
True to their words , they pressed the sessamum into oil .
Daw Shwe
Yi proposed that nine viss of the oil be marked for offering of one thousand lights ; nine viss would be offered to the SaÑghÈ .
U Kyaw Din asked her how many bhikkhus would be the donees .
Daw Shwe
Yi said “ four Bhikkhus , and two viss to be donated to each .
The remaining one viss should see to the congregation at the ceremony ” .
And U Kyaw Din agreed .
On the full moon day of Thadingyut ( October ) 1281 ME , the couple made their light offering at the pagoda south east of the village .
At the congregation where they listened to the sermon of the SaÑghā and poured the consecration water .
They gave to their guests pickled tea leaves , cheroots and betel - as was the custom .
Meantime , U Kyaw Din was at the pagoda watching the burning little lamps of oil .
He observed how the tips of the wicks turned black and the oil boiled .
The sight moved his mind greatly .
So much so that goose - flesh appeared on his skin .
He was shaking violently .
“ Oh , it ’s very extraordinary , ” he thought himself .
If I were to make a wish now , my wish will become fulfilled . ”
He felt convinced about it .
So he made the wish : “ May I become a Bhikkhu .
May I teach Dhamma to the people .
May they follow my example in the practice as instructed by me . ”
Having made the wish whole heartedly , it occurred to him thus , I am quite illiterate : how shall I teach Dhamma as a Bhikkhu ? ”
At that time , he was not only illiterate but also had not heard Dhamma taught by others .
He had no knowledge about the various types of Enlightenment such as Pacceka Buddha - hood , the Chief Discipleship , the Great Discipleship and Ordinary Discipleship .
So he simple wished for Bhikkhu - hood .
Anyway , he was immensely pleased with himself for having spoken out his wish before the Buddha and was anticipating fully of its fulfillment .
It was a decidedly prosperous year for him .
He had heard people say that a marked prosperity forebodes death .
Further , he had heard them says that when one ’s horoscope happen to fall under the planet Saturn , one is liable to meet his death .
And he knew that his horoscope was then falling under Saturn .
Myingyan at that juncture was infected with the epidemic of plague ( which came every year then ) .
May be I might fell a victim to plague .
In that case , he felt he had very little store of merit while being full of demerit .
His good fortune that year particularly made him uneasy .
He was obsessed with death .
It was during those uneasy days that on a month of Tabaung ( March ) night U Kyaw Din dreamt a dream .
In the dream , U Kyaw Din saw a Buddha Image come into the temporary pandal in front of his house and was making certain movements , smiling .
U Kyaw Din said to his wife , “ Just hand me that rice bowl .
I will offer the rice to the Buddha with my hands . ”
As he was in the act of making his rice offering to the Buddha , the Buddha Image said to him , “ O , what a fuss !
I am talking to you only for now .
I shall not talk to you in future . ”
At that U Kyaw Din woke up from his dream .
He found himself trembling violently .
He took the dream as an omen of his impending death .
He roused up his wife from her sleep and told her about the dream .
He urgently asked for some candles .
Daw Shwe
Yi told him to keep the dream to himself and fetched some candles for him .
He took the candles and went straight to the Pagoda where he met his boyhood friend U Chi Daing .
“ What brings you here ( at this unearthly hour ) , ” asked U Chi Daing ?
“ I come to offer light to the Buddha , ” replied U Kyaw Din .
“ I am terribly afraid of death ! ” U Chi Daing asked him of his date of birth and made some calculations .
Then he said , “ The horoscope says that this year your family is liable to lose a two - legged ( meaning a human being in astrological parlance ) .
U Kyaw Din said , “ Dear fellow , do n’t try to frighten me .
I am already dying with fear of death ! ”
To this U Chi Daing replied : “ Look here Kyaw Din , I am telling you just what the horoscope says . ”
U Kyaw Din was definitely shaken .
He made an earnest request to his friend , “ Old boy , let me join your daily worshipping sessions .
Call me every day . ”
Meanwhile , the two friends were joined by U San Tin.
U Kyaw Din also begged U San Tin to call him for the daily worshipping sessions .
Not long afterwards , U Kyaw Din and U San Tin were dozing off while in conversation on the floor of the front part of U Kyaw Din ’s place .
Then U San Tin said , “ These multitudes ( sentient beings ) are in as pitiable plight .
They are suffering in the three kinds of scourge ( War , Famine and Disease ) .
They are falling off from an abyss after losing their way . ”
U Kyaw Din rejoined him saying , “ True it is , we all have lost our way and are falling into an abyss .
If only we got the right direction , I am prepared to take it . ”
To this U San Tin said : “ The Right direction is not hard to find .
Just wait at the cross-roads .
Someone who can show the Right Direction will appear . ” U Kyaw Din could not understand what U San Tin said and asked him what he meant .
U San Tin did not answer , he was dozing off again .
U Kyaw Din shook him and asked again .
U San Tin said , “ Do n’t be afraid , there are the Triple Gems for us , the Buddha , the Dhamma and the SaÑghā are our refuge . ”
U San Tin ’s words of encouragement did not bring solace to U Kyaw Din who was deeply agitated with the prospect of death .
He felt that his fear would cause him great harm .
He thought of curing his mental sickness .
He confided with his friend , “ U San Tin , my mind is sorely agitated , I feel that I am heading for a great misfortune .
I need to cure my mind of this mental sickness .
I think of going about it like this ; I will put up a pandal in front of my house as I saw in my dream .
I will have a Buddha Image properly arranged there and we shall all gather together for regular worshipping sessions .
That way I hope I can get happiness . ”
“ You please yourself , friend , ” said U San Tin .
“ Then come early tomorrow morning .
Let us gather some bamboo and put up a pandal . ”
On the following evening , elderly people of the village gathered at U Kyaw Din ’s place .
Some were discussing about Mind and Mental Concomitants .
Daw Shwe
Yi gave light refreshment to the guests in the customary fashion .
During the first one or two days , religious discussion that took place among the guests did not have any effect on U Kyaw Din ’s mind .
On the third evening , U Ba San , a clerk at the Steel Brothers company ’s weaving factory came uninvited .
He talked about Ānāpāna , Ledi Sayadaw ’s method of Vipassanā meditation practice .
The word Ānāpāna had a magic effect on U Kyaw Din ’s mind .
It stirred his mind so much that goose - flesh formed on his skin .
“ What has become of me ? ” he wondered .
“ It seems I am going to find the Right way .
This man came without invitation .
Perhaps he came just for my sake .
My dream has come true .
Here I waited at the cross-roads putting up a pandal .
And he comes to talk about Dhamma , how to go about it .
Surely I am going to gain what I want , if I try by his method . ”
Then he thought of his lack of learning .
This method , he understood , was for literate persons only .
He was quite illiterate .
“ How could he gain from his method ? ”
He had his doubts .
“ Anyhow , I will wait till he comes again and ask him about it , ” he bethought himself .
The next evening when the clerk came , he waited at the entrance of the pandal and asked him .
“ Mr. Clerk , Sir , will an illiterate person like me be able to practise the way you said the other day ? ”
To this the guest replied : “ Literate or not , that does n’t matter .
Conviction ( SadhÈ ) and Effort ( VÊriya ) are the essential things . ”
U Kyaw Din asked again , “ Then , how does one go about it ? ” U Ba San simply replied , “ In - breaths and out - breaths , that ’s Ānāpāna , ” and went into the pandal .
Those two words from his guest enervated him .
With a glad heart , he went into an extension of his house at one side , sat in an easy chair fitted with a gunny cloth as seat , and started noting .
“ Ah , this is in - breath , this is out - breath ” , “ Now he was on the way .
He continued the practice of in - breathing and out - breathing seriously and zealously .
He was full of confidence for success .
He had great conviction .
And he worked energetically .
One day , a neighbor U Shwe Lok , came and remarked .
“ Awareness must be present . ” U Kyaw Din asked , “ How is awareness to be present ? ” And U Shwe Lok answered .
“ Well , it ’s that you must be aware of what you are doing . ”
“ What ’s the benefit of it ” asked U Kyaw Din ?
“ That is meritorious , ” U Shwe Lok replied : “ If that is meritorious , ” said U Kyaw Din , “ I will do it . ”
U Kyaw Din practiced awareness in his work .
When he chopped dried stalks of corn stems for cattle feed , he kept aware of every stroke of his cutting blade .
In this way , he earned much merit while he finished the work more efficiently .
His Insight got developed for developing awareness .
In breathing , he kept aware of the touching of air at the tip of the nose .
In walking , he kept aware of each touching of the sole with the ground .
In weeding or in digging or in drawing water at the well , he kept aware of every movement .
At every odd moment by day or by night he practiced mindfulness with full awareness - at home or on the field or in the Maung Yin Paw ravine , an out of the way place .
There at the outskirt of the forest , he would meditate overnight .
He gained concentration , thanks to his conviction and energetic effort .
He saw multi-colored lights which he thought to be the multi-colored hues of the Buddha ’s Rays .
This give him encouragement much impetus .
Not long afterwards , he saw a little ball hovering around his face .
As he watched it with keen interest , it rose slowly upwards .
He followed it as it rose till he found himself amidst the clouds .
He was please with his progress .
As he worked earnestly the next day , he noticed a little ball the size of a fire - fly emitting light .
As he was looking it , the little ball rose upwards till he found himself amidst an array of pinnacled mansions .
He thought those things as the place he was destined for .
He came back satisfied and joyful , far from being afraid .
As he practiced persistently , he observed painful sensations on his body .
He was aware of the arising of painful sensation noting the fact with mindfulness .
Touch and awareness are made mindful of at every occurrence .
He became attuned to awareness at all times .
When he talked , he talked only about mindfulness of awareness , i.e. , about natural phenomena and that made him look odd in social dealings .
People said , “ this man has his screws loose . ”
U Kyaw Din preferred to be treated as a mentally deranged person , for that freed him of unprofitable social engagements and made him pursue his practice more fully .
He made use of this opportunity by day and by night .
As he advanced in his practice , he saw the people always going after sense - objects .
He felt consternation about humanity .
He had few words with his neighbors .
When he happened to be speaking to them , he reminded them to be mindful .
“ Hey , you ! ” he would say , “ Remember the Buddha , remember the Dhamma , remember the SaÑghā .
You are going to die in three days , ( or ) in five days , ( or ) in seven days . ”
But alas , those spoken to in those terms met their death as foretold by him .
U Kyaw Din told people how he could see the internal organs of people , the denizens ( inhabitants ) of Niraya , the realm of continuous suffering , congested like maggots in a putrid carcass of a dog .
When news of U Kyaw Din ’s Super - human power spread , people came to him to trace their lost cattle , or to get prescriptions for sickness .
U Kyaw Din became fed up .
He felt the need for seclusion .
So he spent most of his time meditating alone at the Maung Yin Paw ravine .
( N.B : The Sayadaw later said : Mundane powers are quite attractive : I was fortunate to be able to outgrow them . )
Touch , Awareness , Mindfulness — with these three essential features , the practice of Vipassanā proceeded for U Kyaw Din in his observance of natural breathing .
With constant practice , he observed the painful sensations as they arise in his body .
By constant mindfulness , Insight into rise and fall of physical and mental phenomena was attained .
This in technical parlance is called Udayabbaya ÒāÓa .
This Insight enabled him to see the details of the inside of his body as though the body were cut open to see .
( N.B : Seeing the process of arising and perishing of phenomena may be either in liquid form or in solid form .
If the meditator proceeds with the practice , putting forth energetic effort , with a strong conviction and resoluteness , uninterruptedly day and night , he will reach a stage where he comes to understand the nature of the Mind , the Mental Concomitants and the Physical Body , how they arise and how they dissolve .
The meditator can see these happenings clearly .
The Insight into rise and fall of phenomena has three categories , the crude type , the middle type and the refined type .
Only by one ’s own practice can these fine points become comprehensible .
These are the Sayadaw ’s remarks in this matter . )
Note :
Only so much needs be told at this stage . : Author .
( 1 ) .
After attaining Insight into rise and fall of phenomena , on Thursday the 13th waning day of Wasou ( July ) 1282 ME , at about 10 pm U Kyaw Din attained the first Supra- mundane Knowledge , SotÈpana ( First Stage ) .
U Kyaw Din continued with his work .
Daw Shwe
Yi was fretting all the time .
She pulled out all the bamboo strips that made the flooring of U Kyaw Din cot ( bed ) and pushed him down .
She pulled out all the bamboo strips so that no flooring was left , U Kyaw Din did not move away .
Instead , he squatted on the beam of the cot .
At last Daw Shwe
Yi gave in .
She replaced the bamboo strips on the cot ( bed ) .
U Kyaw Din said to her , “ Why are you disturbing my work ? ”
“ I intend to be struck by you ” she replied .
“ Dear wife , I shall never strike you .
Try and talk me out of it . ”
“ You good for nothing man , keeping numb all the time like Prince Temiya ( of the Jātaka ) .
If you are so keen to meditate , why wo n’t you wear the yellow robes and stay at the monastery ? ”
Daw Shwe
Yi kept up her fretting and fuming every day .
U Kyaw Din kept patient since he was not still successful , like the aged Upaka of the scripture story .
On another occasion , when U Kyaw Din was meditating , Daw Shwe
Yi let - loose her cow from the tethered post and cried to her husband , “ Look !
The cow has gone loose from her post , U Kyaw Din , you go after the cow , quick ! ”
That cow was dangerous one , use to attacking anyone coming near her .
However , on this occasion she stood still without attacking anyone .
Daw Shwe
Yi got furious .
Stamping her foot hard on the floor , she railed against her husband who seemed not to notice her and continued with his meditating work .
He progressed in his practice .
His ability to be mindful on Sensation in the body developed .
When others used abusive words against him , he felt displeasure .
His mindfulness told him , “ Look , anger has arisen in you . ”
At that same moment , he could choked his anger .
He was encouraged by his fortitude due to constant mindfulness .
He was pleased to remember that before he practiced mindfulness , he would certainly have slapped that abusive person on the face .
Likewise , when he saw a pleasing form he felt pleasure .
He understood that pleasure as greed .
The eye merely saw the eye - object .
The pleasing form was merely perception .
It has nothing to feel pleased .
Similarly , whenever he heard a sound , he understood it as perception of hearing ; and whenever he touched some tangible objects , he understood it as perception of touch ; whenever he smelt some odour , he understood it as perception of smell .
In any of these perceptions he did not allow any pleasure or displeasure to arise in his mind .
In this way , he had some understanding of the working of the mind in regard to sense objects .
One night when U Kyaw Din , keeping mindfulness , fell asleep .
He had a dream like this .
He got into a booking office of a railway station where he bought a ticket .
The station - master gave him four tickets .
He took them and put them in his pocket .
Soon the train started and he woke up from the dream .
Not long afterwards , he had another dream .
He saw in the dream an ox running towards him .
He grabbed the tail of the animal .
The tail broke loose from it and he had the tail left in his hand .
Just then , he woke up from the dream .
U Kyaw Din interpreted the dream .
It portended , he thought , in that later part of the Buddha ’s Teaching , he was going to break loose from the woeful world .
Greatly encouraged by the dream , he put forth his effort .
( 2 ) .
On Saturday , the 13th waning day of Wagaung ( August ) at about 10 pm he won the second Supra- mundane Knowledge , SakadÈgÈmi ( Second Stage ) .
( N.B. - Having had the first experience of winning the Supra- mundane Dhamma , the Sayadaw told us that the second attainment was not greatly different from the first apart from the way unpleasant sensations arose . )
After attaining the Supra- mundane Dhammas twice , U Kyaw Din came to use bombastic words .
He was able to understand the laws of nature .
When people of the village came to tell him that someone was sick , U Kyaw Din might say , “ He is going to die , ” then that man died .
If someone was sick and U Kyaw Din said , “ He ’s not going to die yet , ” then that man recovered .
His words proved so correct that people dared not open any conversation with him .
U Kyaw Din did not care about what people said , but went on zealously with his work .
( 3 ) .
Then on Monday , the 13th waning day of Taw - tha - lin ( September ) 1282 ME , at about 10 pm , he struggled with extraordinarily severe pains arising within him , feeling as if all the sinew broke off and overcoming them , won the third Supra - mundane Knowledge , AnÈgÈmi ( Third Stage ) .
( N.B. : The third winning of the Supra - mundane Dhamma was marked by an emission of semen , which symbolized the extirpation of sexual interest .
A most severe attack of painful sensation had to be met with .
Overcoming it was a sure signal of success .
The Sayadaw said that only when a meditator has overcome it he would say , “ well done ! ” )
The next day , he found that he was free from fear so much so that he could remain unperturbed even when a thunderbolt fell in front of him .
He went ahead with his work .
He felt very much concerned with the plight of humanity .
“ Ah , these people are so occupied with sensual objects , ” he felt .
He dreaded living amidst the people .
He had a strong desire to become a recluse i.e , to lead the homeless life of a Bhikkhu .
He reflected on the world to see the enemies that are to be contended with .
He found Greed , Hatred , Bewilderment and Conceit .
Of these , he found Greed to be the prime source of trouble .
He therefore worked to get - rid of Greed .
His method was Touch - Awareness - Mindfulness .
As one touches something , one remains aware of the touch and notices the fact with mindfulness .
By practising this way earnestly , greed gets less and less and becomes weaker and weaker .
When he thought of any enemy that would still remain , he realized that his wife and children and own properties were the closest enemies for him .
He pondered on the state of affairs by way of cause and effect : - “ This being bridled with impediments such as wife , children and properties are the resultants of the cause , and the cause is that I have not settled my debts .
I must settle my debts now . ”
These were the thoughts that came to his mind .
So he said to his wife , “ ( Ma Shwe Yi ) you and I became husband and wife due to past Kamma .
Do not settle my debts .
Let me not settle your debts either .
Let us agree to break up our wed - lock .
I will regard you as my own sister and you will regard me as your own brother .
Give me permission to become a Bhikkhu . ”
Daw Shwe
Yi replied , “ Do n’t settle the debts owing to me .
Do n’t go away anywhere .
Do n’t turn a Bhikkhu .
Stay here at the specially revered room .
Let me treat you and look after you as an elder brother .
It is said that a husband makes his wife respectable and that a wife makes her husband graceful .
Besides , a woman without protection of her husband is liable to be abused and persecuted by others .
To be my protector , do n’t go away from here . ”
She used the best of her feminine eloquence to deter him from his plan .
At that time , U Kyaw Din lacking general knowledge , thought that consent of wife was necessary to enter Bhikkhu - hood .
He felt miserable for not being able to get his wife ’s consent .
His thought ran like this , “ O , what a misfortune , living as a house - holder is full of faults .
Where could I find a livelihood that is faultless ?
People around me are leading lives that are not free from blame .
The only way to lead a faultless life is a choice between two things ; turn into a Bhikkhu or else wear the rags and live like a mad man .
Perhaps the second choice alone is open for me .
So I shall wear a gunny bag with two holes at the upper corners , make a bigger hole at the top for putting the head .
The gunny bag will serve as my garment as well as my bed - cloth .
For my food , I will beg from house to house , carrying a cup .
People will feed me as a beggar and no one will harm a poor beggar .
That way I can lead a blameless life .
What a splendid idea ! ”
Those were the ideas that came to his desperate mind .
U Kyaw Din was a very unhappy man then .
He could not eat properly .
His strength waned .
He thought he was going to die .
He could not adjust himself to life around him .
So he made a further appeal to his wife .
But Daw Shwe
Yi did not yield .
Their neighbors took sympathy for U Kyaw Din and pleaded with the wife saying , “ Ma Shwe Yi , give your consent now or he will surely die .
Look at how he had starved himself and how run-down he has become – only bone and skin left of the man . ”
Daw Shwe
Yi was still adamant .
She replied to them , “ O , let him die .
Death is better than separation .
I can forget if he was to die but how could I live alone seeing him as a total stranger ?
If I were to give my consent I shall be feeling miserable every time I see him . ”
The friends persisted in their well - intentioned advice until the wife had to soften her stance .
She told them , “ Well , I shall give him permission for a fortnight or so . ” U Kyaw Din then said , “ Let it be so .
If I did not find suited to Bhikkhu - hood , I shall return home at once but if it suits me , which depend on my past store of Kamma , let me stay a Bhikkhu for as long as my good Kamma holds . ”
Even then , Daw Shwe
Yi had an outstanding task for U Kyaw Din .
Their land which had been ploughed just recently was waiting the sowing of crops .
She told him to be so good as sow some peas .
“ That ’s not going to take long , ” she told him .
U Kyaw Din had to oblige .
He yoked his pair of oxen and went to the fields .
Once on the fields , when U Kyaw Din mounted the plough and gave his oxen the signal to move , the pair kept looking back at him and did not move forward .
U Kyaw Din then thought thus , “ My pair of oxen are usually very obedient .
They never needed any prodding .
Formerly , when ever I mounted the plough , they were always very eager to move , as if vying between each other .
Now they are protesting against me – not wishing me to be working as a plough - man .
If I were to ignore their protestation , there would be no one more stupid than me .
Now is the time for me to be firm in my resolve , ” so he calculated .
Bracing himself thus , he dismounted , dissembled the plough , took the handling frame in his hand and leaned the plough - shaft against a near by tree .
Then , unfastening the tether ropes on his bullocks , he said ; “ Now my good help - mates , I set you free .
From now onwards you and I have parted ways for ever .
You may go where ever you wish to go . ”
He then headed towards the monastery of Bhikkhu U Kyauk .
On the way , he met Daw Tin , who asked him where he was going .
He said he was going to the monastery to become a SāmaÓera ( Novice ) .
Daw Tin said , “ I ’ve got a used upper robe .
Take it and do n’t let Ma Shwe Yi know about it . ”
Taking it , he went and saw Bhikkhu U VÊriya ( a ) U Kyauk who gave him a lower robe and received him into the order of Bhikkhu as a Novice .
He was named Shin Kavi by the Bhikkhu U VÊriya .
As the Sayadaw U Kavi went forth into Bhikkhu - hood after leaving the plough - stock leaning against a nearby tree , he was known as “ Tun - daung - ko - daw ” or the Revered one who left the plough - stock leaning against a tree .
( The Sayadaw U Kavi made his wish to become a member of the Order of Bhikkhu offering lights at the Pagoda in Tha - ding - gyut ( October ) 1281 ME and his wish was fulfilled on the 5th waning day of Tha - ding - gyut ( October ) 1282 ME , just one year after wishing for it .
Shin Kavi lost no time in continuing his meditation practice after becoming a SāmaÓera .
He went alone to Maung Yin Paw ravine and resumed his practice .
After five days of his joining the Order , he was joined by U Shwe Lok as another Novice who came and lived with him .
One day , Shin Kavi saw a big mushroom by the side of the monastery and pulled it out of the earth , when a number of mushroom buds came out along with the big mushroom .
He took it as a good omen fore - telling his successful endeavour , that he was about to free himself from this earthly existence which is woeful so he went on orduously with his work .
( 4 ) .
On Tuesday , on the 13th waning day of Tha - ding - gyut ( October ) 1282 ME , at about 10 pm , he saw a grand covered approach ( to a pagoda ) and also a flying chariot approaching him making a buzzing sound .
He did not pay attention to it but just get absorbed in his meditation .
However , he felt himself lifted up in his sitting , his body seeming to lose weight .
He found that the chariot lay beneath him .
Turning around , he saw at the four corners Great DevÈ Kings with Sakka , Lord of the DevÈs on the right side .
He believed that these celestial personages had come to protect him as he was on the point of winning Supra - mundane Knowledge .
Without making a shift in his posture , he remained engaged in his meditation .
There upon he gained the fourth Supra- mundane Knowledge , Arahanta ( Fourth Stage ) .
After that he looked around , Sakka and the four Great DevÈ Kings were gone .
On winning the Fourth Path Knowledge , he could see the whole universe with the topmost realm of Brahmā and the nethermost ( bottom most ) realm of AvÊci , realm of continuous suffering .
He saw Sakka and the Four Great DevÈ Kings announcing to the world in resounding voices that an Arahanta has arisen in the human world and were urging every one to go and pay their homage to the Noble - one .
After that , living beings closest to him came into his views .
There were guardian spirits of the earth , guardian spirits of trees and also DevÈs of the celestial realms .
An endless stream of resplendent DevÈs coming to pay homage to him .
He then understood the existence of the three worlds that is , the world of Sentient Beings ( Satta Loka ) , the world of Volitional Activities ( Sa~khÈra Loka ) and the world of Physical Base ( Okāsa Loka ) .
As well as the three kinds of Internal world , the three kinds of External world .
The world of Sentient Beings ( Satta Loka ) , the world of Volitional Activities that condition the life of Beings ( Sa~khÈra Loka ) and the world of Physical Base ( Okāsa ) , he knew as the three kinds of External world .
The three Internal world are Mind , Mental Concomitants and Corporeality he understood as the world of Sentient Beings ( Satta Loka ) .
The conditioning factors that cause the arising and dissolution of Mind , Mental Concomitants and Corporeality constitute the second kind of the world of Volitional Activities ( Sa~khÈra Loka ) of the three internal worlds and the Physical Base for the two other internal worlds to come into play constitute the third kind ( Okāsa Loka ) of the three internal worlds .
Further , he understood with discrimination the ( Nine ) attributes of the Buddha , the ( Six ) attributes of Dhamma and the ( Nine ) attributes of the SaÑghā .
Attainment of the Four Paths was related by him thus ; firstly , he knew this is Corporeality ( R|pa ) , this is Mentality ( Nāma ) , this is Mind ( Citta ) , these are Mental Concomitants ( Cetasika ) , this is the Truth of Woefulness ( Dukkha Saccā , Suffering ) , this is the Origin of Woefulness ( Samudaya Saccā ) , this is the way leading to the Cessation of Woefulness ( Magga Saccā ) , this is Cessation of the Woefulness ( Nirodha Saccā ) .
Comprehending these Four Ariya Truths is called SotÈpatti Magga ( Path of the Knowledge of the Stream Winner ) and SotÈpatti Phala ( Fruition of the Knowledge of the Stream Winner ) .
Secondly , he knew this is Corporeality ( R|pa ) , this is Mentality ( Nāma ) , this is Mind ( Citta ) , these are Mental Concomitants ( Cetasika ) .
This is the Truth of Dukkha ( Suffering , Dukkha Saccā ) , this is the Origin of Dukkha ( Samudaya Saccā ) , this is the way leading to Cessation of Dukkha ( Magga Saccā ) , this is the Cessation of Dukkha ( Nirodha Saccā ) .
Comprehending the Four Ariya Truths is called Sakadāgāmi Magga ( Path of the Knowledge of the Once Re-turner ) and Sakadāgāmi Phala ( Fruition of the Knowledge of the Once Re-turner ) .
Thirdly , he knew this is Corporeality ( R|pa ) , this is Mentality ( Nāma ) , this is Mind ( Citta ) , these are Mental Concomitants ( Cetasika ) .
This is the Truth of Dukkha ( Suffering , Dukkha Saccā ) , this is the Origin of Dukkha ( Samudaya Saccā ) , this is the way leading to the Cessation of Dukkha ( Magga Saccā ) , this is the Cessation of Dukkha ( Nirodha Saccā ) .
Comprehending the Four Ariya Truths is called Anāgāmi Magga ( Path of the Knowledge of the Non-Returner ) and Anāgāmi Phala ( Fruition of the Knowledge of the Non-Returner ) .
Fourthly , he knew this is Corporeality ( R|pa ) , this is Mentality ( Nāma ) , this is Mind ( Citta ) , these are Mental Concomitants ( Cetasika ) .
This is the Truth of Dukkha ( Suffering , Dukkha Saccā ) , this is the Origin of Dukkha ( Samudaya Saccā ) , this is the way leading to Cessation of Dukkha ( Magga Saccā ) , this is Cessation of Dukkha ( Nirodha Saccā ) .
Comprehending the Four Ariya Truths is called Arahatta Magga ( the Path of Arahatta Knowledge ) and Arahatta Phala ( Fruition of Arahatta Knowledge ) .
He reflected on and reviewed each of these Four Stages of his attainment and remained in a Blissful state ( which is known only to the Ariyās ) .
Shin Kavi reflected on his past existences in the light of Cause - Resultant principle , he found that mostly , he had been born as an animal with very few existence as a human being .
Since his past existences were so numerous , he made a wish to see a particular existence that had been the cause of his spiritual advancement .
Then he saw that during the time of Kassapa Buddha , belonging to the Bhadda - kappa ( the present world ) graced by Five Buddhas , he had made a wish before the Kassapa Buddha after offering Him with some fruit .
As the result of that wish he won Path nowledge now .

They are giants of medicine , pioneers of the care that women receive during childbirth and were the founding fathers of obstetrics .
The names of William Hunter and William Smellie still inspire respect among today 's doctors , more than 250 years since they made their contributions to healthcare .
Such were the duo's reputations as outstanding physicians that the clienteles of their private practices included the rich and famous of mid-18th - century London .
But were they also serial killers ?
New research published in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine ( JRSM ) claims that they were .
A detailed historical study accuses the doctors of soliciting the killing of dozens of women , many in the latter stages of pregnancy , to dissect their corpses .
" Smellie and Hunter were responsible for a series of 18th - century ' burking ' murders of pregnant women , with a death total greater than the combined murders committed by Burke and Hare and Jack the Ripper , " writes Don Shelton , a historian .
" Burking " involved murdering people to order , usually for medical research .
According to Shelton , the two men were between them responsible for the murders of 35 - 40 pregnant women and their unborn children .
Acting separately , and using henchmen to deliver their supply , they organised a killing spree in London between 1749 and 1755 and , after a period of inactivity enforced by mounting suspicion about the source of their corpses , resumed between 1764 and 1774 .
Motivated by ego , personal rivalry and a shared desire to benefit from being acclaimed as the foremost childbirth doctors of their time , Hunter and Smellie sacrificed life after life in their quests to study pregnancy 's physical effects and to develop new techniques , the author says .
" Although it sounds absolutely incredible , the circumstantial literary evidence suggests they were most likely competing with each other in experimenting with secret caesarean sections on unconscious , or freshly murdered , victims , with a view to extracting and reviving the babies , " Shelton told the Observer .
Shelton examined the men's anatomical atlases , containing detailed images of pregnant women who had been opened up , and medical literature and the causes of death in London at the time .
Glasgow 's Hunterian museum and gallery is named after Scottish - born Hunter , who in 1762 became physician to Queen Charlotte , wife of George III .
He helped her to deliver the future king , George IV .
Smellie , a fellow Scot , is no less distinguished .
From Witchcraft to Wisdom , a textbook on the history of obstetric and gynaecological medicine , hails him as " the greatest obstetrician in the history of British obstetrics " .
He has also been called " the father of British midwifery " .
Shelton , though , regards the duo as on a par with Burke and Hare , who murdered 17 citizens of Edinburgh in 1827 and 1828 , selling their remains to a local anatomist .
The London of Hunter and Smellie 's time was unhealthy and semi-anarchic , and early death from disease was widespread , as was grave robbing .
In his JRSM paper , Shelton claims to prove that the rival doctors could not have obtained their supply of corpses by any other means than murder .
It was rare for mothers - to - be to die or be murdered soon before they were due to give birth , says the historian .
People from poorhouses who died were usually old , unwell or children .
Thus the grave robbers of the time could not have fulfilled the obstetricians ' need for such a specific type of female , concludes Shelton .
Each used an assistant to commission killers , he says , naming Dr Colin Mackenzie as Smellie 's accomplice and John Hunter – William 's brother , who was a ­celebrated anatomist – as his helper .
Young women from the countryside were apparently favourite targets in a city where plenty of people " disappeared " .
" There is great suspicion about the abundance of undelivered ninth - month corpses procured , dissected and depicted in the anatomical atlases of Smellie and Hunter , " writes Shelton .
" The impossibility of supply from random resurrections , taken with a careful analysis of events , and of 18th - century medical literature , shows compelling evidence for burking . "
By 1755 rumours were circulating that the women in Smellie 's journal had been murdered , and associates began pressing him on their origins .
" As a result Smellie and Hunter both halted their research , both presumably fearing trial and execution , " although Hunter – who used his links to powerful families to ensure no investigation was ever undertaken – resumed ordering murders , about once a year , in 1764 , Shelton adds .
Anthony Kenny , a gynaecologist in London for 40 years until his retirement in 2007 , said : " These two guys are my heroes .
The idea that they could have been involved in the murder of subjects is absolutely staggering . "
Kenny is now the curator of the museum of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists .
" They were the first proper obstetricians in the country because of their pioneering work practising what was then still a new branch of medicine . "
While Kenny describes Shelton 's paper as " extremely impressive " in its research , he cannot believe that his heroes were guilty of such terrible crimes .
The trade in corpses was very lucrative and probably attracted unsavoury , unscrupulous characters , he pointed out .
" And it could be that they did n't make proper inquiries as to the origins of the bodies , and so may not have known that the women were murdered . "
Ludmilla Jordanova , a professor of modern history at King 's College London who specialises in the history of medicine , says Shelton 's assertion that Hunter and Smellie could not have come across so many dead pregnant women from any other source as " a striking claim .
Important research … is revealing the complexities of anatomical activities in 18th - century London .
This is an exciting and controversial area of historical investigation , and it invites more meticulous research and judicious research . "
Shelton says his research " turned out to be a bit like a thinking person 's Da Vinci Code , but in this case involving facts , not fiction .
Although the conclusion of burking is shocking , to quote Sherlock Holmes , ' When you have eliminated the impossible , whatever remains , however improbable , is the truth . ' "
Inquiring minds are reading an interesting document by the San Francisco Fed called Global Household Leverage , House Prices , and Consumption .
" [ O ] ver - investment and over - speculation are often important ; but they would have far less serious results were they not conducted with borrowed money . "
— Irving Fisher ( 1933 )
In the United States and many other industrial countries , the recent financial crisis contributed to the longest and most severe economic contraction since the Great Depression .
The rapid expansion in the use of borrowed money , or leverage , by households in recent years , is one factor that may help account for the virulence of the downturn .
In the years leading up to the crisis , a combination of factors , including low interest rates , lax lending standards , a proliferation of exotic mortgage products , and the growth of a global market for securitized loans fueled a rapid increase in household borrowing .
An influx of new and often speculative homebuyers with access to easy credit helped bid up U.S. house prices to unprecedented levels relative to rents or disposable income .
U.S. household leverage , as measured by the ratio of debt to personal disposable income , reached an all - time high , exceeding 130 % in 2007 ( see Glick and Lansing 2009 ) .
National house prices peaked in 2006 and have since dropped by about 30 % .
The bursting of the housing bubble set off a chain of events that pushed the U.S. economy into a severe recession that started in December 2007 .
This Economic Letter shows that the recent U.S. experience is by no means unique .
Household leverage in many industrial countries increased dramatically in the years prior to 2007 .
Countries with the largest increases in household leverage tended to experience the fastest rise in house prices over the same period .
Moreover , these same countries tended to experience the most severe declines in consumption once house prices started falling .
The common patterns observed across countries suggest that , as in the United States , the unwinding of excess household leverage via increased saving or increased default rates could be a significant drag on consumption and bank lending going forward , possibly muting the vigor of the economic recovery .
Household leverage and consumption : U.S. county data
The typical residential housing transaction is financed largely with borrowed money .
The use of such leverage to purchase an asset magnifies the risk assumed by the buyer .
If the value of the asset subsequently drops , as in a burst bubble , the debt incurred to buy the asset remains in place and the buyer must still repay the loan in full .
If the debt exceeds the asset 's market value , refinancing options are limited .
If the debt is very large relative to the buyer 's income , repayment can strain the buyer 's finances , forcing a reduction in other spending .
And if the strain becomes too great , the buyer may be forced to default , shifting some or all of the loss to the lender or the taxpayer if the loan is government - insured .
Using data on household borrowing for the 450 largest U.S. counties by population , Mian and Sufi ( 2009a , b ) provide evidence that the rapid rise in household leverage in recent years was a primary driver of the recession that began in December 2007 .
Their analysis identifies several important patterns .
First , they find that house prices rose faster in areas where subprime mortgages were more prevalent .
This suggests the existence of a self - reinforcing feedback loop in which new buyers with access to easy mortgage credit helped fuel the run-up in prices by bidding competitively for houses , which in turn encouraged lenders to ease credit even further based on the assumption that house prices would continue to appreciate indefinitely .
Second , the authors find that for each incremental dollar of house price appreciation , the average homeowner extracted about 25 to 30 cents in cash via home equity borrowing , which was used primarily for consumption or home improvement .
This indicates that house price appreciation fueled by easy mortgage credit was a significant driver of economic growth during the boom years .
Third , they find that counties that experienced the largest increases in leverage tended to experience the sharpest rise in loan defaults and the most severe recessions , where severity is measured by the subsequent fall in consumption of durable goods or the subsequent rise in the unemployment rate .
The last point suggests that recession severity in a given area reflects the degree to which prior growth there was driven by an unsustainable borrowing trend -- one which came to an abrupt halt once house prices stopped rising .
Household leverage and consumption : International data
Figure 1 depicts the increase in the household leverage ratio , defined as household debt as a percent of disposable income including transfers , in the United States and 15 other industrial countries over a 10 - year period ending in 2007 , according to data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development .
Compared to the U.S. household leverage ratio of around 130 % in 2007 , leverage ratios were significantly higher in some countries , including Denmark ( 199 % ) , Ireland ( 191 % ) , and Netherlands ( 185 % ) , but lower in others , such as Italy ( 43 % ) , France ( 60 % ) , Belgium ( 64 % ) , and Germany ( 82 % ) .
Figure 2 plots the trajectory of real house prices in the United States and other industrial countries since 1997 .
Austria , Belgium , and Portugal are omitted due to lack of data .
Real house prices in the United States rose by roughly 50 % , reaching a peak in 2006 .
House prices in other industrial countries also rose substantially and in most cases more than in the United States .
At their peaks , prices rose the most in Ireland ( 172 % ) , United Kingdom ( 146 % ) , Spain ( 118 % ) , and France and Sweden ( 108 % ) , followed by Denmark , ( 89 % ) , Netherlands ( 75 % ) , and Italy ( 61 % ) .
These dramatic run-ups , which far exceeded the growth in disposable incomes over the same period , show that housing bubbles were widespread .
The two exceptions were Japan and Germany , where real house prices fell over this period .
However , both countries had previously experienced large run-ups in house prices during the late 1980s and early 1990s .

Conclusion
Going forward , the efforts of households in many countries to reduce their elevated debt loads via increased saving could result in sluggish recoveries of consumer spending .
Higher saving rates and correspondingly lower rates of domestic consumption growth would mean that a larger share of GDP growth would need to come from business investment , net exports , or government spending .
Debt reduction might also be accomplished via various forms of default , such as real estate short sales , foreclosures , and bankruptcies .
But such deleveraging involves significant costs for consumers , including tax liabilities on forgiven debt , legal fees , and lower credit scores .
As countries begin to emerge from the recession , it is important to consider what lessons might be learned for the conduct of policy .
History suggests that asset price bubbles can be extraordinarily costly when accompanied by significant increases in borrowing .
During the recent housing bubble , underwriting standards were weakened and credit extension rose at abnormally high rates , creating a self - reinforcing feedback loop that drove house prices upward .
In the aftermath of a global boom - and - bust cycle in credit and housing , financial regulators should take the necessary steps to prevent a replay of this damaging episode .
Bernanke In Denial
There is no possible regulation that can stop a credit binge brought about by cheap money and fractional reserve lending that enabled Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to borrow money into existence at will .
Two weeks into the job , Bernanke testified before Congress that it was a positive that the nation 's homeownership rate had reached nearly 70 percent , in part because of subprime loans .

DETROIT -- Several Detroit Red Wings are headed to Vancouver to represent their country at the Winter Olympics .
Others are traveling to various warmer climates for a much - needed respite .
All of them head into the two - week Olympic break on a positive note .
They snapped a four - game winless streak ( 0 - 2 - 2 ) and cooled off one of the hottest teams in the NHL Saturday night , defeating the Ottawa Senators 4 - 1 at Joe Louis Arena .
Kirk Maltby , Pavel Datsyuk , Dan Cleary and Johan Franzen ( empty net ) scored for the Red Wings , who converted twice on the power play .
Jimmy Howard , making his 23rd start in the past 25 games , stopped 29 shots to raise his record to 21 - 13 - 8 .
“ I thought it was important to get the two points .
Where we ’re at in the standings , we ’re in desperate need of points , ” Red Wings captain Nicklas Lidstrom said .
“ The other night against the Sharks ( 3 - 2 shootout loss Thursday ) , we came out with the same effort tonight .
We got two goals early and controlled the game from there .
I ’m very happy with our effort . ”
Red Wings forward Tomas Holmstrom left the game late in the first period when his left knee injury flared up .
The club had no update on his status after the game .
He could be forced to withdraw from the Swedish Olympic team , which would open up a spot for Franzen .
“ I ’m hoping he ’s going to recover and play for Sweden , ” coach Mike Babcock said .
“ He ’d be a huge part of their team .
He ’s a huge part of our team just with his emotion and net - front presence . ”
Detroit played the final two periods with only 10 forwards , as Valtteri Filppula missed the game due to a groin injury .
Datsyuk and Henrik Zetterberg were double - shifted and defenseman Derek Meech played forward .
The Senators had won 13 of their past 14 games .
“ Realistically , we played well enough to win our last two games , ” forward Kris Draper said .
“ This is what we need , this is how we have to play .
And if we can do that we ’re going to find ourselves right in the mix in the playoff race . ”
Ottawa cut Detroit ’s lead to 2 - 1 on Peter Regin ’s goal at 8:13 of the second period .
Regin crashed the net and knocked in the rebound after Howard ’s save on Alexei Kovalev .
The Red Wings responded with a power - play goal from Cleary at 11:09 .
He banged in Todd Bertuzzi ’s pass through the crease for his 13th goal .
The Red Wings jumped out to a 2 - 0 lead in the first period on goals by Maltby and Datsyuk .
Maltby scored at 9:33 , firing in a backhand shot after Meech jarred the puck free from Brian Elliott , who had made a save on Brad Stuart ’s shot from the point .
Draper made it possible by winning an offensive - zone faceoff .
It potentially was Maltby ’s final game of the season , perhaps his last game as a Red Wing .
He has been bothered by a chronic shoulder injury and is contemplating season - ending surgery after the Olympic break .
“ I ’d be lying if I did n’t think about a little bit , ” Maltby said .
“ But it does n’t change the way I prepare .
You got to stay focused and do what you ’re supposed to do . ”
It was Maltby ’s first goal since Oct. 31 , his fourth of the season .
He had gone 42 games without a point .
“ He was n’t sure coming to the rink this morning what was going to happen .
He goes out and get the all - important first goal , ” Draper said .
“ Everyone in here knows what Malts brings to the team .
He ’s a great teammate .
He ’s going to go out and play hard and frustrate the other team and he ’s going to be a great penalty - killer .
He was able to do that and score tonight . ”
Datsyuk made it 2 - 0 at 16:33 , on the power play .
Standing by the side of the net , he redirected a pass from Lidstrom .
Zetterberg set up the play by stealing the puck from Milan Michalek just inside the blue line .
Michalek made a bad decision to bring the puck back into his own zone when he had a chance to fire it down the ice .
“ He looked like he had the puck on a string , ” Lidstrom said of Datsyuk .
“ He ’s deking guys and skating strong . ”
Olympians honored
The Red Wings ’ Olympians were honored during a pre-game ceremony .
They have four players representing Sweden ( Lidstrom , Zetterberg , Holmstrom and Niklas Kronwall ) and one each on Team USA ( Brian Rafalski ) , Russia ( Datsyuk ) and Finland ( Filppula ) .
In addition , Babcock is the head coach for Canada , whose executive director , Red Wings vice president Steve Yzerman , already is in Vancouver .
“ Good win tonight to go into the break and get ready for the stretch drive , ” Maltby said .
Most of us are intrigued by the amazing graphical character designs of our all - time favourite animated movies like the Shrek , Monster Inc. , Ice Age etc .
In fact , @CG ( Computer Graphics ) character designs for computer games makes up an integral part of the gaming process .
Much as we often take for granted these creatively detailed designs , there is always a tedious behind - the - scene effort needed to make these characters come ‘ alive ’ by first creating an animated 3D model .
The CG characters you are about to see are created with powerful 3D tools like ZBurhs , 3DMax , Photoshop , etc .
In order to appreciate the beauty of our favorite on - screen characters , one should see how the 3D models are first created .
In essence , it is analogous to the molding of the characters before we give life to them through animation .
We hope this list will give you a greater understanding on the complexity of making 3D CG characters .

Defending The Parking Meter Rates
By Marcus Gilmer in News on Dec 31 , 2009 3:20 PM
Photo by swanksalot another hike in the city 's parking rates goes into effect and a day after we looked back on the year that was in the Parking Meter Lease Saga , both the City and the company in charge of the meters have gone on the defensive .
The new rates technically begin tomorrow , but technicians wo n't start phasing the new rates into the meters until Monday and it'll take most of the month of January to get the new rates locked in at all meters around the city .
And as the new rates roll out and a new round of complaints get set to roll in , the defense begins .
Budget office spokesman Pete Scales defended the financial aspect of the lease , telling the Tribune , " It protected taxpayers by providing $ 1.2 billion and has allowed the city to continue providing critical services to residents that would otherwise have been cut , or even preserved by substantially raising taxes .
As Mayor Daley has said , he would not increase taxes or cut critical services during this economic recession . "
Well , that 's all well and good , but what about the fact that the city 's then - Inspector General David Hoffman issued a report saying the City could have gotten almost twice as much for the deal ?
Or that Mayor Daley has already taken out 70 percent of the $ 400 million that he socked away from the deal to cover holes in the city 's budget ( saying he 'd pay it back later once economic times are better ) ?
As for the technological hiccups the meters have experienced , the company in charge of the meters defends the action but one alderman who has opposed the deal from the start is n't having any of it .
Avis LaVelle , a spokeswoman for Chicago Parking Meters LLC , touted technological advances such as the ability to use credit cards at the pay boxes in defending the higher costs to drivers .
" It 's a greatly enhanced system that offers motorists many more conveniences than before , " LaVelle said .
Ald. Scott Waguespack , 32nd , one of five aldermen to vote against the meter lease in December 2008 , called the argument that Chicagoans have benefited with better parking meter technology because of the lease laughable .
" The technology has been there .
The city should have been doing those upgrades , " he said .
" They treat these pay boxes like they 're manna from heaven , and they 're not . "
Truth .
But , still , it looks like this is n't an issue that 'll be going away any time soon : 2010 starts year two of the 75 - year lease .
As the teen , Jacob , is sharing his testimony , a worship leader chimes in : " Do you hear that ?
He was set free from addictions to homosexuality , heroine , crack cocaine .
Anything else ? "
Over the weekend Towleroad posted the video of an " ex- gay " teenager and his testimony at the International House of Prayer in Kansas City .
If you 're reading this and thinking , " That place sounds familiar , " you should be reminded of Lou Engle and TheCall .
Engle and his nationwide , youth " revival " have made headlines over the past year or so as several bloggers and organizations ( including the SPLC ) have tracked his routinely militant and violent religious rhetoric .
( You can read my in - depth report on a similar religious militant in Charlotte , N.C. , and his ties with Engle in here . )
I do n't know if you heard what I heard , but Jacob 's experience in " ex- gay " therapies and movements is n't rare .
" He set me free form homosexuality and also set me free from addiction to heroine and addiction to crack cocaine , " Jacob says .
" And because I lived my life in and around the church and I 've had a lot of condemnation and shame and I did n't know I could be delivered and I did and he set me free from the condemnation and the shame and the depression that came with it . "
The worship leader responds , " That 's awesome and how does he feel about you ? "
" He loves me and he delights in me , " Jacob says .
Jacob , who tells us he had " same sex attractions " from " as early as he can remember , " also tells us , although not in these exact words , that he has suffered from religion - based bigotry and prejudice directly from the hands of the people who should have offered him love and acceptance but who will now exploit his " testimony " as proof of at least five of their oft - quoted claims that :
all gay people are depressed and lonely ; all gay people succumb to addiction to drugs , alcohol and a whole assortment of other sins and ailments ; the shame felt by gay people exists solely because they are living " outside " of " God 's will " ; " change " is possible ; and shame and depression and despair only disappear if one continues to deny who they are and attempt to become something they are not .
Unfortunately , the realities of these types of situations are n't anything like " ex- gay " proponents paint them .
These charlatans , as activist Wayne Besen calls them , are really no more than self - appointed " prophets " with the gift of gab who are able to manipulate their ( oftentimes youthful ) victims by turning religious teaching and feeling into weapons of spiritual , mental and ( sometimes ) physical and sexual abuse .
Because of all this manipulation , teens like Jacob find themselves faced with two options : deny who they are and give into their religious leaders ' and family 's delusions of " change " or risk losing all they 've known and be exiled from their family , friends and spiritual homes .
For any teen , the latter option is akin to death itself .
There are n't many adolescents emotionally or intellectually ready to handle life alone .
There 's a reason our youth are youth : they are n't adults , are vulnerable and need the love , guidance and protection of adults who will value them as and who they are .
Faced with those two options , it 's easy to see how teens and youth fall victim so easily to " ex - gay " predators .
But , if Jacob 's childhood life in the church was anything like mine and millions more LGBT people , I 'm betting the true story behind Jacob 's " conversion " goes a little something like this : Jacob realized he was gay early on .
As he grew up in and around his religious family and church community he came to realize two things : these feelings for other boys were n't the norm and these feelings were " sinful , " " sick , " " evil " and an " abomination . "
Instead of coming to terms with who he was , Jacob kept his feelings to himself as he continued to absorb the twisted rhetoric and mental and psychological abuse from his religious leaders .
With no where to turn and no one to talk to , Jacob slipped into depression .
Like so many other teens dealing with emotional or mental problems , Jacob turned to drugs as an easy escape from a world in which he was not loved and accepted .
Eventually , Jacob hit a wall .
His drug abuse and depression went over the edge .
It was n't until then that his parents and religious leaders noticed something was wrong .
Instead of offering any kind of lasting and helpful healing , Jacob 's family and faith community only added to Jacob 's suffering , piling on more of the same , tired and damaging rhetoric that put him in this place to begin with .
Jacob was faced with two options : lie and hide and gain acceptance and " freedom " or lose everything .
Jacob chose the former .
Right now , Jacob and his faith community consider him " healed " and " delivered . "
As Jacob grows up , goes to college and enters the " real world , " he , like thousands of " ex - gay " survivors , will discover he can't hide or run from the person whom God created and loves unconditionally .
Instead of living a youthful life of purpose and dignity , Jacob will live one of despair .
One in which he 's constantly looking over his shoulder and one in which he allows so - called " loving " faith leaders to continue to strip his soul bare of any truth and integrity .
In his compilation of LGBT leaders ' and young adults ' stories of growing up gay in America , Mitchell Gold calls situations like Jacob's and other youth 's America 's " silent mental health crisis . "
It is a crisis , indeed .
One which must be stopped -- for the health and lives of our youth and for our nation and its future leaders .
Ecatepec y Neza lideran atracos con violencia
[ email protected ]
Los municipios de Ecatepec y Nezahualcóyotl , en el estado de México , comparten algo con una de las capitales del crimen organizado , Culiacán , Sinaloa : son los municipios donde seis de cada 10 autos son robados con violencia .
El año 2009 no sólo será recordado como el año de mayor número de víctimas mortales en la guerra contra el crimen organizado , sino que además será un año recordado por 67 mil 290 propietarios .
De acuerdo con el Reporte sobre Robo y Recuperación en el Ramo de Automóviles , emitido por Asociación Mexicana de Instituciones de Seguros ( AMIS ) , este delito registró en todo el país un incremento de 13.4 % con respecto a 2008 .
Mientras que el año pasado fueron robados 59 mil 348 automotores , de acuerdo con los datos del sector asegurador , en el 2009 el número ascendió a 67 mil 290 .
De este total , sólo cuatro de cada 10 vehículos robados en el país fueron recuperados , una cifra que pese a mostrar el bajo nivel de eficiencia de las autoridades , creció sólo de forma marginal en 1.1 % .
Una explicación a este resultado es la penetración de mercado automotriz de empresas que colocan chips de radiolocalización en las unidades .
El hurto de autos creció 18.8 % en el estado de México , con 14 mil 836 unidades sustraídas , y en el Distrito Federal el ilícito descendió en 3.8 % con 15 mil 258 unidades robadas Las cifras dejan patente el alto peligro que significa ser propietario de un automotor en el Valle de México , ya que en esta zona del país fueron robados casi cinco de cada 10 autos .
Por otra parte , el Distrito Federal , estado de México , Nuevo León , Chihuahua y Jalisco fueron los cinco estados con mayor índice de robo el año pasado .
Entre todas representan 71 % del total de vehículos robados a nivel nacional .
De acuerdo con información de la Asociación Mexicana de Distribuidores de Automotores ( AMDA ) , en estas mismas cincos entidades fueron vendidos 379 mil 121 unidades nuevas durante 2009 , que significaron 26.9 % menos en relación a las unidades facturadas en 2008 .
Analistas de la industria automotriz han manifestado en diversas ocasiones que no sólo la crisis afectó las ventas de automotores nuevos en México , sino en el caso particular de autos de lujo , Vans y Mini Vans el impacto es más achacable al miedo a ser secuestrados .
“ Muchos no quieren que se les note su nivel de ingresos y es por ello que prefieren autos más económicos y no de lujo o camionetas como en otro años ” , explicó a finales del año pasado Pascual Francisco , entonces analista de IHS global Insight .
En la lista de los 10 vehículos más robados en la República mexicana se encuentran el Tsuru ( 13 mil 73 unidades ) ; la pick up ( 3 mil 737 ) y el Sentra ( 2 mil 227 ) de la marca Nissan ; General Motors pick up ( mil 604 ) ; el Bora ( mil 322 ) y el Jetta cuarta generación ( mil 232 ) de la marca Volkswagen ; Honda moto de 125 cc ( mil 88 ) ; Ford pick up ( mil 44 ) ; Volkswagen Pointer ( 842 ) y la Silverado de General Motors ( 792 ) .
For years , ice dance costumes and programs have been so over the top they made it almost ridiculous to think this was a sport worthy of Olympic medals .
Then the International Skating Union turned what was only a farce into an opportunity for cultural insensitivity as well as bad taste when it decided the dancers should use folk themes for their original dance in this Olympic season .
That led Russians Oksana Domnina and Maxim Shabalin , the reigning world champions , to create a program with allegedly Australian Aboriginal music and to perform it wearing brown face , tribal paint and costumes with clumps of faux foliage .
Sol Bellear , of the New South Wales state Aboriginal Land Council , told an Australian newspaper : “ It ’s very offensive .

“ We see it as stealing Aboriginal culture , and it is yet another example of the Aboriginal people of Australia being exploited . ”
Bellear has said he will write to Russia ’s ambassador in Canberra to protest the dance .
The 2010 Winter Olympics take place in Vancouver , which has focused attention on issues related to the status and treatment of Canada ’s First Nations , just as the 2000 Sydney Olympics spurred discussions about Australia ’s historically racist mistreatment of its Aboriginal population .
In the U.S. championships , leaders Meryl Davis and Charlie White did an original dance Friday night to an Indian theme , using movements that could be seen as caricatures or cliches .
But their costumes and interpretation have been greeted with approval on the Internet in comments from India .
Meanwhile , Kimberly Navarro and Brent Bommentre , fourth after the original dance , are using Afro-Brazilian music , but he wears a headpiece that recalls silent movie icon Rudolph Valentino as “ The Sheikh . ”
Bommentre said he used the headpiece because he could not grow long enough hair for dreadlocks and rejected hair extensions .

Five - time U.S. champions Tanith Belbin and Ben Agosto , who are second after the original dance , took a less risky approach , using a Moldovan theme .
While there is nothing inherently wrong about having dancers interpret ethnic themes , it looks absurdly out of place amid the frivolity that is ice dance .
Even with well - intentioned efforts at sensitivity , there is an element of high camp rather than cultural authenticity when ice dancers do the folk programs .
Belbin and Agosto train with the Russians in Aston , Pa .

“ We are all trying to portray a style of dance we are n’t familiar with , ” Agosto said .
“ I know Oksana and Max as people , and I can assume they never intended to offend anyone with their program , ” Belbin said .
“ They were just trying to create something unique and different , and they certainly achieved that .
Hopefully , everyone will be feeling OK by the Olympics , and it all will work out . ”
The U.S. couples all said they spoke extensively with natives of the countries whose folk culture they are using .
Belbin said a Moldovan reporter messaged her on Facebook to express his pleasure over seeing his country well - represented .
Asked if he would dress as an Aborigine , Agosto demurred .
Advertisement
“ I ca n’t comment on what I would or would n’t wear , ” Agosto said .
“ I ’ve had my fair share of odd costumes over the years .
I hope nobody in Moldova is offended by our dance . ”
Davis and White extended the lead they had after the compulsory dance .
They have 113.53 points to 111.91 for Belbin and Agosto , who continue to insist they are treating the nationals as nothing more than a practice .
Davis and White won the title last year in their rivals ’ absence because Agosto had a back injury .
Until Thursday ’s compulsory dance , they never had beaten Belbin and Agosto in any phase of a competition .
Davis said the idea for the Indian program came when their coach , native Russian Marina Zoueva , saw a Hermes scarf with Indian dancers on it and was inspired by the colors .

“ Not knowing about Indian culture very much or Indian folk dance , we went to a couple specialists who really helped us understand what to do , ” Davis said .
They wound up with a blend of moves used in classic Indian folk dance and those seen in Bollywood movies .
“ It was very important for us to do research to make sure we could do the theme justice and that we were n’t going to offend anyone or do something that was completely off - base , ” Davis said .

In a surprise ruling last month , France ’s highest court – la Cour de Cassation – ruled that an employee was wrongly dismissed for downloading smut to their work PC .
The employee , known only as " Monsieur X " , was fired by Peugeot Citroën Automobiles in June 2002 , after an internal investigation found that he had saved to hard disk a folder called " enculade43.zip " , which contained 60 pornographic images and two files featuring animal sex ( presumably what one - time President Charles DeGaulle referred to as " le chien au lit " ) .
For those readers without access to a dictionary of french smut , the practice of " enculade " is illustrated here ( NSFW ) with - yes - Playmobil assistance .
Peugeot justified the sacking on the grounds that it had put out various guidance notes over the years exhorting employees to " refrain from attacks on the personal dignity of their co-workers , and to exhibit the highest moral standards at all times " .
Their decision was upheld first by le conseil de prud’hommes ( equivalent of a UK employment tribunal ) and again in March 2008 at the Rennes court of appeal .
The latter noted that by storing these images on disk , the employee was effectively harassing other employees , as well as running the risk of damaging his employer ’s image .
He then took the matter to the Cour de Cassation .
The two chief grounds for contesting his dismissal were that Peugeot had no right to access his files , as they were personal ; and that passive use of an IT tool for limited personal ends was not a contravention of his terms of contract , so long as this practice did not impact his performance .
To the surprise of many , the second argument was upheld .
While this ruling , announced on December 8 , 2009 , would appear to give French employees a green light to download filth and frolics to their hearts ’ content , the court was clear that it has limited application .
If Peugeot had been able to demonstrate that the downloads had impacted on performance in any way , because the employee was busy doing things he should not during his working day , that would be grounds for dismissal .
Equally , it was determined that size mattered : if the downloads were so big that they interfered with the proper functioning of the system , or came with viruses attached , that also would be grounds for dismissal .
Finally , if the content was itself illegal ( featuring child abuse , perhaps ) or if the terms of employment had specified more closely what an employee could – and could not – download , then Peugeot might have succeeded .
As it is , none of the above appear to have been the case , leaving Monsieur X in the clear – and in line for the receipt of ( modest ) damages .
This leaves the French position ( shush ) on workplace porn just that bit more liberal than the UK one , where the default assumption appears to be that smut is de facto evidence of sexual harassment ( a bad thing ! ) or inappropriate conduct ( also a bad thing ) and in either case , perfectly good grounds for dismissal .
In addition , since the inception of the law on extreme porn , the possession of images involving acts of extreme violence in a sexual context or animal porn are criminal in and of themselves .
The very first conviction for extreme porn was of an individual found to have downloaded animal porn on to his workplace computer .
Under UK law , as presently constituted , Monsieur X would face criminal charges and almost certainly be fired – with little hope of redress . ®

The process itself is quite easy , if not a little repetitive — but it 's a small price to pay to have your friend or loved one guide you through the windy roads of America ( or wherever you 're from ) .
The software leads you through the process of recording a list of words and phrases that your Garmin uses to form directions , and then downloading it to your GPS unit ( you can see a list of which devices are compatible here ) .
Garmin estimates the process will take 30 minutes , which may seem long for the simple task of saying 65 words , but if you want it to sound as natural as possible , I would suggest taking your time to test and trim each recording .
Sadly , my Garmin is not one of the supported devices , so if yours is , try it out and let us know how it worked in the comments !

I just finished reading this book , and it was very good , but I 'm still not exactly sure what the ending means .
I think it was meant to be ambiguous and left up to the reader 's interpretation , but what are your opinions ?
Here are my two theories :
1 . I originally thought that the ending was Teddy 's awakening after taking the pills for his headache , meaning that pretty much the whole second half of the book was a dream .
This seemed unlikely though after I thought about it for a while .
2 . The more likely interpretation in my opinion was that Teddy really was Laeddis and had relapsed for the last time back into Teddy , meaning that the white package with the metal was probably a straight jacket or tools they were going to use for the orbital lobotomy .
What do you think the ending meant ?
A college student wants IM GAY on his Oklahoma car tag , and he is suing to force state tax officials to approve his request .
" I want to tell people who I am and what I am .
I ’m proud of it .
I ’m openly gay .
I ’m not hiding , ” said Keith Kimmel , 28 , of Norman .
" What better way to tell everybody than to put it on the back of a car ? ”
The Oklahoma Tax Commission turned Kimmel down last year because of an internal rule against special license tags that " may be offensive to the general public . ”
Kimmel points out officials allowed tags such as STR8FAN and STR8SXI .
" They defended using ‘ straight sexy . ’ …
They did n’t think that one was inappropriate but yet ‘ I ’m gay ’ is .
I think it ’s kind of a double standard , ” said Kimmel , a political science / pre-law student at Oklahoma City Community College .
In his lawsuit , filed Wednesday , Kimmel asks Oklahoma County District Judge Noma Gurich to order tax officials to grant his application for the IM GAY tag .
His attorney contends the Tax Commission ’s rule violates the Oklahoma Constitution ’s guarantee of free speech .
The attorney , Brittany Novotny , calls it " viewpoint discrimination . ”
The Oklahoma Tax Commission has issued more than 54,000 personalized tags , a spokeswoman said .
Tax officials Friday declined comment until after they could review the lawsuit .
During an administrative hearing last year , a Tax Commission attorney argued : " License plates — even personalized license plates — are not the private billboard for the person to whom they are issued .
They are still a state license plate . ”
A Tax Commission employee denied during last year ’s hearing that STR8SXI was about sexual orientation , records show .
" I think she ’s trying to say , ‘ I ’m cute . ’ …
That ’s just how … I personally interpreted it , ” the employee said of the tag owner .
Asked about the tag VIBR8R , the employee admitted that could be interpreted as vibrator .
" That definitely slipped through our process , ” the employee said .
The three tax commissioners in October upheld the decision to deny Kimmel ’s application .
They agreed Kimmel failed to prove during the administrative hearing that his proposed tag would not be offensive to the general public .
Kimmel said he will appeal if he loses before Judge Gurich .
Universal Music , EMI Music , Sony BMG and Warner Music are demanding one million Swedish kronor from two Pirate Bay founders .
A Swedish court banned them from operating the site last year , and the labels argue that they have failed to comply .
Last October , the Stockholm District Court ordered that two of the site ’s founding members – Gottfrid Svartholm and Fredrik Neij – should cease to operate the site .
The verdict read that if they failed to comply with the court ’s decision , this would result in fines of 500,000 kronor ( $ 71,000 ) each .
The two were granted an appeal little over a month later , but the record labels do not intend to wait and are going after their money .
They have sent the District Court a letter where they ask the authorities to collect the fines .
The labels argue that , since the site is still operational , Neij and Svartholm must be involved in the operation one way or another .
Whether they or the authorities can back this up with evidence is highly doubtful .
Fredrik and Gottfrid
Both Pirate Bay founders currently live outside Sweden , and aside from their whereabouts , it will be hard to prove that either of them is still actively involved in the site ’s operation without monitoring their every move .
Commenting on the announcement , Fredrik Neij said : “ I am no longer involved in the operation of The Pirate Bay , so there is no opportunity for the penalty to be issued .
I think the law is quite clear on this . ”
Whether or not the fine will be enforced does n’t matter that much to Neij , who already owes over 50 million kronor ( $ 7 million ) due to previous legal cases .
He ca n’t pay the money anyway he said , adding “ a few million more or less does n’t really affect me . ”

T- Mobile makes no sense
For reasons that are n't material to this rant , I 'm trying to get a T - Mobile SIM card set up with T - Mobile 's ridiculously named " Even More Plus 500 Talk +
Text + Web " plan .
At this point I have a SIM card , and after much pain and suffering in phone conversations and online chat support , I have an account that is fully paid up .
Let 's log in to the " My T - Mobile " site 's " Billing & Payments " page to see how much I currenly owe :
Ok it says I owe $ 62.42 by 1/19/2010 ( today ) for service from 2/9/2010 - 3/8/2010 ( next month ) .
But it also says that my monthly charges for my previous bill are $ 127.42 due on 3/9/2010 ( two months from now ) .
None of those numbers seem to add up to $ 59.99 , which is what the " Even More Plus 500 Talk +
Text + Web " plan is advertised as costing , but I suppose $ 62.42 could equal $ 59.99 if one were to imagine that T - Mobile felt they could put a few " fees " on there that for whatever reason could be assumed not to count .
But what 's with the $ 127.42 ?
And what 's with the due dates ?
Let 's click " See details " to see details : Wait , bill summary ?
I wanted details !
And hold on , this page says my account balance is $ 0.00 , and that I paid $ 62.42 on 1/20/10 ( tomorrow ) .
It also gives my monthly charges twice ... once as $ 0.00 , and once as $ 127.42 !
I guess if you average them it adds up to $ 63.71 , which is similar to $ 62.42 ...
Oh look , the details are below the fold .
This says the next service period is $ 63.71 , that they 've received $ 62.42 , that the previous balance was $ 63.71 , and that they " adjusted " my account by $ 65.00 ( the result of my calling billing support because they had n't applied the $ 63.71 they actually charged me to my account ) , and apparently that all adds up to me owing $ 0.00 ... by 02/05/2010 .
Clearly maths is not their strong point .
Also not their strong point : being consistent about how they mark up dates .
Or how they decide what dates are important .
Oh and ... also not their strong point : matching reality .
So far they 've only actually charged me $ 63.71 , once , though I have in fact tried to pay more than once ( earlier today I also tried to pay the $ 62.42 that some of these pages claim I owe , though my bank has yet to see that charge ) .
Still , the $ 127.42 is a bit confusing .
Let 's see what the " View Bill " button under that number brings up .
Whaaaa !?
FPEvenMorePlus 500TTW $ 119.98 ?
What on earth is that ?
" Amount due 2/05 / 10 : $ 127.42 " ?
That completely contradicts the previous page !
How much do I owe on that day , $ 0 , or $ 127.42 ??
They say the way to work out how much you owe is to dial # 225 # from the phone , so let 's try that ...
Ok , that says $ 0 .
I guess the phone would know best .
I give up trying to work out how much I owe ; let 's instead try to get the " Unlimited Data " working on this phone .
I 've heard rumours that one has to buy a $ 0 optional extra " Unlimited Web " service since otherwise the " Even More Plus Unlimited Web " is actually limited .
Add additional services on this line ...
Internet & E- mail ...
Aha , here we go .
" T - Mobile Smartphone Unlimited Web with FlexPay " .
That sounds promising .
And it 's free !
Just like the rumours .
Let 's " buy " that and quickly review the charges : Added plan and services ... $ 0 , yup .
Unchanged plan and services ... $ 59.99 .
Yup .
So , the grand total is ... $ 89.99 .
Wait , wait , hold on , let me recheck the maths here ...
$ 0 ... plus $ 59.99 ... carry the one ...
What ??
Ok , ok , clearly it got confused .
Let 's close the browser and start over .
Add additional services on this line ...
Internet & E- mail ...
" T - Mobile Smartphone Unlimited Web with FlexPay " .
And it says FREE .
So we click it again , and let 's see how much $ 59.99 + FREE equals this time : TEN THOUSAND AND EIGHTY EIGHT DOLLARS AND NINETY NINE CENTS ?!
I give up .
I 'll try calling them tomorrow .

Phone " support " I 'm on hold with T - Mobile .
The guy is very nice , but there 's so much interference I can barely hear what he 's saying half the time .
Something about me having to pay a month in advance instead of at the end of the month ( which I prefer anyway ) , and something about the order not going through for " reasons unknown " though he has already done " the credit check " .
Beats me why a credit check is necessary if I 'm paying in advance without a contract , by the way , but that 's another story .
Same thing happened when I paid cash to buy a car recently .
" We need to run a credit check " .
You knock yourself out .
Why can't all this stuff be done by e-mail ?
Really ?
I hate phones .
Time passes .
Hey check this out .
The support guy gave up , and now I 'm doing this all over again with sales !
At least the connection is clearer now .
Ok so I want the $ 59.99 plan , which of course comes with a $ 1.21 non -tax non-government " regulatory " fee and a $ 35 " activation " fee ( given how hard this has been so far , I understand charging an activation fee , though I wonder if we could come to some arrangement wherein I get paid for my part in this ordeal also ) .
" Sir , what is your phone number ? "
Well , I do n't know , are n't you supposed to tell me that ?
I mean , I do n't have a phone , that 's why I 'm buying a phone .
After trying to explain that I just gave them my Google Voice number — it 's not connected to anything but at least they can leave me voicemail , I guess .
Ok , now we have to go through the terms of service ... do n't forget to opt out of the " you ca n't use the legal system if we screw you over " option .
" Actually sir , you can't have Flex Pay , you have to have Take Control . "
I have no idea what that sentence means .
I was n't aware I was trying to get either of those .
What are you talking about .
" Um ... " time passes again " Ok it 's going to be $ 59.99 plus $ 1.25 tax " ( it 's not a tax , that 's a lie , but we 'll let that slide ) " so that 's a total of $ 70 . "
I 'm going to briefly ignore the fact that those numbers do n't add up , and ask where the activation fee went .
" Um ... there 's no activation fee with this plan . "

Why ( And How ) Apple Killed The $ US9.99 Ebook
Publishers joining Apple ’s iBooks store are turning their back on Amazon and its vision of the flat $ US9.99 ebook .
Apple forced the music industry to charge 99 US cents per song , so why are they helping publishers set their own prices ?
To screw Amazon .
The difference between Amazon and Apple is this : Amazon is very much in the ebook business to sell ebooks .
They want you attached to their platform .
That ’s why the Kindle Reader is on both PC and iPhone , as well as the eponymous e-ink device .
Ebooks are huge for them .
They sell six ebooks for every 10 physical books .
Apple , on the other hand , sells content in order to sell hardware .
The iTunes Store , the App Store and the brand - new iBooks Store exist so you ’ll buy iPods , iPhones and iPads , which is where Apple really makes money .
iTunes revenue is just a bonus , though an ever fatter one with the explosion of the App Store .
You can see that the two companies place far different values on the content they sell .
A more illustrative example : Amazon has been selling books at a loss – paying $ US15 for a hardcover bestseller , only to turn around and sell it for $ US10 on the Kindle .
Apple would never , ever sell content at a loss .
They make a decent bit of change , but apps and music are really just a way to fill up your iPhone .
Do you remember three years ago , when Apple was battling with the record labels for control over ( legal ) digital music ?
Apple still owns 69 per cent of the market and sell one out of every four songs , period – in other words , they owned the market , which deeply frightened the labels , who were afraid of losing control .
Universal , the biggest label flipped out , and even tried to build the anti-iTunes .
That failed , so the music business bit the bullet ( or the poison pill ) and went DRM - free , not with Apple , but with Amazon .
For a spell , became a credible competitor to the iTunes monster , long enough to give the labels negotiating power .
When iTunes music downloads went DRM free , many of them – particularly hit singles – suddenly cost $ US1.29 .
The situation is remarkably similar , except this time , Amazon ’s wearing the market - maker pants .
Some estimate Amazon ’s share of the ebook market to be 90 per cent , but I ’ve heard from people in the publishing industry say it ’s closer to 80 per cent .
But that ’s nitpicking .
At this moment , Amazon owns ebooks .
The book publishers ’ fears are the same as the record labels with iTunes :
They ’re paranoid about losing control over pricing , and their own digital destiny .
They ’re worried that books are being undervalued , and that once people have the mindset that the price of an ebook is $ US9.99 , and not a penny more , they ’re doomed .
They needed an insurgent player : Apple .
Apple has advantages that Amazon did n’t have with music : Scale and technology .
iTunes has just moved three billion iPhone apps .
Apple ’s sold over 250 million iPods .
By contrast , Amazon ’s sold an estimate 2.5 - 3 million Kindles since it debuted two years ago .
Analysts predict Apple will sell twice as many iPads this year alone .
In terms of technology , e-ink looks old and busted and slow next to the iPad ’s bright , colour display .
( Even the fact that the written word is much easier to stare at for long periods of time when presented on e-ink wo n’t save the current Kindle . )
An iPad can do more than books : Beautiful digital magazines , interactive textbooks , a dynamic newspaper .
Oh , and it ’s a computer that does video , apps , music .
Amazon ’s scrambling now to make a multitouch full colour Kindle after betting on e-ink , but that kind of development takes at least a year .
Even if they churn out a full colour reader that is somehow better than the iPad , it likely wo n’t matter :
It would just be a very nice reader to iPad ’s everything else , and it would be nine months too late .
The print industry is swirling down the toilet , and apocalypse - era publishers minds ’ dance with hallucinations of digital salvation via iTunes for print .
It ’s the iPod for books .
What Amazon was supposed to deliver , but now maybe never will .
With that contrast in mind , all the publishers needed was a little push .
All Apple had to whisper was , “ Hey , we ’ll let you set your own prices for books .
You should control your own destiny .
We ’d love to have you .
You know , $ US12.99 is a really good price for a beautiful colour version of your amazing books .
BTW , why are you letting Amazon undersell you ? ”
It does n’t matter that publishers make less absolute money through the agency model used by Apple – Amazon might ’ve given them $ US15 for a book it sold for $ US10 , but under the agency model , the seller takes 30 per cent off the top .
They wanted to feel in control , and that their books are worth something more .
Steve gave them that , even as he ’s probably got his fingers crossed behind his back .
Amazon knew what it was doing by insisting on $ US9.99 as the price for ebooks .
A flat , easy - to - understand rate – one that ’s notably cheaper than its analogue counterparters – is a paradigm that works , especially when you ’re trying to essentially build a whole new market .
It plays into the part of our brains that like easy things .
That likes the number nine .
( No really , nine is a psychologically satisfying number . )
Amazon believed in it so strongly , as I said before , they sold books at a loss to keep it up .
Price would ’ve been Amazon ’s major advantage over Apple too – being able to undercut Apple by setting whatever price they needed to compete would ’ve been its ace in the hole against the iPad ’s flashy colour screen , and everything else it can do .
And now that ’s poofed .
Apple will be able to sell you ebooks for the exact same price as Amazon .
By turning the publishers against Amazon , they ’ve effectively dicked the Kindle over .
Why ?
To fill out another bullet point as to why you should buy an iPad .
The real question is how long it ’ll take publishers to realise that ’s all they are to Apple : one little bullet point .
New Zealand 214 for 6 ( McCullum 116 * ) tied with Australia 214 for 4 ( Clarke 67 , White 64 * ) .
New Zealand won after Super Over
Scorecard and ball - by - ball details
Brendon McCullum plays the scoop Getty Images
A superb match needed a Super Over to split the teams and New Zealand prevailed to repay Brendon McCullum for his amazing century .
McCullum became the second - highest scorer in a Twenty20 international with an unbeaten 116 , but after Michael Clarke and Cameron
White exploded in the reply the scores were tied at 214 after 40 overs .
A six - ball tiebreaker was required and the calm Tim Southee delivered another tight over to allow only six runs for White , David Warner and Brad Haddin .
Shaun
Tait 's waywardness , including two wides , assisted the locals and Martin Guptill finished the game with a four over point from the third legitimate delivery .
The hosts were upset by a meek performance in Friday 's one - sided defeat , but McCullum showed his might with an unforgettable 56 - ball demolition on a small ground that was rocking at the start and the end .
Things were much quieter as Clarke organised the chase with 67 from 45 and White provided some much - needed muscle with 64 off 26 in a pursuit that was almost perfectly timed .
However , Clarke and White could only scurry two from the final ball when three were required , with Clarke run out well short of his ground .
Needing two off almost every delivery throughout the second innings , the Australians managed to stay on track after Warner departed for a McCullum - style 20 off 10 .
Haddin ( 47 off 37 ) and Clarke , who was travelling much quicker than his usual pace , were able to stay close to the rate so they required 125 from the final 60 balls .
James Franklin slowed things down briefly with the wickets of Haddin and David Hussey ( 10 ) before White 's brute force arrived .
White warmed up with a six over cover off Daniel Vettori , then caressed an inside - out clearance in the same area and was dropped on the boundary attempting a third .
He then powered two fours and a six off Franklin before flicking Shane Bond into the spectators at square leg .
The 13 that came from Bond 's final over left Australia wanting 36 off 18 deliveries , but the first of three magically controlled Southee efforts made it 30 from 12 .
White survived a run-out and found two boundaries and a six down the ground off Jacob Oram to cut the margin to 12 .
In Southee 's final over the bowler showed the maturity of a 30 - year - old , not a boy who is 21 , by delivering more pin-point yorkers to keep his side in the game .
And he proved it was n't a fluke by doing it again in the Super Over .
The result levelled the series and delivered Australia their first loss of their summer while setting up an intriguing five - match one - day contest beginning on Wednesday .
Despite the flurry of absorbing action at the end , it was McCullum 's fireworks over the first half of the match that were the highlight .
He showered boundaries around the tiny stadium and the change in attitude left the Australians , who had rested Mitchell Johnson and Shane Watson , wondering if there was any way to stop the run avalanche .
They were able to slow it a couple of times , but McCullum carried his team through the loss of six wickets and achieved the side 's highest total .
His hundred came up in 50 balls , equalling the record of Chris Gayle , the only other century - maker in this format .
It was achieved with a single to deep cover , at which point the batsman ripped off his helmet to take in the applause , but he was not finished and carried his bat .
Nathan McCullum joined his brother at the end , getting 14 in a 50 - run stand in 3.2 overs on an afternoon that stunned everyone .
The big crowd of 26,148 was sprinkled by McCullum 's eight sixes and he backed up with a dozen fours during the barrage .
Four of the boundaries came with " McScoops " past or over the wicketkeeper , but that was nothing compared to the two sixes he managed to shovel behind himself off Tait .
It was brave and brutal - one of the clearances off Tait came from a 155 kph thunderbolt .
McCullum proved he would n't be intimidated by Australia 's quick bowlers when he charged the third ball of the day from Tait ( 2 for 40 ) and bashed him for four through cover .
There were 10 runs from the eventful over , which also contained the ugly bowled of the out - classed Peter Ingram for 0 and Tait sending a finger signal to McCullum .
In the second over McCullum planted a six through cover off Dirk Nannes ' opening delivery , was almost caught next ball top edging a pull , and quickly flicked him to fine leg for a boundary .
The new - ball bowlers could n't match Friday 's performance as they gave up 42 in the first four overs .
McCullum ended up on his back after his first attempt to scoop Nannes over the wicketkeeper , but he managed it the second time , with the ball just missing Haddin on the way to the boundary .
He followed up by unleashing a huge six to midwicket to show he could mix the unorthodox and the traditional .
Nannes returned for the 16th over and McCullum enjoyed swinging him twice into the stands on the legside as the bowler went for 51 off four .
After losing the strike in the middle stages when some of his team - mates disappeared , McCullum focused by blasting a fierce straight four off Steven Smith and brought up his half - century in the same over when he pulled to midwicket .
He dusted off the scoop to surprise Daniel Christian and then pulled him for six behind square - 57 of his runs came in that segment .
Gareth Hopkins ( 36 off 17 ) was the perfect ally for McCullum as they put on 68 in five overs to regain their explosive momentum .
McCullum kept going till the end and had a chance to seal the game in the Super Over , but he was as happy as every other local when Guptill squared the series .

You 've likely seen the Patrice Cormier flying elbow already , and if not you can find it at the bottom of this post .
After the hit made the waves on Twitter , a common debate ensued : whether Tam 's injury should determine the length of Cormier 's suspension .
Common sense quickly dictates that it should n't .
After all , whether Tam is out for two games or twenty does not change Cormier 's actions -- Cormier went for a dirty hit , and it's that hit he should be punished for .
What happens to Tam is not only based on Cormier 's hit , but his own susceptibility to injury : there 's a difference between Tim Connolly getting injured and the same happening to Doug Jarvis .
However , injury will always be a determining factor in the length of a suspension , and there are several reasons for it .
The first is that if there 's no injury -- the victim does n't even miss a shift -- then there tends to be complete disinterest on the part of the opposing team and fans for punishment .
Think about it : for every hit from behind that results in concussion or worse , there 's about ten or so that do n't result in any injury .
Those ones that do n't result in injury rarely create an outcry the next day .
A second reason can be found by looking to similar external sources .
Seeing as the suspension policy is based on the same foundation as criminal law -- deterrence , punishment , etc. -- what happens for attempts in the criminal law ?
An attempted murder , which requires all of the forethought and intention of actual murder ( but merely features an unsuccessful perpetrator ) , does not result in nearly the penalty as murder , and that does not seem to really bother the community at large .
And while a hockey injury is a far cry from murder , there is an undeniable connection in these scenarios between what common sense says should happen and what the community at large needs to be satisfied .
And the community is , in fact , the largest reason that injuries dictate suspension length .
Fans base their own perceptions of the player 's intentions based on the aftermath of a hit rather than the intentions , and there 's no denying it : when was the last time you cried out for a suspension of a player that attempted a knee - on - knee or elbow but missed his target ?
You probably never have , and likely never will .
Whether your favourite player gets up after a hit or continues to lie on the ice undoubtedly shapes your view of the incident and what the consequences should be .
So even if common sense dictates that the injury should n't factor into the suspension conversation it always will , because that 's what you want -- even if you do n't realize it .
A little over a week ago I delved into a troubling topic :
Why are so many civil rights groups and members of the Congressional Black Caucus opposing net neutrality ?
It seemed strange to me that leaders in communities of color would be echoing discredited telecommunications industry talking points .
For those not familiar with the term " net neutrality , " it describes the rules and practices that currently keep the Internet a free and open communication medium .
Net neutrality guarantees that blogs , small businesses , and organizations are on a level playing field with the largest corporations .
Whether you 're GM or an individual , the content you put online is accessible and delivered in the same way , with the same priority , and nothing is blocked .
For communities of color , net neutrality is key .
It keeps barriers to Internet entrepreneurship low so that anyone with a good idea and some technical savvy can join the 21st century economy .
Predictably , the major players in the broadband industry have been fighting the FCC 's efforts to adopt rules that would solidify net neutrality principles into law , because scrapping net neutrality would enable them to make even more money by creating new revenue streams .
Ironically , civil rights leaders and CBC members have joined the dominant players .
Their stated reasoning : the belief that net neutrality rules could hurt efforts to close the digital divide .
The problem is that , as far as I can see , the argument does n't hold water .
It falls apart whether you approach it from the perspective of business , common sense , or history .
My hope in writing my first post was that it might encourage civil rights leaders who have opposed or questioned net neutrality to publicly explain their positions .
Given what 's at stake , I think its incumbent on leaders opposing or questioning net neutrality to publicly make clear why .
Unfortunately , none have done so .
While leadership remained silent , my post did elicit some responses , which follow the same pattern -- uncritically echoing industry talking points while trying to change the subject from the arguments I put on the table .
Take , for example , the open letter posted by Navarrow Wright , a former television and Internet executive and current strategic consultant .
I gather from Wright 's resume that he is an accomplished and intelligent guy , but his criticism of my piece typifies the shoddy argumentation and confusing of issues from the loudest voices against net neutrality .
While Wright failed to engage the arguments I put on the table , in the interest of public debate , I want to take on his assumptions one by one .
Wright opens :
... the civil rights groups fought hard to make sure the FCC developed the principles of net neutrality -- this is nothing new , we 've been living with net neutrality since 2004 .
Those principles made it possible for you to create Color of Change and for Senator Barack Obama to become President Obama .
You should thank the people that helped make it all happen .
Instead you question their sincerity .
It 's his first attempt to side - step the issues .
The question is n't about whether the civil rights organizations in question were at one point instrumental in establishing our current net neutrality principles ( a claim which I have yet to find any evidence to back up ) .
The question is why these leaders are opposing the policy now , and it's one they should be able to answer .
Over and over during the course of this debate , many of these leaders have acted as though it 's disrespectful ( or worse ) to ask them for evidence to back up their claims about net neutrality .
This appears to be a tactic designed to shut down any discussion of the actual issues at hand .
Wright continues by echoing the industry talking point , " We all know the fight today is between Google and the ISPs . "
While there are several powerful business interests at play , it has no bearing on my concerns or arguments .
The broadband industry would love to portray the fight over net neutrality as one between themselves and Google , but my support for net neutrality reflects the views of thousands of independent filmmakers and musicians , community organizers and activists , and Internet entrepreneurs struggling to harness the power of the Internet to launch new products .
And while we look at who 's talking , I think it 's important to look at the relationships in play .
My organization has n't taken a dime from Google or any other corporation with a key interest in either side of the debate .
Many of the organizations most vocally opposing net neutrality would have difficulty saying the same .
Wright continues :
Do n't you think the FCC should answer the questions raised by the civil rights leaders and CBC ?
Why is it wrong to ask the FCC to make sure the rules they are proposing will not widen the digital divide ?
Why is it wrong to ask the FCC to make sure the rules they develop will not lead to regressive pricing which would shackle poor people ?
Why is it wrong to ask that the costs be borne by the people that cause them and not by the underserved ?
Why are you so afraid of the answers to these questions ?
Throughout his piece he asserts that the civil rights groups are only “ asking questions " that we “ should n’t be afraid to answer . ”
After reading it a couple of times , I realized where I had seen this technique before : Wright ’s piece -- and the broader arguments he seeks to defend -- are the rhetorical equivalent of a push poll .
Push polls are a well known and highly effective political trick .
They ask questions that insert into the public consciousness a false idea , positioning a baseless assumption as plausible .
Navarrow Wright , and the civil rights organizations he is defending , are effectively “ push - polling ” net neutrality .
They are asking the question , “ If you knew that net neutrality would widen the digital divide , would you support it ? ”
The question is asked without any evidence to suggest that the premise of the question is true , but the question itself alters the frame of the debate .
The effect has been real -- FCC commissioners who know the truth about net neutrality are being held hostage by debunked theories , as they do n’t want to be perceived as embracing policy that could hurt minority communities .
Finally , Wright suggests that the FCC has a bad record on issues of concern to communities of color :
Maybe you do n't quite grasp why minority leadership is vexed .
Perhaps you 're too young to understand why many of our elders , who 've given their lives and wear the scars of the struggle , feel the need to seek the truth .
You might not understand why they do n't trust the FCC to get it right .
Understandable mistakes if this is your first foray into media and communications issues ... but there is a long history behind their deep skepticism and it makes sense that they would question the FCC on its intended course of action .
Putting aside the personal attack against me , if you follow Wright 's reasoning then we should obstruct the ability of the US Congress to make laws even when they 're in the interest of our communities , as is the case with net neutrality .
For example , in 1964 Congress had a very poor record of protecting the interests of communities of color .
Would he have then questioned whether we could trust Congress to pass the Voting Rights Act ?
Let me restate what I keep hearing from net neutrality ’s detractors .
The reasoning seems to be that if we give broadband providers the legal authority to discriminate on content , which will allow them to increase their profits , they will suddenly become benevolent and invest in expanding their networks or lower broadband prices .
The reasoning is just not borne out by reality .
These companies are earning as much as 80 percent profit margins on their broadband services ; despite this , they have n't -- except when forced -- made broadband more affordable for poorer communities in any systematic way that would spur adoption .
Worse , it was just reported that major broadband companies are actively attempting to block broadband expansion and adoption plans by smaller players when it presents competition for them .
I 'd still like to hear a response from those groups that say they represent the interests of communities of color , but are in line with the broadband providers .
If there 's a credible argument to be made against network neutrality , I 'd like to hear it and engage it .
I 've put my arguments out there , and I 've addressed the opposing arguments .
Now I hope other civil rights leaders will join the conversation .
Before his death in 1977 , Vladimir Nabokov instructed his wife , Vera , to burn the unfinished draft of a novel called " The Original of Laura " — a handwritten mélange of notes on 138 index cards .
Vera ignored the instruction .
Instead , she temporized for 16 years about whether to publish the book in its incomplete form , and never did .
When she died in 1991 , the cards were still locked in a Swiss bank vault .
Dmitri Nabokov , the novelist 's 75 - year - old son , has now liberated them .
Indeed , they are displayed for all to see , precisely duplicated on detachable cards — one per page , with printed transcriptions underneath — in the ...
Barney Frank took the gloves off on the floor and called John Fund out for making up a story about a phony bill and then he outlined how the right wing noise machine works as a propaganda arm of the republicans to push that narrative into the mainstream .
Frank :
You are entirely wrong about me and in the absence of your being able to show any basis which you made such a statement to ask you to acknowledge that fact .
He 's not only a liar , he 's a coward .
He would n't do it .
My staff member asked him , called him up and said , what was this based on ?
Well , I made a mistake .
Well , have you made a retraction ?
Oh , yeah , he said .
Can we see it ?
" I told a couple of people . "
Mr. Fund makes it up .
It 's a lie , it 's a myth .
There was nothing there and it's to discredit all democrats .
His right - wing cohorts echo it and echo it .
The next thing is it will be on the floor in the next two weeks .
This is the democrat disregard for the electoral process .
And when we call Mr. Fund 's attention to the fact that this was a lie , what does he say ?
Whoops .
but he 's not going to tell anybody about it .
Mr. Speaker , this is not the only case of this and I know this has happened before .
But because I was directly involved here , I was in position to document this .
It begins with a lie from this editorial writer from " the Wall street journal . " it is then a lie repeated by his right - ring colleagues .
He refuses to do anything about .
It does n't get any clearer than that .
Frank posted the entire story on the web .
Frank responded to fabricated accounts of his supposed plans to introduce a bill on “ universal voter registration . ”
The story began in November at the conservative Restoration Weekend conference in Palm Beach , Florida , where for $ 1,700 per person activists were able to hear talks by conservative opinion leaders on the theme , “ Defending our Country and Culture . ”
At one session , John Fund , a writer for the editorial pages of the Wall Street Journal , claimed that Congressman Barney Frank and Senator Chuck Schumer had hatched a plan to game the election system by registering felons , illegal aliens and others to vote : Democrats were very rattled by the November 3rd election results .
What do liberals do when they lose elections ?
They change the rules .
In January , Chuck Schumer and Barney Frank will propose universal voter registration .
What is universal voter registration ?
It means all of the state laws on elections will be overridden by a federal mandate .
The feds will tell the states , “ Take everyone on every list of welfare recipients you have , take everyone on every list of unemployed you have , take everyone on every list of property owners , take everyone on every list of driver ’s license holders , and register them to vote regardless of whether they want to be . ”
The allegation against Congressman Frank is absolutely false and has no basis in reality .
The Congressman in fact heard about it for the first time after the story was launched in the conservative media .
On January 5th , Glenn Beck of Fox News , which like the Wall Street Journal is owned by Rupert Murdoch , repeated the same fallacious story , specifically citing John Fund as his source .
The next day , Rush Limbaugh retold the story on nationwide radio , also quoting Fund .
On January 7th , the Washington Times , owned by Reverend Sun Yung Moon ’s Unification Church , ran an editorial titled “ Letting Crooks and Illegals Vote . ”
None of the outlets called Frank ’s office to verify the story .
In addition , right - wing web sites have also posted the story online , often embedding video of Mr. Fund ’s talk , giving the fictitious story an even longer life - span .
Congressman Frank addressed a letter to John Fund on January 13th , asking the writer to either corroborate or publicly repudiate his statement .
When called by a staffer who was seeking a fax number for Mr. Fund , Fund claimed that he had issued a retraction .
When asked for a copy of the retraction , he stated that he had not actually issued a written correction , but that he had simply told a few inquiring bloggers that he had made a mistake .
To date , Mr. Fund has still not issued a public retraction .
Fund 's idea of a retraction was to tell a few people .
The Wall Street Journal should suspend him from their pages if they had any real integrity .
Fund did his job well .
Promote a lie and then watch it take off because he knows that once the story is out there --- then it 's out there .
Greg from the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association sez ,
It 's not just the U.S. border guards who want to search the files on your laptop and cellphone .
The Canada Border Services Agency has been doing the same thing for years .
From U.S. journalist Amy Goodman to a Canadian gay couple whose collection of porn got border agents all hot and bothered , the CBSA likes to look just as much as its counterpart in the U.S .
The biggest difference between U.S. border guards and the CBSA is that the CBSA has n't made their policy for laptop searches public .
Judging by how they 've handled the BC Civil Liberties Association 's Access to Information request , they 'd like to keep it that way .
Back in October 2009 , the BCCLA filed an Access to Information Request with the CBSA looking for their policies on searching personal electronics and copying data from them .
We got a polite acknowledgement , and we settled in to wait for the 30 days allowed by the Access to Information Act .
On November 30 , 2009 , we got another letter from the CBSA saying that they 'd need another 60 days to meet the request , because a timely response would " unreasonably interfere with the operations of the government institution " and " consultations are necessary to comply with the request . "
We settled in to wait again .
February 1 came and went .
Three months after the original request was filed , the CBSA remains unwilling or unable to provide a single document in response to our request .
We 've written up an overview of the file and put the correspondence online .
We 'll be posting more about this over the next few weeks , and we 'll be putting documents online as soon as we get them .
Abu Kuther sits in the candlelight , casually flicking his left wrist and sending a long string of prayer beads arching into the air .
" There is a famous Arabic saying , " he says .
" There are many ways to die but death is always the same . "
Kuther , interviewed in a secret location in Baghdad for the Guardian , said he was one of the kidnappers of five Britons taken from a government ministry building in the Baghdad in May 2007 .
He has told the Guardian that he was a member of militia group called the " Righteous League " – what he does n't admit is that the league is a front for the Iranian Quds force created , trained and funded by Iran , and that the kidnapping of the five Britons was led by al - Quds force commandos .
The kidnapper spoke to the Guardian after being identified by a senior leader for the Righteous League and a member of the family of the man later exchanged as part of the deal which saw Peter Moore 's freedom .
A year - long investigation by the Guardian can reveal that Iran 's Islamic regime – and specifically the al - Quds force – was heavily involved in the kidnapping of the five men .
The Quds force runs overseas intelligence operations for the Iranian government .
The other Britons captured with Moore – all security guards – were Alec Maclachlan from Llanelli in Wales , Alan McMenemy from Dumbarton in Scotland , Jason Swindlehurst and Jason Creswell .
The bodies of Swindlehurst and Creswell were identified after they were handed over in June , followed by Maclachlan 's in September .
McMenemy is also believed to be dead , though his body has so far not been returned .
Just one , Peter Moore , made it out of Iran alive .
Motives
And the Iranian regime 's motives for the abduction can be confirmed : retaliation for the arrest of key Iranians in Iraq by the United States ; anger at the direct threats against Iran by President George W Bush and the desire to prevent Moore , the computer expert among the five kidnap victims , from installing a sophisticated tracking system that would show how billions of pounds in international aid money from Iraqi institutions was diverted to Iran 's militia groups in Iraq .
The narrative surrounding the hostage taking has been well - rehearsed .
On the morning of Wednesday , 29 May , 2007 , Moore , a computer specialist working for Bearing Point contractors , arrived at the technology centre of the Ministry of Finance in central Baghdad .
He was joined by another man , Peter Donkin , another specialist , and the four British bodyguards .
The job the team was working on was to install , and train staff on , a new software system which was designed to track billions in aid as well as the huge revenues generated by the Iraqi oil industry .
Iraq 's ministries were notoriously corrupt and according to evidence given to the US Congress , as much as $ 18 bn ( £ 11 bn ) in aid and funds had gone missing in recent years .
The British team had been in the technology centre for only a matter of hours when between 80 and 100 armed men , apparently dressed in the uniforms of Iraq 's ministry of the interior , arrived in a fleet of 4x4s and stormed the building .
One witness , Wihaib Allawi , a janitor at the Ministry , told the Guardian : " They kept shouting in English ' sit down , sit down ' to everyone they saw . "
Another witness , Haider Sa'adoon , an administrative assistant , claims the kidnappers " were talking in a language we could n't understand " .
Moore and the four bodyguards were bundled into separate cars and driven off at speed into the mayhem of Baghdad 's traffic .
Donkin , who was in the lavatory at the time the kidnappers arrived , escaped detection after the Iraqi staff tried to protect him by hiding him under floorboards .
The kidnappers missed him .
So much is known .
But what happened next can be revealed for the first time .
Unknown to the kidnappers , they were followed by undercover agents working for Iraq 's intelligence service who , by chance , had been outside the Ministry of Finance when the men were taken .
A former senior Iraqi intelligence commander has told the Guardian that the agents , who worked for him directly , followed the convoy of cars into Sadr City .
It is here in the dusty , airless suburb of east Baghdad that the men spent their first night in captivity , in the al - Zahra mosque .
That night British intelligence and the employers of the bodyguards , GardaWorld , searched Sadr City looking for them , desperately trying to confirm reports that they were hidden in a disused petrol station .
GardaWorld admits to allowing the kidnap and ransom insurance of the four security guards to lapse due to a " clerical error " before the abductions .
The intelligence officers passed the news that the men were inside the mosque up the command chain at the Iraqi Ministry of Defence .
It was still early in the afternoon , but it was to no avail as no action was taken .
The next day – nearly 24 hours after the kidnapping – the prisoners were on the move again .
The Guardian 's intelligence source said : " They left the mosque , the second day at 8 am .
Our two guys followed the cars ... they followed the cars at a distance and the cars went towards al - Obaidi , towards the brick factory .
It is an area where several brick factories are and the road ends with a dusty route that leads towards the Iraqi - Iranian border ... it is the shortest way between Baghdad and the borders .
It is a desert area full of sand hills , no one lives there . "
He continued : " Past the brick factories , there were cars waiting for them .
While they were transferring the hostages to the other cars , our two guys were hanging around , pretending that they were buying bricks for their houses .
One of our guys was negotiating and the other was watching the cars .
" They saw when they moved the British hostages from one car to another – each one into a separate car .
They saw that they were hooded and handcuffed .
The cars went in the direction of the Iranian border – because the road is unpaved and dusty , it can take up to an hour and a half to reach the border .
But the road they took only leads only one way – to Iran . "
There was a window of some 17 hours to rescue the five British men but Iraqi intelligence officials were told not to tell anyone what they had seen .
" They immediately told their boss , who called his boss at the Defence Ministry , " according to the Iraqi intelligence source .
" The following day a message came back saying : ' You must forget all about this subject , completely forget it , act as if you know nothing and tell your colleagues not to say a word ' . "
Secreted
The Guardian has asked Iraq 's Defence Ministry on a number of occasions to respond to this allegation – so far they have not responded .
Once in Iran the hostages passed through the border town of Mehran .
They were moved between different locations in Iran for several months – including the holy city of Qom , where they were secreted in basements in the Zimbeilebad district , a mainly Iraqi area .
A former major in the Revolutionary Guard , who worked in the organisation for more than 14 years , has identified two other prisons where he believes the men were held .
The major , who cannot be identified and who now lives outside Iran , says one is an al - Quds camp near a salt lake about 25 miles from Qom and the other is nearer the Iraqi border .
" My contact works for al - Quds , " the major said .
" He took part in the planning of the kidnap and he watched the kidnapping as it was taking place .
He told me that they spent two days at the Qasser Shiereen camp .
They then took them deep inside Iran .
My contact also told me they stayed in the salt lake camp for a month ... they separated the hostages .
" Everything in the prison gave the impression that they are in Iraq , not Iran : the guards , the buildings and even the cars .
The uniforms used by security are all Iraqi to give the impression that they are being held in Iraq . "
The major said he had no doubts the Iranian regime directly planned the kidnapping .
" The kidnapping at the Ministry of Finance was done was led by the Republican Guard al - Quds force , " he said .
" They work in cells : every cell is made up of five men .
The head of each cell is Iranian , a member of the al - Quds force , and the four others are Iraqis .
They prepare for every operation in the most minute of detail in Iran … they study tiny , minuscule things .
They specialise in creating perfect disguises for their men who take part in operations like this . "
Iranian involvement has also been confirmed by a senior serving Iraqi government minister with close links to Iran .
" This was an IRG ( Iranian Revolutionary Guard ) operation , " he said .
" You do n't think for a moment that those militia groups from Sadr City could have carried out a high - level kidnapping like this one . "
Although there appear to have been multiple locations where the hostages were held , the city of Qom became the centre for negotiation for the release of all the hostages .
It was where negotiators were sent to try to secure the release of the men ; it was also where videos of the hostages were handed over for eventual broadcast .
According to the Guardian 's information the chief negotiator , Sami al - Askari , would fly from Baghdad into the airport at Mahaabad .
From there he would be driven to meet the leader of the kidnappers in Qom .
The man who held the life and death of the five Britons in his hands in Qom was a senior leader for the Righteous League .
Trained and funded by al - Quds , he was one of their main operatives in Iraq .
He and his deputy are believed to be the only men who visited the five Britons while they were in Iran .
In the beginning the kidnappers made contact with the Hostage Working Group appointed by the Foreign Office every two or three weeks but , according to documents from the men's employers , BearingPoint and GardaWorld , the contact then tailed off .
The problem for the men was that once the Foreign Office became involved in the kidnapping , the option of paying a ransom had to be ruled out according to official government policy .
But the kidnappers did n't want more money .
They wanted concessions , including withdrawal from Iraq from the British and American governments .
They also wanted the release of the man running Iran 's military operation in Iraq , Qais al Khazali .
One Foreign Office source said : " The problem with dealing with the Iranians is that , with them there is always ' another demand ' . "
According to one of the leaders of the Righteous League who spoke to the Guardian the negotiations did not go well .
The autopsy reports on the bodies of three of the men discovered that Jason Creswell and Jason Swindlehurst , both of whom were former paratroopers , had been killed some time between March and May 2008 and their bodies buried at secret locations in Iraq .
" We killed them because we said we would kill them if our demands were not met .
And we have lived up to our promises , " the Righteous League leader said in June , just before the first two bodies were found .
An Iraqi intelligence source said : " The first four were killed soon after [ the kidnapping ] .
They had no use for them .
They are trouble .
The computer expert was the valuable one . "
The government minister , who has had direct contact with the leader of the kidnappers in Qom , also said that he believed that Swindlehurst , Creswell , Maclachlan and McMenemy were executed by their captors because they were " just bodyguards " .
" In the Middle East those kind of men are regarded as mercenaries , they are disposable .
Peter Moore was seen as the valuable catch .
" It was clear to the Britons when they got the bodies that this was an execution .
The men had their hands tied in front of their bodies and had been shot , " said the minister .
" Peter Moore was the golden egg , " according to Abu Rahman , an Iraqi journalist who made contact with the kidnappers on behalf the Guardian .
According to the interview carried out by Guardian films with Kuther , they initially had been tasked with spying on foreign consultants working in the ministries .
He said Peter Moore was targeted because he was a computer specialist : " We had detailed information about him and the work he was doing .
We had planned to kidnap him in person and we knew that there was another man who was an expert too – but he was out of our reach . "
The events that led to the kidnappings began shortly after the US president , George Bush , ratcheted up the pressure on the Iranians with a televised address to the world warning Iran to stay out of Iraq and pull back their proxies .
Documents
Iran responded with an unprecedented attack on a US base in Karbala nine days later .
The attack had the hallmarks of the al - Quds kidnap section of the Revolutionary Guard , according to the major who spoke to the Guardian .
The Guardian has also obtained documents released by the US military under the Freedom of Information act .
The documents reveal how the al - Quds operatives '
English was so perfect that the Iraqi guards at the checkpoints " were convinced the attackers were American " .
When the attackers entered the compound they shot dead Private Millican .
Four other US soldiers were kidnapped and spirited away in US - style vehicles .
They were tracked down by US helicopters but before evading capture they shot dead their handcuffed captives .
Tit - for - tat incidents continued with the arrest by the US of Khazali and his brother in Basra in March that year .
Khazali is alleged to have been the mastermind behind the Karbala killings , and also the appointed head of all Iranian special groups in Iraq .
The next move – the kidnap of the Britons from the Ministry of Finance – by the Righteous League and the al - Quds force was to be decisive and was designed to achieve two aims .
The first was to halt the project Moore was working on .
The sophisticated computer system being installed would have exposed any corrupt practices in the Ministry of Finance .
Judge Radhi Hamza al - Radhi , former commissioner of the Commission of Public Integrity in Iraq , testified to the US Congress on 4 October 2007 : " The cost of corruption that my commission has uncovered so far across all ministries in Iraq has been estimated to be as high as $ 18bn . "
He had fled to the US in August 2007 after his family 's home was targeted in a rocket attack .
Vance Jochim , who was the chief auditor and a US adviser for the Commission of Public Integrity based at the US embassy in Baghdad , has previously told the Guardian : " The new system would provide more transparency and accountability over the oil and other revenue handled by the finance ministry " – which he said had been resisting its implementation for nearly two years .
Eight months after the kidnappings , the only other location with a full record of the Iraqi government 's financial transactions and records of possible financial misconduct – Iraq 's Central Bank – was destroyed in a fire .
The subsequent investigation found that it was arson .
The intelligence source said : " Many people do n't want a high level of corruption to be revealed .
Remember this is the information technology centre , this is the place where all the money to do with Iraq and all Iraq 's financial matters are housed .
The centre is linked to the Americans and all the money transfers .
Everything , right down to the last penny , is in that centre . "
But if one aim was to avoid detection of corruption , the second aim was to bargain for the release of the Khazali brothers .
In the end that was achieved , although not before the four bodyguards surrounding Peter Moore had been killed .
Robert Baer , ex-CIA operative and author of several books , says the Iranian tactics are familiar and have changed little over the years .
" High - profile kidnappings have always been part of the Iranian tactics .
In Lebanon the proxy groups they used to carry out the kidnapping were called ' Islamic Jihad ' – in Iraq these days they call them the ' Righteous League ' .
The name does n't matter – it is Iran who is behind them . "
But despite there being a final deal to release the only living hostage , questions have been asked about the tactics employed by the British authorities throughout the ordeal .
According to a confidential document released by the five men's employers , the media plan endorsed by the Foreign office was " for minimal exposure " .
The companies employing the men also said they had pursued a policy of encouraging the families to keep a low profile because it was in the best interests of the men .
Over the months the profile of the hostages gradually diminished .
Spiritual leader
Since the kidnappings , the Foreign Office has never confirmed that they were taken to Iran and will say only that they did n't know where they were .
The official line has always been that : " Her Majesty 's Government policy is not to facilitate or pay ransoms or make substantive concessions to the hostage takers . "
But the Guardian has learned that approaches were made to the Iranians through the British Embassy in Tehran - though not directly to the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who is the spiritual leader of al - Quds force .
Iraqi intelligence sources have also claimed that British intelligence – one of the best intelligence services operating in Iraq – knew that the five Britons had been taken to Iran .
" The British are the best , they know exactly what is going on . "
So why then did they not approach the spiritual leader and ask for the release of the five men ?
" Deals had been done with Iran for the release of the British sailors – so why could n't a deal have been done for our guys ? " asked the father of one of the hostages , Denis McMenemy , a 57 - year - old former paratrooper who works nights stacking shelves at Morrisons in Dumbarton .
Baer agrees :
" The Americans have failed every single time , on every important incident between Tehran and Washington .
" And so has Britain , by not talking to the Iranians , by not establishing a channel to Khamenei 's office .
Not through the foreign ministry , not through the embassy , but to Khamenei 's office , it 's a diplomatic failure . "
Iraq 's national security adviser , Mowaffak al - Rubaie , who had been in direct contact with the kidnappers in Iran also agrees :
" The kidnapping is a very complicated issue in the region .
" The other thing the Foreign Office could have done was to talk to the regional players in the region .
But the modus operandi would have never been reaching out to Iran .
It was a taboo you should avoid . "
Over the last year , three funeral processions have wound their way through the streets of Wales , Scotland and England – carrying the bodies of Jason Creswell , Jason Swindlehurst and Alec Maclachlan .
A fourth will take place in Glasgow for the funeral of Alan McMenemy .
In the end only Peter Moore made it out of Iran alive .
For Kuther , the question of compassion does n't come into the calculus of kidnapping .
" I do n't mean to hurt the families , but they knew there was a risk when their sons went to occupy another country .
What they were afraid of has happened .
It has happened to their five sons . "

Compiling to Java
In my advanced compilers class , we cover a range of intermediate and target languages .
C is a popular target language for performance reasons , but Java has often - overlooked advantages .
Some of Java 's less - utilized features conspire to make it an easy target for high - level language constructs , e.g. , lexically scoped closures become anonymous classes .
It takes roughly a third to half the time ( and code ) to write a compiler that targets Java instead of C .
In fact , we can compile the essential core of Scheme to Java with purely local transforms .
( Scheme 's macro system can easily desugar full Scheme into core Scheme . )
As a result , the reference compiler at the bottom of this page is barely over 400 lines of highly - commented code .
( The companion compiler into C is just over 1000 lines of code . )
Helpful resources :
The official Java Language Specification covers the nooks and crannies of the language which , while rarely or never used in ordinary programming , become extremely convenient during compilation .
Related blog posts :
Pros and cons
On top of these implementation benefits , targeting Java gives the language access to the Java library system , the portability of the JVM , just - in - time compilation / optimization and garbage collection .
The lack of tail - call optimization in Java is a downside with the direct compilation strategy , but it 's possible to do less direct compilation into Java that performs tail - call optimization with trampolining .
More broadly , in my class , I teach that language implementation is about trade - offs between implementation complexity and performance :
I argue that first , you should try an interpreter for your language .
If that 's not fast enough , try an SICP - style optimizing interpreter .
If that 's not good enough , try compiling to Java .
If that 's still not fast enough , try compiling to C .
If that 's still too slow , try continuation - passing - style compilation to assembly .
If you need more speed , start doing basic compiler optimizations .
If you 're still out of luck , start doing static - analysis - driven compiler optimizations .
Each time you go down from n to n + 1 on this ladder , performance will go up , but implementation code size and complexity will go up by about a factor of two .
It turns out that Java occupies a sweet spot : relatively low implementation complexity , but the biggest percentage - wise gain in performance .
Core Scheme with Sugar
The compiler I created is for a core Scheme , but it would not be hard to apply these same techniques to compiling a language like Python or Ruby :
< exp > ::= < const > | < prim > | < var > | ( lambda ( < var > ... ) < exp > ) | ( if < exp > < exp > < exp > ) | ( set ! < var > < exp > ) | ( let ( ( < var > < exp > ) ... ) < exp > ) | ( letrec ( ( < var > ( lambda ( < var > ... ) < exp > ) ) ) < exp > ) | ( begin < exp > ... ) | ( < exp > < exp > ... ) < const > ::= < int >
A Scheme compiler could easily use macros to desugar full Scheme into this language , or in fact , an even simpler one .
Many real Scheme compilers do exactly that .
Encoding Scheme values in Java
The first task in compiling to Java is to come up with a Java - level encoding of the corresponding Scheme values .
To do that , I created the Java interface Value , and had all Scheme values inherit from that .
The sub-classes and - interfaces of Value include VoidValue , BooleanValue , IntValue , ProcValue and Primitive .
The Java stub code also provies a RuntimeEnvironment class , which binds all of the top - level primitives like addition , subtraction and I/O to Java names .
Compiled programs are supposed to inherit from RuntimeEnvironment .
The top - level compile function has a typically Schemish dispatching feel :
; java - compile - exp : exp -> string ( define ( java - compile - exp exp ) ( cond ; core forms : (( const ? exp ) ( java - compile - const exp ) ) ( ( prim ? exp ) ( java - compile - prim exp ) ) ( ( ref? exp ) ( java - compile - ref exp ) ) ( ( lambda ? exp ) ( java - compile - lambda exp ) ) ( ( if? exp ) ( java - compile - if exp ) ) ( ( set !? exp ) ( java - compile - set ! exp ) ) ; syntactic sugar : ( ( let? exp ) ( java - compile - exp ( let=>lambda exp ) ) ) ( ( letrec1 ? exp ) ( java - compile - exp ( letrec1 = > Y exp ) ) ) ( ( begin ? exp ) ( java - compile - exp ( begin= > let exp ) ) ) ; applications : ( ( app? exp ) ( java - compile - app exp ) ) ) )
Integers
So , compilation breaks down into individual constructs .
Integers compile into a IntValue objects , rather than to themselves .
For example , Scheme - level 3 compiles to new IntValue ( 3 ) in Java .
Primitives
Primitives are looked up in table and translated into their RuntimeEnvironment name :
( define ( java - compile - prim p ) ( cond ( ( eq ? '+ p ) " sum " ) ( ( eq ? '- p ) " difference " ) ( ( eq ? '* p ) " product " ) ( ( eq ? '= p ) " numEqual " ) ( ( eq ? ' display p ) " display " ) ( else ( error " unhandled primitive " p ) ) ) )
Variable references
Variable references have to be name - mangled , since Scheme identifiers are richer than Java identfiers .
Mutable variables ( those which are set !'d ) are also handled differently .
These are wrapped in ValueCell objects and prefixed with m_ , since variables captured by anonymous functions in Java have to be marked final .
A pre-compilation code walk finds all of the mutable variables .
Lambda terms
Lambda terms are compiled into anonymous classes .
For example , ( lambda ( v1 ... vN ) exp ) becomes :
new NullProcValueN ( ) { public apply ( final Value [ mangle v1 ] , ... , final Value [ mangle vN ] ) { // for each mutable formal vi : final ValueCell m_[mangle vi ] = new ValueCell ( [ mangle vi ] ) ; return [ compile exp ] ; }
NullProcValueN
NullProcValue
Value
There is aclass for each procedure arity .
Theclasses provide default definitions for some of the methods defined in
Clearly , [ mangle v ] stands for the mangled name of the variable v , and [ compile exp ] stands for the compiled text of exp .
Conditionals
The form ( if exp1 exp2 exp3 ) actually compiles into the ternary operator ? : instead of if ( ) {} else {} :
( [ compile exp1 ] ) ? ( [ compile exp2 ] ) : ( [ compile exp3 ] )
Mutable variables
The construct ( set! var exp ) relies on the compilation of lambda terms and variables references to wrap var in a ValueCell , so that it compiles to :
VoidValue .
Void ( m_[ mangle var ] .value = [ compile exp ] )
Variable binding
The let construct desugars into the application of a lambda term .
That is , ( let ( ( v e ) ... ) body ) becomes :
(( lambda ( v ... ) body ) e ...)
Recursion
Letrec can be desugared into " lets and sets " or the Y combinator .
I opted for the Y combinator just to show that it can be done without using side effects .
Actually , the compiler generates a new Y combinator on the fly so that it matches the arity of the recursive procedure :
; xargs : nat -> list [ symbol ] ( define ( xargs n ) ( if ( <= n 0 ) '( ) ( cons ( string - > symbol ( string - append " x " ( number - > string n ) ) ) ( xargs (- n 1 ) ) ) ) ) ;
Yn generates the Y combinator for n-arity procedures .
( define ( Yn n ) `(( lambda ( h ) ( lambda ( F ) ( F ( lambda ( , @( xargs n ) ) ( ( ( h h ) F ) , @( xargs n ) ) ) ) ) ) ( lambda ( h ) ( lambda ( F ) ( F ( lambda ( , @( xargs n ) ) ( ( ( h h ) F ) , @( xargs n ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )
In Java , the Y combinator for one - argument procedures ends up as :
(( ProcValue1 ) ( new NullProcValue1 ( ) { public Value apply ( final Value h ) { return new NullProcValue1 ( ) { public Value apply ( final Value F ) { return ( ( ProcValue1 ) ( F ) ) .apply ( new NullProcValue1 ( ) { public Value apply ( final Value x ) { return ( ( ProcValue1 ) ( (( ProcValue1 ) ( (( ProcValue1 ) ( h ) ) .apply (h ) ) ) .apply ( F ) ) ) .apply ( x ) ; }} ) ; }} ; }} ) ) .apply ( new NullProcValue1 ( ) { public Value apply ( final Value h ) { return new NullProcValue1 ( ) { public Value apply ( final Value F ) { return ( ( ProcValue1 ) ( F ) ) .apply ( new NullProcValue1 ( ) { public Value apply ( final Value x ) { return ( ( ProcValue1 ) ( (( ProcValue1 ) ( (( ProcValue1 ) ( h ) ) .apply (h ) ) ) .apply ( F ) ) ) .apply ( x ) ; }} ) ; }} ; }} )
Sequencing
Sequencing statements are desugared into let - bindings of unused variables .
That is , ( begin e1 ... eN ) becomes :
( let ( ( _ e1 ) ) ( begin e2 ... eN ) )

The developer of DNA fingerprinting and profiling has said the government is wrong in retaining profiles of innocent people .
Geneticist Sir Alec Jeffreys told MPs that he was " astonished , perplexed and deeply worried " about the existing management policy of the National DNA Database .
He was providing evidence to the House of Commons Home Affairs Select Committee in a session on the database on 3 February 2010 .
Currently , everybody arrested in England and Wales has to provide a DNA sample , and the government has been heavily criticised for retaining profiles of people not charged or found innocent .
The European Court of Human Rights ruled against the policy of indefinite retention in late 2008 .
In response to a question from committee chair Keith Vaz MP on whether he stood by his criticism of the Home Office 's revised proposals of retaining the DNA of anyone who is arrested for six years , Jeffreys replied : " Yes I do indeed , even six years is a unique situation .
We are the only country in the world that keeps DNA for that length of time .
New Zealand is the closest I can find .
No other country is doing this . "
When asked by Liberal Democrat MP Tom Brake what additional controls should be added to the current system , he said innocent people should be taken off the database .
He added that he would " object profoundly " if his own DNA was put onto the system .
" DNA is intimately different to fingerprinting , it carries incredibly intimate information about who you are , where you 're from and your family , " said Jeffreys .
He made reference to a recorded suicide due to an innocent person 's shame at being on the database and pointed out that the likelihood of a false match " was not zero " .
The geneticist said England and Wales should follow Scotland 's lead , where police only retain the DNA profiles of innocent people under specific circumstances , with those accused of sexual assaults having their profiles held for a maximum of five years .
Plans by the United Arab Emirates to introduce a mandatory database for the whole population should be watched closely by the UK " to see if it does impact on criminal protection " , said Jeffreys .

Fluoxetine hydrochloride ( 3-( p- trifluoromethylphenoxy ) - N- methyl - 3-phenylpropylamine HCl ) was first described in a scientific journal in 1974 as a selective serotonin - uptake inhibitor .
It was licenced for use in the treatment of depression in Belgium in 1986 and the USA in 1987 .
Before its launch , to introduce it to the public , its manufacturer Eli Lilly funded eight million brochures ( “ Depression : what you need to know ” ) and 200 000 posters .
It would become one of the best selling pharmaceuticals of its age ; by 1992 annual sales had reached US $ 1bn and by 1995 they had doubled to US $ 2 bn .
In 1999 ‘ Prozac ’ – the trade name of fluoxetine – was named on of the ‘ Products of the century ’ by Fortune magazine .
The impact of the drug is hard to overstate , both in terms of the culture of the treatment of mental health disorders and in Western society at large .
Prior to the introduction of fluoxetine antidepressants had a reputation of having side effects and were cautiously prescribed as they were toxic in overdose .
Fluoxetine , on the other hand , was relatively benign and its introduction practically created a market in drugs for mood problems that could be safely prescribed to anyone who wanted them .
Other SSRIs followed in fluoxetine ’s wake and the result has been an explosion in the diagnosing of depression and the prescribing of antidepressants .
This is all the more incredible when one considers that the revenue from antidepressants sales in 1975 was US $ 200 million and the market was considered to be saturated .
‘ Prozac ’ has since entered the popular lexicon and spawned its own sub - genre of literature .
Of these perhaps the best known is Prozac Nation , a bestselling – but in my view rather tedious – memoir of mental illness written by Elizabeth Wurtzel .
There have been some hiccups along the way .
Fluoxetine does n’t have as few side effects as originally thought and , amongst those who are prescribed it , anorgasmia is quite common .
Nausea is often experienced initially and it can sometimes increase rather than reduce anxiety .
There have been concerns about other SSRI drugs , notably paroxetine , increasing suicide risk in young adults and in 1989 , Joseph Wesbecker shot and killed eight people and injured 12 others in Kentucky before killing himself .
More recently a meta- analysis of 35 clinical trials of four antidepressants including fluoxetine concluded that the action of the medications was not clinical significance for any patient who was not severely depressed .
( see July 2018 note below )
In 2007 Eli Lilly began to market fluoxetine for dogs under the name Reconcile .
In this incarnation it ’s chewable , tastes like beef and is intended to treat something called ‘ canine separation anxiety ’ .
This disorder amounts to a set of behaviours displayed by a dog when being left alone for too long .
A dog so affected may urinate in inappropriate places or chew furniture .
At the time of launch Lilly said that their research showed the up to 17 % of dogs suffered from this behavioural disturbance .
Reconcile comes in a once a day chewable beef flavoured capsule .
I do n’t know much about dogs , but other people seem to really like them .
I ’ve been trying to think about what antidepressants for dogs tells us about ourselves .
Many people see dogs as part of their families and as such project onto them human attributes .
In their advertising Lilly avoid suggesting that Reconcile is a treatment for ‘ canine depression ’ but other articles written at the time of Reconcile ’s launch are not so careful , here in the Times :
In Britain , research among pet - owners carried out for Sainsbury ’s Bank in 2003 indicated that 632,000 dogs and cats had suffered from depression in the previous year .
Nearly three times as many pets had suffered from behavioural problems that which could be linked to depression , often resulting in the animal damaging its home or becoming moody or aggressive , according to the research .
The experience of a human disease such as depression involves complex human attributes such as thoughts , emotions and language .
To suggest that we can extend the concept of a specific human mental illnesses such as depression to dogs is to stretch the paradigm almost to breaking point and shows at once how loosely lay people apply the concept and how engrained widespread mental illness it is in everyday thinking .
Not that this association will worry the pharmaceutical companies .
Marketing antidepressants to dogs tacitly encourages dog owners to consider that their dogs have mental health conditions previously described in humans and this can only be good for sales .
Many pharmaceuticals develop mission creep whereby manufacturers endeavor to win them licences to allow their use to treat disorders distinct from those for which they were initially licenced .
Initially cleared for depression only , Fluoxetine is now used for anorexia and bulimia nervosa , obsessive compulsive disorder , panic disorder , premenstrual dysphoria and generalized anxiety disorder .
Viewed in this light , the launch of Reconcile , and fluoxetine ’s crossing of the species barrier , is just part of the drugs product lifecycle .
This is not to say of course that fluoxetine does n’t have its uses for animals .
In similarity to human subjects it may have impressive effects in some , moderate for others and no effect for a substantial number .
The emphasis is on the problem being in the dog and nowhere else , just like in humans .

Following a lengthy legal procedure the Court of Bergamo has once again ruled that Italian ISPs have to censor their networks and prevent customer access to The Pirate Bay .
Millions of Italian Internet users will be denied access to the popular torrent site in an attempt to prevent copyright infringement .
The Pirate Bay was first ‘ censored ’ in Italy in the summer of 2008 , when ISPs were ordered to prevent millions of Italians from accessing the world ’s largest BitTorrent tracker .
The Pirate Bay chose to appeal the decision and eventually won the court case .
The Court of Bergamo ruled that no foreign website can be censored for alleged copyright infringement and the block was lifted temporarily as the case was appealed once again .
A few weeks ago the Supreme Court reviewed the case and ruled that ISPs can be forced to block BitTorrent sites , even if they are not hosted in Italy or operated by Italian citizens .
According to the decision by the Supreme Court , sites offering torrent files that link to copyrighted material are engaging in criminal activity .
This week the case once again appeared before the Court of Bergamo where it was decided that all Italian ISPs will have to deny their customers access to The Pirate Bay .
Pirate Bay lawyers Giovanni Battista Gallus , Giuseppe Campanelli and Francesco Micozzi told TorrentFreak that the Court followed the same reasoning as the Supreme Court , and deemed it unnecessary to bring the case before the European Court of Justice .
According to the two lawyers
The Pirate Bay is still considering whether to appeal this decision or not , but that will not prevent or delay the block .
“ We do n’t know when Italian ISPs will begin to re-apply the Pirate Bay filters , but we think that this will happen very soon , ” Micozzi commented .
Aside from appealing to the Supreme Court , the Pirate Bay ’s legal team is also considering bringing the case before the European Court of Justice .
It is doubtful that the verdict will have a strong impact on the piracy rate in Italy .
The proposed DNS - filtering scheme can be easily bypassed by Pirate Bay users and there are hundreds of alternative torrent sites that can replace The Pirate Bay .
Investment bankers have been much maligned in recent months , with their salaries and bonuses evoking much anger and despair among the general public .
Here one young investment banker describes what they do , how much they earn and why they are worth it .
When first setting out , I was not sure what I wanted to do in life .
I knew that whatever I eventually decided to do , investment banking would be a good door opener .
I knew that whatever I applied to do later , future employers would look look favourably on it .
Apart from that it 's fast - paced , which I like , and it 's very results orientated .
The money was also a factor - if it was less I 'm not sure I 'd have applied .
And it 's intellectually stimulating .
Average day I usually come in at 9 - 9.30 am .
In terms of the daily tasks , there is a lot of [ financial ] modelling .
A very common modelling task I do is ; how would this company perform if you put this much debt on it .
Another common one is valuation analysis , so you basically model what you think the performance of the company will be over the next 10 years and then come up with a value that you should assign to that performance .
The expectation is that you will work past 9 pm , a minimum 12 hour day .
You can safely say that you will be working at the weekend , most weekends .
The average for a week is a 100 hours , something like that .
My manager expects me to put in these hours .
Bonus hopes
My base salary is £ 50,000 per year and my bonus .
The usual expectation is that your bonus is somewhere around 90 % to 110 % of your base salary .
The number I 've targeted for this year is a £ 40,000 bonus , but it 's hard to say because the past couple of years have been so difficult because of the credit crunch and bonuses have n't been typical at all .
If I get below £ 30,000 I will be very , very disappointed and quite shocked .
Though how shocked will depend on whether other people at my level get that .
If they were to tell me it was £ 30,000 , I 'd definitely say that was way below my expectations .
I 've been working very hard and put in extremely long hours .
I am rarely home before 11 pm .
My bank has done quite well this year and we 're constantly told we 're doing very well , so I do n't see how they could justify paying us just £ 30,000 , given the performance of the bank and given that other banks are likely to pay people at my level more than that .
My base salary at £ 50,000 is already below what is expected for my level at other banks .
I think most others pay £ 55,000 and I think a £ 30,000 bonus is likely to be below what other banks are paying as well .
Lot of money I have a lot of friends who are n't in banking and who earn a lot less than me .
And if I think about it , at my age , it 's a lot of money .
Also , for the money I 'm earning , I do n't think I 'm giving back to society at that level .
So from that respect , I think it 's a lot of money .
If all investment banks paid at a lower level , I would n't really be bothered by it .
It 's just the fact that I know the other banks pay more and I just feel that my bank would be taking advantage of me if they were paying me less .
It also comes back to the hours .
If I look at my friends , yes , they earn a lot less than me , but they have a much nicer lifestyle .
They are able to go out with their friends after work , and take two to three weeks holidays .
In investment banking , for an analyst , its almost unheard of to take two weeks holiday .
I can completely understand why the general public are angry that RBS should be paying bonuses .
But I know that if they do n't pay the bonuses , people will leave RBS and that 's the end of the bank .
The reality is that people work in banking mainly for the money .
The BBC has agreed to conceal the identity of the investment banker and that of his employer .
BBC Radio 4's PM programme broadcast the interview on 4 February 2010 .

Do n't be surprised if you find some porn among the sport highlights , children 's cartoons or music videos you are looking for on YouTube today .
A web forum , the notorious 4 chan , has declared today YouTube Porn Day .
To take vengeance for the apparent removal of the popular YouTube account of Lukeywes1234 , 4 chan called on its members to upload hidden porn onto the site .
But who is Lukeywes1234 ?
It was the username of an eight - year - old Nintendo fanboy who scored viral success with his hilarious videos .
His " shows " featured childish ideas like ghost - fighting with tinfoil on his head directed by his grandmother , and performing his own versions of Super Mario Bros and Star Wars .
The videos attracted attention due to his very direct , sometimes vulgar , language .
Members of the 4 chan forum found the hilarious videos and gave them a broader audience on their message board , referred to as " / b/ " .
In the original and now deleted video Lukeywes1234 begged for 50 subscribers by February .
Within a few hours , several thousand were following him , and praising him and declaring him " awesome " .
Lots of fan material is still online , as teenagers obviously sympathised with Lukeywes1234 .
Now his fans are raging against YouTube for deleting his videos , as you can see here and here and here .
Last May , 4 chan started a similar campaign after YouTube deleted a lot of illegal music .
YouTube said that it is not able to comment on individual users , but it is likely that despite his 15,000 subscribers , Lukeywes1234 was suspended because he did not meet YouTube 's age requirement of being 13 and over .
Meanwhile , YouTube does n't sound too worried about 4 chan 's threat .
In a statement it said : " We have heard rumors that a group of individuals plan to upload sexually explicit content to YouTube in a coordinated attack .
As always , we are monitoring the site and will continue to remove inappropriate content as we become aware of it . "

It sounds like Lukeywes 1234 's internet fame will soon be over .
Still , there are a couple of questions .
Is it OK if underage children speak up freely and upload slightly embarrassing footage of themselves ?
Is posting funny videos and replying to them the way teenagers that teenagers relate to each other today ?
So are they destroying their future or has Lukeywes1234 launched himself into a great media career ?
What do you think ?
The Failed War on Drugs in Latin America Could Decriminalization Be the Answer ?
The massacre in Ciudad Juarez at the end of January made it clear that Mexico is losing the war on drugs .
Narcotics - related violence is on the rise in other Latin American cities as well .
An increasing number of voices are demanding that drugs be decriminalized .
Ouch , apologies to the easily offended as this strip easily and thoroughly trumps my previous kinkiest strip yet .
Oh , and in an attempt to slowly but surely nudge my Friday publishing schedule towards
Thursdays , I ’ve put this one up a little bit earlier .
I assumed you would n’t mind !
Also : Hi , Mom .
Researchers at the Los Alamos National Laboratory have managed to accidentally cause $ 3 million of damage as they blew up one of their own buildings using a large - bore powder gun , a weapon which acts like a Civil War cannon .
Updated .

According to Project on Government Oversight 's Senior Investigator , Peter Stockton , this incident " is a new twist in the long history of screw - ups by Los Alamos . "
I can't really blame him for saying that when testing a gun results in several million dollars of structural damage , propels doors away from the building , and leaves pieces of the weapon spread out on the ground outside .
Geez .
Let 's look at the positive side of this though .
The gun was a mess , but they discovered a heck of a bomb here , no ?
[ Pogo via Wired ]

Update : Wired reports that they 've received an email from National Nuclear Security Administration spokesman Damien LaVera which implies that what we 've first heard might not be the exact story :
Here are the facts :
On December 16 , Los Alamos conducted a standard proof test on a new design for a catch tank in the target chamber for one of our large bore powder guns ( LBPG ) .
These types of experiments are routine and responsible .
The LBPG is used to conduct measurements of material properties at pressures needed for understanding nuclear weapons performance .
During this particular test , unexpected explosive damage occurred and , because that damage could result in $ 1 million in damages , an investigation was automatically triggered .
That investigation will seek to identify the cause of the incident and any changes in procedures that might be required .
NNSA , Los Alamos , and all of our facilities take their commitment to safety very seriously .
It is important to note that no personnel were injured from this event , no hazardous or radioactive materials were involved , and that lab 's incident response mechanisms appear to have performed as intended .

The apparent Israeli assassination of a Hamas operative in the United Arab Emirates turned into a bizarre event replete with numerous fraudulent passports , alleged Israeli operatives caught on videotape and international outrage ( much of it feigned ) , more over the use of fraudulent passports than over the operative 's death .
If we are to believe the media , it took nearly 20 people and an international incident to kill him .
STRATFOR has written on the details of the killing as we have learned of them , but we see this as an occasion to address a broader question : the role of assassination in international politics .
Defining Assassination
We should begin by defining what we mean by assassination .
It is the killing of a particular individual for political purposes .
It differs from the killing of a spouse 's lover because it is political .
It differs from the killing of a soldier on the battlefield in that the soldier is anonymous and is not killed because of who he is but because of the army he is serving in .
The question of assassination , in the current jargon " targeted killing , " raises the issue of its purpose .
Apart from malice and revenge , as in Abraham Lincoln 's assassination , the purpose of assassination is to achieve a particular political end by weakening an enemy in some way .
Thus , the killing of Adm. Isoroku Yamamoto by the Americans in World War II was a targeted killing , an assassination .
His movements were known , and the Americans had the opportunity to kill him .
Killing an incompetent commander would be counterproductive , but Yamamoto was a superb strategist , without peer in the Japanese navy .
Killing him would weaken Japan 's war effort , or at least have a reasonable chance of doing so .
With all the others dying around him in the midst of war , the moral choice did not seem complex then , nor does it seem complex now .
Such occasions rarely occur on the battlefield .
There are few commanders who could not readily be replaced , and perhaps even replaced by someone more able .
In any event , it is difficult to locate enemy commanders , meaning the opportunity to kill them rarely arises .
And as commanders ask their troops to risk their lives , they have no moral claim to immunity from danger .
Now , take another case .
Assume that the leader of a country were singular and irreplaceable , something very few are .
But think of Fidel Castro , whose central role in the Cuban government was undeniable .
Assume that he is the enemy of another country like the United States .
It is an unofficial hostility — no war has been declared — but a very real one nonetheless .
Is it illegitimate to try to kill such a leader in a bid to destroy his regime ?
Let 's move that question to Adolph Hitler , the gold standard of evil .
Would it be inappropriate to have sought to kill him in 1938 based on the type of regime he had created and what he said that he would do with it ?
If the position is that killing Hitler would have been immoral , then we have a serious question about the moral standards being used .
The more complex case is Castro .
He is certainly no Hitler , but neither is he the romantic democratic revolutionary some have painted him as being .
But if it is legitimate to kill Castro , then where is the line drawn ?
Who is it not legitimate to kill ?
As with Yamamoto , the number of instances in which killing a political leader would make a difference in policy or in the regime 's strength is extremely limited .
In most cases , the argument against assassination is not moral but practical :
It would make no difference if the target in question lives or dies .
But where it would make a difference , the moral argument becomes difficult .
If we establish that Hitler was a legitimate target , then we have established that there is not an absolute ban on political assassination .
The question is what the threshold must be .
All of this is a preface to the killing in the United Arab Emirates , because that represents a third case .
Since the rise of the modern intelligence apparatus , covert arms have frequently been attached to them .
The nation - states of the 20th century all had intelligence organizations .
These organizations carried out a range of clandestine operations beyond collecting intelligence , from supplying weapons to friendly political groups in foreign countries to overthrowing regimes to underwriting terrorist operations .
During the latter half of the century , nonstate - based covert organizations were developed .
As European empires collapsed , political movements wishing to take control created covert warfare apparatuses to force the Europeans out or defeat political competitors .
Israel 's state - based intelligence system emerged from one created before the Jewish state 's independence .
The various Palestinian factions created their own .
Beyond this , of course , groups like al Qaeda created their own covert capabilities , against which the United States has arrayed its own massive covert capability .
Assassinations Today
The contemporary reality is not a battlefield on which a Yamamoto might be singled out or a charismatic political leader whose death might destroy his regime .
Rather , a great deal of contemporary international politics and warfare is built around these covert capabilities .
In the case of Hamas , the mission of these covert operations is to secure the resources necessary for Hamas to engage Israeli forces on terms favorable to them , from terror to rocket attacks .
For Israel , covert operations exist to shut off resources to Hamas ( and other groups ) , leaving them unable to engage or resist Israel .
Expressed this way , covert warfare makes sense , particularly for the Israelis when they engage the clandestine efforts of Hamas .
Hamas is moving covertly to secure resources .
Its game is to evade the Israelis .
The Israeli goal is to identify and eliminate the covert capability .
Hamas is the hunted , Israel the hunter here .
Apparently the hunter and hunted met in the United Arab Emirates , and the hunted was killed .
But there are complexities here .
First , in warfare , the goal is to render the enemy incapable of resisting .
Killing just any group of enemy soldiers is not the point .
Indeed , diverting resources to engage the enemy on the margins , leaving the center of gravity of the enemy force untouched , harms far more than it helps .
Covert warfare is different from conventional warfare , but the essential question stands :
Is the target you are destroying essential to the enemy 's ability to fight ?
And even more important , as the end of all war is political , does defeating this enemy bring you closer to your political goals ?
Covert organizations , like armies , are designed to survive attrition .
It is expected that operatives will be detected and killed ; the system is designed to survive that .
The goal of covert warfare is either to penetrate the enemy so deeply , or destroy one or more people so essential to the operation of the group , that the covert organization stops functioning .
All covert organizations are designed to stop this from happening .
They achieve this through redundancy and regeneration .
After the massacre at the Munich Olympics in 1972 , the Israelis mounted an intense covert operation to identify , penetrate and destroy the movement — called Black September — that mounted the attack .
Black September was not simply a separate movement but a front for various Palestinian factions .
Killing those involved with Munich would not paralyze Black September , and destroying Black September did not destroy the Palestinian movement .
That movement had redundancy — the ability to shift new capable people into the roles of those killed — and therefore could regenerate , training and deploying fresh operatives .
The mission was successfully carried out , but the mission was poorly designed .
Like a general using overwhelming force to destroy a marginal element of the enemy army , the Israelis focused their covert capability to destroy elements whose destruction would not give the Israelis what they wanted — the destruction of the various Palestinian covert capabilities .
It might have been politically necessary for the Israeli public , it might have been emotionally satisfying , but the Israeli 's enemies were n't broken .
Consider that Entebbe occurred in 1976 .
If Israel 's goal in targeting Black September was the suppression of terrorism by Palestinian groups , the assault on one group did not end the threat from other groups .
Therefore , the political ends the Israelis sought were not achieved .
The Palestinians did not become weaker .
The year 1972 was not the high point of the Palestinian movement politically .
It became stronger over time , gaining substantial international legitimacy .
If the mission was to break the Palestinian covert apparatus to weaken the Palestinian capability and weaken its political power , the covert war of eliminating specific individuals identified as enemy operatives failed .
The operatives very often were killed , but the operation did not yield the desired outcome .
And here lies the real dilemma of assassination .
It is extraordinarily rare to identify a person whose death would materially weaken a substantial political movement in some definitive sense — i.e. , where if the person died , then the movement would be finished .
This is particularly true for nationalist movements that can draw on a very large pool of people and talent .
It is equally hard to reduce a movement quickly enough to destroy the organization 's redundancy and regenerative capability .
Doing so requires extraordinary intelligence penetration as well as a massive covert effort , so such an effort quickly reveals the penetration and identifies your own operatives .
A single swift , global blow is what is dreamt of .
Covert war actually works as a battle of attrition , involving the slow accumulation of intelligence , the organization of the strike , the assassination .
At that point , one man is dead , a man whose replacement is undoubtedly already trained .
Others are killed , but the critical mass is never reached , and there is no one target who if killed would cause everything to change .
In war there is a terrible tension between the emotions of the public and the cold logic that must drive the general .
In covert warfare , there is tremendous emotional satisfaction to the country when it is revealed that someone it regards as not only an enemy , but someone responsible for the deaths of their countryman , has been killed .
But the generals or directors of intelligence can't afford this satisfaction .
They have limited resources , which must be devoted to achieving their country 's political goals and assuring its safety .
Those resources have to be used effectively .
There are few Hitlers whose death is morally demanded and might have a practical effect .
Most such killings are both morally and practically ambiguous .
In covert warfare , even if you concede every moral point about the wickedness of your enemy , you must raise the question as to whether all of your efforts are having any real effect on the enemy in the long run .
If they can simply replace the man you killed , while training ten more operatives in the meantime , you have achieved little .
If the enemy keeps becoming politically more successful , then the strategy must be re-examined .
We are not writing this as pacifists ; we do not believe the killing of enemies is to be avoided .
And we certainly do not believe that the morally incoherent strictures of what is called international law should guide any country in protecting itself .
What we are addressing here is the effectiveness of assassination in waging covert warfare .
Too frequently , it does not , in our mind , represent a successful solution to the military and political threat posed by covert organizations .
It might bring an enemy to justice , and it might well disrupt an organization for a while or even render a specific organization untenable .
But in the covert wars of the 20th century , the occasions when covert operations — including assassinations — achieved the political ends being pursued were rare .
That does not mean they never did .
It does mean that the utility of assassination as a main part of covert warfare needs to be considered carefully .
Assassination is not without cost , and in war , all actions must be evaluated rigorously in terms of cost versus benefit .
Astronomy is the science of the exotic , but the thing that astronomers most want to find is the familiar : another planet like Earth , a hospitable face in a hostile cosmos .
The Kepler spacecraft , which was launched last March , is their best instrument yet for discovering Earth - like planets around sunlike stars , as opposed to the giant planets that have been planet finders ’ main harvest so far .
Many predict that 2010 will be the year of exo-Earths .
But if the giant planets , which looked nothing like what astronomers had expected , are any indication , those Earths may not be so reassuringly familiar either .
It has dawned on theorists in recent years that other Earth - mass planets may be enormous water droplets , balls of nitrogen or lumps of iron .
Name your favorite element or compound , and someone has imagined a planet made of it .
The spectrum of possibilities depends largely on the ratio of carbon to oxygen .
After hydrogen and helium , these are the most common elements in the universe , and in an embryonic planetary system they pair off to create carbon monoxide .
The element that is in slight excess ends up dominating the planet ’s chemistry .
In our solar system , oxygen dominates .
Although we tend to think of our planet as defined by carbon , the basis of life , the element is actually a fairly minor constituent .
The terrestrial planets are made of silicate minerals , which are oxygen - rich .
The outer solar system abounds in another oxygen - rich compound , water .
A new study shows in detail how carbon lost out .
Jade Bond of the University of Arizona and the Planetary Science Institute ( PSI ) , Dante Lauretta of Arizona and David O’Brien of PSI have simulated how chemical elements got distributed around the solar system as it formed .
They find that carbon remained in a gaseous state within the protoplanetary disk and was eventually blown out into deep space ; the embryonic Earth wound up with none at all .
The carbon in our bodies must have been delivered later , by asteroids and comets that formed under conditions that allowed them to incorporate the element .
Had the carbon - oxygen balance tilted the other way , Earth would have turned out very differently , as Marc Kuchner , then at Princeton University , and Sara Seager , then at the Carnegie Institution of Washington , argued in 2005 .
It would consist not of silicates but of carbon - based compounds such as silicon carbide and , indeed , pure carbon itself .
The crust would be mainly graphite , and a few kilometers underground the pressures would be high enough to form a rigid shell of diamond and other crystals .
Instead of water ice , the planet would have carbon monoxide or methane ice ; instead of liquid water , it might have oceans of tar .
The galaxy could be filled with such worlds .
According to an observational survey Bond cites , the average planet host star has a higher carbon - to - oxygen ratio than the sun does , and her team ’s simulations predict that the most enriched systems give birth to carbon planets .
“ Some of these compositions differ greatly from solar and as a result produce terrestrial planets with vastly different compositions , ” Bond says .
To be sure , other surveys have found that the sun is indistinguishable from the average star in its class .
The Kepler spacecraft may help settle the question , because even the limited amount of information it can glean about planets — their mass and radius — is enough to tell their general composition .
Carbon Earths might be especially prevalent in more bizarre settings , such as the environs of white dwarfs and neutron stars .
Regions of the galaxy that are rich in heavy elements generally , such as the galactic center , have higher carbon - to - oxygen ratios .
As time passes and stars continue to manufacture heavy elements , the balance everywhere will tilt in favor of carbon .
These and other astronomical discoveries turn the tables on our notions of the familiar and unfamiliar .
Most of the galaxy is dark matter ; most suns are dimmer and redder than our sun ; and now , it seems , other Earths may not be especially Earth - like .
If anything departs from the norm and deserves to be called exotic , it is us .
Subscibe to DEAL OF THE DAY
Some things are just meant to be .
When Peter Pocklington and the Edmonton Oilers purchased the contract of the 17 - year - old wunderkind Wayne Gretzky from Nelson Skalbania and the Indianapolis Racers in November , 1978 , the Oilers 1978 - 79 World Hockey Association schedule had long since been established .
One of the home dates was January 26 , 1979 , a Friday evening encounter against Cincinnati Stingers , Game # 40 on the 80 - game sked .
It would have been another ordinary mid-season game except for the important fact that Wayne Gretzky turned 18 that cold winter 's day .
Specific memories have been enveloped by the cobwebs of time , but as I recall there was a bit of a buzz that something special might happen to celebrate the occasion , just enough to try to stimulate walk - up traffic without giving away the farm .
Did n't matter to me , as an every - game season ticket holder I was going in any event , but I made sure to arrive at my seat in the southwest corner of the lower bowl a little ahead of the usual anthem - time .
In the process I purchased that evening 's program , pictured above along with my ticket stub .
Note the prices : $ 9.00 for the ticket , $ 1.50 for the program .
A bargain at twice the price .
It was already clear to anybody paying the least bit of attention that the kid they cleverly called " The Kid " was something very special indeed .
Those of us paying a whole lot of attention could scarcely believe our eyes .
Right from his first game it was evident that he thought the game in a unique way , and had uncanny vision , hand - eye coordination , stick skills , and playmaking ability .
Wayne did n't quite have the skating strength to pull off some of the more audacious moves he tried , occasionally falling on his keester when he attempted a particularly ridiculous cut , but you could see the ideas were sound and it was just a matter of time .
He 'd already begun to put the puck in the net and set up his teammates with regularity , entering the game at 39 GP , 23 -23 - 46 .
The Oilers , who had started the season 3 - 5 - 0 before the trade , had improved to 22 - 17 - 0 and were solidly ensconced in fourth place in the seven - team league .
Led by their precocious rookie - of - the - year , they would eventually wind up in first place .
Tonight , on his 18th birthday , perhaps it 's fair to consider how much this young man means to Edmonton Oilers and their fans -- and to all of professional hockey .
The simple answer , of course , is that he means a tremendous amount to hockey 's future .
But Wayne Gretzky is not in a simple situation .
Since his arrival in Edmonton , Wayne Gretzky has been questioned almost every day by members of the media .
He has been sought after for speaking engagements .
He has signed autographs beyond imagination .
Almost incidentally , he has led the Oilers in scoring and has become one of the strongest group of young centres in professional hockey .
Without willing it , Wayne has become a symbol of youth and prosperity for Edmonton , where youth and prosperity are rampant .
A sociologist might say something profound about Wayne being the right person in the right place at the right time , but we 'll leave that to the sociologists .
He has been virtually perfect as a representative of the Oilers on and off the ice .
The players treat him as what he is -- the smallest and youngest of the group , the runt of the litter .
They respect his talent and they understand the unique situation into which he has been placed by his youth , his huge contract and his undeniable physical gifts .
They also needle him without mercy , taking whatever steps are required to keep him entrenched as one member of an organization .
He is mature to an amazing degree , this young Gretzky .
Watching him play hockey probably is a little like hearing Mozart play a piano at five or Einstein recite mathematics tables at seven .
Local reporter and true gentleman John Short wrote in a feature article in that program ( excerpted ) :
Come the pregame and they had a special birthday treat for Wayne .
The whole famdamily was there , Walter and Phyllis and Wayne 's sister and three little brothers all dressed in Oiler sweaters with the already - familiar # 99 on the back .
They had a special birthday cake on a table at centre ice , actually two cakes in the shape of 9's ( 99 , or 9+9=18 , get it ? ) , which Wayne cut in a schmaltzy ceremony .
His teammates chipped in a bottle of baby champagne .
It was nice , but underwhelming .
Then came the big surprise .
Peter Pocklington took the mic and announced that now that Wayne had reached the age of majority they were going to rip up the seven - year contract he -- actually Wayne 's dad along with his agent Gus Badali -- had signed with Skalbania , and replace it with a 21 - year personal services contract which would keep # 99 in Edmonton for the rest of his hockey life , right through until 1999 .
I do n't remember Pocklington 's specific words but they stressed that the " personal services " nature of the contract would protect him from the big bad NHL , and in the event of a merger he would remain Pocklington 's indentured servant ( I do n't think he said it quite like that ) and an Oiler forever .
The soon - to - be Great One and Peter Puck signed that contract on the little birthday cake table as 12,321 witnesses rose as one to give our enthusiastic blessing .
Only in the Rebel League might one even imagine an 18 - year - old signing a 21 - year deal , which to the best of my knowledge remains the longest professional pact ever signed on this continent .
It is arguably the most influential contract ever signed in hockey .
Terry Jones , then a young reporter with Gretzky 's ear , picks up the story in The Great Gretzky Yearbook II ( 1982 ) :
How much ?
It was hard to say .
But obviously , it made him a multi-millionaire .
" There 's a negotiation clause after ten years , " said Pocklington .
" But there 's no out .
In the tenth year we will sit down and renegotiate because of all the factors such as inflation .
If we can't agree , an arbitrator will be brought in . "
Pocklington swore , than night , that he would not give up Gretzky as a price of merger and Edmonton fans were n't going to let him forget that promise .
They wanted into the NHL .
But not THAT badly , they did n't .
That the contract should expire in 1999 was n't settled until mid-afternoon that day .
And according to all , it was more Gretzky 's idea than anybody's .
" Gus tried to slow the deal down a little , " said then - Oilers general manager Larry Gordon .
" But Gretzky said he 'd seen enough of Edmonton to know that this is where he wants to play hockey for the rest of his career . "
Still buzzing with incredulity and excitement , we then settled in to watch the game which had no chance to be anything but an anticlimax and was all of that in a 5 - 2 Cincinnati triumph .
I 'll spare you the play - by - play , but share the scoresheet from that same program , completed in my fading handwriting .

There are some mighty interesting names on that sheet .
The hero of the day scored one assist on a beautiful feed to Dave Langevin , who that summer was on his way to Long Island where he would win the next four Stanley Cups .
The other goal was scored by B. J. MacDonald and assisted by Brett Callighen , Wayne 's linemates on the becoming - famous GMC Line .
The second assist went to Al Hamilton , who would be the only Oiler to have his sweater retired before Wayne himself .
Even more interesting is on the Stingers side of the ledger .
The winning goalie and my choice for the game 's first star was Mike Liut , who two years later would barely lose to Gretzky in the closest Hart Trophy vote of the 20th Century .
The scoring hero with a hat trick was Robbie Ftorek , who ten years later would be Wayne 's first coach in Los Angeles , during his ninth and final Hart Trophy season .
Another future Kings coach , Barry Melrose , picked up 7 minutes in penalties in a scrum with Oilers Dave Hunter and Paul Shmyr .
The clinching goal , scored by Rick Dudley , was set up by two teenagers who would eventually join Wayne in the Hockey Hall of Fame : 19 - year - old Mike Gartner and Mark Messier , himself just a week past his 18th birthday .
Who could have known then that the three teenagers on display in the Rebel League that night would later play 4675 regular season games , scoring a staggering 2298 goals and 6079 points in the NHfreakinL .
Those NHL careers were not long in the future although we had no way of knowing it at the time .
The WHA 's strategy of signing underage junior stars had gotten the NHL's attention , and Pocklington 's power move of locking up the brilliant prodigy got the desired results .
The NHL talked turkey that summer , and when the merger finally did get accepted ( with a major assist from Canadian beer drinkers ) , the Oilers were one of four teams to make the jump .
Pocklington played the Gretzky card for all he was worth , promising how The Kid would fill houses around the league but any question as to who owned his rights would be a " dealbuster " .
By October the Oilers , Gretzky , Messier (! ) and all , were playing in the NHL , and their fans were over the Moon .
The very first game that proved we had been ( grudgingly ) accepted by the big boys , was against tonight 's opponents , the Chicago Blackhawks .
The other milestones in the contract proved prophetic as to timing if not the actual sequence of events .
Gretzky was to play exactly 9.9 seasons in Edmonton after which he did indeed have an out .
After the tenth year Pocklington did n't renegotiate Gretzky 's contract , he sold it , to Bruce McNall and the Los Angeles Kings .
McNall immediately ripped up Gretzky 's existing deal ( already renegotiated once ) and gave him a new long - term pact for $ 2 MM per season .
Amazingly , for all the records , Cups , publicity , and ticket sales , Wayne had never made so much as a million bucks a year in Edmonton ; from a strictly economic perspective he was the most underpaid superstar since Gordie Howe .
His salary was influential in keeping a lid on league salaries , especially those in Edmonton , for most of the 1980s .
And true to his original word , Gretzky played 21 professional seasons , retiring in 1999 .
His famous sweater # 99 was retired immediately , not just by the Oilers but by the entire league in an unprecedented move to honour this hockey genius .
We lucky few who were seeing him on a nightly basis knew he was a special talent the night he signed that 21 - year deal , and he more than lived up to the promise .
He retired with 61 NHL records , and still holds 61 records today .
Speaking of today , it 's the Great One 's 49th birthday .
Happy birthday , Wayne !
It sure was fun to know ya .
MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin told his ruling party on Friday it must pay more attention to ordinary voters , just days after one of the biggest opposition protests in a decade .

About 10,000 people attended a rally in the Baltic region of Kaliningrad last week to call for the dismissal of the governor , prompting Putin ’s United Russia party to send officials to investigate why its local leader had become so unpopular .
At a meeting in advance of regional elections next month , Putin told senior party officials they should avoid raising expectations by promising “ everything all at once ” only to ignore voters after election day .
“ You cannot turn into promisers , who make promises only to ... get into power and then spend their time solving their own personal problems , ” said Putin , who is the party ’s chairman .
About 100 activists gathered outside the Kaliningrad regional administration building on Friday to call for the governor to be sacked .
Rally organizers said they would give Putin a few weeks to respond to their demand before holding another major rally .
United Russia , which has a two - thirds majority in parliament , is campaigning to win 90 percent of seats in regional elections on March 14 , senior party official Boris Gryzlov told Putin .
Unemployment , which has grown by one - third to more than 6 million in since 2007 , and big rises in prices charged by state - run monopolies are adding to discontent in many regions .
Putin told the leaders to warn voters of the consequences of voting for untried opposition parties .
United Russia must always explain that “ proper and well organized leaders are always capable of solving any problems and that in the absence of such leaders , anarchy prevails , ” he said .
United Russia portrays Putin ’s decade in power as president and then prime minister as the restoration of order after the economic chaos of the 1990s .
Pro-Western liberal opposition forces such as Solidarity and Yabloko are cast as the heirs to the unpopular rule of former President Boris Yeltsin .
Solidarity was one of the organizers of last week ’s protest in Kaliningrad and surprised observers by persuading the Communist and Liberal Democratic parties , both mainstays of a Kremlin - dominated system that tolerates only the mildest of dissent , to join them .
United Russia officials said the Kaliningrad demonstration was not mentioned during the meeting .
I still like listening to KGO Radio ( AM 810 San Francisco ) but on there they still make a big deal about having a traffic helicopter and a team that covers traffic .
Every day they put on air someone caught in traffic too , mostly on the Bay Bridge , to report how long it takes him to drive from SF to Oakland , among other places .
This job skill is dying very quickly , according to the Associated Press .
Why ?
Well , you only need to see Waze , a new crowd - sourced traffic app for mobile phones , to see just how lame this method of reporting the traffic is .
Here , let ’s go for a ride around Palo Alto with Waze ’s .
I ’ve been using it and already I ’ve found that the reports I ’m getting are more complete than others ( including the traffic reports in my 2010 Toyota Prius that I pay a lot of money every year to receive ) and even include things like speed traps .
Why ?
Because they are reported by other drivers on the ground .
This system is even better than the Google Maps traffic on my Android phone ( which is better than my iPhone ) .
This is a VERY disruptive company and one of my favorites to use .
Get it now , it ’ll save you a lot of time driving around .
We ’ll have to figure out something else for those traffic helicopter pilots and reporters to do , though .
Upset over that letter on Tuesday , NBC boss Jeff Zucker is taking a “ super tough threatening position ” over Conan ’s refusal to host a postmidnight Tonight Show and , according to Nikki Finke , he ’s threatening to “ ice ” the host , enforcing a no - compete clause that would keep him off of any rival network “ for 3 1/2 years ” ( the length of his current contract ) .
Even more disappointing than all this acrimony , though , is that Finke did not Photoshop Zucker into a Mr. Freeze costume . [ DHD ]
For our good friends from the church of L Ron , it 's not so much a tragedy as an opportunity
Psychopath , conman , liar , fantasist , fraudster , bully , tax evader , megalomaniac – it's fair to say L Ron Hubbard 's death was a blow to global humanitarianism .
Happily , there is a silver lining to the cloud that has hung over Earth since the founder of Scientology shed his corporeal form in 1986 .
That silver - lining is the high profile , expansionist figures who represent his organisation today – and the good news is that they 're turning their thoughts to Haiti .
Were an idiot like you to itemise the myriad things that this most wretched of disaster zones currently lacked , chances are you 'd omit " militant Scientologists who claim post - traumatic stress is a conspiracy created by the evil psychiatric profession , and who believe the correct response to extreme shock is to touch sufferers with one finger , before attempting to convert them to the ways of Hubbard " .
All I can say is , thank God for John Travolta .
The Wild Hogs legend has unveiled his response to the unfolding crisis , announcing : " I have arranged for a plane to take down some Volunteer Ministers and some supplies and some medics . "
For the medics and supplies John must obviously be thanked , but for the Volunteer Ministers – arriving in Haiti via Air Travolta along with scores from other Scientology churches – the same can not be said .
According to an official press release , the corps will be on hand to dispense " spiritual first aid " to Haitians .
Because really , nothing should feel more appropriate right now than gadding about Port - au - Prince offering survivors the chance to be hooked up to an e-meter .
Hopefully if they find any gay people , they can begin curing them .
For the Volunteer Ministers , you see , a tragedy is not so much a tragedy as a tragitunity .
But please , do n't take Lost in Showbiz 's word for it – take that of L Ron himself , who personally decreed the strategy he called " Casualty Contact " , in which he advised Scientologists to scan newspapers for reports of accidents or bereavements , searching for " people who have been victimised one way or another by life " .
Stipulating that one way to do this was to trawl hospitals , Hubbard declared of the ambulance - chasing Scientologist that , " He should represent himself . . . as a minister whose compassion was compelled by the newspaper story concerning the person [. . .]
However , in handling the press he should simply say that it is a mission of the church to assist those who are in need of assistance .
He should avoid any lengthy discussions of Scientology and should talk about the work of ministers and how all too few ministers these days get around to places where they are needed .
It 's straight recruiting ! "
Casualty Contact has since modulated into the Volunteer Ministers programme , whose yellow tents are increasingly visible at high - profile disaster sites , and often enlivened by special appearances by their celebrity adherents .
Within these tents Scientologists administer the aforementioned Touch Assists , whose purpose is to " speed the Thetan 's ability to heal or repair a condition with his body " .
After 9/11 , aid agencies at Ground Zero voiced concern that the Volunteer Ministers had displayed their leaflets around the disaster site and operated in the restricted area without authorisation until this was pointed out to the police , who then denied them access .
Two days after the tragedy , and presenting themselves as an organisation called National Mental Health Assistance , representatives of the Church of Scientology duped Fox News into running the church 's freephone number for five hours on the bottom of the screen , apparently in the belief that it was the official outreach hotline .
Fox News removed it after an irate intervention from the real National Mental Health Association .
" The public needs to understand that the Scientologists are using this tragedy to recruit new members , " the president of the NMHA stated .
" They are not providing mental health assistance . "
Au contraire , say the Scientologists , who claim they provide a unique brand of " meaningful help " during catastrophes .
They were there after the tsunami , after Katrina – with added Travolta – and in Beslan , before being asked to leave after the local Russian health ministry judged their techniques unhelpful to already severely traumatised children .
And of course they were there after the 7 July attacks , when an undercover BBC investigation taped the leader of the London branch of the Church 's anti-psychiatry movement laughing that their role in the immediate aftermath of the bombings was " fighting the psychiatrists ; keeping the psychs away [ from survivors ] " .
One survivor who happened to have mental health training voiced his shock that Scientologists had attempted to recruit him and others .
What sort of numbers they 'll do in Haiti remains to be seen , but hats off to Travolta and the church leaders for deploying in this way .
As for Scientology 's most famous face , do recall " the Mr Cruise response to 9/11 " – setting up the First New York Hubbard Detox project where firemen who had breathed in the World Trade Centre dust were encouraged to submit to the " Purification Rundown " , discarding their medication and taking endless saunas along with high doses of niacin , much to the despair of their doctors .
Whether even Tom 's nuclear self - confidence extends to mooting the First Port - au - Prince Hubbard Detox Project , only time will tell .
Yesterday , at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona , Eric Schmidt and I demonstrated a prototype version of Google Goggles that showcases the potential of integrating Google 's machine translation and image recognition technologies .
In the video below , you 'll see how we use Goggles to take a picture of a German menu and instantly translate the text into English :
You may wonder what 's happening in the background .
On the simplest level , this prototype connects the phone 's camera to an optical character recognition ( OCR ) engine , recognizes the image as text and then translates that text into English with Google Translate .
Right now this technology only works for German - to - English translations and it's not yet ready for prime time .
However , it shows a lot of promise for what the future might hold .
Soon your phone will be able to translate signs , posters and other foreign text instantly into your language .
Eventually , we 're hoping to build a version of Google Goggles that can translate between all of the 52 languages currently supported by Google Translate — bringing even more information to you on the go .

Fark.com – Seattle ’s new city attorney dismissing all cases of pot possession .
Conservatives outraged , saying that expensive , bureaucratic , pointless lawyers and jail cells are the GOOD kind of socialism ( seattletimes.nwsource.com )
The headline is funny because its true ; liberals and conservatives both suffer from “ its not socialism when we do it ” blindness .
It is socialism , because the mindset behind the war on drugs and health care reform are one and the same : creating a better society through force of government .
It ’s saying individuals do n’t own the right to choose their actions if their actions do n’t benefit society as a whole .
The definition of socialism is ownership and control of the means of production and distribution .
When you can force your neighbor to follow your ideas of what is good for them , you are in essence claiming ownership of your neighbor ’s morality and following the philosophy of socialism .
You do n’t own your neighbor .
You are not your neighbor ’s authority .
You do n’t own their thoughts , or the right to determine which actions are to their benefit .
Its a good thing to want to be part of a beneficial change .
America is a society rich in morality .
It comes as no surprise there are large numbers of people speaking out on issues that need improvement .
Improving America ’s society through force damages that source of morality , free people choosing to do the right thing without the intervention of others .
The way to achieve a better society is through persuasion and reason , not force .
To those who embrace these socialist principles : the next time you see an evil in society and want to take a some action to improve the situation , speak up about it .
Let others know how you think , explain your reasons for supporting or opposing an action .
When reason fails to persuade and does n’t change views , you should MAKE A BETTER ARGUMENT !
Listen to the objections to your view , and use the feedback to craft a more persuasive argument .
Using force solve the problems in society is cowardly , because if you really believe in the logic and morality of your view , you ’ll let the view stand on its own .
If the change you seek really is beneficial , then it ’s inevitable and predictable the change will come about , even if you take no action at all .
Promoting a principle through force bastardizes the principle ; a good principle does n’t require force for others to adopt .
Using force to solve the problems in society is shortsighted .
Force is only effective while force is present .
When an authority is n’t present , people will do what they want to do .
Forcing anything , even a good thing can cause people to reject it , because it ’s natural to object to someone else running your life .
The best society possible is one where people of good conscience act to the benefit of themselves and others by their own choice .
There is no good kind of socialism .
Individuals with free will , reflecting principles of morality , own the means and production to a better society .
WASHINGTON , Feb. 14 , 2010  -- Former Vice President Dick Cheney , in an exclusive appearance on ABC News ' " This Week , " offered a sharp critique of the Obama administration 's handling of national security and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , saying any achievements over the past year largely stemmed from policies implemented under President George W. Bush .
" If [ the administration is ] going to take credit for [ Iraq 's success ] , fair enough ... but it ought to come with a healthy dose of ' Thank you , George Bush ' up front and a recognition that some of their early recommendations with respect to prosecuting that war were just dead wrong , " Cheney told ABC News ' Jonathan Karl .
Earlier Sunday , Vice President Joe Biden said on NBC's " Meet the Press " that Cheney " either is misinformed or he is misinforming " about what policies have been most effective in combating terrorists .
Biden has also suggested that Iraq may end up being one of the Obama administration 's greatest successes .
" Obama and Biden campaigned from one end of the country to the other for two years criticizing our Iraq policy , " Cheney said .
" If they had had their way , if we 'd followed the policies they 'd pursued from the outset or advocated from the outset , Saddam Hussein would still be in power in Baghdad today . "
On Afghanistan , Cheney said he is a " complete supporter " of President Obama 's decision to send more troops to the region and praised the selection of Gen. Stanley McChrystal to head the effort .
But the former vice president repeated his rebuke of the administration 's handling of suspected terrorists , including would - be Christmas Day bomber Umar Abdulmutallab .
Following the attempted attack on Dec. 25 , Abdulmuttallab was interrogated for 50 minutes , read his Miranda rights and has been arraigned in U.S. federal court .
The Obama administration also has promised to close the detention center at Guantanamo Bay , try several high - profile suspected terrorists in U.S. federal courts and repatriate others abroad .
Cheney said the Mirandizing and detention of convicted shoe - bomber Richard Reid by law enforcement officials in December 2001 was appropriate at the time because military commissions were not yet operational .
" We had n't had all the Supreme Court decisions handed down about what we could and could n't do with the commissions , " he said .
Reid was arraigned in U.S. federal court but never faced a trial because he pleaded guilty .
" I do see repeatedly examples that there are key members in the administration -- like Eric Holder , for example , the attorney general -- that still insist upon thinking of terror attacks against the United States as criminal acts of war , " Cheney said .
Cheney : Biden ' Dead Wrong ' on Chances of Another Attack
Cheney said the Obama administration 's " mindset " is putting the country at risk of a terrorist attack and cited as an example Vice President Biden 's recent statement that another attack on the scale of 9/11 is " unlikely . "
" I just think that 's just dead wrong , " Cheney said .
" I think the biggest threat the United States faces today is the possibility of another 9/11 with a nuclear weapon or a biological agent of some kind .
And I think al Qaeda is out there -- even as we meet -- trying to do that .
" You have to consider it as a war , " Cheney said .
" You have to consider it as something we may have to deal with tomorrow .
You do n't want the vice president of the United States running around saying , ' Oh , it 's not likely going to happen . ' "
The former vice president acknowledged that the debate over whether to treat threats to national security as criminal or wartime acts was waged within the Bush administration , too .
" We had a major shootout over how this was going to be handled between the Justice Department that advocated that approach and the rest of us that wanted to treat it as an act of war , " he said .
Cheney said he disagrees with Obama administration 's decision not to use so - called enhanced interrogation techniques and said he argued for them within the administration during the Bush years .
" I was a big supporter of waterboarding , " Cheney said .
" I was a big supporter of the enhanced interrogation techniques .
... I think you ought to have all of those capabilities on the table . "
Cheney , who said he has not seen former President George W. Bush since they left office over one year ago , may be the previous administration 's most outspoken member .
He added that he was " deeply offended " by attempts to investigate and prosecute the Bush administration and CIA officials who helped construct and justify their counterterrorism policy .
" I thought it was important for some senior person in the administration to stand up and defend those people who'd done what we asked them to do , " he said .
Cheney Undecided on Palin for President
When asked about former Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska 's presidential qualifications , Cheney said , " I have n't made a decision yet on who I 'm going to support .
" I think all of the prospective candidates out there have got a lot of work to do if in fact they are going to persuade a majority of Americans that they are ready to take on the world 's toughest job , " Cheney said .
An ABC News / Washington
Post poll released this week found 71 percent say " no " when asked if Palin is qualified to serve as president .
Among Republicans polled , approximately 52 percent think she 's not qualified to be commander in chief .
Cheney took issue with Palin 's suggestion that President Obama could help himself politically if he declared war on Iran .
" I do n't think a president can make a judgment like that on the basis of politics , " Cheney said .
" The stakes are too high , the consequences too significant to be treating those as simple political calculations .
When you begin to talk about war , talk about crossing international borders , you talk about committing American men and women to combat , that takes place on a plane clear above any political consideration . "
In an interview last week on " Fox News Sunday , " Palin said that if Obama " toughen[ed ] up " and " secured our nation , " people might think differently about him .
" Say he decided to declare war on Iran or decide to really come out and do whatever he could to support Israel , which I would like him to do , " Palin said .
" [ I ] f he decided to toughen up ... I think people would perhaps shift their thinking a little bit and decide , ' Well , maybe he 's tougher than we think he's , than he is today . ' "
Gays in the Military : Reconsider ' Do n't Ask , Don't Tell , ' Cheney Says
Cheney said he thinks it 's time to " reconsider " the " Do n't Ask , Don't Tell " policy that prohibits gays and lesbians from serving openly in the U.S. military .
" Twenty years ago , the military were strong advocates of ' Do n't Ask , Don't Tell ' when I was secretary of defense , " Cheney said .
" I think things have changed significantly since then . "
Cheney served as the secretary of defense from 1989 to 1993 in the first Bush administration .
" I 'm reluctant to second - guess the military in this regard , " Cheney said .
" When the chiefs come forward and say , ' We think we can do it , ' then it strikes me that it 's time to reconsider the policy .
Cheney Penning Memoir
The former vice president plans to see his former boss , President George W. Bush , at an administration reunion in the coming weeks , he said .
Cheney has been keeping busy by penning his memoir , which is due on bookshelves next year .
Geekbench result posted to their site on February 4th has generated a lot of excitement in our forums .
The report seems to reveal the results for an unreleased Arrandale MacBook Pro running at 2.66GHz .
Intel officially unveiled the new latest mobile chips at CES 2010 and Apple has been widely expected to use them in their next MacBook Pro revisions .
The MacBook Pro gives a " 6,1 " model designation and a non-shipping build of Mac OS X 10.6.2 ( Build 10C3067 ) .
The 6,1 designation has been spotted before in recent builds of Mac OS X 10.6.2 .
The later build number is also consistent with the kind of interim builds Apple provides with brand new hardware .
The processor is listed as an Intel Core i7 M 620 running at 2.66GHz .
The final benchmark score of 5260 compares favorably to identically clocked ( 2.66GHz ) shipping MacBook Pros ( 3700 -4000 ) .
The Core i7 M 620 is a high end dual core processor with Turbo Boost and Hyperthreading .
Apple 's MacBook
Pros are due for updates and Intel 's new mobile processors are the most likely candidates .
While we have n't heard any solid evidence , there have been rumblings from international resellers that Apple 's MacBook Pros supplies have been constrained .
Supplies can be constrained for any number of reasons , but the timing does fit with a MacBook Pro refresh .

Your three weblinks do not offer proof .
One should always keep confirmation bias in check and look at data objectively .
People are not always honest .

The claim that man hunted down dinosaurs is a total lie .
No dinosaur bones have ever been found to conclude that they lived in the same time as man .
I disagree that something reported in the Bible which states that something had iron ribs means a dinosaur .
I also find very little evidence in the links which simply states ' two men saw a dinosaur in 1915 ' or ' in 1855 two men from the church congregation claimed to have killed a dragon ' .
To me , it offers no proof whatsoever .
Yet , to a person who WANTS to believe in dinosaurs existing today , it registers in your brain as undeniable evidence .
If so many persons claim to have spotted Nessie , why is it that only one blurry photograph is all we have ?
I do not state that no dinosaurs exist today somewhere in the oceans .
I state that one needs to have an amount of skepticism whenever one delves into subjects where extremely little ACTUAL evidence exists .

Okay , let 's take an objective look at the Moore beach ( Natural Bridges State Beach ) monster found in 1925 by Charles Moore .
There was only one scientist who viewed the creature .
He was E.L. Wallace , president of the Natural Historical Society of British Columbia .
He stated that he could not identify it .
He then concluded that it MAY have been some TYPE of plesiosaur .
Later , he offered the theory that the monster may have been preserved in a glacier for millions of years , finally being released by the gradual melting of ice , eventually ending up cast upon the shore in Monterey Bay .
This in no way suggests that plesiosaurs exist today .
Historical accounts are unreliable since newspapers which reported the find each gave different dimensions of the creature .
Later , a book by Bernard Heuvelman served to confuse the subject even further by stating false exagerations of the newspaper dimensions .
Officials from the California Academy of Sciences carefully inspected the creature 's skull , and announced to the waiting world that the mysterious monster of Moore 's Beach was a North Pacific type of beaked whale .
Baird 's Beaked Whale ( Berardis bairdi ) is rarely seen from ships at sea which means that the connection of a beaked whale did not quickly come to mind when attempting to identify the beached creature .
There is evidence which supports the beaked whale link .
A report was published in the Santa Cruz Sentinel newspaper of an account of a battle between a dozen or more sea lions and a ' monster fish ' observed by E.J. Lear , days before Charles Moore found it .
As stated by Mr. Lear himself : " I was driving a team toward Capitola , when suddenly I was attracted by some young sea lions not far out .
They were lined up and several large lions were swimming back and forth in front of them .
Much farther out I saw the water being churned to foam and thrown high up in the air .
It was shiny and I took it for a big fish .
A dozen or more lions were battling it , and every once in a while all would raise out of the water .
It looked to me as though all the sea lions were attacking it beneath as the monster came out of the water several times .
In telling of the battle of that night I estimated its length at 30 feet . "
Further evidence exists in the fact that beaked whales are highly aggressive towards each other resulting in scarring and deaths .
Persons in the scientific community sometimes make mistakes .
In this case , the rest of the world was waiting for an answer which did not exist .
Time pressures caused some to call the creature a plesiosaur simply to get the issue resolved .
A similar example is the archeoraptor which was originally claimed to be a missing evolutionary link .
Later , it was exposed as a hoax .
If the creature was not a beaked whale , it most probably was part of the cetacean family .
Monterey Bay boasts the deepest underwater trench of the Pacific Coast .
One of the world 's largest and least studied underwater chasms .
Possibly home to hundreds of unknown species .

How about the Japanese fishing boat monster ?
It was caught in a fishing net on 4/25 / 77 .
The National Enquirer was a pretty hot tabloid back then .
It did n't matter if the story was highly fictional or fake .
Of course , they printed it as a prehistoric monster because that 's what it took to sell the paper .
One would think that the creature would have been preserved so a profesional could study it .
Nope , this amazing find was quickly thrown back into the water to avoid contaminating the other fish that were onboard .
Seems kind ot strange do n't you think ?
Fortunately , some tissue samples were taken .
Several lines of evidence , including lab results from tissue samples , strongly point to the specimen being a shark , and most likely a basking shark .
This should not be surprising , since basking sharks are known to decompose into pseudoplesiosaur forms , and their carcasses have been mistaken for " sea- monsters " many times in the past .
Unfortunately , the results of scientific studies on the carcass data received less media attention than the early sensational reports , allowing widespread misconceptions about this case to continue circulating .
Truth does n't seem to sell as well as mysteries .
In fact , when the crew returned home the company owner played up the plesiosaur story for publicity even though the tissue sample were still in the lab being tested .
It was the best place to shock people who have Godzilla as their hero .
On 7/25/77 , Taiyo Fish Company issued a report on biochemical tests on the tissue samples .
The report stated that fibers sampled from the carcass was similar in nature to the fin rays of sharks but by now Japan was caught up in monster mania .
Wind - up toys of the beast were sold and the camera company which produced the camera used to take the photos conjured an advertising campaign .
The Japanese government decided to make some money too via a new postage stamp .
Why would anyone making some quick cash want the truth to come out ?
When lab results concluded that chromatography tests matched the amino acids of the blue shark particularly the basking shark ( Cetorhinus maximus ) , it was too late for truth to replace the hype .
When the basking shark decays , the jaws and loosely attached gill arches often fall away first , leaving the appearance of a long neck and small head .
All or part of the tail , and the dorsal fin may also slough away before the better supported pectoral and pelvic fins , creating a form that superficially resembles a plesiosaur .
These remains are found in fishing nets about every 10 years .
Close photographic anaysis shows that the creatures head was turtle - shaped .
This is consistant for basking sharks .
Plesiosaurs had triangular - shaped heads .
Photographic evidense reveals the presence of fin rays which are present in sharks and most fish .
Plesiosaurs in contrast had bony phalanges .
The creature had a dorsal fin seen in sharks and most fish .
Plesiosaurs did not have this .
The creature had myocommata found in sharks but not reptiles such as the plesiosaur .
The anterior fins were articulated at a right angle to the shoulder , consistent with sharks but not plesiosaurs
The pectoral girdle is shark - like in shape .
If the carcass were a plesiosaur , the body would be unlikely to bend in the posture shown since the breast bone would be large and flat .
The ventral bones of plesiosaurs are not seen in the carcass .
In plesiosaurs , bones of all limbs were situated at the ventral portion of the body .
If the creature were a decayed plesiosaur , it is likely the limbs would have already been detached from the body .
A plesiosaur would probably have retained its upper jaws and teeth but no teeth were reported in the carcass .
A basking shark is known to easily loose both jaws , and even if it retained the upper jaw , its extremely tiny teeth could be easily overlooked .
The body proportions are incompatible with any known plesiosaur fossils .
In many plesiosaurs the neck is by far the longest section , and in no case is the torso much longer than the head and neck , as it is in the carcass .
The body proportions are compatable with a basking shark .
In 1978 , scientists in Japan finally admitted their errors .
They publicly acknowledged that most evidence pointed to a shark and ruled out a plesiosaur .
They admitted that no known reptilian fossils matched the creature .
They concluded that the creature was most likely a basking shark .
The media chose not to do a follow - up report .
Thus , most people never heard the final conclusions .
The plesiosaur remained a good topic for book sales even though there was overwhelming proof of it being a basking shark .
Since you appear to have such a strong interest in this topic , you may wish to choose a career in underwater biology .

I receive a thumbs down by someone who refuses to accept truth .
Again it comes down to selective bias .
I have presented the objective truth regarding the above .
The person who thumbed down refuses to look at the subject objectively .
This is why hoaxes and misunderstandings get perpetuated .
This is why tabloid papers make money .
Some people just WANT to live in a mysterious world .
When the truth is presented , it is ignored because their immature BELIEFS override thruthful evidence .
Maybe some day we may find prehistoric sea creatures .
So far , we have only sharks and alligators .
No plesiosaurs .
If undeniable evidence does not prove the question wrong , then there is no hope .
You can believe whatever you want to .
But try to keep in mind that you are only deluding yourself .
Such an approach is not a scientific one .
P.S. A plesiosaur is not a dinosaur .
With its winners and losers , politics is a lot like sports .
Now biologists have the testosterone — or lack thereof — to prove it .
Specifically , they have found that male voters who back a losing candidate experience a drop in the hormone .
Immediately before and after the 2008 U.S. presidential election result , neuroscientists from Duke University and the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor collected the saliva of 163 college - age participants to determine the amount of testosterone in their systems .
Male voters for winner Barack Obama had stable levels of testosterone , but the hormone rapidly declined in males who cast ballots for losers John McCain and Robert Barr .
Female voters showed no significant testosterone changes after victory or defeat of their candidate .
Past research has shown that winning and losing in sports matches and other competitions affect testosterone levels in men .
The new findings , published online October 21 by PLoS ONE , reveal that politics can influence testosterone in men “ just as if they directly engaged head to head in a contest for dominance , ” says Kevin LaBar of Duke , the study ’s senior researcher .
In separate work , anthropologist Coren Apicella of Harvard University and her colleagues obtained similar results with a smaller group , findings they will publish this year .
“ It ’s an exciting time for people who study political behavior , where biological factors have largely been ignored , ” she notes .
“ Political scientists are starting to recognize the role of biology , and more and more research is showing there may be some reciprocal interactions between how elections make one feel and how feelings can affect political behavior . ”
Testosterone is linked to aggression , risk taking and responses to threats .
Bumps and drops in testosterone levels after competition can help both winners and losers in all species , explains Steven Stanton , the Duke study ’s lead author .
Victors may get motivated to pursue further gains , whereas also - rans are encouraged to back down so as not to press onward and potentially get injured .
Indeed , in the Duke study , McCain and Barr voters reported feeling significantly more controlled , submissive , unhappy and unpleasant after the loss than the Obama supporters did .
The team conjectures that because the shift in the hierarchy of dominance in the nation after a presidential election is stable for at least four years , the stress of having one ’s political party lose executive control could plausibly lead to continued testosterone suppression in males .
But “ it ’s hard to know how long - lasting these effects might be , ” LaBar remarks , considering that many factors influence testosterone levels .
LaBar and his team , though , are shifting gears .
“ We ’re now going to try and explore this in spectator sports , ” he says .
“ Sports competitions are not like the political process , where you can have a direct influence on the outcome , but obviously avid sports fans are highly invested personally in the outcome of a game . ”

As many of you residents of Maryland are aware , the Old Line State takes a hard line when it comes to shipping wine .
Lots of states have laws limiting the shipment of liquor to a private residences ; many limit the amount one may receive in a year , some only permit intrastate shipment , and others levy a tax .
At my old retail job , we often shipped to some of the more , erm , " questionable states , " and had a pretty good success rate .
Maryland , though , was on a very short list of no - no states , as their laws are downright draconian .
Not only does the state forbid liquor shipping from out - of - state , but in - state liquor shipment of any kind is also verboten .
And guess what ?
If you 're caught , it 's a FELONY , even for the recipient !
Sound a bit outmoded ?
Unjust ?
Unconstitutional , even ?
A lot of folks think so , and have pushed for legislation to have Maryland join the thirty - some - odd states that treat their citizens like responsible adults .
In both '08 and '09 bills have crossed the congressional table , but thanks to tired old morals and some stiff opposition from the wholesaler lobby ( which has much to lose , and lots of money to throw around ) each has been summarily dispatched .
But grassroots support has been building , with several groups popping up fighting for the rights of MD drinkers , most notably the Marylanders for Better Beer and Wine Laws .
Founded in 2005 , the MBBWL organizes meet - ups advocates on behalf of Maryland producers and consumers .
Thanks to their work and that of some allies in the government , it looks as if another bill might make it to the floor this session .
But they need your help !
The nice thing about issues like this is that an single individual can have a real impact .
So what can you do ?
Everybody :
Go to MBBWL's Petition Site , and take a few seconds to give your support .
The group is hoping to gather 10,000 digital signatures in support of altering MD 's antiquated and prohibitive liquor laws .
They are well on their way , but could certainly use your help .
Maryland Residents :
Free The Grapes , a national advocacy group for free and open wine trade , has made petitioning your state legislators on this matter a breeze .
Click on this link , and you will be taken to a site with all the digital details taken care of for you .
Simply fill in your info , personalize your message as you see fit , and hit send , and your representatives in the House and Senate will soon know how you feel .
Take a look at MBBWL 's event calander , and consider attending one of their meetups .
On February 22nd , the group will be attending a House Economic Matters Committee hearing dedicated to this very issue .
If you are passionate about the cause and live in the greater Annapolis area , take an afternoon off any make your voice heard .
On the scale of injustices in the world , this is , of course , a minor one .
But if you are resident of DC or Virginia , where laws are more progressive , it will only take you a couple seconds to do your neighbors to the north a solid .
And Marylanders , I know your state has as many problems as the next , but this is a inequity with a realizable solution just over the horizon .
Not only do these laws hurt consumers and support big business , but they are also a huge detriment to your state 's growing winemaking industry .

The International Space Station ( ISS ) is an internationally developed research facility , which is being assembled in low Earth orbit .
On -orbit construction of the station began in 1998 and is scheduled for completion by 2011 .
The station will remain in operation until at least 2015 .
With a greater mass than that of any previous space station , the ISS can be seen from the Earth with the naked eye , and , as of 2010 [ update ] , is the largest artificial satellite orbiting the Earth .
The ISS serves as a research laboratory that has a microgravity environment in which crews conduct experiments in biology , human biology , physics , astronomy and meteorology .
The station has a unique environment for the testing of the spacecraft systems that will be required for missions to the Moon and Mars .
The ISS is operated by Expedition crews , and has been continuously staffed since 2 November 2000 — an uninterrupted human presence in space for the past 9 years and 75 days .
As of 1 December 2009 , the crew of Expedition 22 is aboard .
The ISS is a synthesis of several space station projects that includes the American Freedom , the Soviet / Russian Mir - 2 , the European Columbus and the Japanese Kibō .
Budget constraints led to the merger of these projects into a single multi-national programme .
The ISS project began in 1994 with the Shuttle - Mir programme , and the first module of the station , Zarya , was launched in 1998 by Russia .
Assembly continues , as pressurised modules , external trusses and other components are launched by American space shuttles , Russian Proton rockets and Russian Soyuz rockets .
As of November 2009 [ update ] , the station consisted of 11 pressurised modules and an extensive integrated truss structure ( ITS ) .
Power is provided by 16 solar arrays mounted on the external truss , in addition to four smaller arrays on the Russian modules .
The station is maintained at an orbit between 278 km ( 173 mi ) and 460 km ( 286 mi ) altitude , and travels at an average speed of 27,724 km ( 17,227 mi ) per hour , completing 15.7 orbits per day .
Operated as a joint project between the five participant space agencies , the station 's sections are controlled by mission control centres on the ground operated by the American National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) , the Russian Federal Space Agency ( RKA ) , the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency ( JAXA ) , the Canadian Space Agency ( CSA ) , and the European Space Agency ( ESA ) .
The ownership and use of the space station is established in intergovernmental treaties and agreements that allow the Russian Federation to retain full ownership of its own modules , with the remainder of the station allocated between the other international partners .
The station is serviced by Soyuz spacecraft , Progress spacecraft , space shuttles , the Automated Transfer Vehicle and the H - II Transfer Vehicle , and has been visited by astronauts and cosmonauts from 15 different nations .
The cost of the station has been estimated by ESA as € 100 billion over 30 years , and , although estimates range from 35 billion dollars to 160 billion dollars , the ISS is believed to be the most expensive object ever constructed .
The financing , research capabilities and technical design of the ISS programme have been criticised because of the high cost .

Calls for Competition Commission inquiry after claim that energy giants are not passing on falls in wholesale gas prices
Energy companies have been accused of profiteering by failing to pass on steep falls in world gas prices to consumers at a time when bitterly cold weather means soaring bills for tens of millions of customers .
Consumer watchdog Consumer Focus is calling for a Competition Commission investigation to address " anomalies " in the energy sector that are likely to see British Gas 's residential business report a 40 % rise in profits to £ 540 m for 2009 .
The company has benefited from the slump in wholesale gas prices since mid-2008 , down by about 35 % , but price cuts for consumers have been at a much lower level .
For gas customers , the firm has cut prices by just 10 % since last February .
Consumer Focus says that all the big suppliers have failed to fully pass on wholesale price reductions ; British Gas is by no means the worst culprit , it adds .
Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Vince Cable agrees there is a case for a Competition Commission inquiry .
" Just six big companies control the lion 's share of the market ... making it difficult for rivals to break into the sector and providing an environment where it was relatively easy for prices to fluctuate within a narrow band , " he said .
And power generation companies could spark more controversy because they have taken advantage of the recent spike in wholesale natural gas prices caused by the cold weather to sell energy to traders .
Some insiders suggest these activities contributed to the restriction of gas supplies that affected many major industrial users last week .
Regulator Ofgem is due shortly to publish a report on the profit margins enjoyed by the energy majors as part of a monitoring programme that is designed to ensure wholesale and retail prices do not get too far out of kilter .
Analysts say margins at the moment are at around 7 % , the highest for several years .
Last week , prime minister Gordon Brown said energy companies should behave more responsibly .
He said : " One of the continuous problems I have is trying to persuade the companies to pass on cuts in oil prices [ which are closely linked to gas prices ] so that the consumer is not hit when the price is going up and then not given any benefit at all when prices are coming down . "
Robert Hammond of Consumer Focus said : " Wholesale and domestic electricity supplies now largely come from different arms of the same companies .
This leaves the sector dominated by a small number of players who can self - supply their own electricity , with a lack of transparency over this relationship .
" The limited volume of trading , particularly in electricity , also restricts competition .
A Competition Commission investigation is needed to inject genuine competition in these markets . "
A British Gas spokesman said people did not realise that energy groups buy gas well in advance , sometimes 18 months ahead of time , and that the company was still tied into some relatively expensive contracts .
Ofgem added that on average , 11 % of bills are accounted for by charges that energy firms incur to meet new environmental standards .
" It 's complicated , " said a spokesman .
But Ann Robinson , director of consumer policy at price comparison website uSwitch , said : " The main problem is that we do n't have transparency in the UK energy market .
We do n't know if firms buy one , two or five years in advance . "
It seems obvious to us that consumers are sold short and that something needs to be done about it . "
But Ofgem has warned that higher bills in the future are almost inevitable as £ 200bn of new investment may be needed in the next few years if the private sector suppliers is are to deliver energy security .
and meet climate change plans for Britain .
Consumers could face price rises of up to 60 % in their gas and electricity bills in the next seven years as energy supplies become more volatile , the regulator admitted at the end of last year .
Its explosive report on future energy supplies said the biggest challenge was the country 's growing reliance on a volatile global gas market as North Sea supplies dwindled and the need rose for variable power to compensate for intermittent sources such as wind .
Alistair Buchanan , Ofgem 's chief executive said : " Our scenarios suggest that Britain faces a tough challenge in maintaining secure supplies whilst at the same time meeting its climate change targets . "
Only in Vegas :
The magic carpets designed to keep you awake and gambling
Las Vegas is well - known for being the city that never sleeps as gamblers are encouraged to spend their money around the clock .
Now a new set of photographs has revealed that even the garish carpets that line the hotels and casinos have an important part to play .
Garish designs : A paisley carpet at the Bellagio , in Las Vegas ( pictured below ) , which makes tens of millions of pounds a year
Chris Maluszynski , 35 , has spent four years snapping the kaleidoscopic designs after noticing them on a business trip .
They include samples from the MGM Grand , Bellagio , Luxor and The Flamingo .
He said : ' Vegas is I feel the most surreal place in the world .
In the middle of the desert you have this huge neon - lit metropolis , which is bizarre in itself .
' Everywhere you look when you are on The Strip or Downtown there are flashing lights to mesmerise you .
' I found myself trying to give my eyes a rest from the chaos by looking at the floor , but there is no respite even there .
' I noticed the carpets were as loud as everything else out there and I was really blown away by the detail and effort that had gone into them .
They are like carpets you see nowhere else .
Only in Vegas , as the saying goes . '
The outrageous carpets do nothing to distract gamblers at Las Vegas 's most popular casinos
This floral carpet is one of many garish designs intended to keep casino regulars awake
The extreme carpets unleash an assault on the senses in a deliberate attempt to keep tourists wide awake .
This is compounded by the fact Vegas casinos and hotels do n't have windows so that customers become confused about what time of day it is .
Dr David Schwartz from the Center for Gaming Research in Nevada said : ' Casino carpet is known as an exercise in deliberate bad taste that somehow encourages people to gamble .
' Many of the carpets use wheels - famous to the Romans as a symbol of the relentless capriciousness of fortune .
' Could it be a subtle reminders to casino patrons that life and luck are fleeting , and one should eat , drink , and be merry before the morrow brings a swing in fortune ?'

Some bloggers have speculated greens and reds are used to make dropped chips harder to find
Bloggers have also speculated that the intricate patterns also help to conceal the red and green chips that gamblers may accidentally drop .
' It seems that every inch of everything out there has been designed to bombard your brain into staying awake , ' Mr Maluszynski concluded .
' It 's all about keeping you stimulated .
Tourists spend money when they are not asleep . '

Sandy Irvine of The Green Party predicts that , despite the amazing advances of human beings in the 20th and 21st centuries , those years will be known by the historians of the future as the “ Age of Stupid ” .
The age when leadership failed at its most fundamental level ; when society collectively refused to see that we were engaged in a long term process that threatened the species ( not just homo sapiens ) as a conseqence of our technological successes which in turn lead to unfettered population growth based largely on finite resources .
Yes – The Age of Stupid !
We spend billions of pounds , dollars or whatever on trying to reverse the impact we make on our planet yet seem to accept without challenge or comment the fact that every hour we add a further 10,000 to our population .
This depletes our natural capital .
We are using groundwater to such an extent that replacement is impossible if usage levels continue .
Our fossil fuels may give another 100 years or more at ever increasing cost .
We may be lucky and get technology to mitigate this depletion but at 10,000 births per hour we are draining the glass quicker than we can fill it .
Indefinite population growth is physically impossible – it must stop at some point either through measures that we introduce or through death through famine , drought , disease , war and environmental collapse or a mix of all of these combined .
Many experts view the sustainable population of the planet is around 2,000 million – about one quarter of the forecasted level in the middle of this century .
There are some serious policies required if this is to be achieved and we are not to become the agents of our own demise .
In spite of this , I remain an optimist that the scales will fall from the eyes of the policy makers and that the conversations that are needed will take place .
The alternative is not worth contemplating and we will be rightly tagged as those who managed the Age of Stupid .

Obama Gives Speeches , Interviews But Few Press Conferences Media complain , but White House insists Obama is accessible .
Jan. 14 , 2010  --
There 's a tug of war in every administration between the White House and the media that cover it .
Reporters want more access and more quality time to question the president , while staffers want to control how the message plays .
The two goals are quite often at odds .
In the era of Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and blogs , the Obama Administration has been savvy about how it communicates its message and seems to agree with the previous administration on at least one point :
Go around the media filter and engage directly with the U.S. public .
At issue is whether the president has an obligation to take questions on a regular basis from the group of reporters that cover him daily .
The reporters say yes .
The White House says , well , we choose to do that differently .
President Obama has not held a full news conference at the White House since July 22 , the night he said that the Cambridge Police " acted stupidly " in the arrest of Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates .
Since then , the president has delivered dozens of speeches and taken a few questions from reporters while with world leaders on foreign trips .
But , lately , it is rare for him to take questions from the media at events or meetings at the White House .
Obama had five news conferences at the White House last year , one more than President George W. Bush had in his first year in office .
When it was noted last week that Obama had not had a news conference at the White House since last summer , spokesman Robert Gibbs turned it back on reporters .
" I think the last time ... we talked about the president 's media schedule , and here you all , to a person , reminded me of our dramatic overexposure , " Gibbs said .
Gibbs was referring to last year when the cable pundits were chattering about how everywhere you turned , there was Obama .
Five Sunday morning political show interviews , breaking down NASCAR and college basketball on ESPN , dropping by David Letterman 's show and appearing in a promo for a new television show featuring comedian George Lopez , it seemed as though the president was on every channel talking about everything under the sun .
The White House was clear about its media strategy , wanting to go beyond the typical news junkie and reach a broad spectrum of Americans .
But that did n't stop the pundits from claiming it was an Obama overload .
The White House reporters who cover him on a daily basis have a different view , said Caren Bohan , a White House correspondent for Reuters and a board member of the White House Correspondents Association .
" I do n't think there is a feeling in the briefing room among reporters who regularly cover the president that he 's overexposed in terms of giving too many press conferences , " said Bohan , who has covered the White House since 2003 .
Gibbs was again questioned about the news conference drought this week .
The White House spokesman said , no , the president was not avoiding reporters and reiterated the media 's concern about overexposure .
When he asked for a show of hands from those who wanted a news conference , Gibbs got unanimous agreement from the press corps : Bring on the president .
White House Strategy , Reach the Most Americans Possible
The White House says the president is not hiding and , indeed , does regular interviews with a wide variety of media .
But they 're one - on - one interviews , not a large collective news conference .
Obama sat down at the end of last year for a slew of interviews with organizations such as ABC News , the Washington Post , PBS ' " Newshour " and NPR .
He has been interviewed this year by CNN 's Roland Martin and People magazine .
Dana Perino , press secretary for George W. Bush , said the media is not being tough enough on the Obama White House .
" Ask yourself , would the media have sat so idly by if Bush had not given interviews ?
I think we all know the answer , " she said .
" Interviews are great ways to communicate , but as Vanilla Ice said , it 's not the same . "
The White House is making a strategic calculation on when it offers the president for a news conference .
The Obama communications team has shown it 's willing to have the president face the firing squad of questioners , but it would prefer to hold it during the television networks ' prime time line - up .
A prime time slot equals more viewers and the administration wants to get the most bang for its buck .
The networks have strongly pushed back against this becoming a trend because airing an hour of the president means an hour of no commercials , and a loss of revenue .
The White House knows it has to balance its requests for network prime time coverage :
Ask too frequently and the networks could simple decline to cover the president .
The other option is to put the president before the media during the day .
But the concern there is that the potential audience is dramatically smaller .
As a result , the White House is making the strategic calculation that it will get better results by doing many selected interviews across a variety of platforms -- television , radio , print -- instead of daytime news conferences .
Reuters ' Bohan said she hopes the White House adjusts its thinking on the issue of access to the president .
" I think it 's very important that they do make him more available for press conferences , " she said .
" I think that the unfortunate trend in presidencies is that each year access gets narrowed more and more and I think we 're seeing that trend this year . "

Ibrahim , a 20 - year - old Galilee Muslim whose failed circumcision twoyears earlier left him with too little penile skin to perform hismatrimonial duties , was abandoned by his fiancee prior to theirwedding .
But plastic surgeon Prof. Yaron Har - Shai eventually enabled Ibrahim to get engaged to another woman by adapting – for the firsttime in the world – a technique used on hand and facial burns torehabilitate his penis , restoring normal function .
Har -Shai and colleagues at Haifa ’s Carmel Medical Center and the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology ’s Rappaport Faculty of Medicinehave just published their report on the highly unusual case in the British , which presents not only the details of the procedure but also ‘ before ’ and ‘ after ’ photos .
The doctors ’ careful search of the Medline databaseshowed that the technique had not been used previously to correct sucha problem .
The man , now 21 , is due to wed a different woman who accepted hismarriage proposal after hearing about the normal appearance andfunctioning of his penis .
Upon hearing the news , the Carmel staff whotreated him sent the couple a huge bouquet of flowers and wishes forgood luck and many children .
Instead of undergoing a ritual circumcision at the conventional age forMuslims – 13 years – the man waited until 18 , apparently because hecomes from a secular family and did n’t think it was important , Har -Shaitoldon Monday .
The procedure was performed by an overzealous traditional practitioner , who botched the job .
Instead of removing just the foreskin , he also cutoff ventral penile skin , a complication that occurs in 0.2 percent ofcircumcisions .
Although able to have erections before the accident , the unfortunateman found that the error shortened his organ by causing the developmentof scar tissue that prevented the skin from expanding with increasedblood supply .
Skin webbing developed from the sub-coronal groove to theanterior scrotal base .
Intercourse was impossible , and when his firstfiancee learned about his condition , the wedding was off .
An anesthesiologist who knew the family turned to Har - Shai , a Techniongraduate who worked at Haifa ’s Rambam Medical Center until he wasinvited to head the plastic surgery department at Carmel .
Surgeons abroad trying to treat similar injuries in the past took skinfrom other parts of the patient ’s body and transplanted it onto thepenis ; the result , however , was not only of a different color but thepenis also sometimes developed a web texture and became too small toallow for intercourse .
First , Har -Shai performed a known procedure called Z - plasty , atechnique used to improve the functional and cosmetic appearance ofscars .
It can elongate a contracted scar or rotate the scar tensionline .
The procedure , however , was unsuccessful .
Har - Shai ’s father , Prof. Bernard Hirshowitz , was a pioneer in plasticsurgery at Rambam before his retirement and years ago developed the “ flap technique - 5 ” procedure to enable webbed skin between fingers tobecome flexible after suffering a burn and shrinking , as well as fortreating facial skin injuries .
But it had never been used torehabilitate a shrunken penis .
Har - Shai decided to adapt his father ’s innovation – for the first timein the world – to the young man ’s problem .
He created five flaps fromsmall bits of skin left on the man ’s penis itself so they were notrejected and did not turn into webbing .
“ Although previous surgery had been executed at the surgical site , uneventful healing of the skin flaps and complete relaxation andelongation of the skin web [ was ] achieved , ” the team wrote .
The man ’s penile length measured 11 centimeters after the procedure –eight centimeters longer than it was after the complications from thecircumcision set in .
Two months after the operation , the patient hadfunctional erections , Har - Shai told “ It also looks great , very aesthetic , ” he enthused .
He added that hisfather ’s flap technique - 5 could also be used on baby boys if they havea shortage of skin .
There have been no previous reports of such a complication incircumcisions in Israel , even though some 50,000 ritual procedures areperformed here each year .
Har - Shai said he saw references to thecomplication occurring in Iran .
“ I would have no problem treating Iranians who need it , ” he said , though there are no diplomatic relations between the two countries .
“ The Iranian nuclear issue has become the main pillar of the regime ’s legitimacy , ” said Mustafa el - Labbad , an Iran expert in Cairo .
“ So Ahmadinejad is putting it in the center of the scene in order to conceal the internal differences and huge domestic challenges they face . ”
It is not at all clear how much uranium has been enriched or whether Iran has the capacity to transform that into either weapons - grade fuel or even into the fuel rods necessary for running the medical research reactor it says it aims to supply .
The Obama administration dismissed the idea that Iran had the capacity to enrich uranium to weapons grade .
The White House press secretary , Robert Gibbs , said , “ Iran has made a series of statements ” that were “ based on politics , not on physics , ” The Associated Press reported .
Mr. Ahmadinejad ’s speech , delivered from a platform decorated with flowers , was heard by a largely sympathetic crowd that had been bused in from around the country to celebrate the most important political celebration of the year .
The day is similar to the Fourth of July in the United States or Bastille Day in France , and like those holidays it is steeped in myth and symbolism .
Both the opposition and the government hoped to control the message of the day .
The opposition leaders , Mir Hussein Moussavi and Mehdi Karroubi , had called on their supporters to fill the streets , though they had not offered a clear plan .
The government provided little room for the opposition to gain traction .
It sent thousands of security officers into Azadi Square the night before to intimidate the opposition and , if necessary , block it from participating .
Those who attended the rally disappeared in a sea of government supporters .
I spoke little Pashto , he spoke little English .
I came up with a routine when a newspaper arrived .
I showed Asad photos and tried to explain what they were about .
He laughed , but I felt like a monster .
Asad was an impoverished , hard - working father of two  and I was going to get him killed .
On the third day after Badruddin ’s visit , I told one of our guards that I was willing to make a video  or do anything they wanted  to save Asad .
The guard said he would check with Badruddin .
The following day , the guard announced that it had all been a misunderstanding .
There was no deadline to kill Asad .
I did n’t know what the truth was but felt enormous relief .
Several days later , Badruddin arrived to make the video .
He promised us that it would go only to our families , but what he instructed us to say made me think it would be released publicly .
As guards pointed assault rifles at our heads , I called for President Bush and President - elect Obama to meet the Taliban ’s demands .
“ If you do n’t meet their demands , ” I said , “ they will kill all of us . ”
Tahir and Asad then made similar statements .
Badruddin departed , and I told myself that our families would at least know we were alive .
As December dragged on , tensions in the house steadily grew .
Qari , the guard who had nearly shot Tahir , tore the checkah board to shreds after he repeatedly lost .
Then , Tahir and Asad ripped up two other checkah boards out of frustration as well .
Qari began spending hours alone reciting the Koran and seemed increasingly distant and unstable .
I worried that the situation was slowly spinning out of control .
SEVERAL days before Christmas , Atiqullah finally returned .
He announced that he had spectacular news .
“ We are here to free you , ” he said , wearing no scarf over his face for the first time .
“ We have come here to release you . ”
At first , I was euphoric .
My confidence in Atiqullah had not been misplaced .
Here was a more moderate and reasonable Taliban leader who would persevere and release us .
WASHINGTON --
Showing little sympathy for critics of his proposed fee on big financial institutions , President Barack Obama vowed to recover all the cash taxpayers spent on the Troubled Asset Relief Program , saying he wo n't let Wall Street " take the money and run . "
In his weekly radio address Saturday , Mr. Obama said the large banks that are gearing up to dole out billions in bonuses can afford to pay his planned " financial crisis responsibility fee , " which is designed to generate $ 90 billion over 10 years .

Curling up for an afternoon nap can improve the brain 's ability to learn by clearing out cluttered memory space , psychologists say .
People who nodded off for an hour after lunch performed better in learning tests than those who stayed awake all afternoon , the scientists found .
A study of students revealed that their brains were refreshed by napping only if they entered what is called stage 2 non-REM sleep , which takes place between deep sleep and the dream state , known as REM or rapid eye movement sleep .
The findings support a habit made famous by Sir Winston Churchill , who considered it part of his daily routine to climb into bed at some point between lunch and dinner .
The research follows a recent study by the same group that showed that staying up all night reduced students ' ability to cram new facts by nearly 40 % , a consequence , they said , of brain regions effectively shutting down through sleep deprivation .
" Sleep not only rights the wrong of prolonged wakefulness but , at a neurocognitive level , it moves you beyond where you were before you took at nap , " said Matthew Walker at the University of California , Berkeley .
The findings may explain why our ability to learn falls as we age , since people tend to sleep less as they get older .
Walker 's team recruited 39 students for the study and divided them into two groups .
At midday , all of the volunteers took part in a learning test designed to exercise a region of the brain called the hippocampus , which is involved in storing memories .
Two hours later , one of the groups settled down for a siesta while the other group stayed awake .
Later that afternoon , at 6 pm , both groups took part in a second round of learning tests .
Those who napped for an hour not only performed better than the group that stayed awake , they scored better than they did in the first round of tests .
The findings suggest that sleep clears the brain 's short term memory and makes room for new facts to be remembered , Walker told the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in San Diego .
Previous studies have established that fact - based memories are stored temporarily in the hippocampus before they are moved to the prefrontal cortex region of the brain .
" It 's as though the email inbox in your hippocampus is full and , until you sleep and clear out those fact emails , you 're not going to receive any more mail .
It 's just going to bounce until you sleep and move it into another folder , " Walker said .
In the latest study , Walker 's team used electrodes to take EEGs , or electroencephalograms , of the students and identified the sleep phase that was critical for their memories to be refreshed .
Humans spend half of their sleeping hours in stage 2 non-REM sleep .
" I can't imagine Mother Nature would have us spend 50 per cent of the night going from one sleep stage to another for no reason , " Walker said .
Why Is This Coconut Octopus Walking So Strangely ?
February 22 , 2018 - “ The creeping murderer , the octopus … pretending now to be a bit of weed , now a rock … runs lightly on the tips of its arms . ” – John Steinbeck , Cannery Row
Actually , this coconut octopus is on the hunt for food , and may be carrying prey that it ’s already caught .
Walking and mimicry are common for octopus species in sandy habitats .
This urchin is not on the menu – it ’s too spiny to eat .
But , the octopus grabs something next to the urchin – likely a bivalve or crab .
The fanning and pulsing of the octopus ’s body indicates that it ’s taken prey into its arms .
It ‘ skulks ’ away to find a safe place to devour its catch , away from predators .
The octopus ’s donut - shaped brain wraps around its esophagus so it has to eat tiny bites of food , or else its expanding esophagus would damage its brain .

Congressman Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) has an idea he thinks will create 1 million new jobs , fast .
His piecemeal solution to the employment crisis : get the old people to retire and bring in some “ new blood . ”
By providing government incentives for workers to retire at the age of 60 instead of 65 , Kucinich believes all the newly open positions would create a surge of fresh employment .

“ Nearly 70 percent of workers elect to take early retirement under current rules , which allow eligible individuals to begin receiving a reduced Social Security benefit starting at age 62 , ” a media advisory from the Congressman ’s office claimed .
“ The Kucinich Plan would reduce the eligibility age to 60 for the first million workers who want to take advantage of an earlier retirement date . ”
With some 4.2 million U.S. workers between ages 60 - 65 , Kucinich believes at least 1 million will take advantage of early retirement , even though the Social Security payout would be at a reduced rate .
Additionally , instead of Medicare , Kucinich proposes early retirees received health coverage through the COBRA program .
Kucinich estimates the cost of his plan to be around $ 15 billion — funds that will not come from Social Security , but out of amounts already set aside to cope with the financial crisis .
“ This is something we could do now , ” he said .
“ This gives companies a chance to get new blood in , in a way that does not make them get more money to do it . ”
“ My plan is a cost - effective way to create job opportunities for younger workers while making it possible for older workers to retire at 60 with the equivalent of their social security early retirement benefit . ”

In news sure to delight topheavy Z - list celebrities everywhere , US boffins funded by shadowy federal agencies say they have developed a new kind of silicone implant which can generate electrical power from the movements of the bodily area in which it is placed .
The new technology , developed at Princeton University in the States , involves adding piezo - electric lead zirconate titanate ( PZT ) to silicone , creating a material which generates electricity when squeezed , mashed or wobbled .
" Because the silicone is biocompatible , it is already used for cosmetic implants , " note the Princeton engineers .
" Natural body movements [ could ] power pacemakers , mobile phones and other electronic devices . "
" The new electricity - harvesting devices could be implanted in the body to power devices perpetually , and the body would n't reject them , " adds Michael McAlpine , Princeton engineering prof .
The boffins describe their revolutionary new implantable power - generation tech as " piezo - rubber chips " .
" The beauty of this is that it 's scalable , " said Yi Qi , a postdoctoral researcher who works with McAlpine .
" As we get better at making these chips , we 'll be able to make [ the power units ] larger and larger . "
Exact performance figures on the kit are n't given , but it seems that some users at least might be able to generate substantial amounts of power .
Famously be-funbagged cross-platform media node Katie Price / Jordan , for instance , was memorably described as nothing more than " two bags of silicone " recently - she would presumably be able to jumpstart a truck merely by loosening her lingerie and doing a few brisk knee bends .
Intriguingly in this context , the Princeton team specifies that the kit can also work in reverse , rather as a normal electrical generator can also function as a motor .
If power is supplied to the silicone piezo - modules from an external source , they can be made to flex , bulge or oscillate .
Perhaps most interestingly of all , McAlpine and his colleagues ' research was funded by the United States Intelligence Community - " a cooperative of federal intelligence and national security agencies " .
Just why the US spooks would be looking into perpetual in - body power supplies is unlikely to be revealed .
However , the possibilities range from cybernetically enhanced super - agents to the rumoured existence of implantable tracker bug technology of some kind , perhaps placed in or on prisoners during the Wars on Stuff . ®
Americans have been losing the protection of law for years .
In the 21st century , the loss of legal protections accelerated with the Bush administration 's " war on terror , " which continues under the Obama administration and is essentially a war on the Constitution and U.S. civil liberties .
The Bush regime was determined to vitiate habeas corpus in order to hold people indefinitely without bringing charges .
The regime had acquired hundreds of prisoners by paying a bounty for " terrorists . "
Afghan warlords and thugs responded to the financial incentive by grabbing unprotected people and selling them to the Americans .
The Bush regime needed to hold the prisoners without charges because it had no evidence against the people and did not want to admit that the U.S. government had stupidly paid warlords and thugs to kidnap innocent people .
In addition , the Bush regime needed " terrorists " prisoners in order to prove that there was a terrorist threat .
As there was no evidence against the " detainees " ( most have been released without charges after years of detention and abuse ) , the U.S. government needed a way around U.S. and international laws against torture in order that the government could produce evidence via self - incrimination .
The Bush regime found inhumane and totalitarian - minded lawyers and put them to work at the U.S. Department of Justice ( sic ) to invent arguments that the Bush regime did not need to obey the law .
The Bush regime created a new classification for its detainees that it used to justify denying legal protection and due process to the detainees .
As the detainees were not U.S. citizens and were demonized by the regime as " the 760 most dangerous men on earth , " there was little public outcry over the regime 's unconstitutional and inhumane actions .
As our Founding Fathers and a long list of scholars warned , once civil liberties are breached , they are breached for all .
Soon U.S. citizens were being held indefinitely in violation of their habeas corpus rights .
Dr. Aafia Siddiqui an American citizen of Pakistani origin might have been the first .
Dr. Siddiqui , a scientist educated at MIT and Brandeis University , was seized in Pakistan for no known reason , sent to Afghanistan , and was held secretly for five years in the U.S. military 's notorious Bagram prison in Afghanistan .
Her three young children were with her at the time she was abducted , one an eight - month old baby .
She has no idea what has become of her two youngest children .
Her oldest child , 7 years old , was also incarcerated in Bagram and subjected to similar abuse and horrors .
Siddiqui has never been charged with any terrorism - related offense .
A British journalist , hearing her piercing screams as she was being tortured , disclosed her presence .
http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article24605.htm
An embarrassed U.S. government responded to the disclosure by sending Siddiqui to the U.S. for trial on the trumped - up charge that while a captive , she grabbed a U.S. soldier 's rifle and fired two shots attempting to shoot him .
The charge apparently originated as a U.S. soldier 's excuse for shooting Dr. Siddiqui twice in the stomach resulting in her near death .
On February 4 , Dr. Siddiqui was convicted by a New York jury for attempted murder .
The only evidence presented against her was the charge itself and an unsubstantiated claim that she had once taken a pistol - firing course at an American firing range .
No evidence was presented of her fingerprints on the rifle that this frail and broken 100 - pound woman had allegedly seized from an American soldier .
No evidence was presented that a weapon was fired , no bullets , no shell casings , no bullet holes .
Just an accusation .
Wikipedia has this to say about the trial : " The trial took an unusual turn when an FBI official asserted that the fingerprints taken from the rifle , which was purportedly used by Aafia to shoot at the U.S. interrogators , did not match hers . "
An ignorant and bigoted American jury convicted her for being a Muslim .
This is the kind of " justice " that always results when the state hypes fear and demonizes a group .
The people who should have been on trial are the people who abducted her , disappeared her young children , shipped her across international borders , violated her civil liberties , tortured her apparently for the fun of it , raped her , and attempted to murder her with two gunshots to her stomach .
Instead , the victim was put on trial and convicted .
This is the unmistakable hallmark of a police state .
And this victim is an American citizen .
Anyone can be next .
Indeed , on February 3 Dennis Blair , director of National Intelligence told the House Intelligence Committee that it was now " defined policy " that the U.S. government can murder its own citizens on the sole basis of someone in the government 's judgment that an American is a threat .
No arrest , no trial , no conviction , just execution on suspicion of being a threat .
This shows how far the police state has advanced .
A presidential appointee in the Obama administration tells an important committee of Congress that the executive branch has decided that it can murder American citizens abroad if it thinks they are a threat .
I can hear readers saying the government might as well kill Americans abroad as it kills them at home -- Waco , Ruby Ridge , the Black Panthers .
Yes , the U.S. government has murdered its citizens , but Dennis Blair 's " defined policy " is a bold new development .
The government , of course , denies that it intended to kill the Branch Davidians , Randy Weaver 's wife and child , or the Black Panthers .
The government says that Waco was a terrible tragedy , an unintended result brought on by the Branch Davidians themselves .
The government says that Ruby Ridge was Randy Weaver 's fault for not appearing in court on a day that had been miscommunicated to him , The Black Panthers , the government says , were dangerous criminals who insisted on a shoot - out .
In no previous death of a U.S. citizen by the hands of the U.S. government has the government claimed the right to kill Americans without arrest , trial , and conviction of a capital crime .
In contrast , Dennis Blair has told the U.S. Congress that the executive branch has assumed the right to murder Americans who it deems a " threat . "
What defines " threat " ?
Who will make the decision ?
What it means is that the government will murder whomever it chooses .
There is no more complete or compelling evidence of a police state than the government announcing that it will murder its own citizens if it views them as a " threat . "
Ironic , is n't it , that " the war on terror " to make us safe ends in a police state with the government declaring the right to murder American citizens who it regards as a threat .
Dr. Roberts was Assistant Secretary of the Treasury in the Reagan administration and associate editor of the Wall Street Journal .
He is a nationally syndicated columnist for Creators Syndicate in Los Angeles .
It has been a lazy trope in both ideological aisles of the new media to attack out - of - touch beltway arrogance and the institutional myopia of the traditional media for these and other sins , especially as story after story emerges about the very real pain being felt by average Americans during this Great Recession .
But at no point before has it become as essential to Democratic leadership both in D.C. and in state capitals across America to extricate themselves from this pettiness and abandon these parlor games as it is today .
Unfortunately , the success which Barack Obama achieved in 2008 on a message of comity , bipartisanship and good feeling will make doing so doubly difficult .
Human psychology in a period of economic difficulty is not complex .
As individuals and communities , people will often come together in the immediate aftermath of a disaster to help and support one another .
But when the dust has settled and the immediate crisis is over , the fingers inevitably start pointing .
Scapegoats are inevitably found as a part of the coping process -- even in cases of unavoidable natural disasters , to say nothing of man-made crises like military defeats or economic collapses .
It 's a story as old as Pericles , and as potentially disastrous as the Weimar Republic .
In the economic crisis of 2008 , the scapegoat was clear and unmistakable .
The downturn had a single face not only for Democrats , but also for many Republicans : George Bush .
In that context , Obama did not need to name a scapegoat .
The scapegoat was sitting right there in the Oval Office .
Obama simply needed to promise a new beginning : hope for a renewed America ; change from the old way of doing things ; a commitment to work with politicians on both sides of the aisle to fix America 's problems .
And it worked .
It worked not because Obama caught the golden ring of bipartisanship in the parlor game , but because he best reflected a departure in style , appearance and substance from George Bush , America 's accepted national scapegoat .
Fast forward to 2010 , and Bush is no longer an effective scapegoat .
An argument can easily be made that he should be , and that President Obama cannot be expected to fix a crisis of this magnitude , created through decades of neglect , in just one year .
It could be said that Democratic leadership should have continued to use Bush as a whipping post in the same way that Republicans used Jimmy Carter for decades .
But from a political point of view , the era of the easy , automatic scapegoat is over .
Like a bad dream , the American public has done its best to wash the Bush Administration out of its collective memory , and the Democratic Party now owns this crisis one way or another .
But as the economic hits keep coming , Americans will find a new , alternative scapegoat .
And that , more than anything else , is what makes the continued beltway obsession with with its silly parlor games so dangerous today .
The American people do n't care about bipartisanship , but rather solutions .
It seems commonsense to most people in their everyday experiences that solving problems often comes about through negotiating disagreements , so bipartisanship tends to poll well in theory .
But most Americans do n't understand the way Washington works , or the degree to which the GOP refuses to cooperate in the process of actual governance .
In the absence of actual solutions to problems , Americans will settle for punishing a scapegoat .
And as we know all too well from history , the scapegoat that gets punished all too often has little bearing on the reality of cause and effect , or the actual perpetrators of the crisis .
In short , without quick solutions to complex problems and without a ready - made scapegoat like George Bush appropriately was in 2008 , the American people will settle for punishing the first available scapegoat they 're told to punish in 2010 .
It 's unavoidable .
Right now , in the absence of a Democratic message that clearly articulates the economic evils perpetrated by the corporate pluocratic class , that scapegoat is likely to be the " Other " : persons of color on welfare , urban intellectuals and union workers with government paychecks , and anyone else falsely presumed to be reaping economic benefits at the expense of the ordinary American .
Down that road lies massive electoral defeat in 2010 -- and ominously worse eventualities should the decade enter a long , jobless " recovery " .
If only one Party is giving the public a scapegoat to blame , that Party is going to win no matter how nonsensical the choice of scapegoat appears to be .
Fortunately , the Democratic Party has no shortage of very real villains to blame , but it will require enduring the tut -tuts of " class warfare " from all the Georgetown cocktail salons .
Still , all the hearty approval from the Milbanks and Broders in the world wo n't help Democrats when it comes time to pay the piper in 2010 and beyond .
Telomeres at the end of chromosomes shorten with age Gene variants that might show how fast people 's bodies are actually ageing have been pinpointed by scientists .
Researchers from the University of Leicester and Kings College London say the finding could help spot people at higher risk of age - related illnesses .
People carrying the variant had differences in the " biological clock " within all their cells .
The British Heart Foundation said the findings could offer a clue to ways of preventing heart disease .
While doctors know that as people age they are more at risk from diseases such as Alzheimer 's , Parkinson 's and heart disease , some people fall prey to these at an earlier age than expected .
Telomeres
One theory suggests that biological timers called " telomeres " , part of the chromosomes in every cell that carry genetic code , may be a factor in this .
What our study suggests is that some people are genetically programmed to age at a faster rate
Professor Tim Spector , King 's College London
From birth , every time a cell divides , the telomeres get shorter and there is some evidence that people with shorter telomeres , either because they diminish more quickly or because they were born with shorter versions , may be at higher risk from age - related illness .
The researchers say in the journal , Nature Genetics , that they looked at more than 500,000 genetic variations across the entire human genome to see which variants cropped up more frequently in people known to have shorter telomeres .
They eventually located a number of variants located near a gene called TERC which , in people carrying them , seemed to be equivalent to an extra three or four years of " biological ageing " .
Bad lifestyles Professor Tim Spector , from King 's College London , said : " What our study suggests is that some people are genetically programmed to age at a faster rate .
" Alternatively , genetically susceptible people may age even faster when exposed to proven ' bad ' environments for telomeres such as smoking , obesity or lack of exercise - and end up several years biologically older or succumbing to more age - related diseases . "
Professor Jeremy Pearson , associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation , which part - funded the study , said it was not yet clear whether telomeres did contribute to an increased risk of disease .
He said : " Understanding how our cells age is an important step in our quest for better ways to prevent and treat heart disease .
" Perhaps in the future one of the ways we try to reduce the risk of , or treat , heart disease would be to use an ' anti- ageing ' approach for our arteries . "

The UN says corruption is holding back Afghanistan 's development Afghans paid $ 2.5 bn ( £ 1.5 bn ) in bribes over the past 12 months , or the equivalent of almost one quarter of legitimate GDP , a UN report suggests .
Surveying 7,600 people , it found nearly 60 % more concerned about corruption than insecurity or unemployment .
More than half the population had to pay at least one bribe to a public official last year , the report adds .
The findings contrast sharply with a recent BBC survey in which the economy appeared to top Afghan concerns .
It 's time ... to stop money and trust disappearing down a big black hole
Antonio Maria Costa
head of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime
BBC poll reveals optimism How Afghan corruption works Afghan reaction to survey
The survey commissioned by the BBC and other broadcasters in December suggested that fewer Afghans ( 14 % ) saw corruption as the biggest problem than the economy ( 34 % ) and security situation ( 32 % ) .
According to the UN survey , bribes averaged $ 160 ( £ 98 ) in contrast to an average Afghan annual income of $ 425 .
Bribes were most often paid to police , judges and politicians but members of international organisations and NGOs were also seen as corrupt , the survey said .
Antonio Maria Costa , head of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime ( UNODC ) , said corruption was contributing to drug - trafficking and terrorism in Afghanistan .
The UNODC said its report , Corruption in Afghanistan , was based on interviews with 7,600 people in 12 provincial capitals and more than 1,600 villages around Afghanistan .
The BBC survey , which was also nationwide , was based on a smaller number of people ( 1,534 ) .
Explicit demands
According to the UN survey , 59 % of Afghans said their daily experience of public dishonesty was a bigger concern than insecurity ( 54 % ) or unemployment ( 52 % ) .
In 56 % of cases , the request for illicit payment was an explicit demand by the bribe - taker , it said .
In three out of four cases , bribes were paid in cash .
Around one in four Afghans surveyed had to pay at least one bribe to police and local officials during the survey period while between 10 and 20 % had to pay bribes either to judges , prosecutors or members of the government .
" The Afghans say that it is impossible to obtain a public service without paying a bribe , " said Mr Costa .
" Bribery is a crippling tax on people who are already among the world 's poorest , " he added .
' Perverse and growing '
Another finding of the survey is that at least one in three Afghans believed that corruption was the norm .
Only 9 % of the urban population ever reported an act of corruption to the authorities , the survey said .
There was also a perception among 54 % of Afghans that international organisations and NGOs were corrupt and " in the country just to get rich " , the survey added .
" This perception risks undermining aid effectiveness and discrediting those trying to help a country desperately in need of assistance , " the UNODC said .
Mr Costa noted the emergence of a " new caste of rich and powerful individuals who operate outside the traditional power / tribal structures and bid the cost of favours and loyalty to levels not compatible with the under - developed nature of the country " .
" Criminal graft has become similarly monumental , perverse and growing and is having political , economic and even security consequences , " he said .
He expressed his concern that the lack of confidence in the Afghan authorities apparent in the survey was making the Taliban 's advocacy of " more violent forms of retribution ... treacherously appealing " .
" It 's time to drain the swamp of corruption in Afghanistan , to stop money and trust disappearing down a big black hole , " the UNODC chief concludes .
" Corruption is the biggest impediment to improving security , development and governance in Afghanistan . "

In all the years it 's been available , uTorrent has n't changed as much as it will with the upcoming release .
Codenamed Falcon , the client will have an easier , more secure and more complete web UI as well as support for streaming and remote downloading .
Developed by BitTorrent Inc. , uTorrent Falcon will bring plenty of change to the BitTorrent client currently in use by more than 50 million people a month .
Most of the upcoming features of the Falcon project are still being developed , but those who download the latest Alpha release have the option to take a peak at what to expect from the future .
Below we sum up some of the key features .
Access Anywhere
Allowing users to access their BitTorrent downloads from anywhere through a simple web - interface is one of the main goals of the Falcon project .
Without having to configure uTorrent and home networks so that they can be accessed remotely , users can simply head over to the Falcon page and connect to their client instantly .
The easy to use web interface is as secure as it gets , a major improvement over the Web UI currently available .
When logged in , it gives users all the controls they are familiar with in their regular PC client .
Torrents can be added , paused and removed using an interface with a look and feel identical to that of the uTorrent application .
u Torrent ’s Falcon web - interface
Those who want to try the remote access features require an invite for now .
Invites are sent out regularly and those who leave their email address behind should receive one within a few days .
Download Anywhere
Aside from the added security and easy setup , accessing your torrents via the Falcon web - interface offers another advantage – remote downloading .
Once a file has finished downloading you can transfer a copy of the file to a remote computer via the web - interface .
This feature is not enabled in the current version of the Falcon web - interface .
However , it has been publicly announced in the uTorrent forums so we expect that it will return soon .
Streaming
Another new feature of the Falcon project is the added option to stream video files while downloading .
Instead of having to wait until a file has finished downloading , users can already start watching video provided that the download speed is sufficient .
“ Our hope is to transform getting media using uTorrent from a ‘ load - wait - watch - tomorrow ’ to more of a ‘ point - click - watch ’ experience , ” Simon Morris , BitTorrent ’s VP of Product Management told TorrentFreak , commenting on the new feature .
Easy Sharing
Also new in the Falcon release is the “ Send Torrent ” feature .
This feature is particularly useful when you want to share torrents with people who do not have a BitTorrent client installed yet .
Right clicking a torrent in uTorrent shows a “ Send Torrent ” option which then brings up a URL similar to this one .
This is a direct link to a download of the uTorrent client with the torrent file included .
Share uTorrent plus a torrent
Finding Torrents
The Falcon release is expected to make it easier for users to find torrents .
The uTorrent team did n’t want to comment on how this will be integrated , but Simon Morris has stated that they are working on “ better ability for torrent sites to promote content or search within the client . ”
When we asked if this means that uTorrent will come with a built in torrent search engine , Morris said that they are more interested in “ APIs rather than bloating the uTorrent user experience . ”
We ’ll see what this means in the months to come .
Further Improvements
The features listed above are just a few of many that will be added to the new uTorrent clients .
The latest Alpha release also had a ‘ minify interface ’ option , for example , and the development team is also working on speed improvements , UI improvements and optional file security features .
Exciting times ahead for uTorrent users .

We 've seen it in science - fiction books and movies before — the urban dystopia where living space has shrunk to almost nothing to house a teeming humanity .
Now it seems to be here ... or at least scheduled for 2011 .

The loft — already a compact , efficient living arrangement that eschews most luxury — is being replaced in some places , including one city in windy , wide - open Canada , by the even more austere micro-loft .
Soon you can live like Larry Niven 's Louis Grindley Wu ( in Ringworld Engineers ) , who could see both doors to his apartment from his chair .
That 's the news in a new post at Core77 , which says that Vancouver — a progressive , green city that also has some of the highest rents in the world even before Olympic madness — could lead the way .

And of course , as Thomas Malthus warned us two centuries ago , it could take off from there : " In a problem spreading across the globe , " the post says , " the population is outstripping the available space . "
It 's another step in a trend — mass produced faux - Tuscan mini-mansions be damned — toward more compact living :
The micro -lofts should be ready to roll next year .
Explains Core77 :
Although the comedian Ricky Gervais is now fabulously wealthy , in one of his sets he recalls how , as a poor unknown , he and his girlfriend shared a London flat so small that he could open the refrigerator whilst still in bed .
In Tokyo I saw similarly tiny apartments , where you would open the front door and hit the bed ; and New York 's East Village spawns , among other trends , some of the tiniest rabbit - hutch apartments you 'll ever see .

Besides Ringworld Engineers , what other scifi books or films does this remind us of ?
MOST parents who are worried that their children spend a lot of time on social networking sites such as Facebook and Myspace can relax .
A new study has found that it is well - adjusted young people who are more likely to use social networking .
American researchers assessed the popularity and social adjustment of 92 13 and 14 - year - olds , based on a series of reports from the individuals , their friends and parents .
Eight years later the team , led by Assistant Professor Amori Mikami of the University of Virginia , reviewed the same group of young people , then aged 20 to 22 years old , most of whom had social networking sites .
They counted the number of cyber friends they had and determined the quality of those friendships .
After posts suggesting that local constituents contact Rep. Barney Frank ( D - MA ) about his comments on the prospects of the Democrats ’ healthcare bill , the powerful Massachusetts congressman has purportedly told callers his party does n’t have the votes in the House to ensure passage .
“ I live in Barney Frank ’s district , and I called his office this morning , ” one constituent reportedly emailed Talking Points Memo .
“ To my surprise , he took my call and I asked him why on earth could n’t the House simply pass the Senate version of the health care bill .
He told me straight up that the votes were n’t there to pass the Senate bill .
He said that labor is totally against it , the abortion caucus is against it , and more than a few progressives were against it . ”

“ I asked him about Democrats ’ prospects in the 2010 election if they do n’t get something done on health care , ” the caller reportedly added .
“ He told me it would be worse electorally for Democrats if they passed the bill versus dropping it and facing voters having done nothing .
I told him I disagreed with him on that point , but I suppose he knows more about this stuff than I do .
I hope . ”
A second caller , from Norton , MA , allegedly believed from Frank ’s comments that the healthcare bill is now effectively doomed .
Frank is also reported to have suggested that the Democrats ’ best hope is again Sen. Olympia Snowe ( R - ME ) — emphasis ours .
I just called his office in DC and expressed my displeasure with his statement released last night especially the line “ But our respect for democratic procedures must rule out any effort to pass a health care bill as if the Massachusetts election had not happened . ”
I told him I did n’t think we lost this election because of it was a Health Care Reform referendum but because we had a very weak Senate candidate .
He agreed she did a lousy job campaigning .
I told him we should just pass the Senate HCR and be done .
He stated that all that would do was rile up the electorate and guarantee our further losses in November .
I told him that caving in to Republican foot - dragging would kill the bill and we would not have HCR for another 15 years .
He thought our best route was to try to get Snowe to come aboard with a revised Senate bill .
I told him that was ridiculous , that the Republicans were emboldened by this win and I was incredulous that he thought there was any chance of getting even one Republican vote to make this bipartisan .
Barney Frank insisted to me that there was not the vote in the House now to pass the Senate HCR .
I asked him personally if he would vote to pass the Senate HCR as it stands and get it on Obama ’s desk .
He said he would not vote yes on the Senate bill .
He cited the abortion and plan tax portions of the bill for his opposition .
He thought the Democrats were headed for heavy losses if they did n’t drop the current HCR and try to pass some revised version .
I told him if they did n’t pass the Senate HCR now the November defeat would be guaranteed and much worse because you would lose the progressives and nothing Barney Frank would do or say could convince the right to not vote against us .
He was firm in his belief and I found his argument very unconvincing .
I got the impression that HCR is now doomed and his alternative to fix it and pass it did not seem feasible .
I told him the public is sick and tired hearing about health care and that we should pass the Senate HCR , have Obama sign it tomorrow , and then spend from now to the election passing a jobs bill and doing financial reform .
I told him the public will only remember that in November and will have moved on from HCR .
I said the electorate is always distracted by the next shiny object they see and would forget HCR and remember last good bill you passed , but he replied he thought the public had more intelligence than I thought they had .
We ended the call in total disagreement on his assessment , his plan on how to proceed on HCR , and is refusal to vote personally for the Senate HCR .
Frank ’s alleged contention to callers gibes with his statement released just after Brown ’s victory Tuesday night .
“ I feel strongly that the Democratic majority in Congress must respect the process and make no effort to bypass the electoral results . ”

He also suggested a Republican might need to come on board , as he reportedly told the caller .
“ But since Scott Brown has won and the Republicans now have 41 votes in the Senate , that approach is no longer appropriate , ” he said .
“ I am hopeful that some Republican senators will be willing to discuss a revised version of healthcare reform . ”
Frank is apparently not the only Congressman who seems to believe the Senate health bill cannot pass the House .
Rep. Raul Grijalva ( D - AZ ) told Salon on Wednesday that “ it ’s going to be difficult to round up a majority ” in the House for the upper chamber ’s template .

Grijalva strongly vouched for the budget reconciliation process , which would allow health reform — albeit a different version than now exists — to pass through the Senate with a simple 51 - vote majority .
Frank ’s contention that House Democrats do n’t have the votes to pass the Senate ’s healthcare bill is n’t his first foray into controversial healthcare comments .

At a lively two - hour health care town hall meeting in August , Frank was faced with an angry woman opposed to health care reform who compared health care proposals favored by Frank and President Obama to policies of Nazi Germany .
“ When you ask me that question , I ’m going to revert to my ethnic heritage and ask you a question :
On what planet do you spend most of your time ? ”
Frank asked .
“ You stand there with a picture of the president defaced to look like Hitler and compare the effort to increase health care to the Nazis , ” he said , adding such behavior demonstrated the strength of First Amendment guarantees of what he called “ contemptible ” free speech .

“ Trying to have a conversation with you would be like trying to argue with a dining room table , ” Frank said to the woman .
“ I have no interest in doing it . ”

Last week , Joseph Stack set his house on fire , drove to the airport , jumped in his plane and flew it into an IRS building in Austin , Texas .
This deliberate , cowardly act of domestic terrorism resulted in injuring thirteen IRS workers and left one man dead -- a veteran of the Vietnam War :
When Ken Hunter first heard about a plane crashing into his father 's office building in Austin , he said he hoped his dad , Vernon Hunter , was n't there .
After several attempts to reach his father , a 67 - year - old IRS worker , he discovered his dad was missing .
In the hours that followed , Ken said he heard lots of talk about the pilot 's motivations and felt compelled to speak out on his father 's behalf .
" There was just too much going on about what the guy did and what he believed in , and enough 's enough , " he said .
" They do n't need to talk about him .
Talk about my dad .
You know , some people are trying to make this guy out to be a hero , a patriot .
My dad served two terms in Vietnam .
This guy never served at all .
My dad was n't responsible for his tax problems . "
Read on ...
Stack 's political views can be debated , but he was n't the real victim here .
He committed an act of terrorism that took the life of an American veteran .
As the son of a vet , I felt compelled to write this post and make sure that Vernon Hunter was acknowledged instead of being overshadowed by the sick , selfish coward who ended his life .
More than a year after reckless Wall Street gambling collapsed the economy , no employee of a major American bank or financial institution is behind bars .
This fact is all the more astounding when it comes to AIG .
AIG was at the heart of the financial meltdown .
Their " innovative " use of risky credit default swaps ( a type of insurance policy on bonds ) helped transform boring bond trading into a highly leveraged , high - velocity global business .
AIGs built up a $ 500 billion swaps portfolio , but did n't have the cash when the bond market started to tank .
The result ?
A $ 180 billion taxpayer bailout .
While some of that money may be paid back , we are likely to lose a chunk of it for good .
The American taxpayer owns 80 % of AIG right now , and AIG does n't like it at all .
It wants to pay back that money lickity split .
Wells Fargo and Citibank paid back TARP bailout funds last week .
Of course , we did n't find out until late in the game that Citi was only able to do so because it received billions of dollars in tax breaks from the IRS .
Before we let AIG off the taxpayer 's dime , a group of prosecutors wants us to demand some basic accountability : " Who knew what and when ?
Who benefited , and by exactly how much ?
Would AIGs counterparties ( which included Goldman Sachs and numerous foreign banks ) have failed without this taxpayer support ? "
Elliot Spitzer , Frank Partnoy and William Black , three experienced investigators and prosecutors of financial fraud , called upon the Obama administration not to release oversight of AIG until they force the firm to cull the hard drives and recover all the e-mails that would answer these questions and more .
It is absolutely shocking that they have not done so already .
While the FBI claims that thousands of finance - related investigations are underway , the administration has not put the effort and resources into these prosecutions that prior administrations have .
Compare this to what happened after the Savings and Loan heist almost 20 years ago .
No less than 1,852 S&L officials were prosecuted and 1,072 were jailed .
Over 500 CEOs and top officers were indicted .
The FBI needs to get on the ball here , and Congress needs to pass Ohio Rep. Marcy Kaptur 's bill to give them 1,000 new agents .
But right now , right at this moment while " we the people " stiill own AIG , a simple thing can be done to get the ball rolling .
If the government does n't have the resources or agents to read a million emails , let the taxpayers do it !
The government should insist that the company immediately make these reams of materials public so that an " open source , " citizen - based investigation can get underway .
Join the movement to demand accountability from AIG and free the emails !

Some situations are nail - biters .
This one 's a nipple - biter .
An off - duty cop was allegedly bitten in the chest outside a Gold Coast bar Sunday night , police said .
At about 9:30 p.m. , Fernando Cooper , 31 , and an off - duty officer got into a physical confrontation outside Gibson 's Bar and Steakhouse , the Sun - Times reports .
Police who witnessed the event say the officer identified himself , but the other man did n't back down and continued to assault the cop .
Along with several punches that caused cuts to the officer 's eye , the man also " severely " bit the cop 's nipple .
Both the suspect and the cop were treated for cuts and bruising to their faces .
However , a doctor said that the bite on the officer 's chest was so severe , the cop " lost a body part , " according to the report .
Cooper has been charged with attempting to disarm a peace officer and aggravated battery to a peace officer , both felonies .
Talk about getting something off your chest .
Matt Bartosik is a Chicago native and a social media sovereign .
In 2006 , she took control back of her life .
With the help of a $ 100 microloan , she started turning this situation around .
From the Grameen Foundation 's Web site ;
But at the beginning of 2006 , Samsariah took control and began to turn her luck around .
She formed a group and received a $ 100 loan from Yayasan Mirtra Dhuafa ( YAMIDA ) to buy the necessary equipment to re-start her business .
She contacted the man at the nearby market with whom she used to do business to see if he would buy her oysters .
He agreed and she immediately set to work .
Within a day of receiving the loan she once again had an income .
With the money she makes from her oysters , combined with the odd jobs her sons find , they manage to make ends meet .
Samsariah plans to open a stall of her own in the local market , which would allow her to benefit from a markup of her sales price .
The profits from owning her own stall would enable her hire someone else to fish for and shell the oysters .
As her income continues to improve , she hopes to send her adopted sons to school .
She dreams of them finishing high school , a dream that no one in her immediate family has yet realized .
It was through a microloan program that Ibu was able to get life back on track , and start supporting herself again .
In the middle of the tragedy and devastation , she took in two other children who were orphaned .
Now there 's a good deed and it was rewarded by another good deed , a microloan .
That good deed was furnished with the good deed of folks who donate money to help the poor sustain their own lives on their own through microloans .
You see , good deeds are rewarded in ways you may never know how .
The Grammen Foundation is on the forefront of the microfinance initiative to help people like Ibu achieve the most of her life , and to provide for herself and her family .
It 's all good deeds , and no punishment despite that old saying .
You can be a part of this effort by doing a good deed yourself .
Grameen has a fundraising and awareness initiative going on until February 2010 .
It 's called the Ingenuity Fund Challenge .
It 's challenge to people to use their ingenuity and creativity by creating a fund raising page , and getting people to donate , thus allowing more good deeds .
The page that is determined to be the most creative will win a trip for 2 overseas to see Grameen 's work of micofinace and technology solutions for the poor in action .
You will see the direct benefit of the good deed you have done by raising funds for Grameen to continue their mission , one that is collection of good deeds that alleviates the punishing situation of poverty .

Heidi Montag is " Addicted To Plastic Surgery , " but so what ?
Getting 10 cosmetic procedures in one day is a great way to validate your distorted body image and bump the President of the United States off the cover of People .
Advertisement
On November 20 , 2009 Heidi Montag spent 10 hours getting a series of cosmetic surgery procedures , including increasing her breast implants to a DDD , getting " sexy ears " , and arching her brow , which Dr. Frank Ryan , her plastic surgeon , admits " is n't commonly done " to 23 - year - olds .
In the accompanying 7 - page interview , Heidi explains that she wanted to get the operations because her dream is to become a pop star and " it 's a superficial industry . "
She adds ,
I would say the biggest reason is to feel better , to feel perfect .
I was made fun of when I was younger , and so I had insecurities , especially after I moved to L.A.
People said I had a " Jay Leno chin " ; they 'd circle it on blogs and say nasty things .
It bothered me .
And when I watched myself on The Hills , my ears would be sticking out likle Dumbo !
I just wanted to feel more confident and look in the mirror and be like , " Whoa !
That 's me ! "
I was an ugly duckling before .
Advertisement
Though People asking , " has she gone too far ? " on the cover , suggests that there 's some kind of discussion about the dangers of plastic surgery in the magazine , Heidi is basically allowed to spew comments about how surgery was the answer to all of her body image issues .
Even magazines like In Touch and Life & Style will usually consult with a " doctor who does n't treat the star " and tack on several paragraphs cautioning against becoming addicted to altering your appearance .
People only cites two doctors in its piece .
Dr. Ryan justifies operating on Heidi , saying , " She 's doing what every other celebrity does ...
They just do n't talk about it . "
The second doctor gets in six words in a sidebar on the last page .
In the only challenge to Heidi advocating going under the knife , the magazine points out that about 5 to 10 percent of people who get cosmetic surgery have body dysmorphic disorder , a condition in which people look normal , " ' but they see a distorted image , ' says Jamie Feusner M.D. , a psychiatrist who heads UCLA's BDD Research Program . "
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
Heidi is allowed to do whatever she wants to her body , but her comments about the way she saw herself " before " are still extremely sad .
Even if you hate Speidi and their media - whoring , it 's hard not to feel bad for a young woman who , when asked about " changing what God gave her " says she knows , " It 's what 's inside that God cares about , " then goes on to publicly disparage her natural body saying , " I honestly was never the prettiest girl .
I was more like the frumpy sidekick to Lauren [ Conrad ] . "
Advertisement
Yesterday Emmy Rossum Tweeted about Heidi's cover ,
It upsets me to see young women in the spotlight advocating plastic surgery .
ANY surgery is extremely dangerous &should not be taken lightly , .. much less , used as a tool to increase notoriety or popularity ...
By putting this on magazine covers , we are somehow legitimizing the dangerous lengths to which some will go for fame and " beauty "
Advertisement
Judging from the public reaction to the songs Heidi has already released , it seems unlikely that her new appearance will catapult her to pop music stardom .
However as Rossum points out , the surgery has already allowed her to increase her notoriety by appearing on the cover of People , while just recently she had a hard time getting on the cover of one of the far less legitimate celebrity weeklies .
Heidi already wants another procedure to make her breasts even bigger because when she posed for Playboy , " I did n't fill out one of the bras and they had to Photoshop my boobs bigger and it was disheartening . "
She says this is just the beginning of what she wants to have done and , " I plan to keep using surgery to make me as perfect as I can be . "
And why should n't she ?
People 's editors have deemed a reality star 's quest for " perfection " more important than an exclusive interview with the President and First Lady .
Advertisement
Six months ago the media was teeming with commentary on how tragic it was that Michael Jackson died never being at peace with his appearance , and many people lamented that a cosmetic surgeons never told him enough was enough .
Now when another ( albeit far less talented ) person in the spotlight announces that she 's " obsessed " with surgery , magazines reward her with fame and publish photos for the public to scrutinize every inch of her more " perfect " body .
Charming , that .

On the outskirts of Houston , along the industrial ship canal , is a refinery known as Deer Park .
It is the sixth largest refinery in the United States Its 340,000 barrel per day capacity makes it a critical refinery for the greater Houston fuels market .
But what really sets the facility apart is that it is partially owned by Mexico ’s national oil company , Petróleos Mexicanos , ( Pemex ) .
The Deer Park refinery dates back to 1929 , but in 1993 Pemex acquired a 50 % stake from Shell and the two firms have run it as a joint venture since .
The facility -- which receives roughly 240,000 barrels per day from Pemex oil fields in Mexico -- has continuously served the United States market for many years
This has greatly contributed to US energy security of supply .
While a significant amount of the refinery ’s product is for US consumption , a portion of the output returns to Mexico .
Deer Park is a remarkable two - way street of oil connections between the United States and Mexico - and a microcosm of a larger symbiotic relationship .
The refinery offers superb insight into a key international piece of the broader energy security discussion in the United States .
Indeed , for over 15 years Mexico ’s Pemex has operated a critical piece of the United States ’ energy matrix – both in terms of crude oil supply and refined products .
Yet it is likely that few Americans outside of the energy business have ever heard of Deer Park or fully grasp the larger linkage between the United States and Mexico that Dee Park underscores .
Symbiosis
In terms of the US - Mexico energy relationship , Deer Park is in some ways an anomaly .
It does , however , serve as an excellent example of the symbiotic relationship that has developed between the United States and Mexico when it comes to oil , national budgets and energy security .
Scientists define symbiosis as a mutually beneficial relationship that evolves between two species .
Symbiotic relationships often feature complex co-dependencies .
For Mexico and the United States , symbiosis speaks to the direct relationship between Mexican oil production , its related fiscal dependency for the nation , and the United States ’ “ addiction to oil . ”
Mexico is the United States ’ third largest supplier of oil and the United States is by far Mexico ’s largest export market for oil , accounting for over 80 % of its oil exports each year .
Mexico ’s budgetary dependency on oil export revenues and , more specifically , Pemex is another important element of the symbiosis that has evolved .
Dating back to the early days of the oil industry in both countries , the physical neighbors have slowly and steadily marched into an oil co-dependency that has contributed significantly to both countries ’ recent economic development and geopolitical relationship .
March 1938 , the Creation of Pemex and Oil Nationalism in Mexico
No discussion of oil in Mexico is complete without at least a cursory review of the historical and geopolitical developments crucial to understanding the oil business in Mexico today and there is no better temporal starting point than the March 18 , 1938 nationalization of the oil industry in Mexico .
On that momentous day , Mexican President Lazaro Cardenas -- responding to a crippling oil strike that pitted Mexican workers against United States and British / Dutch oil companies – expropriated the assets of international oil firms operating in Mexico .
In choosing to expropriate the foreign concerns , President Cardenas cited Article 27 from Mexico ’s 1917 Constitution and declared that all oil reserves within Mexico belong to the state .
These developments led to the creation of the national oil company Pemex in June of that year and effectively restricted the participation of private and foreign concerns in Mexico ’s oil industry ; limited access remains the case almost 72 years later .
That March 18 is a federal holiday in Mexico and that school books include descriptions of these events speaks volumes .
It is clearly one of the most important historical dates for Mexico in the Twentieth Century .
And Pemex literally embodies that nationalistic fervor .
It is not uncommon to hear tales in Mexico of how families responded to President Cardenas ’ effort by donating family heirlooms , livestock , savings and other contributions to help fund the early days of the company .
Pemex and National Sovereignty Interconnected
It has been said that in Mexico oil is not merely a chemical compound but rather a fundamental element of sovereignty .
Simply put , in Mexico , oil is part of the national DNA .
This fundamental political truism continues to affect development of the nation ’s huge oil resource potential by restricting private -- particularly foreign – investment .
President Cardenas ’s historic decision has imbued citizens of Mexico with a sense of ownership of the nation ’s oil and a fervent desire shared by many to keep Pemex in state hands and to keep private firms out .
The legacy of nationalism in Mexico vis -à - vis oil has perhaps most importantly denied Pemex partnership opportunities with international firms which would have greatly benefitted it by access to technology , know - how , fiscal - and - management efficiencies .
Given the potential of the deep water Gulf , these hindrances are routinely exposed when multinational partnerships from across the world ( including several national oil companies ) drill and discover significant oil reserves just across the maritime border in US waters .
To wit , in September 2009 , BP announced that it had made a “ giant discovery ” at its Tiber prospect in the Gulf of Mexico ; BP operates Tiber in partnership with Brazil ’s national oil company , Petrobras , and ConocoPhillips .
Meanwhile , given the constraints of the Mexican Constitution , Pemex is barred from entering into such partnerships in the deep waters on its side of the Gulf of Mexico .
Mexico ’s deep waters continue to go almost completely un-explored and un-produced .
Mexican Oil Production & Cantarell
Fast forward almost forty years from Lazaro Cardenas ’ nationalization epoch to the sleepy fishing coast along the Bay of Campeche in the 1970 ’s for another critical marker in Mexico ’s oil history : the discovery of the Cantarell field .
Named for the fisherman , Rudesindo Cantarell , who reported that his fishing nets were being ruined by oil to the local Pemex office , Cantarell proved to be the world ’s third largest oil field .
The discovery in the shallow waters changed everything – including the flow of oil north to the United States .
Cantarell ’s production boom and its output oil shipped to the US is perhaps the most visible manifestation of the Mexico - US symbiotic relationship .
As the Cantarell field proved itself prolific , Pemex became one of the world ’s largest oil exporters .
The increase in production beginning in the 1980 ’s also saw a commensurate increase in exports to the United States .
Production at Cantarell boomed until 2003 when its output peaked at 2.1 million barrels per day .
Of that overall production , exports to the United States reached their peak in 2004 at 1.6 million barrels per day .
On the back of Cantarell , Mexico became the United States ’ second largest supplier of oil , but since the peak of Mexico ’s oil exports in 2004 , it has gradually lost surplus production .
Supplies to the United States have decreased .
Mexico fell to third place in terms of the United States ’ top foreign suppliers of oil in 2008 with 1.3 million barrels per day .
And if international projections and outlooks for Mexico ’s oil production are even remotely accurate , Mexico will continue to slip down the list of top foreign oil sources serving the US market .
Recent news on Cantarell points to a slight slow - down in the production decline but the larger picture still remains bleak for the field and for Pemex ’s short to medium term oil production outlook .
Indeed , Cantarell has now slipped to Pemex ’s second largest producing area , second to the Ku-Maloob - Zaap field .
Most disturbing is that with Cantarell ’s precipitous decline in production coupled with a lack of sufficient replacement production at other fields , many projections indicate that Mexico will become a net importer of oil by as soon as 2020 ; the International Energy Outlook 2009 indicates that net imports could reach 300,000 barrels per day in 2030 .
This obviously has serious implications for Pemex , Mexico ’s national treasury , and US energy security .
Cantarell ’s Fallout
Cantarell ’s relevance cannot be overstated in other than less - than - positive ways .
With the bonanza that the field provided , it also served as an important cover for the myriad inefficiencies at the state oil giant .
Because of the nature of the Cantarell field , the Mexican government was for a time spared facing the inefficiencies embedded in Pemex , particularly in its fiscal management and its lack of access to know - how and technologies commonplace in the oil industry elsewhere .
Critics contend that because of Cantarell , Pemex and Mexico skirted challenging issues that other nations faced such as how to attract and manage international investment and collaborate with international oil companies , how to deal with bloated work forces , how to redress severe managerial inefficiencies , and how to face its most difficult issue – corruption .
Alas the Cantarell story has become a rather tragic one .
Pemex and the Mexican Energy Ministry have regularly overlooked the steepness in the decline in Cantrell production and accordingly have exaggerated projections for output that have impacted both the company and Mexico ’s national treasury .
Mexico ’s Fiscal Dependency on Oil
The golden goose , the cash cow , and a variety of other expressions have all been used to describe what oil and Pemex are for Mexico .
Pemex oil is the economic life line for the federal budget of Mexico .
As Mexico ’s oil industry boomed , and particularly with the enormous discovery of Cantarell , dependency on oil revenues for the federal budget developed ; roughly a third of revenue come from oil exports .
Much has been written about the economic impact and “ resource curse ” Cantarell has caused both for Mexico ’s structural development and for Pemex .
What is important to highlight is how resource dependency wrought by Cantarell in turn led to mismanagement at the field , as well as inefficiencies and ultimately a stifling fiscal straightjacket placed on Pemex by the federal government .
Seeking to maximize what was initially a highly pressurized field , Pemex drilled hundreds of wells in Cantarell which led to gusher - like production .
As the field ’s production soared , pressure dropped and Pemex implemented a process known as nitrogen injection to further pressurize the reservoir allowing Pemex to continue to pump large amounts of oil .
But saltwater seeped into the reservoir and Pemex did not have the technology at its disposal to arrest the saltwater intrusion thanks largely to the fiscal constraints placed on it by the federal government .
Cantarell ’s development ultimately suffered from an almost perfect storm of mismanagement due to ineffective technology , insufficient capital budgets and intense pressure to produce as much oil as possible thereby maximizing its rent for the federal government .
Indeed , the brunt of this rent seeking has been borne by Pemex itself .
Through onerous taxes and royalties the federal government ’s milking of Pemex peaked during the oil price spike of 2008 .
According to a Business News Americas ( BNA ) report , due to the onerous fiscal demands placed on Pemex , the company has not been able to successfully manage what have been several years of pre-tax profits .
Despite a year of record oil prices in 2008 , Pemex lost $ 8.1 billion on revenues of $ 98 billion ; the company paid the federal government $ 57 billion in taxes and royalties .
While BNA ’s analysis emphasizes the extremely poor year in 2008 – then - CEO Jesus Reyes Heroles publicly called it the worst year ever for the company – it is important to note that Pemex has not had a profitable year since 2006 .
Record Oil Prices Made Matters Worse
For Pemex and Mexico , the atmospheric rise in prices in 2008 distracted attention from its continued downward production profile .
As production at Pemex plunged in 2008 , international oil prices skyrocketed to the $ 147 / barrel in July .
Pemex ’s export values and revenues were literally going through the roof as production was going through the floor .
Making matters worse , its estimated that Pemex loses upwards to $ 2 billion per year due to corruption , mismanagement and in the theft of oil and fuels from its network ; almost 400 illegal connections were detected in 2009 alone .
The problems became so severe , that in mid-2009 , federal law enforcement authorities raided Pemex headquarters to obtain documents and information for further investigation of the fuel theft .
The ongoing investigation and dramatic losses incurred at the company underscores that the issue of corruption while efforts to modernize and manage its oil production and fuel distribution challenges remain .
Indeed , as Mexico ’s Secretary of Energy conceded , fuel thieves have been more likely using technology more sophisticated than that employed by Pemex itself .
Energy Reform in Mexico 2008
Mexican President Felipe Calderon , who served a stint as Secretary of Energy under his predecessor Vicente Fox , assumed office with a clear understanding of the problems and challenges for Mexico due to its oil - driven fiscal dependency and the burdensome legacy that makes inward foreign investment virtually impossible .
He knew all - too - well the failed effort by President Fox on redressing those issues .
Nevertheless , in April 2008 President Calderon announced a four - point plan to reform Mexico ’s energy sector .
If there was any doubt as to the explosiveness of the topic , huge public demonstrations erupted led by one - time presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador , and months of debate in Congress dispelled the notion that the reform would be approved quickly .
By October 2008 , Mexico ’s Congress approved a fairly broad set of measures aimed at reforming the sector and in particular Pemex .
Central to these measures was the need to create a more modern , agile Pemex ; to give the company enhanced and increased autonomy through a major re-write of many of the statutes governing the company , including revised contractual mechanisms that would allow the company to hire outside firms to assist with the production of oil via service contracts .
Critics labeled the original proposal ‘ energy reform light ’ and bemoaned the final legislation .
Others concede that Calderon has inched down the road aided by incrementalism .
Perhaps not surprisingly , legislative implementation has slipped far behind schedule .
The reform has also brought new oversight over Pemex in the form of a new regulatory body : the Comision Nacional de Hidrocarburos or CNH .
Recent debate over the development of another field , Chicontepec , points to the possibility that these reforms may prove a fairly important step toward the incremental modernization of Pemex and Mexico ’s oil industry .
Chicontepec
Chicontepec is an onshore oil formation that straddles three north eastern states in Mexico .
Lately however it has become synonymous with the ills that afflict Pemex .
Pemex had initially s projected that production at Chicontepec would hit 700,000 barrels per day in 2017 ; critics have long noted discrepancies between these projections and actual production figures .
Others have focused on the geological challenges of Chicontepec as a serious impediment to its production profile .
Experts have noted that Chicontepec ’s fractured formation would require a large number of wells each with small amounts of production and low rates of recovery .
So far , the numbers are indicative of the challenges : Pemex has spent approximately $ 11.1 billion dollars and earmarked over $ 2 billion in 2009 alone for Chicontepec .
Production targeted 70,000 b/d but the field has only returned 30,000 b/d in Q3 2009 .
This has led Pemex to announce that they will be significantly reducing spending on Chicontepec in 2010 .
Robust Debate
Debate is unfolding in Mexico triggered by the Chicontepec developments .
Demands for accountability have been voiced by the newly created CNH .
Its head , Juan Carlos Zepeda , minced no words when he declared that " The project should be stopped and reinstated once there is a real development plan . "
This may be merely be the CNH flexing its muscles but with good reason as the nation ’s newly established oil watchdog .
Changes in Pemex ’s Board of Directors have also figured into the evolving Chicontepec debate .
For Mexico ’s northern neighbor , the US should pay attention to the fact that Mexico is in the throes of a process that may ultimately redefine the energy in Mexico itself .
Where will the United States Turn ?
Mexico ’s role as a critical oil supplier to the United States is ebbing .
This is coupled with falling production in Venezuela and through Canadian reflection on trying to find the right balance in producing oil from its vast oil sands .
While the proximity of these nations to the United States market makes them natural suppliers , oil is a global commodity that is fungible .
Oil from democratic states however is not fungible and this should be something of deep concern to US policy makers .
Brazil may provide one option for future US oil imports .
Over the last 50 years , Brazil has evolved from an oil importer to a self - sufficient nation with the near - term potential to be a significant net oil exporter .
The primary catalyst for Brazil 's stratospheric rise was its strategic decision regarding offshore oil and gas exploration and production in the 1990 ’s that eliminated national oil company Petrobras ' monopoly and partially privatized the company .
But it has been this nation ’s lack of onshore and easy - to - get - to oil reserves that surprisingly have proven most fortunate .
With no choice but to explore for oil and gas offshore , Brazil turned its Atlantic Coast into one of the world 's largest oil and gas research and development laboratories .
Years of efforts paid off as Petrobras has set a string of records for offshore and deep - sea drilling .
And since late 2007 an almost never ending series of discoveries have continued to stun the energy world .
First , the Tupi field was discovered with an estimated 5 billion to 8 billion barrels of oil and the potential to be the largest offshore field ever .
Immediately following were announcements regarding the Jupiter gas field and the Carioca field , which analysts believe could equal the potential of the Tupi field .
Each day seems to bring a new announcement of oil discovery in Brazil ’s so called Pre -Salt deep sea reserves .
But there are some wrinkles emerging that may hamper the potential in Brazil .
At the end of August 2009 , Brazilian President Lula announced a four - bill proposal to overhaul the fiscal and regulatory framework for the Pre -Salt reserves .
“ To allow the government to become the owner of the petroleum , ” President Lula said during the ceremony in Brasilia .
How the new framework will impact access and ultimately oil production is not entirely clear .
Iraq ’s oil potential may provide the US another option .
With an estimated 115 billion barrels of proven reserves this nation is already a top - ten supplier of oil to the US market .
While serious security issues remain , oil auctions conducted in 2009 by the government may prove insightful as the country aims to monetize its tremendous oil potential .
Major oil companies including BP , ExxonMobil , Shell and firms from Russia and China gained contracts under new terms in Iraq and according to the government , the projects and injection of foreign participation will allow the country to produce about 12 million barrels per day by 2017 .
One cannot dismiss the possibility that Iraq may drive a reconfiguration in the current top US foreign supplier list by displacing Mexico or Venezuela in the top three over the next decade .
Symbiotic Redefinition
After many years of intricate connections , there are recent signs that the symbiotic relationship between the United States and Mexico may be evolving .
The relationship based on oil surely will not unravel overnight , but the cracks in the façade bear discussing .
There are two medium term issues which may serve as the most important bellwethers for redefining this relationship .
First , as noted Mexico ’s Cantarell oil field is in severe decline .
If new fields are not discovered to adequately replace lost production , Mexico ’s oil surplus may dry up as early as 2020 with it exports to the United States .
Second , there has been an increasing shift in attitudes and perceptions to strongly embrace an energy transition that moves away from a dependency on fossil fuels to one that further incorporates renewable sources , reduced consumption and an eye on carbon emissions .
Look no further than to the leaders of both countries for a sense of this change .
President Felipe Calderon , elected in 2006 , has sought in a variety of ways to exert a leadership role for Mexico in climate change talks and at home by incorporating renewable sources into his country ’s energy matrix .
Mexico City will also host the next United Nations Climate Change conference .
President Barack Obama , while still early in his presidency , has pushed hard for a new international profile for the United States on energy and climate issues .
Moreover , the $ 787 billion stimulus package in the United States includes a heavy bet on efficiency measures and renewables to revive the economy .
In the short term , for at least the next several years , the relationship will amble along its well worn path of oil co-dependency .
But we are clearly thinking and talking about energy differently now and a new generation is being schooled in a completely different milieu – both in Mexico and the United States .
History aside , the recent developments across both countries – and the world ’s energy industry – may foretell a slow motion break up of the symbiotic relationship based upon oil .
If that is the case , what is unclear is whether a redefined energy outlook in both nations will allow for the relationship to persist albeit along a different energy path .
Fifty years from now we may look back and strain to recall the role of Pemex and why its ebbs and flows so concerned the US as we remark to ourselves , “ Did n’t we always have such massive renewable electricity integration with Mexico to power our electric cars ? ”

Using a simple game theory technique , you can save a sizeable sum when buying a car , writes Paul O’Doherty
FOR THE average motorist , buying a car usually involves searching in the pages of various newspapers and on the web , before marching onto the garage forecourts late on a Thursday or early on a Saturday looking for a bargain .
It might sound familiar but there is an alternative that claims to guarantee better value to the buyer : the Bruce Bueno de Mesquita way .
Not quite in the sense that Bueno de Mesquita , professor of politics at New York University and a Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University , and game theory specialist , uses classic game theory techniques to save money every time he buys a car .
It seems too easy not to invite scepticism , but Bueno de Mesquita maintains it has never let him down .
“ I ’ve used the following strategy to buy eight or nine cars in the past saving myself thousands of dollars .
It ’s also a strategy that my students use all the time , saving them decent amounts they can turn towards their tuition .
Basically , it ’s game theory , a fancy label for a pretty simple idea : that people do what they believe is in their best interest .
That means they pay attention to how others might react if they choose to do one thing or another . ”
As a starting block , Bueno de Mesquita looks at the traditional model .
He maintains that by arriving at a dealership or showroom you are sending out a “ costly signal ” to the salesperson that you want to buy and there ’s a good chance you ’ll buy from him .
While this gives you credibility as a serious purchaser , the salesperson sees it as eagerness .
Once you start a conversation with the salesperson , most people tend to give away far too much information , with the salesperson telling you very little that ’s valuable in return .
By the time you get down to price , the salesperson can easily manipulate the negotiation because he knows exactly how much the car is worth – it ’s his job – and has a fair idea how much you ’re prepared to pay .
So , what should you be doing ?
Well , he recommends the following .
To begin with , do the traditional homework and decide exactly what car you want to buy , the price you want to pay , the safety considerations , its performance , judging , for instance , style over comfort or whether you really want to pay a premium for a particular colour .
Once you ’ve made your choices , go online and find every single dealer or showroom that has what you want for the price you want to pay .
Then ring each one and tell them the following : “ At 5 pm today , I want to buy a car ( Mazda , Ford , Fiat , or whatever ) .
I am calling every dealership within a 50 - mile radius of my home and I am telling each of them what I
am telling you .
That is , I will come in at 5 pm today with a cheque to buy a car from the dealer who offers me the best price . ”
Finishing the call , you also tell the salesperson that you will be telling the next dealer the price you ’ve been quoted from them .
This , of course , gives the salesperson one shot as selling you the car at their best price .
Every time you ring a subsequent dealer you quote them the best price you ’ve gotten so far .
He acknowledges that dealers do n’t like getting these calls , and will probably try to fob you off with a response like “ you ca n’t buy a car like this over the phone ” to which your response should be , “ well , I ’ve done this before .
So , maybe I ca n’t buy a car over the phone from you , but I know I can from others ” .
Bueno de Mesquita adds that you might get a negative response from the odd dealer keen to get you to their forecourt , but in the main most will be grateful for any opportunity to sell .
Still seems too easy to be true ?
Well , bear this in mind .
Away from the triviality of driving the car sales fraternity nuts , the professor ’s day job as a game theorist , when he ’s not teaching , is working as a consultant in procedural forecasting , political economy and international security policy .
The CIA and US government regularly ask his opinion on what the terrorist threat is likely to be from North Korea or what Iran will want to do with atomic energy .
So , when he turns his attention to game theory strategies on how to buy a car , it ’s time to listen up .

On trial Does the game theory method work on Irish dealers ?
LISTENING TO Bruce Bueno de Mesquita admit he has been involved in over 1,000 predictions for the CIA , how he could have saved Arthur Andersen from the Enron debacle and hear him laugh over Mobutu ’s offer of millions if he could only calculate how the Zairian despot could stay in power , it ’s easy to be sceptical of Bueno de Mesquita ’s method of buying a car .
So , we put it to the test : our goal was to see what sort of discount we could get if we tested the market for a Ford Mondeo 1.8 petrol saloon with around 50,000 miles on the clock , preferably in metallic silver for less than € 9,000 .
I pitched my wits against the car dealers of Ireland , trying to buy a car the Bruce Bueno de Mesquita way .
Picking out five cars on the internet that fitted the criteria , I started in Dublin , rang the first dealership on my list and gave the salesperson the following spiel .
“ Hello , my name is Paul O’Doherty , I need to buy a car urgently .
At noon tomorrow I will walk into a dealership with cash to buy a 2005 Ford Mondeo 1.8 petrol saloon with around 50,000 miles on the clock from the dealer who offers me the best price .
You are the first person I ’ve rung and I have four others on my list .
What ’s your best price ? ”
On the website the price quoted was € 7,950 and after shovelling a few papers , the dealer quoted me € 7,750 , down €200 .
Telling the dealer I would be back to him if it was the best price , I rang the next number on my list .
It was a Dublin number .
With a mileage the wrong side of 50,000 , the price tumbled from € 9,950 to € 8,950 before I could finish my sentence , going to € 7,500 a second later .
Next up was a Cork number .
Going with the same patter , this time quoting the last price as my best price so far , the dealer capitulated almost immediately , from a website price of € 8,950 , going south to € 7,500 , and then to € 7,250 when I squeezed for a better price than I ’d been quoted one phone call earlier .
For the fourth phone call I rang a Cavan dealer , who had a hatchback model rather than a saloon .
His price was € 8,500 .
Would he budge ?
“ Possibly .
Would he beat € 7,250 ?
“ No chance . ”
Was that his final offer ?
“ Definitely . ”
Lastly I rang a Kildare dealer with an opening price of € 6,900 .
Delivering what I had to say , the best price returned was € 6,750 with the final warning that this price would n’t be beaten .
And , in fairness , it was n’t .
Summing up , the Bruce Bueno de Mesquita way certainly cut through a lot of the haggling and allowed me to sidestep the obvious “ well , how much are you offering ? ” or “ you ’ll have to call in and see us ” .
It also got me to the nitty - gritty of price much faster , and all from the comfort of my own home , saving in one case € 2,450 off the opening price .
Not bad for less than 10 minutes ’ work on the phone .
However , whether I was the recipient of some kickback from Bueno de Mesquita ’s teach - in or the eloquence of his game theory spin , or an unexpected someone with cash to buy a car in an idling market , I ’ll never know .
Having said that , if you ’re planning to buy a car soon , it certainly beats going out in the cold on a Thursday night or early on Saturday morning with a shopping list that ’s all over the country , into a cauldron that pits you at the mercy of the dealer .
As a gambit therefore , buying a car the Bruce Bueno de Mesquita way is certainly worth a punt .

US presidential debate : who won , was it any good , were there any surprises ?
No statue of a pharaoh has ever been found further south of Egypt than this one .
At the height of his reign , King Taharqa controlled an empire stretching from Sudan to the Levant .
A massive , one ton , statue of Taharqa that was found deep in Sudan .
Taharqa was a pharaoh of the 25th dynasty of Egypt and came to power ca. 690 BC , controlling an empire stretching from Sudan to the Levant .
The pharaohs of this dynasty were from Nubia – a territory located in modern day Sudan and southern Egypt .
The Nubian pharaohs tried to incorporate Egyptian culture into their own .
They built pyramids in Sudan – even though pyramid building in Egypt had n’t been practised in nearly 800 years .
Taharqa ’s rule was a high water mark for the 25th dynasty .
By the end of his reign a conflict with the Assyrians had forced him to retreat south , back into Nubia – where he died in 664 BC .
Egypt became an Assyrian vassal – eventually gaining independence during the 26th dynasty .
Taharqa ’s successors were never able to retake Egypt .
In addition to Taharqa ’s statue , those of two of his successors - Senkamanisken and Aspelta – were found alongside .
These two rulers controlled territory in Sudan , but not Egypt .
Dr. Julie Anderson of the British Museum is the co-director for the Dangeil excavations .
This project is an archaeological mission of the National Corporation for Antiquities and Museums , Sudan .
It is also co-directed by Dr. Salah eldin Mohamed Ahmed .
Dr. Anderson confirmed that no statue of a pharaoh has ever been found further south of Egypt than this one .
“ That ’s one reason it ’s so exciting and very interesting , ” she said .
The discovery was such a surprise that one colleague of Anderson 's did n't believe it at first saying that the statues “ ca n’t possibly be ( at ) Dangeil . ”
Dangeil is near the fifth cataract of the Nile River , about 350 kilometres northeast of the Sudanese capital of Khartoum .
There was a settlement at the time of Taharqa , but little of it has been excavated .
Most of the finds discovered at Dangeil , so far , date to the time of the Kingdom of Meroe ( 3rd century BC – 3rd century AD ) .
While this is the furthest south that a pharaoh ’s statue has been found , it does n’t necessarily mean that Dangeil is the southern border of Taharqa ’s empire .
It ’s possible that he controlled territory further up the Nile .
The statue of Taharqa is truly monumental .
“ It ’s a symbol of royal power , ” said Dr. Anderson , an indicator that Dangeil was an “ important royal city . ”
It ’s made of granite and weighs more than one ton .
It stood about 2.6 meters ( 8.5 feet ) when it had its head .
In ancient times it was smashed into several pieces on purpose .
This was also done to the two other statues .
It ’s not known who did this or why .
It happened “ a long time after Taharqa , ” said Anderson .
One idea is that there was a dynastic struggle .
A group came to power in Nubia that was determined to eliminate reminders of Taharqa ’s reign and that of this successors .
Another possibility is that in 593 BC an Egyptian military force , led by pharaoh Psamtek II , succeeded in reaching Dangeil and decided to damage the statues .
The largest piece of Taharqa 's statue is the torso and base .
This part of the statue is so heavy that the archaeological team had to use 18 men to move it onto a truck .
“ We had trouble moving him a couple hundred meters , ” said Anderson .
The move was “ extremely well planned , ” with the team spending eight to nine days figuring out how to accomplish it without the statue ( or the movers ) getting damaged .
Given the lack of moving equipment the team resorted to “ traditional methods . ”
Anderson and Ahmed say that “ the back of the statue was first protected with sacking after which a heavy plank of wood was attached to the backpillar .
Trenches were dug under the statue to facilitate the attachment of the wood backing , ”
The team than rotated the statue so that it rested on this wood .
A platform of red - brick and silt was created beneath the statue .
“ The statue was raised upwards , one brick ’s thickness at a time ( approximately 80 mm ) , using wooden and iron levers . ”
A team of 18 men then brought it to a truck , dragging it over an ancient wall .
Taharqa ’s ancient statue movers would have had an even rougher job .
The nearest granite quarry is at the third cataract – hundreds of kilometres up the Nile .
The trip was “ certainly many days ” said Anderson , consisting of a river ride and in “ some places dragging . ”

Here ’s a mind - bender for you to ponder over the holidays :
What do diva musician Beyonce , the massively - multiplayer game World of Warcraft , the anime series Naruto , and Libertarian politician ( and failed presidential candidate ) Ron Paul have in common ?
I could n’t guess what you might come up with , but we ’ve found a drive - by download attack that delivers malware , using these disparate icons as a hook to convince Web surfers to click malicious links .
The hack attempt was discovered by a Threat Research Analyst who also happens to be a Ron Paul fanatic ( and I do mean fanatic — that ’s a photo of his truck parked out back ) .
While doing his daily search for Ron ’s latest words of wisdom , he encountered a cleverly crafted campaign to manipulate search results which originated with Twitter feeds suddenly lighting up with links supposedly pointing to YouTube videos .
A large number of Twitter accounts tweeted messages like “ YOUTUBE RON PAUL – BEST NEW VIDEO – WATCH NOW ” or “ YOUTUBE NARUTO CHAT ROOM 1 | BEST NEW VIDEO | WATCH NOW ” — you get the idea — all within a short amount of time .
Each of those screaming teasers was accompanied by a URL shortened using the bit.ly ( and to a lesser extent , TinyURL.com ) service ;
The bit.ly URLs pointed to a ( now deleted ) hidden subdirectory on the website of Stage Time magazine , an online only , stand - up - comedy industry publication ( neither YouTube nor Stage Time was , knowingly , involved in the hack — they were victims as well ) .
And the many first - time visitors to that site found their computers in a world of hurt shortly after following one or another of those links .
The malicious pages on Stage Time hosted PHP scripts that pushed down several new malware samples ;
The scripts exploited security vulnerabilities in older versions of Adobe Flash and Adobe Reader , loading maliciously crafted SWF and PDF files in order to force the browser to pull down and run malicious executables which had virtually no detection across the spectrum of antivirus vendors .
Some of these samples were droppers , others were downloaders ;
In either case , the drive - by payloads left the PC in a very bad state .
Drive - by downloads such as these serve to illustrate a point I ca n’t emphasize enough :
No matter how careful you might think you are , one wrong click can lead to an infection .
In the case of this drive - by , the malicious website attempted to load first an Adobe Flash video , then a PDF file , which tricked the browser into downloading more malware .
Now more than ever , browser plug-ins like Flash and Adobe Reader need to be kept up to date .
For additional protection , you can disable Javascript in Adobe Reader ; in this case , it would have stopped the initial infection in its tracks .
The Twitter component of this search engine manipulation trick acted as a “ force multiplier ” — not only did Twitter followers pick up on the links , but Twitter feed services like Tweetmeme also picked up on the problem and , inadvertently , linked to the malicious page .
A lot of Twitter feeds posted links like these , all within a short amount of time .
It ’s not clear exactly how the malware distributors accomplished this , but most of the Twitter user accounts appear to have been compromised .
Following the links left computer users in a world of hurt .
Just the act of opening the malicious PDF file caused my test system to become infected with the Internet Security 2010 rogue antivirus app .
In the course of the infection , this rogue changes the desktop background to a puke - green color , planting a fake warning message in a black box at the center of the desktop .
It also drops several files to the system directory , some of which spawn popup warnings about an infection from the System Tray .
Others display a fake “ scan ” that , when it completes , reports that it has found 25 infections on the computer .
The fakealert also puts the kibosh on manual removal ;
It disables the Task Manager and screensaver , changes the desktop to a Web page named “ critical_warning , ” and sets registry keys that prevent changes to the Active Desktop or wallpaper ( the fakealert ) .
It also creates a user account on the infected machine , named “ console , ” which it uses to make other changes to the system .
The good news is that Webroot easily removes all the rogue security tools , and can block the malicious PDF file if you stumble upon a drive - by Web page and your browser attempts to load it .
The bad news is that the malware distributors can make this a very unhappy holiday for you if you find yourself infected .
The best thing you can do to protect yourself is follow our common sense guidelines :
Keep your operating system , programs , and antivirus definitions up to date ; Disable Javascript in Adobe Reader and in your browser ( the NoScript add - on to Firefox makes this easy ) .
Flash and Adobe Reader are especially prone to abuse by malicious sites , but any networked application or browser plugin could potentially be a target .
DALLAS / SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Jon Koehling has a job delivering pizzas in a Dallas suburb and that sets this 21 - year - old apart from many of his American peers .
Shoppers walk past a window display at H+M in New York December 20 , 2008 .

“ I ’m grateful I have a job I do n’t hate .
I did about 15 to 20 applications and it took me three months to get this job , ” he said as he sat in the restaurant between deliveries .
Koehling is fortunate .
People under 30 have been pounded by this recession and its job losses and the implications for some retailers are proving to be dire this holiday season .
Andrew Sum , a labor economist at Northeastern University in Boston , reckons about 50 percent of the 7.7 million jobs lost over the past two years have been absorbed by those under 30 .
Within that group , about 62 percent of these job losses have been incurred by young men .
Those aged 16 to 19 have seen a 23 percent decline in jobs -- by far the sharpest decline of any age category .
In October to November 2007 , almost 5.9 million people in this group were employed either full or part time , according to Sum .
By October of this year only 4.5 million were .
This may explain why mall - based retailers catering to male and female teens such as Pacific Sunwear of California Inc , American Eagle Outfitters Inc and Abercrombie & Fitch Co are resorting to steep promotions .
Pacific Sunwear shares have shed 50 percent since a 2009 high in October .
American Eagle shares are down 15 percent in the same period , Zumiez Inc has fallen 28 percent since a September high and Abercrombie is down 16 percent from a 2009 high in November .
The labor situation has been especially hard for the working class and Sum estimates the recession has taken 17 percent of America ’s blue - collar jobs over the past two years .
“ It is the most uneven recession ever .
It ’s all young and working class for the most part ...
In the labor and youth markets , I would call it a Great Depression , ” Sum told Reuters .
GOT IT , SPEND IT
The young tend to spend what they earn so their job woes are bad news for retailers .
And in this downturn , they ca n’t rely on making up the difference through from parents ’ wallets , which already are stretched thin .
Retail analysts note that teenagers for decades have been a key consumer market relied on by many sectors -- from consumer products to electronics to the approximately $ 26 billion teen apparel market , which is down 7.6 percent this year through October , according to NPD Group .
Eric Beder , an analyst with Brean Murray Carret , estimates teen income has been down 30 percent over the past two years , with apparel , video games and fast food restaurants really taking it on the chin .
“ That entire retailing segment has been hurt and fast food ...
Think of where 16 - to 19 - year - olds hang out .
It ’s in the mall and in fast food restaurants , ” he said .
In apparel , the lower teen income has most visibly hurt Abercrombie & Fitch , known for its clothing at higher price points than competitors .
The chain has posted some of the worst sales results in the teen apparel segment over the past year as teens have gravitated to lower - priced chains such as Aeropostale Inc .
On the other side of this demographic equation , Sum -- using U.S. Department of Labor data -- calculates that , in the over 55 age group , there are over a million more people working now than there were just over two years ago .
This is partly because this group includes the numerous “ baby boomer ” generation -- who drove much consumption when they were teens -- but also because many older workers have reentered the labor force because their retirement nest eggs or properties have lost value .
One consequence of this has been increased competition for low wage jobs in the retail , fast food and entertainment sectors typically associated with young adults and students .
Jim Morgan , 19 , and Brad Hearst , 18 , who were smoking in the snow - filled parking lot of a fast - food restaurant in Loves Park , a suburb of Rockford , Illinois , can relate .
Morgan graduated from high school in 2008 and has yet to find a permanent job .
He lives with his parents .
“ Everywhere I apply for a job , I get told I do n’t have experience , but how am I going to get any experience when no one will give me a job ? ” he said .
“ Even some of the stores and fast - food places I ’ve tried , they ’re hiring older workers who ’ve lost their jobs elsewhere but have experience .
I ’ve been squeezed out of the job market and I ’m about ready to give up . ”
Hearst graduated this summer and has yet to get a job , although he says he has applied everywhere in the area .
Sum said these scenarios stemmed in part from minimum wage increases .
“ Employers say , ‘ If I have to pay somebody $ 7.50 or $ 8.00 an hour I ’m going to hire an older worker , ” he added .
But for some retailers that it is still not good news -- older workers are more likely to save or to spend their earnings in other ways .
After a rash of schoolyard attacks left scores of red- headed children beaten and bruised , parents in the US , Canada and the UK are shocked and appalled by the rising tide of anti-ginger violence .
The attacks were said to have originally been inspired by an episode of South Park that aired in November of 2005 , but have since mutated into a global phenomenon .
In the episode , the character Eric Cartman claims that " gingers " are diseased and inhuman .
But after his friends bleach his skin and dye his hair red while he 's asleep , Cartman does a volte - face and becomes the leader of a genocidal ginger uprising .
The writers of South Park were clearly attempting to satirise hate groups , but the episode inadvertently spawned the " ginger kids " internet meme , which has served to amplify and spread pre-existing prejudice .
Although these online jabs were initially meant to be humorous , often taking the form of mock inspirational posters , the meme turned violent in 2008 after a 14 - year - old Canadian created a Facebook group that established 20 November as " Kick a Ginger Day " .
The group was deleted soon after authorities learned of its existence , but by that point the webpage had received enough traffic for Kick a Ginger Day to go viral .
Now in its second year , this year 's incidents have spread as far as the Isle of Man , indicating a cultural momentum completely independent of the original context .
But while one Canadian judge blamed a " vulgar , socially irreverent " South Park for the violence , there is nothing new about gingerism .
Rather than an isolated case , Kick a Ginger Day is best interpreted as the latest flare - up of what many consider to be the last form of acceptable prejudice .
For centuries , even millennia , non-gingers have continually expressed their distaste for all things copper - top .
The only difference between the red - headed - witch - burnings of the 15th century and the grade - school drubbings of today is that superstition has been replaced with crudely applied science .
Since their genes were decoded in 1997 , gingers , once regarded as vampiric by their oppressors , are now dismissed as mere genetic defects doomed to eventual extinction .
This attitude is in critical need of reappraisal .
Gingers are more than potential sunburn victims cloaked in a galaxy of freckles and topped off with a wild streak of bright orange hair .
They are living metaphors for the fragility of our species and the universality of individual perseverance .
The adversity faced by the average ginger can , in fact , be inspirational and beneficial , but ginger kids should n't be expected to endure violent persecution just because they have a mutated MC1R gene .
Less than 2 % of the world is full - on ginger , but many of us , regardless of race or religion , contain partial ginger genetics .
Now is the time for these closet gingers to stand up against the further proliferation of Kick a Ginger Day , a heinous fad that is tantamount to racism .
I hold such a strong opinion on the subject because I am one .
I am ginger .
My father , a Scotsman , is a full ginger .
But my mother is blonde ; a pigment combination that has has allowed me to live a double - life similar to the that of Anatole Broyard .
My hair is technically " strawberry blond - brown " but everything south of my scalp is a rusty red .
Which means my gingerness remains shrouded if I stay clean shaven and do n't take off my clothes .
But no longer .
From this point on , until it becomes physically uncomfortable or I get a girlfriend , I am making the personal choice to not shave as a gesture of solidarity .
If we allow the next generation of ginger kids to be alienated and victimised , what will happen to the Lionhearts , the Churchills and the Lohans of the future ?
Malcolm X , one of the 20th century 's most influential gingers , put it best when he said : " I believe in human beings , and that all human beings should be respected as such , regardless of their colour . "
And the same should go for hair colour .
For a night out on the town with the family , we decided to head to I Cugini at the recommendation of their concierge .
This hardly pronounceable restaurant was in Santa Monica and had a pretty cool setup with an outdoorsy patio- esque seating area .
The menu offered some pretty good - looking food , but the menu was n’t as robust as a typical Italian place .
Nonetheless , I was transfixed by an item on the menu that I had never seen before .
It was called a “ Bomba ” and was mixed up with the pizzas , so I knew it had to be somewhat similar to pizza .
I asked the waiter what it was , and she said that bomba meant bomb in Italian , so the dish was sort of like an Italian quesadilla .
I had never eaten a bomb before , so I decided to get one .
The bomb I chose had fontina , mascarpone cheese , prosciutto and truffle oil .
When it arrived , I saw the reason it was called a bomb .
The thing was all puffed up like fresh - baked pita and covered with strips of prosciutto .
Then the waitress sliced it up and I could see that beautiful mix of cheese oozing out and waiting for me to eat it .
It was sliced into pizza - style wedges , but it was a lot harder to eat than pizza .
All the cheesy goodness and flakey bread made the bomb a little tough to eat , but when I got it into my mouth , each bite was delicious .
It was also a lot lighter to eat than pizza , so I ate the whole thing without destroying my stomach .
The bomba is definitely worth getting at I Cugini , and although I can’t speak for their other food , I now know to look out for bombas when I find myself at an Italian restaurant .

Haiti has charged 10 US missionaries with child abduction and criminal conspiracy for allegedly trying to smuggle 33 children out of the country .
Haitian officials said their cases would now be sent to an investigating judge who would decide how to proceed .
If convicted they face lengthy jail terms , says the BBC's Paul Adams , in Haiti 's quake - hit capital city .
When stopped on the border last Friday , they said they were taking the children to a Dominican Republic orphanage .
But it has emerged some of the youngsters had parents who were alive .
' Kidnappers '
After the hearing the 10 missionaries were taken back to the jail where they have been kept since Friday .
ANALYSIS Nick Davis , BBC News , Port - au - Prince
This case has become the biggest thing since the quake .
It 's pushed the tragedy - that has seen up to 200,000 killed and countless more made homeless - off the front page .
The issues surrounding this story are important .
Natural disasters in the past have seen cases of child trafficking .
A warning by Unicef saw the increased security by the Haitian authorities that led to the arrest .
With the US spearheading the relief mission and with the American aid public donating so much to the survivors of the disaster , the expectation of many was that they'd be released ; they 'd turn up at court and a short time later they'd be whisked out of the country .
Amid chaotic scenes , the group was bundled into a van outside the court .
" I feel good , " the group 's leader Laura Silsby told reporters .
" I trust in God . "
The five men and five women , most of them from Idaho , were due to have a hearing earlier in the week , but that was postponed because of a lack of interpreters .
Haiti's Prime Minister Jean - Max Bellerive has labelled the Americans " kidnappers " .
Justice Minister Paul Denis said they should be tried in Haiti despite the damage done to the country 's judicial infrastructure and casualties among judges and court staff .
There have been suggestions the 10 could be tried in the US .
" It is Haitian law that has been violated , it is up to the Haitian authorities to hear and judge the case , " he told AFP news agency .
" I do n't see any reason why they should be tried in the United States . "
The US ambassador to Haiti , Kenneth Merten , met the group at police headquarters after the hearing .
" We 'd like to assure they get treated according to the law , the Haitian law , and that they get treated fairly , " he said .
A state department spokesman in Washington said the US was watching the case closely and would continue to offer assistance , through its consulate , to the group .
' Single village '
The children , who are from aged from two to 12 , are now in the care of the Austrian - run SOS Children 's Village in Port - au - Prince .
The missionaries have said they were not trying to kidnap the children Twenty - one of the children are from a single village outside the capital and were handed over willingly by their parents , says the BBC's Paul Adams , in Port - au - Prince .
Residents in the village of Callebas told an Associated Press news agency reporter they had handed their children over through a local orphanage worker who said he was acting on the Americans ' behalf .
The worker is said to have promised the families that the missionaries would educate their children in neighbouring Dominican Republic .
A number of parents in the badly - damaged village said they would find it difficult to provide for their children if they came back .
Ms Silsby has said her group had met a Haitian pastor by chance when they arrived last week , and that he had helped them gather the children .
She also admitted that they did not have the proper paperwork .
" Our intent was to help only those children that needed us most , that had lost either both their mother and father , or had lost one of their parents and the other had abandoned them , " she said from her jail cell on Wednesday .

The projection that Australia ’s population will grow to 36 million by 2050 , contained in the 2010 Intergenerational Report , was received very differently by Australian governments and the community .
Many Australians are deeply uncomfortable with rapid population growth .
A recent poll ( PDF 108KB ) found that 48 per cent of Australians thought such growth would be bad for Australia , while only 24 per cent thought it would be good .
They intuit , perhaps , that governments might not be up to the task of providing sustainable water , energy and transport infrastructure for rapidly growing cities .
The Government ’s stance has vacillated between claiming that such rapid population growth is inevitable on the one hand , and assuring us that it is good for Australia on the other .

The claim of inevitability is disingenuous and easily dismissed .
While some degree of growth is inevitable over the next few decades , both the pace of growth and the ultimate trajectory are well within the government ’s power to influence .
Migration is the largest determinant of long - term population growth for Australia , and different migration levels mean the difference between population stabilisation and ongoing rapid growth .
More interesting , and more forthright , is the claim that rapid population growth is in Australia ’s best interest .
Finance Minister Lindsay Tanner has been the government ’s most vocal proponent of the “ Big Australia ” preference .
In a recent piece , Tanner asked “ Do we want lower productivity and less economic growth ? ” , implying that lower population growth could only damage our economy .
Is there good evidence for or against a link between population growth and economic prosperity ?
Tanner unfortunately offered none in support of his argument for rapid growth .
One ’s view on the question depends largely on an assessment of so - called “ economies of scale ” and “ diseconomies of scale ” .
Economies of scale are things that get better the more of us there are - greater diversity of restaurants is an example that rings true for me .
Diseconomies of scale are things that get harder the more of us there are .
For example , water supply tends to get more expensive per unit as population increases , as increasing supply requires resorting to progressively more distant and difficult to access sources .
A desalination plant is more expensive than extraction from local wells , for example .
Congestion is another diseconomy of scale , and greenhouse pollution is rapidly emerging as another .
Economic modelling conducted for the Intergenerational Report concluded that lower population growth would mean lower per-capita GDP for Australia , among other ills .
But a closer look reveals some flaws .
For one , the modelling excluded any environmental parameters , such as the potential impact of a larger population on greenhouse pollution , water use , and congestion .
The omission seems all the more glaring when you consider that climate change was identified as one of the two most important intergenerational challenges facing Australia today .
In effect , the Intergenerational Report included many potential economies of scale , while excluding the most important diseconomies of scale .
The result tells us more about the modeller than about what is likely to happen in the real world .

The most considered and balanced treatment of this issue in recent times is the final report of the National Population Council , an official Commonwealth body , released in 1991 .
Although nearly two decades old now , its analysis remains compelling and relevant .
It is not , I should stress , an “ anti- growth ” document .
On the link between population and economy , the Council found that the jury was still out : “ because of our limited present direct knowledge of economies and diseconomies of scale , it is not possible to state … that population growth per se enhances or reduces the productivity basis for economic progress . ”
Unfortunately , our knowledge of economies and diseconomies of scale is no better today than it was back then .
This leaves Tanner ’s claim that we’d be less prosperous if we do n’t grow our population on a pretty shaky theoretical base .
BEIJING 
Two days after Google announced that it would quit China unless the nation ’s censors eased their grip , the Chinese government offered an indirect but unambiguous response : Companies that do business in China must follow the laws of the land .
The comments , by two different officials on Thursday , suggested that China was unlikely to give ground on Google ’s demands that its search engine results be unfiltered .
In announcing its decision on Tuesday that it might leave the world ’s biggest Internet market , Google also cited a series of cyberattacks aimed at breaching the accounts of human rights advocates on its e-mail service , Gmail .
Several of those who said their e-mail accounts were hacked provided more details about the assaults on Thursday .
After a day of silence , the Foreign Ministry said that China welcomed foreign Internet companies but that those offering online services must do so “ in accordance with the law . ”
Speaking at a scheduled news conference , Jiang Yu , a ministry spokeswoman , did not address Google ’s complaints about censorship and cyberattacks and simply stated that “ China ’s Internet is open . ”
I received an email from an Army Soldier who was having a difficult time running a few months ago .
His breathing patterns were so erratic that he was basically hyperventilating while running his two mile PFT run .
Once he started breathing properly as well as exhaling fully , he was able to perform better in the run - not only did he run faster , but he had more energy to finish .
The Soldier stated :
" It finally clicked !
Not only was I able to breathe and finish while running , but I was able to run faster without getting tired or cramped at all ! "
Learning to breathe during exercise has benefits such as preventing dizziness during activity , improving athletic performance , and increasing fat burning .
What is Proper Breathing While Running ?
Many experts will say that to fully oxygenate the muscles and clear the body of carbon dioxide you should breathe a 3:2 inhale - to - exhale ratio ; full inhales and full exhales .
This means you INHALE on the LEFT , RIGHT , LEFT foot strikes and EXHALE fully on the RIGHT , LEFT foot strikes .
This pattern is not that hard to turn into a habit , but it may require you to slow your pace down for a few runs to master the technique .
You will notice a lower heart rate as you are able to get more oxygen in and more importantly push all the carbon dioxide out of your body .
You may notice that you naturally drop to a 2:1 ratio when you are really pushing it to the finish .
That is OK .
But realize it is difficult to maintain a pace that requires you to breathe at a 2:1 ratio .
The CO2 in your body will increase if your breathing patterns are short and hurried .
This will increase your heart rate and lactic acid production , and decrease your endurance in any cardiovascular event ( running , swimming , biking , etc. )
What About Breathing and PT / Lifting ?
Proper breathing during exercises where you exert yourself - such as lifting , pushing , or pulling - is much easier to remember and control than the 3:2 ratio during running long distance .
To put it simply : always exhale on exertion .
For example , when you are pushing a bench press off your chest , you exhale on the push and inhale as you bring it slowly to your chest .
When you are doing a pullup , you exhale on the pulling up motion and inhale on the way down .
Breathing during exertion is important in preventing internal injury such as hernia , blood vessel strain , and high blood pressure .
Because weight lifting and PT can be potentially harmful when done incorrectly , it is advised to get clearance from a doctor before performing too much - too soon .
To decrease that pressure , focus on breathing deep all the time - during workouts and in your daily activities .
How Does More Oxygen Help Burn More Fat ?
Oxygen Water = Fat burn . ( from " Want to Lose Weight ? " article )
Basically , the body needs water and increased oxygen to burn fat as an energy source .
The water intake should be anywhere from a half gallon for women and up to one gallon a day for men , and the increased oxygen consumption will assist with the other part of the equation .
See the " Water Plus Oxygen Equals Weight Loss " article if you are concerned about drinking too much .
As you add more water and oxygen to your system , your body will be able to use the retained water for excretion , prompting almost immediate weight loss of retained water and toxins .
This is not the same as sitting in a sauna and sweating which actually dehydrates you .
Adding water will rehydrate you and enable the body to burn more fat ( as long as you increase your oxygen intake by doing some form of exercise ) .
Walking , swimming , biking , jogging , calisthenics , and even yard work can help with working your cardiovascular system .
Try the deep breathing rhythm during running and see for yourself how you will run at a lower heart rate and have more energy for a strong finish .

The top two Republicans in the House sent a letter daring their counterparts -- Nancy Pelosi and Steny Hoyer -- to engage in a public discussion .
| AP photo composite by POLITICO GOP wants televised jobs debate
House Republicans are taking a page from the president 's playbook by challenging Democrats to a televised debate about job creation .
The top two Republicans in the House sent a letter Wednesday daring their counterparts — Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Majori ty Leader Steny Hoyer — to engage in a public discussion over ways Congress can provide a boost to the economy .
Advertisement
Their call comes as Democrats struggle to find consensus on a job creation package and in advance of the Feb. 25 bipartisan health care summit .
" Clearly , we need a different approach to developing legislation that will get Americans back to work , " Republican leader John Boehner and party Whip Eric Cantor wrote to Pelosi and Hoyer .
" Therefore , in the interest of complete transparency on the single most important issue of the day for most Americans , we ask that you join us for an open discussion so that we can begin to change a process that has not only polarized this Capitol building but this country as well . "
Democrats did n’t outright dismiss the Republican idea , but they did n’t exactly embrace it .
Pelosi spokesman Nadeam Elshami said : “ In her most recent meeting with Leader Boehner earlier this month , the speaker raised the subject of jobs but did not receive a positive response .
The speaker welcomes the change in the Republican leadership and looks forward to a productive discussion on promoting jobs and economic recovery . ”
Their call for an open discussion echoes President Barack Obama 's invitation to congressional leaders to hold a health care debate next week at Blair House .
That event stems from a recent back and forth between Obama and House Republicans .
The president earned praise from the left and the right for his lengthy , candid exchange with Republicans during their annual issues conference in Baltimore late last month .
The White House caught Republicans off guard by asking the GOP to open the normally closed - door question - and - answer session to television cameras and reporters who are normally ushered from the room after the president speaks .
The two parties have been at loggerheads over the economy — and everything else — since Obama took the oath of office , when Republicans refused to support his almost $ 800 billion economic stimulus package , arguing it was too expensive and would prove ineffective .
On Wednesday — the anniversary of its enactment — Democrats and Republicans engaged in yet another public relations blitz about whether the massive package actually spurred job growth .
" There are no doubt significant differences between our respective approaches to create jobs , as was evident during the stimulus debate last year , " Boehner and Cantor said in their letter .
" Though we had different philosophical approaches , it is unfortunate that there was neither a public discussion nor an opportunity for the American people — especially small - business owners — to become more engaged , " the Republicans wrote .
" Had there been such a discussion , perhaps Congress would have produced a bill that more directly addressed our nation ’s economic problems . "
House Democrats passed a $ 154 billion jobs bill in December that used $ 75 billion from the Wall Street bailout package to improve highways and help cash - strapped communities pay for teachers , police officers and firefighters .
Republicans say that that package " continued the failed policies of the first stimulus " because it " was drafted without Republican input . "
As a result , every Republican voted against it , along with 38 Democrats .
Senate Democrats offered a competing measure last week , but Majority Leader Harry Reid immediately scaled it back , setting the stage for yet another policy fight between Democrats in the two chambers .
With the letter from Boehner and Cantor , House Republicans are trying to insert themselves into that debate .
The Republican leaders also took a veiled shot at members of the majority by reminding them that Obama held open debates with the House GOP and Senate Democrats but not the Democratic Caucus .
" As you are no doubt aware , President Obama has recently held public forums with both House Republicans and Senate Democrats , " the leaders wrote .
" Though House Democrats have yet to participate in such a forum , we write to ask that you follow this precedent and agree to participate in an open meeting focused on job creation and economic growth between leaders of both parties in the House . "

" The knave abideth . "
Sweet baby Jesus , the attention to detail in this sucker is just mindblowing !
What a thing of beauty .
Here 's the carpet - staining scene :
WOO :
Rise , and speak wisely , man–but hark ; I see thy rug , as woven i'the Orient , A treasure from abroad .
I like it not .
I 'll stain it thus ; ever thus to deadbeats .
[ He stains the rug ]
THE KNAVE :
Sir , prithee nay !
BLANCHE :
Now thou seest what happens , Lebowski , when the agreements of honourable business stand compromised .
If thou wouldst treat money as water , flowing as the gentle rain from heaven , why , then thou knowest water begets water ; it will be a watery grave your rug , drowned in the weeping brook .
Pray remember , Lebowski .
THE KNAVE :
Thou err'st ; no man calls me Lebowski .
Yet thou art man ; neither spirit damned nor wandering shadow , thou art solid flesh , man of woman born .
Hear rightly , man ! –for thou hast got the wrong man .
I am the Knave , man ; Knave in nature as in name .
BLANCHE :
Thy name is Lebowski .

Accepting death can be difficult .
When loved ones have passed on , we refuse to let them go , fantasizing that they ’re still alive and secretly hoping , wishing and even praying that they ’ll walk back through our door at any second .
Unfortunately , in the case of videogames , they sometimes do .
Thanks to the powers of lazy publishers and lucrative nostalgia value , we ’re constantly forced to watch as old , long - buried franchises are exhumed and then paraded around as reboots , relaunches , reinventions and reimaginings .
A few of these updates work .
These , though , are the ones – the horrifying , unnatural , “ Oh God , aim for the head ! ” zombies – that did n’t .
The dead franchise : Alone in the Dark ( 1992 - 2001 )
Four years before a polygonal zombie dog smashed through the window of a Raccoon City mansion in Resident Evil , giant murderous rats and undead pirate slaves were chasing players through the haunted 3D hallways of Alone in the Dark .
Seven years before Silent Hill unlocked the psychological fear of its protagonists through foggy exploration and foggier puzzles , Alone in the Dark asked us to solve the suicide of a tortured artist by investigating the mysterious belongings and macabre booby - traps he left behind .
In other words , this series was the original .
These games were the classy old grandfathers of the genre .
If you ’ve ever enjoyed a survival horror adventure , you have Alone in the Dark to thank .
The failed resurrection : Alone in the Dark ( 2008 )
You know your franchise is better off dead when Uwe Boll is no longer the worst thing about it .
2001 ’s Alone in the Dark : The New Nightmare may have suffered from a dumb title and a dumber movie adaptation by the loathed director , but the actual game was a faithful update on the original formula .
That reboot did n’t take , though , so a new team of developers tried again in 2008 .
We really wish they had n’t .
The latest Alone in the Dark has a few highlights – the special effects are cool and the graphics are good – but these are quickly overshadowed by a poorly told story , badly designed controls , half - baked missions and game - breaking glitches .
Even if it was n’t an unplayable mess , however , this version would still be a major betrayal of the brand .
The first Alone in the Dark cast you as Edward Carnby , a gentlemanly 1920s detective trapped in a Louisiana mansion , fighting the H.P. Lovecraft - inspired forces of evil through quick reflexes , but more importantly , quick wits .
The last Alone in the Dark , meanwhile , casts you as “ Edward , ” a foul - mouthed smartass stuck in present - day New York City , fighting off generic zombies through a combination of melee combat , fetch quests and driving minigames .
If we wanted a derivative action movie , we could ’ve stuck with Uwe Boll .
The dead franchise : Bionic Commando ( 1987-1999 )
You need to know one thing – and one thing only – about the original Bionic Commando games .
Grapple arm .
Nobody cared if the graphics were fancy ( they were n’t ) , if the story was interesting ( it was n’t ) or if the hero was complex ( his personality consisted of spiky hair and sunglasses ) .
Nobody even minded that the “ damsel ” - in - distress was a grizzly old dude named Super Joe instead of a beautiful princess .
Why would we , when Bionic Commando taught us to swing and soar through levels rather than trudge across platforms ?
When we could grab enemies from across the screen with a badass robotic claw rather than just shoot at them ?
All that mattered was the arm , and the newfound freedom that arm delivered .
The failed resurrection : Bionic Commando ( 2009 )
So when the folks at Capcom decided to bring Bionic Commando back in 2009 , they kept things pure , simple and focused .
Right ?
Well , as should be obvious from the headline of this article ... not so much .
Everything about the experience has been needlessly complicated .
The protagonist , who was once a harmless and happy 8 - bit sprite , is now a grab bag of modern gaming clichés : edgy , angsty and rebellious , with a stupidly exaggerated set of muscles and a predictably mysterious past .
The story tries way too hard as well , introducing overwrought themes of terrorism , genocide and government betrayal .
Then , of course , the arm .
Our poor , beloved grapple arm .
Why must you be reimagined , too ?
Why are you so ludicrously large ?
Why do you appear ten times heavier than the man who is carrying you ?
Why have the developers restricted your glorious potential with tight , narrow corridors and invisible “ radiation ” borders ?
Why , oh why , must you be the target of gaming ’ smost terrible plot twist ?
By the way , Capcom also released a remake of the NES classic , with essentially untouched gameplay , in 2008 .
Guess which versionscored better …
About Ventless Gas Heaters
Ventless gas heaters are one of the most controversial types of gas heaters in the market today .
This is primarily due to the fact that there are certain segments of the market that believe ventless gas heaters are actually more harmful than helpful .
One thing , however , is certain .
These heaters are becoming more and more popular with many people switching over to these sorts of heaters from conventional forms of heaters or fireplaces .
Owing to the stark increase in the popularity and the controversial nature of these types of heaters , the following is an �all you need to know ' guide on ventless gas heaters .
What Are Ventless Gas Heaters ?
These are heaters that operate on gas and whose Unique Selling Point ( USP ) is that they do not have vents , and hence neither do they draw fresh air from outside nor release emissions outside .
These types of gas heaters have been banned by some states as they are believed to be harmful to the user .
Another fact as to why these types of heaters are gaining popularity is the good fuel efficiency that they offer .
The fuel efficiency of these heater systems can go up to 99.9 percent .
What Are Their Advantages ?
There are many advantages of ventless gas heaters .
Many people choose such heaters for the following varied properties . 
The primary advantage of these types of gas heaters is that they provide a fuel efficiency of 99.9 percent . 
Their efficiency levels result in a major reduction in fuel expenses for the user .
This means that the volatility of the fuel market does not affect him or her to the extent that happens with conventional gas heaters .

Furthermore , these same efficiency levels have lead to such types of gas heaters to be considered highly environment friendly .

The ventless and highly efficient property of these types of gas heaters allow for better heating for the user as no heat is lost .
In the case of conventional gas heaters , a good deal of heat is lost through their vents . 
There is a whole array of ventless gas heaters available in the market .
Some examples include stand alone versions , wall mounted versions , gas log versions , blue flame versions , radiant versions , etc . What Are The Disadvantages ?
There are no inherently harmful disadvantages of ventless gas heaters .
However , some misconceptions do prevail among the masses .
As a matter of fact , most of the well known harmful effects of these types of gas heaters are nothing but cases of bad maintenance and usage of the product .
The following are some . 
One of the misconceptions is that ventless gas heaters cause asphyxiation .
This can only be possible if there is not enough ventilation in the room where the gas heater is installed .

The second misconception is also linked to the ventilation system of the room where the device is installed .
Some people believe that carbon monoxide levels can rise to harmful levels and be particularly damaging .
However , the carbon monoxide levels will never accumulate to dangerous levels in a room which is properly ventilated .
Furthermore , it should be noted that all forms of combustion result in carbon monoxide emissions and in the case of conventional fireplaces the levels are much higher than gas heaters .

One of the genuine complaints pertaining to ventless gas heaters is that their usage results in increased levels of humidity in the room .
This is a real side effect , but should be countered easily with proper ventilation . 
The biggest and most genuine disadvantage of ventless gas heaters is that they require higher maintenance than conventional heaters .
This is true for the owner of the device as well as the professional who services it .
In fact , in the case of some models , the servicing of the device is not even possible at home and can only be done at the service center , workshop , or factory .
What Are The Different Types Available ?
There are many types of ventless gas heaters in the market which provide different advantages and benefits to the user .
The following are some of the different types available .
 Wall Mounted :
These are units that are mounted on a wall and are advised not to be moved .
It should be noted that these are highly inappropriate for small walls .
 Freestanding :
These types of heaters do not require to be attached to any wall and can be stood separately like any other furniture .
The flaw with these types is that they occupy floor space and resultantly knocked over .
 Display Variety :
There is a whole spectrum of ventless gas heaters available in the market and each one of them gives a different feel and look to the user .
Portable Gas Heaters : Handy and Efficient Heating Option Portable gas heaters have risen in popularity thanks to its main beneficial feature of portability , besides being one of the cheapest and cleanest heating options .
Heaters become the great sought - after equipment when winter season touches its peak .
In extreme cold regions , staying warm during the winter days is a real challenge .
Portable gas heaters are considered to be one of the best ways to keep house warm and livable .
A Brief Historic Account of Gas Heaters
The first gas heater was made available to the public in the year 1856 by the English company Pettit and Smith .
In 1881 , British engineer Sigismund Leoni came up with a new gas heater design , which included a structure made of asbestos .
This is said to be the first successful gasfire .
Both these models were based on the principles of the � Bunsen burner ' , where heated air spreads by means of convection .
Modern gas heaters are based on the radiant heat technology where heat is not spread through convection .
Radiating heat into the surrounding atmosphere is the basic principle of modern gas heaters .
Reasons for the Popularity of Portable Gas Heaters
Most households prefer portable gas heaters above other methods like electric heaters and wood stoves in cold environments .
When people decide to buy heaters , the size , price , and safety are some of the most important factors that they take into consideration .
Portable gas heaters emerge as a clear winner in these attributes and many others .
Compatible and Space - Efficient : Portable gas heaters are small and compatible in size , and can conveniently be positioned in any room you desire to heat .
As it dos not eat away a sizeable amount of space in any room , it causes less trouble in terms of repositioning the existing things in the room or finding a special space for the new equipment .
Portability : Since these are portable , they help in heating up the required room , rather than the entire house .
The equipment is lightweight , adding to the portable characteristic .
The equipment can be stowed away when not in use .
Energy - Efficient and Environment - Friendly : Portable Gas Heaters consume less energy compared to the other heating options .
Less energy consumption also means that they are eco-friendly and do not worsen the already rising issue of global warming .
It helps in reducing heating costs associated with central heating systems , since it heats up only the specific area .
Natural gas does not leave any harmful residue and ensures a less polluted environment .
Odorless operation is an additional benefit .
The commonly available ventless design of the gas heaters also contributes to the eco-friendly aspect , in addition to making it easier to install .
Ventless design increases efficiency and is designed to be safe .
So , in this winter season , do n't forget to warm yourselves with portable gas heaters that are handy and economical .
Choosing the Right Heater for Your Garage
There are different kinds of garage heaters available in the market , depending on the fuel sources such as propane , natural gas , and electric power .
Each garage heaters has its pros and cons .
Electric Garage Heaters :
Most people opt for them since electric garage heaters do not require a vent , even though they cost more than gas - fired garage heaters .
Electric heaters operate quietly and are easy to install without any need to install a gas line or flue .
They just require an electric output .
The most important demerit of these garage heaters are that their cost of operation is very high since electricity is expensive .
Electric heater is preferred in case you are planning to use garage heater only occasionally .
Gas Garage Heaters :
These are like small furnaces .
Their operation produces a loud noise when gas combusts in the heat exchanger .
In the case of an attached garage , these heaters will cause irritating sound vibrations to the attached dwelling spaces .
Since it is an energy - saving electric appliance , natural gas and propane heaters can be beneficial in the long run .
Gas garage heaters are considered to be the best heating option since they are durable and long lasting , besides being energy - efficient and eco-friendly .
Natural gas and propane are clean fuels that produce the lowest harmful emissions without any residue .
Nowadays , ventless models of different varieties are available , helping to do away with much of the untidy and cumbersome procedure of installing vents .
Ventless heaters are available as wall - mountable as well as free standing models , which can be customized into the room structure .

Mr Galloway had been in Gaza with an aid convoy British MP George Galloway has been deported from Egypt , say activists working with him to take an aid convoy into Gaza .
The Bow and Bethnal Green MP had been with international activists trying to take 200 aid trucks into the blockaded Gaza Strip .
Egypt had refused some of the vehicles access and there have been protests and clashes on the Egypt - Gaza border .
The state news agency says Mr Galloway has left Egypt and returned home .
There have also been reports the Respect MP has been declared " persona non grata " and will not be allowed to enter Egypt again , following his criticism of Cairo over delays to the aid convoy .
The activists have accused the Egyptians of heavy - handed policing .
Egyptian officials counter that Mr Galloway has tried to embarrass the government .
In a speech last year Mr Galloway described Egypt 's President Hosni Mubarak as a " criminal " and " outlaw of the Arab world " and called for his overthrow .
Egypt has faced criticism in the Arab and Muslim world for co-operating with Israel in its blockade of the Gaza Strip .
But Egypt says it allows humanitarian aid to pass with certain restrictions .
Convoy tension
The BBC's Cairo correspondent Yolande Knell said Mr Galloway had returned from Gaza , where the convoy arrived two days ago , and had been planning to head back to London .
But when he and his assistant returned to Egypt they learnt that seven other members of the convoy still in Gaza were due to be arrested on their return to Egypt .
Mr Galloway wanted to go back to accompany them out but it is understood the Egyptians would not allow him to return , bundled both men into a van and escorted them to the airport .
There has been much tension around the aid convoy after Egypt made it take a big detour , delaying its arrival .
There were clashes with Egyptian police at a port close to the Rafah crossing , our correspondent said .
A spokeswoman for the convoy said police intervened when Mr Galloway and colleague Ron McKay arrived at the crossing .
" As soon as they emerged on to Egyptian soil , both men were forcibly pushed into a van , refused exit and told that they were leaving the country .
They were then driven off in a police convoy . "
She said Mr Galloway had been put on a plane bound for London .
On Wednesday an Egyptian soldier was killed and several Palestinians hurt during clashes over the delayed aid convoy , which involves 550 people from 17 countries .
Dozens of activists had been hurt on Tuesday .
Egypt and Israel impose a strict blockade on the Gaza Strip , which Israel says is aimed at weakening Hamas .
The Viva Palestina aid convoy , which is carrying items including heart monitors , clothing and dental equipment , aims to break the blockade .

CANADIAN ministers , it seems , are a bunch of Gerald Fords .
Like the American president , who could not walk and chew gum at the same time , they cannot , apparently , cope with Parliament 's deliberations while dealing with the country 's economic troubles and the challenge of hosting the Winter Olympic games .
This was the argument put forward by the spokesman for Stephen Harper , the Conservative prime minister , after his boss on December 30th abruptly suspended , or “ prorogued ” , Canada 's Parliament until March 3rd .
Mr Harper 's supporters might argue that there is nothing wrong with this .
Precedent allows it , and Canada is a decent , well - run place , where much is decided at the provincial level .
Since most countries already have too many laws , a pause for parliamentary reflection might count as progress .
Some places , such as Texas , manage well with only a part - time legislature .
Politicians ' ritual slanging matches should not be allowed to distract Canadians from weightier battles , such as the bobsleigh , the giant slalom or round - robin curling .
Come to think about it , why not shut down Parliament altogether , perhaps until the economy is growing again at full throttle ?
At least that would help cut the federal deficit .
The argument that previous prime ministers frequently prorogued Parliament is no more convincing .
In almost every case they did so only once the government had got through the bulk of its legislative business .
The Parliament that Mr Harper prorogued still had 36 government bills before it , including measures that form part of the prime minister 's much - vaunted crackdown on crime .
When it reconvenes , those bills will have to start again from scratch .
Past prorogations were typically brief ( see article ) .
This time sessions will be separated by a gap of 63 days .
Never mind what his spin doctors say : Mr Harper 's move looks like naked self - interest .
His officials faced grilling by parliamentary committees over whether they misled the House of Commons in denying knowledge that detainees handed over to the local authorities by Canadian troops in Afghanistan were being tortured .
The government would also have come under fire for its lack of policies to curb Canada 's abundant carbon emissions .
Prorogation means that such committees — which carry out the essential democratic task of scrutinising government — will have to be formed anew in March .
That will also allow Mr Harper to gain immediate control of committees in the appointed Senate , where his Conservatives are poised to become the biggest party .
Mr Harper has form .
He prorogued Parliament last winter , too — to dodge a short - lived threat by the three opposition parties to bring his minority government down .
Having gone to the polls three times since 2004 Canadians do not want another election .
He might say that governing in a minority obliges him to play fast and loose with parliamentary nicety .
He has nursed the economy and he has confounded those who feared that he would impose his supporters ' loathing of abortion and liking for the death penalty on a generally tolerant country .
A legislature matters more than the luge
Mr Harper is a competent tactician with a ruthless streak .
He bars most ministers from talking to the media ; he has axed some independent watchdogs ; he has binned campaign promises to make government more open and accountable .
Now he is subjecting Parliament to prime - ministerial whim .
He may be right that most Canadians care more about the luge than the legislature , but that is surely true only while their decent system of government is in good hands .
They may soon conclude that it is n't .
MEXICO CITY 
The story is as convoluted as a film noir plot .
A prominent lawyer is murdered after he accuses the president of plotting to kill him .
But an international investigation finds that the murder was actually planned by the victim himself and carried out in a way that appeared intended to inflict maximum damage on the government .
Bizarre as the story is , its conclusion is likely to put an end to a political crisis in Guatemala that has threatened the survival of President Álvaro Colom ’s government .
Vindicated by the results of the United Nations - sponsored report that has cleared his name , Mr. Colom on Wednesday declared victory over political opponents who had called for his resignation .
“ This strengthens both my government and my country , ” Mr. Colom said in a telephone interview .
The lawyer in question , Rodrigo Rosenberg , was shot five times on May 10 while riding his bicycle .
A day later , a videotape that he made earlier surfaced .
He said , “ Unfortunately , if you are watching the message , it is because I was assassinated by President Álvaro Colom . ”
Peter Hustinx , the European Data Protection Supervisor , has issued a 20 - page opinion expressing concern about ACTA .
The opinion is a must - read and points to the prospect of other privacy commissioners speaking out .
Moreover , with the French HADOPI three strikes law currently held up by its data protection commissioner , it raises questions about whether that law will pass muster under French privacy rules .
Given the secrecy associated with the process , the opinion addresses possible outcomes based on the information currently available .
The opinion focuses on three key issues : three strikes legislation , cross - border data sharing as part of enforcement initiatives , and transparency .
Three Strikes
On three strikes , the opinion begins by noting the privacy implications :
Such practices are highly invasive in the individuals ' private sphere .
They entail the generalised monitoring of Internet users ’ activities , including perfectly lawful ones .
They affect millions of law - abiding Internet users , including many children and adolescents .
They are carried out by private parties , not by law enforcement authorities .
Moreover , nowadays , Internet plays a central role in almost all aspects of modern life , thus , the effects of disconnecting Internet access may be enormous , cutting individuals off from work , culture , eGoverment applications , etc .
The opinion then assesses three strikes within the context of European data protection law , concluding that it is a disproportionate measure :
Although the EDPS acknowledges the importance of enforcing intellectual property rights , he takes the view that a three strikes Internet disconnection policy as currently known – involving certain elements of general application – constitutes a disproportionate measure and can therefore not be considered as a necessary measure .
The EDPS is furthermore convinced that alternative , less intrusive solutions exist or that the envisaged policies can be performed in a less intrusive manner or with a more limited scope .
Also on a more detailed legal level the three strikes approach poses problems .
Among the specific problems , Hustinx concludes that the benefits simply do n't outweigh the costs :
The EDPS is not convinced that the benefits of the measures outweigh the impact on the fundamental rights of individuals .
The protection of copyright is an interest of right holders and of society .
However , the limitations on the fundamental rights do not seem justified , if one balances the gravity of the interference , i.e. the scale of the privacy intrusion as highlighted by the above elements , with the expected benefits , deterring the infringement of intellectual property rights involving – for a great part – small scale intellectual property infringements .
Data Sharing
The opinion also considers the privacy implications of data sharing arrangements facilitated by ACTA for enforcement purposes :
It can be questioned first whether data transfers to third countries in the context of ACTA are legitimate .
The relevance of adopting measures at international level in that field can be questioned as long as there is no agreement within the EU member states over the harmonisation of enforcement measures in the digital environment and the types of criminal sanctions to be applied .
In view of the above , it appears that the principles of necessity and proportionality of the data transfers under ACTA would be more easily met if the agreement was expressly limited to fighting the most serious IPR infringement offences , instead of allowing for bulk data transfers relating to any suspicions of IPR infringements .
This will require defining precisely the scope of what constitutes the ' most serious IPR infringement offences ' for which data transfers may occur .
The opinion follows this with detailed recommendations on how ACTA can facilitate sharing of information and ensure appropriate privacy safeguards .
Transparency
Hustinx is direct and to the point on the issue of transparency :
The EDPS strongly encourages the European Commission to establish a public and transparent dialogue on ACTA , possibly by means of a public consultation , which would also help ensuring that the measures to be adopted are compliant with EU privacy and data protection law requirements .
Arnold Schwarzenegger savages congressional plans for health reform in his 2010 State of the State address .
Arnold : ' Bribes ' infect health reform
California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger savaged congressional plans for health reform in his 2010 State of the State address on Wednesday , calling the legislation " health care to nowhere " that 's infected with " bribes , deals and loopholes . "
With the nation 's largest state enduring a fiscal crisis , Schwarzenegger said California 's lawmakers should vote against the bill or push to get the Medicaid subsidies that were written into the Senate bill in order to secure Sen.
Ben Nelson ( D - Neb. ) as the 60th and passing vote for that chamber 's version of reform .
The deal has been attacked as the " Cornhusker Kickback . "

" While I enthusiastically support health care reform , it is not reform to push more costs onto states that are already struggling while other states get sweetheart deals , " Schwarzenegger said before a joint session of the California State Legislature .
" Health care reform , which started as noble and needed legislation , has become a trough of bribes , deals and loopholes .
You 've heard of the bridge to nowhere .
This is health care to nowhere .
California 's congressional delegation should either vote against this bill that is a disaster for California or get in there and fight for the same sweetheart deal Senator Nelson of Nebraska got for the Cornhusker State .
He got the corn ; we got the husk . "
In 2014 I watched over 200 movies , 80 % more than my yearly average .
In 2015 I watched 112 movies , which was one off from my yearly average .
In 2016 my movies total went back up to 180 , 60 % more than my yearly average .
I have no real explaination , other than that I did n’t do as much reading as I wanted to ( and one of my 2017 resolutions ) .
I think the standout new movie from 2016 was The Lobster , and I really liked The Nice Guys , and Zootopia .

MacRumors caught the slip during a CNBC segment , in which the anchor lobs a softball closer question about the — excuse me , a — tablet , from Apple , maybe .
Instead of deflecting , Mr. McGraw just started talking about it as if it'd already been announced :
Yeah , Very exciting .
Yes , they 'll make their announcement tomorrow on this one .
We have worked with Apple for quite a while .
And the Tablet is going to be based on the iPhone operating system and so it will be transferable .
So what you are going to be able to do now is we have a consortium of e-books .
And we have 95 % of all our materials that are in e-book format .
So now with the tablet you 're going to open up the higher education market , the professional market .
The tablet is going to be just really terrific .

Holy hell , guy .
So , now we know a few things about the tablet !
It 's real , it 's going to have a wide media strategy that at the very least includes textbooks , and it may be exactly what we predicted it will be , and apparently it does n't suck , according to this man in a suit who is heavily invested in its success , or at least was , until he barfed up his NDA all over CNBC 's anchor table .
We reached out to the company regarding the slip , they 're not calling back .

Very nice clip -
See to the last :-)
Last December , Israel began a 23 - day bombardment of Gaza , killing around 1,400 people .
One year on , a generation of children is growing up amid the wreckage of that attack , traumatised – and radicalised – by the experience
Ghiada abu Elaish 's fingers twist in her lap and her eyes cloud over as she recalls the day an Israeli shell killed four of her cousins and left her in a coma for 22 days .
She has had almost 12 months to reflect on the tragedy , a time in which hatred and anger might have consumed the 13 - year - old .
Remarkably , though , not only has she survived shocking injuries and a dozen operations , with many more to come , but she has retained both her sweet nature and faith in a bright future .
Which makes it all the harder for her to return each day after school , dressed in the ubiquitous Palestinian uniform of blue - and - white - striped smock over jeans and trainers , to the scene of the massacre – her family home .
It was Friday 16 January and Ghiada was studying for exams .
Her father , a pharmacist , woke from a nap , demanding tea and shouting at the younger children to be quiet .
" Suddenly I could hear my cousin downstairs , screaming ' Dead ! Dead ! ' "
A shell had hit the building – a block of five apartments , housing the extended Abu Elaish family – smashing windows and causing extensive damage to the flat below .
In the ensuing panic , Ghiada defied her father and followed him downstairs .
" One room was completely black .
I saw Aya [ my cousin ] , she was on the ground with wood on top of her .
There was a big hole in the wall . "
Ghiada tried pulling Aya out from under the furniture .
A second shell struck .
" There was a big light for a second , " she says .
" I saw some windows smash and I heard screaming all around .
A piece of shrapnel hit me .
I started to scream for help and then fell down unconscious . "
Ghiada 's father , Atta Mohammed abu Elaish , rushed into the room .
" I saw bodies without heads and legs .
I saw my daughter .
I saw her mother screaming . "
He ran outside to call an ambulance .
" The Israelis stopped the ambulances 250 metres from the house .
Some boys from the street came to start ferrying the bodies and the injured out of the building . "
The attack was one of countless assaults during Israel 's 23 days of war on Gaza – Operation Cast Lead – that began on 27 December .
But it was also one of the most notorious because Ghiada 's uncle – Aya 's father – was a doctor who worked in Israeli hospitals and was well known to Israeli viewers for advocating peace and reconciliation .
All through the conflict , Dr Izzeldin abu Elaish gave regular eyewitness accounts by phone in fluent Hebrew to Israeli television .
Within minutes of the attack on his own family , he was back on the phone to a journalist in a Tel Aviv studio , weeping and begging for help as Israeli viewers listened : " My daughters have been killed . "
Indeed , they had : Bissan , 20 , Miar , 15 , and Aya , 14 , were dead , along with another cousin , 17 - year - old Nour .
Ghiada was in a critical condition ; another of the doctor 's daughters was also wounded .
The injured girls – thanks to that live TV broadcast – were unusually and swiftly evacuated to a hospital in Tel Aviv , where Ghiada was found to be suffering from multiple problems with her heart , kidneys , stomach and legs .
She remained in hospital in Israel for four and a half months .
Now , Ghiada says , she thinks about that day " always " , but tries not to let others see her pain .
" When I am crying , I go to my room and cry alone , " she says .
Does she feel angry ?
No , she says , just sad .
And she plans to stay put in Gaza : " Maybe others would like to emigrate , but that 's not for me . "
Toll of death and destruction
But if Ghiada expresses no bitterness , her father insists she is angry and so is the rest of the family .
" It 's very hard for us , " he says .
" That accident took Bissan , Nour , Miar , Aya – and my brother . "
Dr Abu Elaish has left Gaza for Canada .
" He is the eldest brother , the father of the family , and now he 's gone .
How can we forgive ? "
The shelling of the Abu Elaish family was unusual in that it caught the attention of the Israeli public , but what Ghiada continues to endure 12 months on is shared by many of Gaza 's 750,000 children – half of its population .
More than 1,400 Gazans were killed in the 23 days of the Israeli assault , including several hundred children .
The actual number is in dispute .
The Palestinian Centre for Human Rights ( PCHR ) documented 313 deaths , almost 40 % of them less than 10 years old .
Other Palestinian groups say the toll was much higher .
More than 1,600 children were injured .
But the 23 - day war is only part of the story .
The long history of Israeli assaults on Gaza , and the two - and - a - half - year - long blockade of the territory after Hamas took power , has exacted a toll on almost every aspect of children 's lives : schooling , housing , leisure time , what they eat , what they wear , how they see the future .
A Gaza Community Mental Health Programme ( GCMHP ) survey earlier this year found that about 75 % of children over the age of six were suffering from one or more symptom of post - traumatic stress disorder .
Almost one in 10 ticked off every criteria .
" The majority of children suffer many psychological and social consequences , " says Dr Hasan Zeyada , a psychologist with GCMHP .
" Insecurity and feelings of helplessness and powerlessness are overwhelming .
We observed children becoming more anxious – sleep disturbances , nightmares , night terror , regressive behaviour such as clinging to parents , bed wetting , becoming more restless and hyperactive , refusal to sleep alone , all the time wanting to be with their parents , overwhelmed by fears and worries .
Some start to be more aggressive . "
Dr Abdel Aziz Mousa
Thabet , professor of psychiatry at al - Quds university in Gaza , says the conflict has a different impact on boys and girls .
" Girls have more anxiety and depression , boys are more hyperactive . "
Some children no longer look on their homes as a place of safety , security and comfort .
Others do n't even have a home to go to .
The Israeli bombardment damaged or destroyed more than 20,000 houses , forcing some families into tents and others into crowding in with relatives .
Hamas distributed money to displaced families to rebuild their homes but the Israeli blockade has created a desperate shortage of materials .
Almost one year later , some children still have no roof over their head .
Hanan Attar , a slight 10 - year - old wearing flip - flops several sizes too big for her small feet , is wistful as she recalls the house destroyed by an Israeli tank shell .
" We had land , my father is a farmer , " she says .
" We used to grow watermelons , but the land was too close to the border and we can't get there now . "
Home is now a tent on a patch of scrubby sand , shared by 10 members of her family , including a 50 - day - old baby sister with a pinched face and a tin of formula milk perched on her rusting iron crib .
The baby , Haneen , is seriously underweight at only 3kg , and is not growing .
Her mother , Arfa , 40 , cannot breastfeed because she is taking medication for back problems ; the formula costs 45 shekels ( £ 7.50 ) a tin , money that the family has to borrow .
The father , too , is sick as well as unemployed .
He reaches on top of a tall fridge that dominates the tent to pull down a sheaf of x-rays showing how his leg , broken in the conflict , is pinned together with metal .
" We are civilians , we do n't belong to any faction , " he says .
" What are we guilty of so that we have to live like this ?
I spent my entire life building up my home .
In one hour everything was gone . "
Hanan does n't complain about the tent , but says " the house was better " .
She adds : " A snake came one night and bit my mother .
I can't sleep at night ; I 'm scared of the snakes and the dogs . "
Meals are cooked on a Calor gas stove ; the toilets – a hut donated by an Arab charity – are shared by all the families in the compound of tents .
" There are big queues , " says Hanan .
Winter is coming ; the tent is " freezing " , she says .
There is a community of tent families , circled round the shared lavatories .
The children play as all children do , kicking a football , wrestling , dragging sticks through the sand .
The families are doing their best in near - impossible circumstances .
Some families have even planted small gardens in the scrub : corn and a few flowers .
But Hanan – who wants to be a doctor so she can treat the sick – says she spends most of her time in the tent with her seven brothers and sisters .
Do they think they will ever go back to a proper home ?
" God knows , " says Arfa .
Overcrowding , lack of privacy and poverty are contributing to what some in Gaza call the " mental siege " .
Tensions within families are increasing , say Gaza 's mental health experts .
" Some parents themselves have depression and anxiety .
Some become more aggressive towards their children , " says Zeyada .
John Ging , director of UN operations in Gaza , puts it like this : " Parents are sitting there in their homes , very upset and very frustrated at the their situation , and that is of course having ramifications for the home environment . "
Has there been an increase in domestic violence ?
" Of course . . . children are losing respect because of the breakdown of the role - model structure .
They see their parents as incapable of providing for them , they 're seeing their parents as a failure . "
Lost childhoods
Part of the problem is the lack of release and entertainment for children .
There are few gardens or parks , no cinemas or theatres , many sports facilities have been damaged or destroyed by Israeli bombing , and one of Gaza 's great natural advantages – a 25 - mile stretch of sandy beach facing the Mediterranean – is hiding a fresh danger .
In the summer months , families flock to the beach on Fridays and Saturdays .
The sight of children splashing in the waves is cheering until one remembers that every day 20 m gallons of raw sewage is pumped into the water .
Since Gaza 's sewage processing plant was bombed after the kidnap of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit in July 2006 , there has been no alternative means of disposal .
Now , according to Save the Children , children are developing skin diseases as well as bacterial infections from swimming in polluted water .
" There are not enough safe places for children to play , " says Mona al - Shawa , head of the women 's unit at the PCHR .
To counter this , the UN organised a hugely popular " Summer Games " during the long school break , despite objections from Hamas about boys and girls mixing together .
" There were those on the political side saying kids should be going to summer camps , not doing sport and recreation , but preparing for a future life of militancy , " says Ging .
Ging says schooling has also suffered .
Thirty - two of the UN's 221 schools were damaged in the Israeli assault , plus scores more government ones .
None have been repaired because Israel does not allow construction materials into Gaza , saying they could be used to make weapons .
" So the schools , where the windows were blown out or other damage was done , have been cleaned up , made safe , and continue in operation today without the physical repairs because we have n't been allowed to bring in one pane of glass or one bag of cement since last January , " says Ging .
Israel did permit a consignment of wood into Gaza to make school desks for 8,000 children , but then blocked delivery of the steel necessary to complete them .
" Now you see three kids squashed on to a desk , " says Ging .
" How are teachers supposed to give each child the attention they need ? "
There is also a shortage of school books and pens , and what does arrive mostly has to be smuggled through underground tunnels from Egypt .
The result is children attending overcrowded schools on a double or even triple shift system that has contributed to a continuing decline in education levels .
One in five of the 200,000 pupils at the UN's 221 schools in Gaza failed basic Arabic and maths exams this year .
Engendering extremism
" It 's shocking for them but it's also alarming for us in terms of the future , " says Ging .
" The objective of the [ Israeli ] policy is to counter extremism .
Education is probably the most effective tool through which you will counter extremism , by developing a positive and well - educated mindset .
And yet we are being prevented by the policy from educating these children . "
It is , he says , " facilitating the destruction of a civilised society and , worse than that , the development of an extreme society " .
One of the starkest examples of school destruction is the American International school , Gaza 's elite fee- paying institution in Beit Lahiya , which was bombed in the early hours of the morning of 3 January .
The Israeli military claimed it was being used as a rocket - launching site .
Now , where once stood science laboratories , computer rooms , a music centre and sports fields , there is a mountain of crushed masonry , twisted metal girders , broken glass and droppings from the sheep that roam the deserted site .
To the side of what was once the main building lies a row of burned - out schoolbuses .
The odd fragment of textbook can be seen amid the rubble .
Then there is the difficulty of trying to concentrate in class when children are clawed by hunger .
Three - quarters of Gazans rely on food handouts , according to the UN .
Save the Children says it is seeing newborn babies suffering from malnutrition .
Anaemia , especially among girls , is common .
The UN has started feeding children in its schools because , says Ging , " they 're coming to school without breakfast and therefore their attention span is very short and the academic results will then reflect that " .
Food , at least , is something that is relatively easy to fix .
There are many less tangible issues that concern child experts , such as a lack of healthy role models .
" During the war , children could see that their parents could not fulfil their needs , " says Zeyada .
" They see their fathers as weak , powerless .
They see parents can't give them feelings of security , can't protect them .
So they look towards other figures .
That might be God as an absolute power – so children might go towards religion , become more fanatic .
Some identify with fighters from Hamas and other groups .
" Without hope , we are moving fast towards more aggressive children , more fanatics .
If the siege ended you would see positive changes among children .
They [ Israel ] are creating their enemies .
They are pushing a new generation of children to believe in violence as a way of solving their difficulties .
They are creating their own enemies of the future . "
In September 2007 Israel declared Gaza a " hostile entity " .
" I said at that time , and I continue to say it , that 's a self - fulfilling prophecy , " says Ging .
" You designate it as a hostile entity , you treat it as a hostile entity and in fact what happens is you generate hostility .
And that 's precisely what we have been witnessing here at the grassroots level for the last two and a half years under this illegal siege . . .
We have more extremism in Gaza every single day . "
Yet through it all , it is striking how many Palestinians cling to a belief in a better future .
For all her traumas , Ghiada has n't given up .
She attends a thrice - weekly English lesson after school to improve her chances of fulfilling her dreams .
The teacher hands Ghiada a question to answer to the class in English :
If you were a colour , what colour would you choose ?
The girl does n't hesitate .
" Red , " she tells the class .
The teacher asks the students what the colour red means to them .
Blood , suggests one ; danger , says another , both witnesses to last year 's carnage .
Ghiada considers for a moment , then replies : " It makes me happy .
It 's the colour of love . "
And what will Ghiada do with her English ?
She wants to be an airline pilot , she says .
Ironically that 's one career choice that will certainly require emigration : Gaza has no aeroplanes and the runway of its only airport was bulldozed to rubble by the Israeli army years ago .

Grant County residents are taking steps to fight any effort by members of a white supremacist group calling themselves the Aryan Nations to find a new headquarters in John Day .
On Friday , residents will gather for two town hall meetings in Canyon City , just south of John Day .
Speakers will include Coeur d'Alene , Idaho , attorneys Norman Gissell and Tony Stewart , who helped win a landmark judgment against the Church of Jesus Christ Christian - Aryan Nations in 2000 .
On Monday , 60 to 70 protesters carried signs in downtown John Day with slogans such as " One Race : Human , " " No to Aryan Nations ! " and " Say No to Hate and Violence ! "
View Larger Map
The gatherings come in the wake of a visit to John Day last week by Paul R. Mullet , who described himself as the Aryan Nations national director .
He told townspeople he was in town to look at two large downtown properties for a possible national headquarters for the group , said John Day Mayor Bob Quinton .
Mullet , of Athol , Idaho , added that Grant County , with its wide open spaces , would be an ideal setting for both a headquarters and a neo -Nazi national gathering in September 2011 .
Mullet also said he was looking for a property with enough space to train recruits , house them in a barracks , and hold gatherings .
The group would pay cash " from legal means , " he said .
Wearing a uniform shirt with a swastika patch , Mullet was accompanied by Leif Berlin , described as the group 's Washington state leader , and Grant County residents Jacob Green of Mount Vernon and Christopher Cowan of John Day , said John Day Police Chief Richard Tirico .
Quinton expressed surprise that anyone in the county would be affiliated with the hate group .
" If they 've got a presence here , it 's been pretty much under the radar , " he said .
But Grant County Undersheriff Todd McKinley said officials are n't dismissing the group 's plan .
" We are taking it seriously , " he said .
Grant County , with fewer than 8,000 residents in an area twice the size of Delaware , " would rather be known for cattle and timber and their rivers , and not be known as an area that harbors a hate group , " McKinley added .
Monday 's rally drew a broad cross section , Quinton said .
" There were grandmothers and people in their 20s and every age group in between , " he said .
" There were log trucks honking and cars honking and people waving . "
The supremacist group advocates so - called racial purity and claims that Jews and nonwhites are natural enemies of white people .
The group seeks to establish a state for the " Aryan race , " where nonwhites would be prohibited .
The group 's interest in Grant County may have been piqued by a 2002 ballot measure declaring the county a " U.N. - free " zone .
The designation has occasionally attracted outsiders with the mistaken idea that Grant County is lawless and a good spot to lie low , law enforcement officials said .
Lt. Stuart Miller of the Kootenai County Sheriff 's Office in Coeur d'Alene monitors separatist , neo -Nazi and white supremacist activities .
He said the group has been relatively inactive in the Idaho panhandle since the 2004 death of Richard Butler , the group 's longtime leader .
Butler owned a 20 - acre compound and neo -Nazi church near Hayden Lake , north of Coeur d'Alene , for many years .
He was forced to sell it in 2000 after losing a $ 6.3 million lawsuit brought by two Native Americans , a mother and son , who were shot at by Aryan Nations members .
The group 's current national leader is August B. Kreis 3rd of Lexington , S.C. , according to the group 's Web site .
The site says the group 's national headquarters will soon move to St. Cloud , Fla .
Mullet , meanwhile , and two associates were accused in August of scattering supremacist literature on lawns around Coeur d'Alene , Miller said , but charges of littering were later dismissed .
Grant County remains on guard .
" I can guarantee you we are probably not done with the issue , " said Tirico , the police chief .
" Most of the population is agreeing they will stand together on this .
I am very happy with the community on the way they handled this . "

Haiti patients ' will die ' because of US airlift halt
Hundreds of quake victims have been flown to the US for treatment US doctors in Haiti have voiced concern about the suspension of evacuation flights to America for critically injured Haitian earthquake victims .
A senior US medic told the BBC that scores of patients could die if they did not get treatment in the US soon .
The US military stopped the flights to Florida on Wednesday .
A White House spokesman told the BBC the move was due to " logistical issues " , not over medical costs as had been reported earlier .
In a separate development , Haitian officials have detained at least nine US nationals on suspicion that they tried to take more than 30 children out of the country without authorisation .
Meanwhile , the World Food Programme said it had established fixed sites for food distribution in the Haitian capital , Port au Prince , where only women would will be allowed in to collect earthquake relief supplies .
' Order from above ' Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Barth Green , a senior American doctor at a field hospital in Port - au - Prince airport , warned that the suspension of the so - called mercy flights could result in the deaths of scores of critically injured patients .
" The consequences - in the kids with crushed chests and on ventilators and respirators , and some of the adults - are they will die , " Dr Green told the BBC .
He said there were " hundreds of thousands of critically injured and severely disabled Haitians , and we 're only trying to send a few hundred to America " .
There has been no policy decision made to suspend medical evacuation flights

" It 's really a small issue , " Dr Green said .
He also said the US State Department , Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security had until now co-operated with the programme , but an " order from above " had halted the flights .
Among the patients was a five - year - old girl suffering from tetanus in a small leg wound .
She would die within a day unless evacuated , Dr David Pitcher , a medic at the institute 's temporary field hospital at Haiti 's international airport , told the Associated Press .
' Logistical hurdles '
" There has been no policy decision made to suspend medical evacuation flights .
This is an unprecedented relief effort with enormous logistical hurdles , and we are working through those in an effort to resume medical evacuation flights , " the White House spokesman said .
He stressed the flights had been halted due to " logistical reasons that have nothing to do with funding " .
The New York Times earlier quoted the US military as saying that the flights were suspended because of a dispute over whether the federal government or the state government of Florida would pay for the evacuees ' medical care .
Hundreds of patients with spinal injuries , burns and other wounds have been evacuated to the US since the 12 January quake that killed up to 200,000 people .
' Reaching saturation ' Confirming the flights had stopped , US Transportation Command spokesman Capt Kevin Aandahl said on Saturday : " Apparently , some states were unwilling to accept the entry of Haitian patients for follow - on critical care .
" We manage air evacuation missions , but without a destination to fly to we can't move anybody .
If we do n't have permission to bring them , or they wo n't take them in , we can't fly the mission .
It 's pretty simple . "
He declined to say which states did not want to accept patients .
A spokesman for Florida Governor Charlie Crist said he was not aware of any hospital in his state refusing patients .
In a letter on Tuesday to US Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius , Mr Crist asked the federal government to activate the National Disaster Medical System , which usually pays for victims ' care in domestic disasters .
He warned : " Florida 's healthcare system is quickly reaching saturation , especially in the area of high - level trauma care . "
Women - only
The Republican governor 's letter noted the system was already under strain because of the winter influx of elderly people .
Meanwhile , the UN World Food Programme said it had set up 16 distribution points in Port - au - Prince which would open on Sunday and reach many more hungry Haitians .
But only women will be allowed in to collect rations , because , the WFP says , this has proved that is the best way to get food to the people who need it .
Men will be encouraged to wait outside the distribution centres to accompany women after they have been given rations , because lone women would be more vulnerable to attack .
The WFP is also starting to hand out food coupons entitling each family to collect 25kg ( 55 lb ) of rice rations , designed to last two weeks .

Washington ( CNN ) --
The suicide bomber who killed seven CIA officials and a Jordanian military officer last week in Afghanistan was a Jordanian double - agent , a former U.S. intelligence official told CNN Monday .
The bomber was a source who came to the base camp in Khost near the Pakistan border for a meeting on December 30 , a senior U.S. official also confirmed .
The man had been used by both countries ' intelligence services in the past , and had provided information about high - value targets , the senior U.S. official said .
" Yes , it was a joint U.S. - Jordanian source who had provided over the period of his cooperation a lot of very detailed good information that was of high interest at the most senior levels of the U.S government , " the former U.S. intelligence official said .
The security breach occurred because the bomber was met off - base by U.S. intelligence officials who failed to search him before they put him in a car and drove him onto Forward Operating Base Chapman , the former intelligence official said .
Both the Jordanian and U.S. intelligence services believed the man was loyal , according to the former intelligence official .
" Clearly there is a lot of soul searching " at CIA headquarters in Virginia , according to the former intelligence official .
The bomber was identified as Human Khalil Abu-Mulal al Balawi , from the Jordanian town of Zarqa , also home to the late Abu Musab al Zarqawi , the one - time leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq , the former intelligence official said .
Both the Jordanian and U.S. intelligence agencies apparently believed al Balawi had been rehabilitated from extremist views and were using him to hunt Ayman al Zawahiri , the second - ranking al Qaeda official to Osama bin Laden , the former intelligence official said .
Jordanian intelligence services have long covertly cooperated with the United States , specifically in the hunt for al Zawahiri and bin Laden , because of the ability of Jordanian agents to blend into the al Qaeda organization , noted the former intelligence official .
Also killed in last week 's attack in Afghanistan was Jordanian Army Captain Sharif Ali bin Zeid , a cousin of King Abdullah of Jordan .
The Jordanian government has not publicly commented on the specific circumstances of bin Zeid 's death , but U.S. sources confirmed bin Zeid was present and was the Jordanian operative working closely with al Balawi .
The CIA refused to comment Monday , saying the matter was under investigation .
The bodies of the seven CIA employees were flown to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to a private ceremony attended by CIA Director Leon Panetta , other agency and national security officials , and friends and family .
A Jordanian official who did not want to be identified said bin Zeid " was killed on Wednesday in the line of duty as he was taking part in a humanitarian mission carried out by the Jordan Armed Forces in Afghanistan . "
The Jordanian official added : " Jordan 's position in the war on terror is clear ; we are fully committed to fighting al Qaeda , which is a threat to Jordan as it is a threat to the United States .
We are also committed to continuing our cooperation with the United States and the international community in the fight against terror and in defeating al Qaeda . "
In a posting on its Web site last week , the Taliban in Afghanistan claimed the bomber was an Afghan National Army soldier .
On Sunday , however , Pakistani Taliban chief Hakimullah Mehsud said in an e-mail that " we claim the responsibility for the attack on the CIA in Afghanistan . "
" The suicide bomber was a Jordanian national .
This will be admitted by the CIA and the Jordanian government " the message said .
The attack occurred at a forward operating base , which a U.S. intelligence official acknowledged was a crucial CIA post and a " hub of activity . "
The main purpose of CIA forward operating bases in Afghanistan , officials have noted , is to recruit informants and to plan and coordinate covert operations , including drone surveillance and targeting .
The attack was " a huge blow , symbolically and tactically , " because it eliminated such a large number of CIA officers , who can require years to become ingrained in the region , said Reva Bhalla , director of analysis for STRATFOR -- an international intelligence company .
In addition , the attack showed the ability of the Taliban to penetrate perhaps the most difficult of targets -- a CIA base , she said .
Former CIA official Robert Richer called it " the greatest loss of life for the Central Intelligence Agency since the Beirut Embassy bombing " in 1983 , which killed eight agents .
An American intelligence official vowed last week that the United States would avenge the attack .
Two of those killed were contractors with private security firm Xe , formerly known as Blackwater , a former intelligence official told CNN .
The CIA considers contractors to be officers .
On Sunday , a local administration official and an intelligence official told CNN that two guided missiles struck a compound in the Pakistani village of Musaki in North Waziristan suspected of being a gathering place for local and foreign militants .
The attack killed Sadiq Noor , a teacher ; his 9 - year - old son ; and three people from outside the country , according to the sources , who said the missiles were believed to have been fired by an unmanned drone .
There was no immediate U.S. confirmation of the missile attack .
SOUNDBITES —
“ Rich says that it ’s no big deal to live hiding one ’s sexual orientation .
If you ’re straight , try it for one day .
Try never mentioning your spouse , your family , your home , your girlfriend or boyfriend to anyone you know or work with – just for one day .
Take that photo off your desk at work , change the pronoun you use for your spouse to the opposite gender , guard everything you might say or do so that no one could know you ’re straight , shut the door in your office if you have a personal conversation if it might come up .
Try it .
Now imagine doing it for a lifetime .
It ’s crippling ; it warps your mind ; it destroys your self - esteem .
These men and women are voluntarily risking their lives to defend us .
And we are demanding they live lives like this in order to do so . ”
— Andrew Sullivan , responding to the National Review‘s Rich Lowry in this debate with Ana Marie Cox over serving openly in the military ( via )

The number of people confirmed dead after Chile 's earthquake has soared to 708 and is expected to rise further , President Michelle Bachelet has said .
Previously about 300 people had been reported to have been killed in Saturday 's 8.8 magnitude quake - one of the most powerful recorded .
Massive damage is hampering rescue teams as they struggle to reach those still buried in the rubble .
The Chilean government has declared a curfew in two of the worst - hit areas .
State television reported that the curfew would apply in the regions of Maule and Concepcion , and begin at 2100 local time ( midnight GMT ) .
The army is being sent to support police to prevent unrest in Concepcion .
CHILE TSUNAMI

The mayor of Concepcion city has said food is running out and police used tear gas and water cannon against looters at a supermarket on Sunday .
Rescue teams are still trying to reach dozens of people believed to be trapped in a collapsed block of flats in Concepcion .
Many Chileans in affected areas have spent the first night since the earthquake outdoors , afraid to stay inside .
Speaking to reporters on Sunday , Ms Bachelet said : " The catastrophe is enormous .
The latest number I have is 708 dead . "
She said 541 had died in Maule region , 64 in Biobio and a total of 103 in other areas .
More than 300 bodies were found in the devastated fishing village of Constitucion .
A growing number of people were listed as missing , the president added .
Ms Bachelet announced a series of emergency measures :
The Maule and Concepcion regions are being placed under special rules to speed up the delivery of aid
The air force will fly supplies to both areas and the military will take a leading role in distributing them
In Maule and Biobio basic goods will be handed out free of charge .
Distribution points are yet to be decided .
Electricity is a big concern and the government is working to guarantee distribution Officials said public transport services were slowly returning to normal .
One metro line in Santiago is now operating .
Roads are passable , although with diversions .
The airport in the capital , Santiago , has reopened , with a total of five international flight due to arrive on Sunday .
It had been closed because of damage to the terminal and control tower .
Aid offered
The epicentre of the quake was 115 km ( 70 miles ) north - east of Concepcion and 325 km south - west of Santiago .
CHILE QUAKE - DAY TWO International airport reopens Official death toll rises from 300 to more than 700 Tens of thousands forced to live outdoors because of damaged homes Police in Concepcion move to stop looters robbing shops Survivors rescued from collapsed Concepcion building , but dozens more unaccounted for Limited services resume on Santiago metro and international airport Pacific - wide tsunami alert lifted
In pictures : Day two Chileans tell of quake terror Chile well prepared Your pictures : Chile earthquake About 1.5 million homes have been damaged .
Most of the collapsed buildings were of older design - including many historic structures .
About 90 % of the historic centre of the town of Curico was destroyed .
Many roads and bridges across the affected area were damaged or destroyed .
One US risk assessor , Eqecat , put the value of the damage at between $ 15bn and $ 30 bn ( £ 9.8 bn -£ 19.6bn ) or 10 - 20 % of gross domestic product .
Responsibility for reconstruction will soon pass to President - elect Sebastian Pinera , who takes office in two weeks .
" It 's going to be a very big task and we 're going to need resources , " he said .
Chile has so far not requested foreign assistance , saying it can handle the immediate relief effort .
Foreign Minister Mariano Fernandez said Chile did not want aid offers to be " a distraction " , adding : " Any aid that arrives without having been determined to be needed really helps very little . "
Meanwhile fears of a devastating tsunami across the Pacific receded on Sunday .
About 50 Pacific countries and territories had issued tsunami alerts .
French Polynesia and Tahiti were among those hit by high waves , but no casualties have been reported .
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center on Sunday lifted its Pacific - wide alert .

Ilham Moussaid , candidate of the New Anti-Capitalist party ( NPA ) .
Photograph : Jean - Paul Pelissier / Reuters
Olivier Besancenot , the postman - turned - revolutionary at the helm of France 's anti-capitalist movement , has been fiercely criticised from all sides of the political spectrum for fielding a headscarf - wearing candidate in forthcoming elections .
Ilham Moussaid , a 21 - year - old Muslim woman who describes herself as " feminist , secular and veiled " , is running for the far - left New Anti-Capitalist party ( NPA ) in the south - eastern region of Avignon .
But , despite her insistence that there is no contradiction between her clothing and her political role , Moussaid 's candidacy in the regional vote due in March has angered other feminists and politicians .
In an echo of the controversy raised by recent moves to ban the full , face - covering veil in public places such as schools , hospitals and buses , critics have said that the young activist 's headscarf , which conceals only her hair , goes against values of laïcité – secularism – and women 's rights .
Today , in a sign of how deep concerns are running , a leading feminist group announced it would file an official complaint against the NPA 's list of candidates in the Vaucluse département to protest against what it called an " anti-secular , anti-feminist and anti-republican " stunt .
" In choosing to endorse ' open ' laïcité , the NPA is perverting the values of the Republic and suggesting we reread them in a manner which conforms with regressive visions of women , " said the Ni Putes Ni Soumises ( Neither Whores Nor Submissives ) association in a statement .
Others have expressed their shock at Besancenot 's attempt to field a candidate who sees no problem with making an overt statement about her religion in the public sphere , a practice considered taboo .
Moussaid 's candidacy has been considered all the more surprising because she is running for a party with far - left leanings traditionally seen as hostile to religion and pro-women 's rights .
Socialist MP Aurélie Filippetti advised Besancenot to " reread Marx " in order to understand why the headscarf was unacceptable .
The government is attempting to wrap up a " great debate " on national identity , which many people believe has caused Islamophobia .
It is reminiscent of the controversy in 2004 when headscarves and other conspicuous religious symbols were banned from state schools .
Moussaid , an advocate of contraception and abortion rights whose candidacy was announced last month , said she had been particularly stung by the criticism from feminist groups .
" Try as I might to explain that I am not oppressed and that it shows , there 's still a lack of understanding , " she told today 's Le Monde .
In a statement to local party members at the weekend she wrote : " It is with great sadness that I watch … my life reduced to my headscarf .
It is with great sadness that I hear that my personal beliefs are a danger to others while I advocate friendship , respect , tolerance , solidarity and equality for all human beings . "
ATLANTA ( Reuters ) - A dismal job market , a crippled real estate sector and hobbled banks will keep a lid on U.S. economic growth over the coming decade , some of the nation ’s leading economists said on Sunday .
Speaking at American Economic Association ’s mammoth yearly gathering , experts from a range of political leanings were in surprising agreement when it came to the chances for a robust and sustained expansion :
They are slim .
Many predicted U.S. gross domestic product would expand less than 2 percent per year over the next 10 years .
That stands in sharp contrast to the immediate aftermath of other steep economic downturns , which have usually elicited a growth surge in their wake .
“ It will be difficult to have a robust recovery while housing and commercial real estate are depressed , ” said Martin Feldstein , a Harvard University professor and former head of the National Bureau of Economic Research .
Housing was at the heart of the nation ’s worst recession since the 1930s , with median home values falling over 30 percent from their 2005 peaks , and even more sharply in heavily affected states like California and Nevada .
The decline has sapped a principal source of wealth for U.S. consumers , whose spending is the key driver of the country ’s growth pattern .
The steep drop in home prices has also boosted their propensity to save .
“ It ’s very hard to see what will replace it , ” said Joseph Stiglitz , Nobel laureate and professor of economics at Columbia University .
“ It ’s going to take a number of years . ”
One reason is that U.S. consumers remain heavily indebted .
Consumer credit outstanding has fallen from its mid-2008 records , but still stands at some $ 2.5 trillion , or nearly one - fifth of total yearly spending in the U.S. economy .
Another is that many of the country ’s largest banks are still largely dependent on funding from the U.S. Federal Reserve and the implicit backing of the Treasury Department .
Kenneth Rogoff , also of Harvard , argued that if the U.S. government ever “ credibly ” pulled away from its backing of the financial system , then a renewed collapse would likely ensue .
He cited government programs giving large financial institutions access to zero - cost borrowing as artificially padding their bottom lines .
“ There ’s something of an illusion of profitability , ” he said .
Researchers from Stony Brook University Medical Center in New York have confirmed that Homo floresiensis is a genuine ancient human species and not a descendant of healthy humans dwarfed by disease .
Using statistical analysis on skeletal remains of a well - preserved female specimen , researchers determined the " hobbit " to be a distinct species and not a genetically flawed version of modern humans .
Details of the study appear in the December issue of Significance , the magazine of the Royal Statistical Society , published by Wiley - Blackwell .
In 2003 Australian and Indonesian scientists discovered small - bodied , small - brained , hominin ( human - like ) fossils on the remote island of Flores in the Indonesian archipelago .
This discovery of a new human species called Homo floresiensis has spawned much debate with some researchers claiming that the small creatures are really modern humans whose tiny head and brain are the result of a medical condition called microcephaly .
Researchers William Jungers , Ph.D. , and Karen Baab , Ph.D. studied the skeletal remains of a female ( LB1 ) , nicknamed " Little Lady of Flores " or " Flo " to confirm the evolutionary path of the hobbit species .
The specimen was remarkably complete and included skull , jaw , arms , legs , hands , and feet that provided researchers with integrated information from an individual fossil .
The cranial capacity of LB1 was just over 400 cm , making it more similar to the brains of a chimpanzee or bipedal " ape- men " of East and South Africa .
The skull and jawbone features are much more primitive looking than any normal modern human .
Statistical analysis of skull shapes show modern humans cluster together in one group , microcephalic humans in another and the hobbit along with ancient hominins in a third .
Due to the relative completeness of fossil remains for LB1 , the scientists were able to reconstruct a reliable body design that was unlike any modern human .
The thigh bone and shin bone of LB1 are much shorter than modern humans including Central African pygmies , South African KhoeSan ( formerly known as ' bushmen " ) and " negrito " pygmies from the Andaman Islands and the Philippines .
Some researchers speculate this could represent an evolutionary reversal correlated with " island dwarfing . "
" It is difficult to believe an evolutionary change would lead to less economical movement , " said Dr. Jungers .
" It makes little sense that this species re-evolved shorter thighs and legs because long hind limbs improve bipedal walking .
We suspect that these are primitive retentions instead . "
Further analysis of the remains using a regression equation developed by Dr. Jungers indicates that LB1 was approximately 106 cm tall ( 3 feet , 6 inches ) -- far smaller than the modern pygmies whose adults grow to less than 150 cm ( 4 feet , 11 inches ) .
A scatterplot depicts LB1 far outside the range of Southeast Asian and African pygmies in both absolute height and body mass indices .
" Attempts to dismiss the hobbits as pathological people have failed repeatedly because the medical diagnoses of dwarfing syndromes and microcephaly bear no resemblance to the unique anatomy of Homo floresiensis , " noted Dr. Baab .

WARSAW - A frightened , shivering dog was rescued after floating 75 miles on an ice floe down Poland ’s Vistula River and into the Baltic Sea , officials said yesterday .
Now his saviors have to figure out who really owns him .
Four people have tried to claim him , but rescuers say there has been no wagging tail of joy from the miracle dog they nicknamed “ Baltic . ’’
The dog ’s frozen odyssey occurred as Poland suffers through a winter cold snap , with temperatures dipping to minus 4 degrees .
The thick - furred male dog was found adrift Monday 15 miles out in the Baltic Sea by the crew of the Baltica , a Polish ship of ocean scientists carrying out research .
Researcher Natalia Drgas said yesterday that the rescue was difficult .
“ It was really a tough struggle .
It kept slipping into the water and crawling back on top of the ice .
At one point it vanished underwater , under the ship , and we thought it was the end .
But it emerged again and crawled on an ice sheet , ’’ Drgas said .
At that point , the crew lowered a pontoon to the water , and a crew member grabbed the dog .
A firefighter in Grudziadz , on the Vistula river 60 miles inland from the Bay of Gdansk , said the dog was spotted Saturday .
Firefighters tried to save him , but could not because the ice sheets were shifting , said the firefighter .

A wisp of a galaxy : NASA 's Spitzer Space Telescope captured what NASA said was an action - packed picture of the nearby Small Magellanic Cloud , a small galaxy that looks like a wispy cloud when seen from Earth .
NASA is interested in the Small Magellanic Cloud not only because it is so close and compact , but also because it is very similar to young galaxies thought to populate the universe billions of years ago .
The Small Magellanic Cloud has only one - fifth the amount of heavier elements , such as carbon , contained in the Milky Way , which means that its stars have n't been around long enough to pump large amounts of these elements back into their environment .
Such elements were necessary for life to form in our solar system , NASA stated .
BioWare 's Casey Hudson , the project director for Mass Effect 2 , acknowledged a " tremendous amount of interest " from Hollywood in a Mass Effect film but vows such a movie , if done , will be done right or not at all .

" Obviously we have a tremendous amount of interest from people in Hollywood to make a major motion picture about ' Mass Effect , ' " Hudson told the MTV Movies Blog .
" The most important thing for us is , we do n't just want to see a movie get made .
We want to see a great movie get made , if it 's going to get done at all . "
Way back in the middle of 2008 , Avi Arad , best known for several successful ( and some less so ) comic - book adaptations , optioned the rights to a Mass Effect film .
But there has been no news of such a project since then .
This may be deliberate .
Hudson 's comments make it apparent that BioWare is n't in a hurry and wants to be sure the film has a story worthy of this franchise .

EXCLUSIVE : There 's ' A Tremendous Amount Of Interest ' In Developing A ' Mass Effect ' Film [ MTV Movies Blog ]
If you are a baby boomer , you are not a stranger to the popular Marvel Comics fictional character , Incredible Hulk .
But for those who just existed a decade ago , here is a brief history of the character …
Incredible Hulk was a creation from combining Jekyll and Hyde with Frankenstein , who was really good but nobody knew it .
He was also somebody who could change from a normal man into a monster , and lo , a legend was born .
He was the good guy .
He did n’t want to hurt anybody .
And from there , Chrisco was inspired to create his own monster Nike Dunk Low using colors that best describe Incredible Hulk .
When Hulk gets mad , he turns into this huge scary creature with the skin of Green , which is now the shoe ’s toe and midfoot .
And upon turning into a monster , his Purple pants are ripped off , which is now the shoe ’s mudguard and heel in raveling edges .
With the earthquake - inspired midsole , Chrisco made a perfect association of the latter to Incredible Hulk .
Additional feature is seen on the tongue with the embroidered “ COMICS ” label and a Green “ HULK ” embroidery on the heel .
Black Swoosh was used to accentuate the strongly - colored upper .
Whether you are a fan of this character from the 60s or not , this Nike Dunk Low is an exceptional design that everyone would want to collect .

To make sense of the earthquake , the eighth - grade science class analyzed plate tectonics , used computer animation to simulate tremors of different magnitudes , and browsed satellite images to zero in on their family villages in Haiti .
Down the hall , a kindergarten teacher took a lower - tech approach : piling Legos on two cardboard squares and bumping them together until the toy buildings crashed down .
In the fourth grade , a skinny , bright - eyed boy , dressed up for his first day back at his old school in a sweater - vest , tie and jeweled cross , needed no simulation to visualize the catastrophe .
Joshua Joseph , 10 , was playing Twister at his aunt ’s house in Port - au - Prince when the world shook , sending him on an odyssey — sleeping outside , riding through streets that reeked of corpses , flying on an Air Force plane — that brought him back to SS .

Last week ’s earthquake has devastated Haiti , and prompted a massive relief effort .

Formula 1 teams are closing in on a move to ban double diffusers in a bid to cut downforce and slow the cars down from the start of the 2011 season , AUTOSPORT can reveal .
The introduction of double diffusers into F1 caused huge controversy at the start of last season , when rivals protested the concept that was used to great effect by Brawn GP , Williams and Toyota in the opening races of the campaign .
The matter eventually went to the FIA International Court of Appeal , where the double diffuser was deemed fully legal and other teams had to revise the rear end of their cars to make the most of the extra downforce the design produced .
However , with downforce and car speeds having increased since then - and the diffuser designs getting increasingly more complicated - sources have revealed that moves are now afoot to change the F1 regulations to outlaw them completely .
On the back of predictions that the downforce levels of cars will this season potentially go beyond what they were at the end of 2008 , teams have decided to take action .
AUTOSPORT understands that technical chiefs discussed reducing downforce levels in a meeting of FOTA 's Technical Regulations Working Group ( TRWG ) late last year , and agreed that the rules should be changed to effectively outlaw double diffusers .
The teams want to create regulations that require the floor to be a continuous section if taken through a longitudinal or lateral plane - which if achieved will get rid of the ' slots ' in the floor that have made the double diffuser concept work .
It is understood that efforts are now being made to sort out the wording of the regulations to ensure that there are no loopholes that will allow anyone to continue using a double diffuser .
Once the wording of the rules has been sorted , it will then be put to the FIA 's official Technical Working Group for ratification prior to going through the channels required for it to get put into the 2011 regulations .
It is estimated that the reduction in downforce caused by the double diffuser ban would result in the cars being slowed by around one second per lap .
Lotus ' chief technical officer Mike Gascoyne confirmed to AUTOSPORT that the move was being made , and it was one he supported .
" I think it is exactly right , " he said .
" It is what we should do , and it is what both FOTA and the FIA are looking at for 2011 .
I think it is very sensible and very easy to do - just tighten up the regulations and it is done . "
Gascoyne did not believe that the double diffuser ban would have that big an impact in terms of helping overtaking , though .
When asked if he felt the widespread use of double diffusers in F1 had hindered overtaking , Gascoyne said : " I do n't think there was a reduction in overtaking , but the changes to improve overtaking did n't help .
And in fact , if you look at the numbers , it was never going to .
" But if you look at it carefully , what the [ F1 teams ' ] aero group set out to achieve it actually did , and if you take the diffuser away it will do exactly what it said on the tin .
Unfortunately that will never help you overtake anyone . "
Although the majority of teams support the move , some outfits are unhappy about the double diffuser ban because it will mean an expensive redesign of the entire rear end of the car , including the gearbox and rear suspension , for 2011 .
Welfare and Social Services Minister Isaac Herzog has ordered officials to look into the possibility of adopting dozens of orphaned Haitian children .
In a conversation with Ynet , Herzog said : " The orphaned children in Haiti are a grave humanitarian issue .
I ordered an examination into the possibility of adopting orphans in Israel in line with international and Israeli law , in order to offer help in the face of this terrible distress . "
Haiti Disaster Haiti to cease quake rescue ops Noam Barkan Haitian government says it intends to cease survivor recovery operations in devastated Port - au - Prince .

The Welfare Ministry will be forming a team to look into the issue vis-à - vis the Foreign Ministry within a few days .
Minister Herzog has been in touch with all relevant parties over the weekend and ordered officials to prepare for an adoption operation .
The minister 's decision was prompted , among other things , by numerous inquires from childless couples seeking to adopt orphans .
" We will work vis -à - vis authorities in Haiti in order to determine the number of children to be adopted , " Herzog said .
" We will do it through full cooperation with UNICEF , after the organization issued a warning this past week regarding abduction of children . "
" We wo n't act rashly , but rather , in a level - headed manner , so that this process will indeed help the children and offer even a little comfort in terrible human distress encountered by Haiti 's residents in the wake of the major earthquake , " the minister said .
The Welfare Ministry now plans to authorize non-profit organizations that are already active on the adoption front to proceed with the adoption process .

Finally , a little reality from the press .
ICE is expanding in much of Antarctica , contrary to the widespread public belief that global warming is melting the continental ice cap .
The results of ice - core drilling and sea ice monitoring indicate there is no large - scale melting of ice over most of Antarctica , although experts are concerned at ice losses on the continent ’s western coast .
Antarctica has 90 per cent of the Earth ’s ice and 80 per cent of its fresh water , The Australian reports .
Extensive melting of Antarctic ice sheets would be required to raise sea levels substantially , and ice is melting in parts of west Antarctica .
The destabilisation of the Wilkins ice shelf generated international headlines this month .
However , the picture is very different in east Antarctica , which includes the territory claimed by Australia .
East Antarctica is four times the size of west Antarctica and parts of it are cooling .
The Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research report prepared for last week ’s meeting of Antarctic Treaty nations in Washington noted the South Pole had shown “ significant cooling in recent decades ” .
Let ’s take a quick peak at the Steig Reconstruction again .
Note the complete lack of cooling at the south pole in the first RegEM plot .
This plot is my best effort at reconstructing his conclusions and was presented here :
Steig AVHRR Reconstruction from Satellite Data
And if you ’ll all indulge me a bit second longer , this is what I said :
I ’ll say it now for the first time .
In my opinion the paper is flawed and has an exaggerated warming trend due to bad mathematics .
Temperature distributions on the continent are a result of artifacts in RegEM and not supported by the natural weather patterns as they were presented .
As an example which is pretty clear .
Steig ’s paper shows warming across the entire Antarctic .
Here ’s a plot of the ground data at the south pole .
A reconstruction cannot ignore a trend this strong .
So TCO , it is n’t up to me .
As Gavin likes to say , the data is the data .
This data just cannot support Steig ’s conclusions .
I did n’t even require peer review .
Well to continue with the article , apparently there is a paper confirming what my readers already know , Antarctic Ice is increasing .
Australian Antarctic Division glaciology program head Ian Allison said sea ice losses in west Antarctica over the past 30 years had been more than offset by increases in the Ross Sea region , just one sector of east Antarctica .
“ Sea ice conditions have remained stable in Antarctica generally , ” Dr Allison said .
The melting of sea ice – fast ice and pack ice – does not cause sea levels to rise because the ice is in the water .
Sea levels may rise with losses from freshwater ice sheets on the polar caps .
In Antarctica , these losses are in the form of icebergs calved from ice shelves formed by glacial movements on the mainland .
Last week , federal Environment Minister Peter Garrett said experts predicted sea level rises of up to 6 m from Antarctic melting by 2100 , but the worst case scenario foreshadowed by the SCAR report was a 1.25 m rise .
Mr Garrett insisted global warming was causing ice losses throughout Antarctica .
“ I do n’t think there ’s any doubt it is contributing to what we ’ve seen both on the Wilkins shelf and more generally in Antarctica , ” he said .
Dr Allison said there was not any evidence of significant change in the mass of ice shelves in east Antarctica nor any indication that its ice cap was melting .
“ The only significant calvings in Antarctica have been in the west , ” he said .
And he cautioned that calvings of the magnitude seen recently in west Antarctica might not be unusual .
A paper to be published soon by the British Antarctic Survey in the journal Geophysical Research Letters is expected to confirm that over the past 30 years , the area of sea ice around the continent has expanded .
Finally a little bit of sanity on the eve of the political tipping point .
So you ’ve ended up in the microservice swamp , or somewhere else where you need to deal with a zoo full of fractious , opinionated , distributed systems .
Now you ’ve found out that there ’s a set of common things many of your services need to have a shared understanding about , but do n’t .
You also prefer to retain even a bit of your dwindling sanity until the project is over .
What to do ?
This post is an attempt to distill into a digestible format the experiences I and my team have had during the last few years building a distributed system around centralized schema management ( I ’m going to just say CSM from here on . )
I ’m not entirely sure we were that sane to begin with , but at least the loss in cognitive coherency has been manageable .
Your mileage may vary , caveat emptor , etc .
Centralized schema , in its most simplified form , means that you have a common authority who can tell every other part of your system ( service , API , lambda function , database , etc. ) what kinds of objects or data structures your system contains .
It ’s the responsibility of each service to determine what to do with that information — the assumption being , however , that whenever a service needs to communicate with other services ( or the outside world ) about a Thing it should use the authority - provided definition of that Thing .
Systems that need to work with a large set of various kinds of data objects across multiple services are the prime candidates to benefit from centralized schema management .
Many do n’t , and since CSM means giving up a portion of the flexibility service - oriented architectures ( whether micro , midi or macro ) bring , it ’s not a good fit for every system .
In our case we have a system that is supposed to manage all the assets of the Finnish national road network .
Assets in this case meaning the roads themselves ( surface material , how many lanes , … ) , and anything related to them such as traffic signs , surface markings , fences , off - ramps , service areas , various measurements , and so on .
Altogether that adds up to roughly a hundred different types of assets .
Each of them needs to be imported , stored , validated , exported to interested parties via some API , returned as search results , drawn on a map … you get the idea .
Why centralize schema if everything else is distributed ?
The common wisdom around microservices is that everything needs to be decentralized .
That ’s how you ’re supposed to reap their benefits .
Unfortunately , that wisdom tends to slink away ( looking slightly guilty as it goes , with those benefits in its pocket ) whenever you need to have more than two of your services talk about something , because it ’s a lot of work to keep all parties in agreement on what they ’re talking about .
CSM is a tool and architectural pattern to manage that problem .
It forces all parties interested in a given kind of data to use a standard definition of it — what properties the data has , what ’s the set of allowed values for each property , which ones are mandatory , and so forth .
This is normally not optimal from the viewpoint of any particular service , since depending on how they ’re built they usually have a richer set of tools available than the smallest common denominator an external schema represents .
For example , a TypeScript - based service would rather use its own type system for defining objects , and a relational schema defined in SQL in the fourth normal form is a thing of beauty compared to any JSON schema document .
For systems that have just a few kinds of data , or just a few different services that deal with it , the tradeoff is likely not worthwhile .
But when you have a dozen services that all need to be able to process some or all of the set of 100 data types , implementing CSM is the only way to stave off the impending madness .
Even if that results in all of your services having to submit to a jackbooted overlord who controls what they may or may not say in public .
( Please do not try to extrapolate this into anything human - related . )
A portrait of a CSM in three acts
The MVP
To be of any use , a CSM implementation , whether homebrew or off - the - shelf , needs to include at least the following :
Some way to distribute schemas in a format or formats that are understood by all parts of the system .
Your options format - wise include JSON Schema , Apache Avro , Protobuf schemas , and the comedy options of XML Schema or RELAX - NG .
( Not going to link to those two . )
Ideally you define your schema just once , and distribute it in multiple formats .
If you have , or suspect you ’ll have in the future any external APIs , then your selection narrows .
There are not many formats that are widely accepted , and JSON Schema is probably the least problematic option .
in a format or formats that are understood by all parts of the system .
For each of your services , a means of consuming ( using ) the schema .
Having multiple formats available makes it easier to find a good consumer or validator .
It ’s a nice bonus if your consumer can process the schema into something native for your under - the - hood implementation .
This includes F# type providers , Clojure spec or Plumatic schema , or even just plain old Java code generators .
( Let ’s not mention JAXB . )
If you can do this runtime , that ’s even better .
But you can often get by with compile - time consumption .
At a minimum , your consumer must be able to tell you if a data structure is valid or not in the context of a schema .
If it can also do coercion of almost valid data into completely valid data , like parsing an ISO8601 string into a DateTime object , that ’s good .
.
Having multiple formats available makes it easier to find a good consumer or validator .
Schema distribution to consumers can be done during compilation or packaging , but it ’s more microservicey if you have a schema registry service .
It can just be nginx serving static files , in a pinch .
We ’re not in MVP land anymore
The above is fine for a workshop demo .
However , it ’s likely your system will need something a bit more advanced to survive in the wild .
To upgrade your CSM from the “ Home Edition ” into “ Professional ” , you ’ll probably need these :
Support for schema evolution .
Schemas are like war plans , they never survive enemy contact .
You need to prepare for this by having a way to handle changes to your schemas without the need to rebuild everything and breaking all your external APIs .
But what to do if you end up with an object of version 1 , and you need to upgrade it into version 3 ?
Or the reverse ?
Transform is what you do .
Your CSM system can help by providing transformation services , or supplying transformation instructions alongside your schemas .
To do this efficiently and in a way compatible with as many languages and platforms as possible is difficult , though .
More on this later on .
. Schemas are like war plans , they never survive enemy contact .
You need to prepare for this by having a way to handle changes to your schemas without the need to rebuild everything and breaking all your external APIs .
Support for schema composition .
If you need CSM to begin with , then your data types probably have things in common between them .
You ’ll want to be able to compose your schemas from components .
It ’s boring and error - prone to copy - paste the same list of create - time , created - by , modify - time and modified - by properties to every schema .
I do n’t need to mention this complicates evolution and transformation somewhat , do I ?
You could also consider deriving schemas from other schemas , but that smells like OOP - style inheritance and we do n’t do that .

Enumerations as first - class citizens .
Real - world systems always have various lists of enumeration - type values that evolve over time .
You need to be able to apply the same tools to them as the rest of your schemas : evolution , transformation , etc .

Nah , man .
I ’m pretty friggin ’ far from MVP
In for a penny , in for a pound ?
Why not go for the whole hog ?
Since you ’re already committed , why leave money on the table by not extracting some more value from your fancy bespoke CSM ?
To evolve your CSM into its final form you could …
Embed business logic into your schemas .
If your CSM supports arbitrary metadata you can include things such as UX rendering instructions alongside your property definitions .
This opens up the rabbit hole of dynamically constructing forms and other UX layouts purely based on your schema .
Do n’t say I did n’t warn you .
Other possibilities include having things like embedded Elasticsearch mappings ( for the special cases where you ca n’t generate them automatically from your schema , of course . )
If your CSM supports arbitrary metadata you can include things such as UX rendering instructions alongside your property definitions .
Allow runtime end - user modifications to your schemas ( probably just administrators , but still . )
If the previous item was a rabbit hole , then this is a portal to the netherworld .
All of your services would need to be capable of runtime schema reloading for this to work .
This will quickly veer into “ if all you have is a hammer ” territory so let ’s stop here .
Are there existing options ?
Yes .
There are things like Confluent Schema Registry which provides tight integration with Apache Kafka but also works with anything else that can consume JSON Schema , Avro or Protobuf .
I do n’t have any hands - on experience with it , but looks like it provides most , but not all of the functionality described above .
In any case , we rolled our own because we could not find anything fitting our requirements .
Besides , this post is already too long to include a market survey .
How we did it ( and why )
As I said above , in our project ( Velho , for the Finnish Transport Infrastructure Agency ) we ended up creating our own , custom centralized schema management solution .
This was due to several reasons :
Our project has to produce a long - lived system , and our architectural solution to that was a “ midi- service ” ( i.e. less granular than micro , but definitely not a monolith ) approach .
So we would have a moderately large amount of independent services , each with their own responsibility of data storage etc .
To allow for a ship of Theseus - type evolution path for the entire system , our internal architecture would explicitly and consistently support a polyglot implementation .
This means every service chooses its own tech stack , and disallows the use of any integration technologies specific to any single language or platform .
To keep ourselves honest we dogfood , i.e. consume internally the same protocols and APIs we provide externally .
The number of data types our system needs to manage is around 100 , of varying complexity , each with their own properties and quirks .
They ’re split into multiple collections and each collection is managed by a different service .
The above made the need for a CSM evident early on .
The existing options did not feel suitable .
Granted , we did n’t do any really comprehensive market research .
So sue me .
Our stack
AWS native .
Containerized with AWS Fargate , FaaS with AWS Lambda .
Multiple independent SQL databases ( Aurora PostgreSQL ) .
Elasticsearch .
Redis .
S3 . AWS API Gateway .
Infrastructure - as - Code via CloudFormation .
Languages : Clojure backend services .
ClojureScript frontend with Reagent , Re-frame and Web Components .
Lambdas in Clojure , Python and Javascript .
What we use CSM for
We validate incoming data ( APIs , import jobs , etc ) using CSM - provided schemas .
Inbound data using old schema versions is supported , and we automatically transform it into the latest version when needed .
We use Elasticsearch to provide advanced search capabilities , and generate ES indexes automatically based on our schemas , with custom mappings embedded in the schema metadata
When we read data from our own storage , we validate and ( if needed ) upgrade its schema version .
This allows us to not bother with updating our data in storage whenever our schemas change — we have multiple kinds of storage backends , not all of which support easy in - place updates .
We provide schema definitions for our external partners in OpenAPI format
We provide a “ data catalog ” user interface for our end -users , which includes human - friendly descriptions of the various data types we manage
We construct various UX views into our data dynamically based on our schemas .
This includes … schematic views of the road network a search builder allowing the end - user to graphically construct a complex query into our data in the future we ’ll provide asset view and update forms generated from our schema
Get to the point already
It ’s written in Clojure like most of our project and deployed as a Docker container .
The schemas themselves are written as EDN files , which are more - or - less equivalent to JSON or YAML files , but with added Clojureness ( including the ability to embed code ) .
Each of the schema definitions contains the complete description of a single asset type , including
All of its versions from the beginnings of time until the current day .
Versions are identified by monotonically increasing numbers ( 1,2,3,5 … )
from the beginnings of time until the current day .
Versions are identified by monotonically increasing numbers ( 1,2,3,5 … ) Transformations from one version into the next .
We only support forward transformations ( i.e. increasing versions ) .
A gap in version numbering indicates that an automatic transformation would not be possible .

Collections including lists and sets are supported , as are nested objects .
We are limited mainly by what ’s possible to express in JSON Schema .
The properties are defined using a notation based on Metosin ’s Data Spec .

We are limited mainly by what ’s possible to express in JSON Schema .
The properties are defined using a notation based on Metosin ’s Data Spec .
Arbitrary metadata for the asset and all its properties .
This includes human - readable names , Elasticsearch mappings and anything else we ’ll come up with .
We also use metadata for routing : each asset defines which of our services “ owns ” it and thus requests for it can be routed to the correct service .
Here ’s a sanitized , redacted and translated example of the schemas for Fence , which is part of the Road Furniture namespace ( and therefore owned by the furniture - registry service ) .
There are two schema versions , a transformation from v1 to v2 , and some metadata .
The schemas refer to two generic components ( the velho / import directive ) which include properties defined elsewhere , and there ’s a property whose type is an enum schema ( velho / enum ) .
{ :latest-version 2 :versions { 1 ( velho / import [ : general / basic - props :location/linear - location ] { : properties { : code string ?
( ds / opt : material ) ( velho / enum : furniture / material ) : type ( velho / enum : furniture / type ) : size ( ds / maybe pos-int ? ) }} ) 2 ( velho / import [ : general / basic - props :location/linear - location ] { : properties { : code string ?
( ds / opt : material ) ( velho / enum : furniture / material ) : type ( velho / enum : furniture / type ) : height ( ds / maybe pos-int ?
) }} ) } : transforms { 1 " $ merge ( [ $ , {' properties ' : $ merge ( [ $ sift ( $ , function ( $v , $ k ) {$k != ' size '} ) , {'height ' : $.' size '} ] ) , ' version ' : 2} ] ) " } : metadata { :oid-prefix " 1.2.246.578.5.100 " : owner - service : furniture - registry : indexing true : name " Fence " : fields { : properties { :_metadata { : name " Properties " : indexing true } : code { : _metadata { : name " Code " : index true }} : material { : _metadata { : name " Material " : index true }} : type { : _metadata { : name " Fence type " : index true }} : height { : _metadata { : name " Fence height " : index true }}}}}}
We do n’t serve these EDNs outside our schema registry service .
EDN is a Clojure - specific format , therefore it ’s an implementation detail , and we want to punish everyone equivalently .
Our schemas are transformed into an OpenAPI 3 definition ( which is an extension of JSON Schema ) and served via a REST API .
OpenAPI does not directly support all of our features ( e.g. transforms and metadata ) so we use extensions for them .
The resulting definition is still completely valid OpenAPI , and third parties would just ignore the more esoteric stuff .
Eat it up
Currently we consume our schemas only from Clojure or ClojureScript code .
We do this by …
Fetching the OpenAPI definition via our REST API Translating it back into the same EDN format as seen above
At this stage we also extract our custom stuff from the OAS extensions .
Processing our custom extensions ( import and enum )
Feeding the processed and evaluated schemas to Data Spec , which … … ends up registering the schemas as Clojure specs .
The resulting specs are then used in our code , both backend and frontend , in the usual Clojure / CLJS fashion to validate and coerce incoming data .
It ’s not a coincidence that our “ native ” data format is so close to Data Spec already .
Hooray for dynamic languages and runtime eval .
Yes , we do runtime consumption of schemas and our services ( both frontend and backend ) can handle schemas that change on - the - fly .
About those transforms …
More than meets the eye , is n’t it ?
As I alluded to somewhere above , transformations between schema versions are an issue , primarily because we can’t really define them in a language / platform - independent way .
( Unless we go full XML Schema in which case XSLT would work .
But we do n’t want to .
Never go full XML . )
Fortunately we have a good - enough solution in JSONata which is an expression language for querying and transforming JSON - like data .
It has implementations for Java , JavaScript , Python and .NET ( at least ) , covering the common platforms nicely .
It must be said that JSONata is far from perfect .
The various implementations differ in the set of features they support , and this is not really documented anywhere .
In the example above , the JSONata transform takes a version 1 object , adds a key properties .
height which is set to the value of the properties .
size key , and removes the now - unnecessary size .
It additionally sets the version property to equal 2 , as is good and correct for a version 2 object .
The version property itself is imported from the general / basic - props component schema alongside many other properties , so it is not visible in the example .
An astute reader would at this point remember that JSON Schema and OpenAPI do not have support for these kinds of transformations .
That ’s entirely correct — we have custom consumer - side code to run them , and we deliver the transformations via OpenAPI extensions .
Our consumers so far have been solely Clojure or ClojureScript - based , so we only have client code for browsers ( JSONata / JS used from ClojureScript ) and the JVM ( JSONata / Java via interop from Clojure ) .
Can I play with your toys ?
Hopefully yes , in the near future !
We ’d like very much to open - source our CSM implementation but there are a few bureaucratic hurdles to overcome yet ( and it needs some cleanup ) .
Final words
To summarize :
Centralized schema management is necessary when you have a distributed system with many data types handled by many services .
There are a lot of decisions you need to make when implementing CSM related to formats , schema evolution , transformations etc .
Planning for the future is haram in the Agile methodology , but in this case you might want to make an exception , since CSM tends to infiltrate all parts of your system whether you want it to or not .
Properly done CSM makes microservice architecture slightly more manageable .
You can throw together a bespoke CSM if you need to and be pretty happy in the end .
I know this because we did it .
We ended up implementing quite a lot of advanced features , including schema evolution with embedded transformations , runtime schema loading , etc .
This post took a long time to write .
I ’ve attempted to be not entirely boring , and I hope you got something useful out of it .

The things described in this post are a result of a lot of teamwork .
While I might have written the largest number of lines ( easy enough when you end up throwing away the entire first implementation ! ) the good stuff would n’t have been possible without the rest of the Velho team .

PRINCETON , NJ --
More than one - third of Americans ( 36 % ) have a positive image of " socialism , " while 58 % have a negative image .
Views differ by party and ideology , with a majority of Democrats and liberals saying they have a positive view of socialism , compared to a minority of Republicans and conservatives .
" Democrats and Republicans agree in their ratings of several of the terms , but differ significantly in their ratings of others -- in particular , capitalism , the federal government , and socialism . "
" Socialism " was one of seven terms included in a Jan. 26 - 27 Gallup poll .
Americans were asked to indicate whether their top - of - mind reactions to each were positive or negative .
Respondents were not given explanations or descriptions of the terms .
Americans are almost uniformly positive in their reactions to three terms : small business , free enterprise , and entrepreneurs .
They are divided on big business and the federal government , with roughly as many Americans saying their view is positive as say it is negative .
Americans are more positive than negative on capitalism ( 61 % versus 33 % ) and more negative than positive on socialism ( 36 % to 58 % ) .
Democrats and Republicans agree in their ratings of several of the terms , but differ significantly in their ratings of others -- in particular , capitalism , the federal government , and socialism .
In similar fashion , there is little distinction across ideological groups -- conservatives , moderates , and liberals -- in the ratings of several of these terms , but more significant differences in response to others , such as big business , the federal government , and socialism .
These differences will be discussed in the sections that follow .
Socialism
Socialism had the lowest percentage positive rating and the highest negative rating of any term tested .
Still , more than a third of Americans say they have a positive image of socialism .
Exactly how Americans define " socialism " or what exactly they think of when they hear the word is not known .
The research simply measures Americans ' reactions when a survey interviewer reads the word to them -- an exercise that helps shed light on connotations associated with this frequently used term .
There are significant differences in reactions to " socialism " across ideological and partisan groups :
A majority of 53 % of Democrats have a positive image of socialism , compared to 17 % of Republicans .
Sixty - one percent of liberals say their image of socialism is positive , compared to 39 % of moderates and 20 % of conservatives .
Capitalism
" Capitalism , " the word typically used to describe the United States ' prevailing economic system , generates positive ratings from a majority of Americans , with a third saying their reaction is negative .
As was the case with " socialism , " there are differences across population segments .
Republicans are significantly more positive than Democrats in their reactions to " capitalism , " although majorities of both groups have favorable opinions .
Opinions of the word by ideology are divided in an unusual , though modest , way .
Conservatives have the highest positive image , followed by liberals .
Moderates have somewhat lower positive ratings than either of these groups .
One might expect those with negative attitudes toward capitalism to be more likely than others to have positive attitudes toward socialism .
That is indeed the case , but the difference in positive attitudes toward socialism between those with positive and those with negative attitudes toward capitalism is fairly modest : 33 % vs. 43 % , respectively .
Free Enterprise
Eighty - six percent of respondents rated the term " free enterprise " positively , giving it substantially more positive ratings than " capitalism . "
Although in theory these two concepts are not precisely the same , they are in many ways functional equivalents .
Yet , underscoring the conventional wisdom that words matter , the public clearly reacts differently to the two terms .
Free enterprise as a concept rings more positively to the average American than does the term capitalism .
Strongly positive ratings of free enterprise are generally uniform across both partisan groups , and across the three ideological groups .
Small Business and Big Business
" Small business " is the most positively rated term of the seven included in the list , with a nearly universal positive rating of 95 % .
In contrast , Americans were sharply divided when asked to react to the term " big business , " with 49 % of respondents rating the term positively and 49 % negatively .
This contrast in images , based on whether the adjective " small " or " big " is placed in front of " business , " confirms a number of previous Gallup findings .
Americans have a strong tendency to react positively to " small " and negatively to " big " when it describes business entities .
There is remarkably little difference between Republicans and Democrats in their ratings of the images of small and big business .
Both partisan groups are overwhelmingly positive about the former , and roughly half of both partisan groups rate the latter positively .
The finding that Democrats and Republicans have roughly equal reactions to big business is significant given the usual assumption that Republicans are more sympathetic to large businesses and corporations than are Democrats .
These data do not confirm that hypothesis at the rank - and - file level .
All three ideological groups rate small business very positively .
Big business is rated positively by 57 % of conservatives .
Less than half of both moderates ( 46 % ) and liberals ( 38 % ) have positive images of big business .
Entrepreneurs
Because " entrepreneurs " are usually by definition associated with start - ups of small businesses , it is not unexpected to find that the term generates nearly the same level of positive reaction as did the term small business .
And , as was the case for small business , there is little distinction in ratings of entrepreneurs across partisan or ideological groups .
The Federal Government
Americans ' reactions to the term " the federal government " are similar to those for " big business , " with about half rating the term positively and half negatively .
However , while there are only minimal partisan differences in reactions to " big business , " there are substantial differences in reactions to the federal government , which may reflect the current partisan control of the White House and Congress .
Democrats are much more positive about the federal government than are Republicans .
Liberals are over twice as likely as conservatives to have a positive image of the federal government , with reactions of moderates in between those of these two groups .
Bottom Line
As most politicians and many in business have learned , the choice of words to describe a concept or a policy can often make a substantial difference in the public 's reaction .
The current research confirms that assumption .
" Socialism " is not a completely negative term in today 's America .
About a third of Americans respond positively when they hear the term .
Some of this reaction may reflect unusual or unclear understandings of what socialism means .
Reaction to the term is not random , however , as attested by the finding that positive images are significantly differentiated by politics and ideology .
It is apparent that " free enterprise " evokes more positive responses than " capitalism , " despite the apparent similarity between the two terms .
President Barack Obama made frequent positive references to small business in his recent State of the Union address , perhaps aware of the very positive associations Americans have with that term .
In particular , this research underscores the fact that Americans ' image of business can vary substantially , depending on whether it is described as small or big .
Along these same lines , it is perhaps not surprising to find that entrepreneurs are held in high esteem by Americans .
The finding that Americans have mixed reactions to the term " the federal government " is not new .
Much previous research has shown that at this point in history , a majority of Americans are not enamored with the federal government , particularly the legislative branch .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 972 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted Jan. 26 - 27 , 2010 .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of error is ±4 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones and cellular phones .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

Package : php5 Severity : wishlist
It would be nice to enable the php embed SAPI alongside the apache and CLI variants .
This might be of use for packages like ggz - grubby , which implements a scripting interface for various languages , or KDE 's kscript which allows component scripting again in various languages .
PHP is missing from both if no shared library to link against is provided , and the embed SAPI provides this .
I figure that adding this to php5 - module .
config should be doable .

Disgust at the idea of propagating php into other contexts ?
We have to put up with php as a language for web apps , but it 's a rotten language whose use should not be encouraged .
Or supported beyond what 's necessary .

I am also interested in having an php-embed package containing the embed SAPI .
This is required for an application I 'm developing at the moment .

Tags : patch Attached is a patch against Debian stable ( PHP 5.2.0 ) and testing ( PHP 5.2.6 ) which enables the embed SAPI in a seperate package called libphp5 - embed .
The header file /usr / include / php5/ sapi/embed/php_embed.h ( required for building applications using the embed SAPI ) is bundled with the php5 - dev package .

Nope , and I doubt there ever will be .
I guess we all ( php maintainers ) share Steve 's opinion on embedding php5 .
It 's bad enough with php5 today , no need to make it worse by plugging language create to server web pages to another random applications .
If you need to embed scripting language , use something more suited for the task - lua comes to the mind .

While I support the idea that PHP is a hideous language that should never be used , I do not support the idea that your role as maintainers should allow you to refuse to package something for what is essentially a religious reason .
Steve 's comment about it being experimental is also incorrect , despite the file he quoted , which is out of date .
The embed APIs have not changed at all in the four years this bug has been open , it is as stable and mature as anything else in PHP .
I think this argument is only being used as a strawman to support what has already been decided based on religious reasons .
Thanks ,

there 's also the unfortunate reality that as it stands now the maintainers for for php are few and already overcommitted with supporting the existing php5 packages / extensions in debian .
so regardless of the " religious " objections as you call it , there 's also an acute shortage of knowledge / time / interest / developers to deal with supporting yet another SAPI .
myself , i might not have the same strong objections that other members of the team may have , but i certainly wo n't be making any investment of time to get this working , either .
i'm ( semi-ignorantly ) guessing that there are * also * some technical problems that would have to be solved w.r.t the exported includes / api / abi / dependencies .
in any event , i think there would be unanimous agreement from our team that even if we do enable this SAPI it wo n't be for squeeze given the short time frame and the focus of our limited efforts is to get 5.3 transitioned to testing before the freeze .

hi , I find quite amusing to read the comments in this bug report .
Steve Langasek 's reply is simply too stupid to even be considered , yet another extremist who make Debian such a pain to use .
However I can fully understand Steve as maintaining another SAPI is a lot of work , and from a time point of view , it could be hard to support .
But I 'd to say that it is an expected situation given the way you patch PHP in all possible ways , including the suhoshin patch being actived by default ( which adds its lot of pain as well ) .
Maybe the right time to reconsider this strategy and work more closely with us at php , as some of you began to do a couple of weeks ago .
A long awaited step .

Bug #380731 : understanding and kwow your place Date : Mon , 1 Mar 2010 07:49:37 +0100
hi pierre , i'd like to point out that while some of us have been making active efforts to reach out and cooperate , your hyperbole makes it it very difficult and demotivating to continue doing so .
fwiw , i also hope the people on our end of the fence keep the level of rhetoric down .
as for your opinions on the suhosin patch , libgd , embedded timezone data , etc -- they may all have valid arguments behind them , but this is neither the place nor the approach / tone for approaching them .
if you want to push for some kind of reconciliation , please bring it up in a constructive form on the pkg - php mailing list or a seperate bug report .
for everyone else , this is a bug report about the embedded sapi and nothing else , so please keep anything unrelated to this out of the bug report .
as it is i'm already considering trashing the bug report and opening a new one because of all the bad blood .
in the meantime please refer to my previous post ( # 50 ) for what our current position on this is ( no time to do so , possible technical concerns , someone else will have to do the legwork and it will be after squeeze at soonest ) .

That has been done already , for what I can do there is even an open report about GD ( which is solved as of 5.3.0 + :) . > for everyone else , this is a bug report about the embedded sapi and > nothing else , so please keep anything unrelated to this out of the > bug report .

About embed , I also think it is prematur to bring it to a stable package .
It needs some changes to be useful ( for ex. split init functions so it can be used with embedded server more efficiently ) .
Maybe a good start would be to contribute directly to PHP and add some tests for this SAPI .
Once we reached a stable state , distros can then consider to bring it to their users .

Subject : I would like to support this effort to package phc and php-embedded in debian Date : Sun , 25 Mar 2012 10:58:42 +0200
For the packaging of phc in debian , which I would like to have packaged , we need some way to allow the embedding of php .
I will look into packaging of them both together and uploading them to debian mentors .
Really php embedded could be it own package like discussed .
it should be possible to host the debs produced on debian mentors server or somewhere else until we have a final solution .

That 's the worst idea I have ever heard in this case .
You would double the work required by security team .
Every security issue which hit the PHP would need two updates - one in main php5 package and second in php5 -embedded .
I am strongly opposed to uploading php-mebedded as separate package just to circumvent the ( later ) things which was said about embedded SAPI ( still experimental in the upstream , no motivation to support yet another SAPI from maintainers ) .
> it should be possible to host the debs produced on debian mentors > server or somewhere else until we have a final solution .
I have a much better proposal .
Join the PHP5 packaging team ( #664595 ) , help with bug squashing in the main package and also dedicate yourself to support php5 -embedded .
There are already too many " sort - of - orphaned " packages in the Debian where the original maintainer lost the interest in the software and in the package and forgot that he made the upload .

That would be bad , I agree .
I did not think that far .
Right now i am still fighting with hiphop for php , when i have that package done nicely I will look at phc.
maybe we can make a separate php embedded package that uses the same sources , and is built at the same time .

When word first surfaced that a new Star Wars game would be unveiled at tonight 's 2009 VGA ceremony , the prime suspect was a sequel to The Force Unleashed .
After all , LucasArts ' decently reviewed 2008 action game was a massive hit , having sold more than 5.7 million copies as of February 2009 .
Marek is back , it seems .
Sure enough , the game in question was The Force Unleashed II , due out in 2010 .
Though details are thin -- no platforms revealed -- it is clear the game picks up after the events of the 2008 original , which cast players as the secret apprentice to the Sith Lord Darth Vader , Galen " Starkiller " Marek .
[ WARNING : Spoilers ahead . ]
The canon ending of the game , listed on the official Star Wars site , has Marek turning sides and sacrificing himself to save the Rebel Alliance leadership .
However , it now appears that Marek is very much alive , as he appears front and center in the sequel 's trailer , which is viewable on YouTube .
The former Sith now appears to be a Jedi , as he wields their distinctive blue lightsabers to slay a towering , Rancor - eating monster .
The trailer features voice - overs from both Darth Vader and Yoda talking to Marek , perhaps indicating that he will be torn between the Light and Dark sides of the Force .
The official Force Unleashed II Web site www.unleashed2010.com was teased at the end of the trailer .
GameSpot will have more details on the game as they become available .
For more on the original , check out the video review below .
This wo n’t be the first time I ’ve written about statins .
And sadly , I very much doubt it will be the last , as more and more evidence continues to expose them for the truly dangerous drugs they are .
You may already be familiar with some of their more notorious side effects — including memory loss , muscle weakness , and liver damage .
But as one new study reinforces , the threat these cholesterol - lowering pharmaceuticals pose to your health actually runs far deeper than you can imagine .
In a recently published analysis of data , pooled from six trials involving more than 57,000 adults , researchers examined the influence that long term statin use has on the risk of acquiring Type II diabetes .
As it turns out , 2,082 of the study participants developed diabetes over an average follow - up period of 3.9 years , accounting for a small but statistically significant increase in risk ranging from 6 to 13 percent .
Apparently , these results were contrary to the investigators ’ expectations .
They are not , however , contrary to mine .
Researchers have been aware of the link between statins and increased diabetes risk for some time now .
And yet they are still considered a first - line solution for cholesterol control .
Another recent study took this one step further in proposing that statins be prescribed for the prevention of chronic inflammation .
This recommendation was despite the fact that this trial ’s results revealed the exact same negative developments .
Needless to say , I find such recommendations to be frighteningly irresponsible — a sentiment that I know is widely shared by my colleagues in the integrative medical community .
Let me be clear :
There is no question as to the benefit of many pharmaceutical drugs .
I do n’t think anyone would argue that the invention of penicillin , for example , was anything short of revolutionary for the practice of medicine as we know it today .
But it ’s also undeniably true that the pharmaceutical business has since grown into a profit - driven industry .
These profits , unfortunately , often come at the costly expense of the public health .
There are far more effective ways for you to reduce your cholesterol , curb inflammation , and ensure lasting heart health without the use of dangerous drugs .
I feel that the benefits of statins in particular are questionable at best .
The improvements these drugs offer most certainly do not outweigh the risks , especially given the wide variety of natural alternatives available — to say nothing of the benefits that even simple lifestyle changes are clinically proven to deliver .
Before you consider taking statins to lower your cholesterol , I ’d like to encourage you to read my free report on safe , natural strategies for overcoming cardiovascular disease here .
I urge you to share this important information with anyone you know who is looking for an effective , drug - free way to combat this widespread health concern .

Bangalore , Feb 3 : How do you like the idea of Internet being awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace in 2010 ?
The world might see Internet succeed the 2009 awardee US president Barack Obama as it is officially fighting for the world 's most coveted prize alongside a Russian human rights group and a Chinese dissident .
While a Princeton philosophy professor , Kwame Anthony Appiah nominated Liu Xiaobo , a recently jailed Chinese dissident , Norwegian politician Erna Solberg has nominated Russian rights activist Svetlana Gannushkina and her group Memorial , media reports said on Tuesday , Feb 2 .
It was the Italian edition of the Wired magazine which supported the idea of an inanimate object getting the prize .
Wired reportedly nominated Internet for promoting " dialogue , debate and consensus through communication " as well as democracy .
In an article published on Nov 20 , 2009 , titled ' Wired Backs Internet for Nobel Peace Prize ' , the magazine said , " The internet has clearly been a boon for news junkies , LOLcats and the makers of goofball videos .
But it "s also proven to be a powerful international force for peace . "
“ The internet can be considered the first weapon of mass construction , which we can deploy to destroy hate and conflict and to propagate peace and democracy , " Riccardo Luna , editor - in - chief of the Italian edition of Wired magazine opined .
Besides using the instance of Iraq elections to establish how Internet could be used as a ' weapon of global hope ' , the magazine went on to say how it can be used for terrorism and warfare to prove the power of the media .
So , now that it has been officially nominated , the world has to wait and see if a medium of communication trumps activists and fighters to win the Nobel Prize 2010 .
The winner will be announced in Oct 2010 .

More than $ 800 million in student fees and university subsidies are propping up athletic programs at the nation 's top sports colleges , including hundreds of millions in the richest conferences , a USA TODAY analysis found .
The subsidies have reached that level amid a continuing crisis in higher education funding .
At some of the schools where athletics is most heavily subsidized , faculty salaries have dipped , state - funded financial aid is drying up and students are bracing for tuition and fee increases .
Taken together , the subsidies for athletics at 99 public schools in the NCAA 's 120 - member Football Bowl Subdivision grew about 20 % in four years , from $ 685 million in 2005 to $ 826 million in 2008 , after adjusting for inflation .
At more than a third of those schools , the percentage of athletic department revenue coming from subsidies grew during the four - year period studied .
BIG - TIME ATHLETICS :
Are they worth the big - time costs ?
DATABASE : See what schools spend on athletics " The word I would use is ' appalling , ' " says Carole Browne , a professor at Wake Forest who co-chairs the Coalition on Intercollegiate Athletics , a national faculty group that advocates for athletics reform .
" It 's appalling in the big picture and representative of what is going on in athletics with coaches ' salaries and facilities .
It 's part of a bigger problem . "
USA TODAY , through open - records requests , obtained four years of financial reports schools must send annually to the NCAA .
The newspaper examined allocated revenue from student fees , university and state sources .
Of the 30 public schools where the percentage of athletics revenue coming from allocated sources rose the most from 2005 to 2008 , about half are from schools in the power conferences , often assumed to be self - supporting .
The '09 reports , which might show bigger gaps because of the recession , are due Friday .
At the University of Cincinnati , a Big East Conference school , subsidies grew from 26.7 % ( $ 5.6 million ) of athletics revenue in 2005 to 33.1 % ( $ 10.7 million ) in '08 .
That made Cincinnati the power - conference public school where reliance on subsidies grew most during the years studied .
UC athletics also has a $ 24 million operating debt .
" The ultimate goal is to have the athletics department running on its own , " said Tim Lolli , the student body president .
" But students here love big - time athletics ... and they are willing and eager to help athletics as much as possible . "
Cincinnati has trimmed its budget .
The faculty has faced state budget cuts , hiring " frosts " and some wage freezes .
Bigger class loads are coming , faculty chairwoman Marla Hall said .
Scholarships to three sports , including men's track and field , were cut last year , coach Bill Schnier said .
But new money might not bring them back .
" If ( college ) sports have to match the pros dollar - for - dollar in salaries and facilities , then we 'll have to find more money next year , and the year after that , and the year after that , " Schnier said .
" Someone has to put an end to this madness . "
Nebraska and Louisiana State were the only schools whose athletics programs reported receiving no subsidies in each of the four years studied .

DETROIT — Although Toyota is the world leader in producing fuel - efficient hybrid cars , and it has plans to introduce a plug - in hybrid and a battery - powered city car ( versions of both were on the stand at the auto show here ) , the company has been outspoken about the limitations of some green - vehicle technologies .
It ’s been particularly vocal about the drawbacks of plug - in hybrids .
At the auto show this week , Toyota held a news conference with Koei Saga , managing officer of the Toyota Motor Corporation with responsibility for advanced technology and battery development .
Mr. Saga announced that Toyota had set up a research division with 50 engineers to develop advanced lithium - ion batteries for its plug - in hybrids .
But Mr. Saga harbors considerable doubt about the current prospects for long - distance battery - only cars .
He said ( through a translator ) that limited range means that E.V. ’s work best as “ very small commuter - type vehicles ” for use in major metropolitan areas ( he used Europe and Japan as examples ) .
Asked if longer - range E.V. ’s were possible with current technology , he said that could happen only “ if we forget about battery life and if we forget about the cost incurred for replacement of those batteries . ”
Cost remains an issue , Mr. Saga said .
In 10 years , he said , Toyota would like to reduce the cost of lithium - ion batteries by more than 50 percent .
But he pointed out that the price of batteries for cellphones and computers has fallen much faster .
Battery cars capable of extended highway travel are relatively far in the future , Mr. Saga said .
He envisioned such electric cars working best if they could obtain electricity not from batteries , but from an interaction with the highway itself .
Just such a system has been tested by the Advanced Institute of Science and Technology of Korea , which uses induction strips and inverters embedded in the road to recharge batteries when cars drive over them .
Asked if the world ’s vehicles would ever be exclusively electric , Mr. Saga said , “ In my personal view , I think we will never abandon the internal - combustion engine . ”
He did envision a possible future for fuel - cell vehicles and internal - combustion cars that burn hydrogen , however .

That makes two movies for Director James Cameron .
The 430 million dollar movie Avatar became the fifth movie in history to pass through the 1 billion dollar mark in unadjusted inflation worldwide sales .
It is now , so far , the fourth highest grossing movie of all time at $ 1.0188 billion , surpassing The Dark Knight which is at $ 1.0019 billion .
Only three films have higher sales , Pirates of the Caribbean : Dead Man ’s Chest at $ 1.0662 billion , The Lord of the Rings : Return of the King at $ 1.1191 and Cameron ’s previous film Titanic with a staggering $ 1.8429 billion .
The movie also broke the record for fastest climb to 1 billion dollars – 17 days .
It also now holds the highest second - weekend and third - weekend sales .
Previous holders for those titles were The Dark Knight and Spiderman .
In the third - weekend battle , Avatar beat the record of Spiderman ’s $ 45 million by raking in $ 68 million – a drop of only 10 % from the previous weekend .
The movie is already the highest grossing film in Russia and it is yet to open in the very lucrative market of China .
At this rate that the movie is showing , the film is projected to climb to the second spot ahead of Return of the King giving Cameron the two highest spots .
How the War Hawks Caged Obama Two of President Barack Obama ’s most acclaimed Cabinet appointments – keeping Republican Defense Secretary Robert Gates and picking former Democratic rival Hillary Clinton to be Secretary of State – set the risky course that his administration is following toward a military escalation in Afghanistan .
Email
Printer friendly According to a variety of press accounts , Gates and Clinton proved to be a powerful tandem urging a more hawkish approach to the Afghan War and lending crucial political support to Gen.
Stanley McChrystal ’s request for tens of thousands of additional troops .
Gates and Clinton more than counterbalanced the more dovish recommendations from Vice President Joe Biden and U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan Karl Eikenberry , a former U.S. military commander in Afghanistan who warned about increasing Afghan government dependence on American forces .
So , as Obama prepares to unveil a plan expected to send about 30,000 more American soldiers to Afghanistan – pushing the U.S. total to about 100,000 or roughly double the size of the U.S. force there when President George W. Bush left office – it looks in retrospect as if the Gates - Clinton appointments a year ago effectively baked in this decision .
Though Washington ’s conventional wisdom remains enamored of those two “ Team of Rivals ” appointments – and especially the bipartisan appeal of the Gates selection – it is increasingly apparent that warnings from the Democratic rank - and - file about the need to make a clean break with Bush - era warmongering carried some real - life wisdom .
Instead , Obama went with war - time “ continuity ” and bipartisanship in keeping Gates and U.S. Central Command Gen. David Petraeus .
By doing so , Obama ensured that the “ surge ” escalation strategy that Gates and Petraeus sold in Iraq would be repackaged for Afghanistan .
In April , Obama further locked in the escalation by allowing Gates to fire Gen. David McKiernan , as commander in Afghanistan , and replace him with McChrystal , a Petraeus favorite who had led the ruthless “ war on terror ” special operations under Bush .
McKiernan was regarded as insufficiently aggressive and supposedly lacking the charisma and press savvy of Petraeus and McChrystal .
While Obama basked in some praise from neoconservative editorialists for these national security personnel selections – and for dispatching about 20,000 more troops to Afghanistan in the spring – the President was outflanking himself .
That is , assuming he really had any serious notion of pursuing a more diplomatic and less militaristic approach to Afghanistan .
A Dire Report McChrystal , the new Afghan - theater commander , next prepared a dire report demanding 40,000 more troops to avert defeat .
Reflecting the press savvy of these war hawks , the report was promptly leaked , touching off demands from Republicans and right - wing news outlets that Obama stop “ dithering ” and give his field commanders what they wanted .
Biden and Eikenberry put up a rear - guard battle against the proposed escalation , but they only seemed to have succeeded in giving Obama enough political space to scale back the troop commitments , which Obama is scheduled to announce in a speech to West Point cadets on Tuesday .
The escalation , which is intended to set the stage for a major U.S. offensive into Taliban - dominated Helmand Province , will surely increase U.S. casualties in Afghanistan – now exceeding 925 dead .
The escalation also will drain scarce resources from the U.S. Treasury at a time when Republicans are attacking Obama ’s social agenda as too expensive .
So , Obama ’s much - hailed political strategy of building a “ Team of Rivals ” is revealing its dark underbelly : Powerful rivals can maneuver you into a corner that ultimately undermines your goals and promotes their own .
A President still could battle out of the corner , but not without paying a high political price , especially if the rivals engage in strategic leaking to their friends in the press and thus make the President look as bad as possible .
Theoretically , a President also could fire these insubordinate rivals , but that would carry severe political costs , too .
The time for making those personnel decisions was really a year ago , before the inauguration .
To clean house now – less than a year into his presidency – would prompt serious questions about Obama ’s executive judgment .
It also ca n’t be said that Obama was n’t warned .
Here at Consortiumnews.com , for instance , we ran story after story raising questions about whether Gates , a longtime Bush Family operative known for his behind - the - scenes maneuvering , would end up undermining Obama ’s presidency .
Our articles pointed out that Gates has long collaborated with neocons promoting the foreign policies and intelligence strategies that have brought the United States to its present circumstances .
Gates was linked to secret arms sales in the early 1980s to both Iraq and Iran as the two countries fought an eight - year war .
However , because Gates had influential friends among Democrats – the likes of Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman David Boren – as well as Republican allies , investigations into Gates ’s roles in the Iran - Contra and Iraqgate scandals faltered .
[ For details , see Consortiumnews.com ’s “ The Secret World of Robert Gates . ” ]
Purging the Analysts Also , as an ambitious CIA bureaucrat in the early 1980s , Gates became CIA Director William Casey ’s action officer in breaking down the CIA analytical division ’s tradition of providing objective assessments to the President and other senior policymakers .
As Casey ’s choice to head that division , Gates purged analysts who would n’t go along with the politicization and promoted those who would , a distortion of a core CIA function that has had devastating consequences through this current decade and the disastrous Iraq War .
A Cold War hardliner in the 1980s , Gates particularly punished analysts who resisted the direst assessments about Soviet power and intentions .
Analysts who noted the Soviet Union ’s rapid decline and Moscow ’s desire for negotiations were shunted aside in favor of propagandists who were willing to issue alarmist reports .
Gates may have been singularly responsible for the CIA 's failure to detect the collapse of the Soviet Empire from 1989 to 1991 .
For the prior decade , he was the most senior CIA analyst exaggerating threats that justified massive U.S. military build - ups as well as support for violent guerrilla groups .
For instance , Gates made wildly erroneous predictions about dangers posed by leftist - rule Nicaragua as he espoused policy prescriptions , including the bombing of Nicaragua , that were considered too extreme even by the hawkish Reagan administration .
In a secret Dec. 14 , 1984 , memorandum to then - CIA Director Casey , Gates ignored many relevant facts that got in the way of his thesis about the need to launch air strikes against Sandinista military targets and to overthrow the supposedly “ Marxist - Leninist ” regime .
Gates made no mention of the fact that only a month earlier , the Sandinistas had won an election widely praised for its fairness by European and other international observers .
But the Reagan administration had pressured pro-U.S. candidate Arturo Cruz into withdrawing when it became clear he would lose – and then denounced the election as a “ sham . ”
Without assessing whether the Sandinistas had any real commitment to democracy , Gates adopted the Reagan administration ’s favored position – that Nicaragua ’s elected president Daniel Ortega was , in effect , a Soviet - style dictator .
“ The Nicaraguan regime is steadily moving toward consolidation of a Marxist - Leninist government and the establishment of a permanent and well armed ally of the Soviet Union and Cuba on the mainland of the Western Hemisphere , ” Gates wrote to Casey .
The Gates assessment , however , turned out to be wrong .
Rather than building a Marxist - Leninist dictatorship , the Sandinistas competed six years later in a robust presidential election – even allowing the United States to pour in millions of dollars to help elect Washington ’s favored candidate , Violeta Chamorro .
The Sandinistas respected the election results , ceding power to Chamorro .
The Sandinistas also have competed in subsequent elections with Ortega finally regaining the presidency in the latest election held in November 2006 .
Aggressive Intent ?
In the 1984 memo , Gates also promoted another right - wing canard of the era – that Nicaragua ’s procurement of weapons was proof of its aggressive intentions , not an attempt at national self - defense .
Again , Gates ignored significant facts , including a history starting in 1980 of first the right - wing Argentine junta and then the United States financing and training a brutal counterrevolutionary movement , known as the contras .
By 1984 , the contras had earned a reputation for rape , torture , murder and terrorism – as they ravaged towns especially along Nicaragua ’s northern border .
In 1983 - 84 , the CIA also had used the cover of the contra war to plant mines in Nicaragua ’s harbors , an operation later condemned by the World Court .
But Gates offered none of this context in his five - page memo to Casey , who was a strong advocate of the contra cause .
The memo made no serious analytical attempt to gauge whether Nicaragua – the target of aggression by a nearby superpower , the United States – might have been trying to build up forces to deter more direct U.S. intervention .
Instead , Gates told his boss what he wanted to hear .
“ The Soviets and Cubans are turning Nicaragua into an armed camp with military forces far beyond its defensive needs and in a position to intimidate and coerce its neighbors , ” Gates wrote .
After laying out his premises , Gates moved to his conclusion – that there was no hope the Sandinistas would accept democracy , even if the contras remained in the field , and thus there was no choice but to oust the Sandinistas by force .
Gates wrote : “ It seems to me that the only way that we can prevent disaster in Central America is to acknowledge openly what some have argued privately : that the existence of a Marxist - Leninist regime in Nicaragua closely allied with the Soviet Union and Cuba is unacceptable to the United States and that the United States will do everything in its power short of invasion to put that regime out .
“ Hopes of causing the regime to reform itself for a more pluralistic government are essentially silly and hopeless .
Moreover , few believe that all those weapons and the more to come are only for defense purposes . ”
Tough Talk Dressing up his recommendations as hardheaded realism , Gates added : “ Once you accept that ridding the Continent of this regime is important to our national interest and must be our primary objective , the issue then becomes a stark one .
You either acknowledge that you are willing to take all necessary measures ( short of military invasion ) to bring down that regime or you admit that you do not have the will to do anything about the problem and you make the best deal you can .
“ Casting aside all fictions , it is the latter course we are on . …
Any negotiated agreement simply will offer a cover for the consolidation of the regime and two or three years from now we will be in considerably worse shape than we are now . ”
Gates then called for withdrawing diplomatic recognition of the Nicaraguan government , backing a government - in - exile , imposing an economic embargo on exports and imports “ to maximize the economic dislocation of the regime , ” and launching “ air strikes to destroy a considerable portion of Nicaragua ’s military buildup ( focusing particularly on the tanks and the helicopters ) . ”
In the memo , Gates depicted those who would do less as weaklings and fools , including some administration officials who favored focusing on arranging new covert aid to the contras .
“ These are hard measures , ” Gates wrote about his recommendations .
“ They probably are politically unacceptable .
But it is time to stop fooling ourselves about what is going to happen in Central America .
Putting our heads in the sand will not prevent the events that I outlined at the beginning of this note .
…
“ The fact is that the Western Hemisphere is the sphere of influence of the United States .
If we have decided totally to abandon the Monroe Doctrine , if in the 1980 ’s taking strong actions to protect our interests despite the hail of criticism is too difficult , then we ought to save political capital in Washington , acknowledge our helplessness and stop wasting everybody ’s time . ”
Despite Gates ’s history – as either an opportunist or an extremist depending on whether you think he actually believed his own words or was just currying favor with his boss – he has been embraced as something of a new Wise Man in today ’s Washington , a favorite of the city ’s insider press corps .
After Obama won in November 2008 , some of Obama 's clever aides pushed the President - elect to retain Gates as a signal of Obama ’s sincere desire for bipartisanship .
Similarly , Obama reached out to his chief Democratic rival , Hillary Clinton , whose hard line in the Middle East made her a Democrat acceptable to Washington ’s influential neocon community .
The Washington press corps fell in love with this narrative based on Doris Kearns Goodwin ’s Team of Rivals , a book about how Abraham Lincoln assembled his Cabinet .
The incoming Obama administration and top Democrats turned a deaf ear to outsiders who warned about the practical consequences of following such a route in modern Washington .
There was always the danger that these powerful “ rivals ” would fill key staff positions with subordinates who did n’t share the new President ’s goals and then essentially hijack a sensitive policy decision .
That situation appears to have arrived as Obama finds himself caged in by war hawks – Gates , Petraeus , McChrystal and Clinton – determined to escalate the war in Afghanistan .

The moment comet was eaten up after orbiting too close to the sun
A comet has been captured by Nasa being ' eaten ' as it flies too close to the sun .
The space agency 's solar - focused agency -
[ caption ]
Caught on camera :
The footage was recorded using a Coronagraph , which blocks out the brightest object in an image , enabling other activity to be viewed
Kreutz Sungrazers are characterised by orbits taking them extremely close to the Sun .
They are believed to be fragments of one large comet that broke up several centuries ago and are named after German astronomer Heinrich Kreutz , who first worked out that they were related .
A SOHO spokeswoman said the agency gathered the footage using a Coronagraph , which blocks the brightest object in an image .
This allows activity around the sun - such as the comet 's approach - to be viewed .
It is known as a ' false eclipse ' and displays the actual footage of the comet 's final seconds , presented in a way that it can be seen by the naked eye .
Hundreds of Kreutz comets , some only a few metres in diameter , have been discovered since the launch of the SOHO satellite in 1995 .
Like the comet captured in these images , none have survived the section of their orbit closest to the sun .
Experts say a new cluster of Kreutz comets will approach the sun over the next few decades , treating stargazers to more spectacular shows .

NEW YORK | Historically , marriage was the surest route to financial security for women .
Nowadays , it ’s men who are increasingly getting the biggest economic boost from tying the knot , according to a new analysis of census data .
The changes , summarized in a Pew Research Center report being released Tuesday , reflect the proliferation of working wives over the past 40 years — a period in which American women outpaced men in both education and earnings growth .
A larger share of today ’s men , compared with their 1970 counterparts , are married to women whose education and income exceed their own , and a larger share of women are married to men with less education and income .
“ From an economic perspective , these trends have contributed to a gender role reversal in the gains from marriage , ” wrote the report ’s authors , Richard Fry and D’Vera Cohn .
“ In the past , when relatively few wives worked , marriage enhanced the economic status of women more than that of men .
In recent decades , however , the economic gains associated with marriage have been greater for men . ”
One barometer is median household income — which rose 60 percent between 1970 and 2007 for married men , married women and unmarried women , but only 16 percent for unmarried men , according to the Pew data .
The report focused on U.S. - born men and women aged 30 to 44 — a stage when typical adults have finished their education , married and launched careers .
The Pew report noted that today ’s Americans in this age group are the first such cohort in U.S. history to include more women than men with college degrees .
In 1970 , according to the report , 28 percent of wives in this age range had husbands who were better educated than they were , outnumbering the 20 percent whose husbands had less education .
By 2007 , these patterns had reversed — 19 percent of wives had husbands with more education , compared with 28 percent whose husbands had less education .
In the remaining couples — about half in 1970 and 2007 — spouses had similar education levels .
Only 4 percent of husbands had wives who earned more than they did in 1970 , compared with 22 percent in 2007 .
During that span , women ’s earnings grew 44 percent , compared with 6 percent growth for men .
According to 2009 Census Bureau figures , women with full - time jobs earned salaries equal to 77.9 percent of what men earned , compared with 52 percent in 1970 .
The Pew researchers noted that the economic downturn is reinforcing the sex - reversal trends , with men losing jobs more often than women .
Deborah Siegel , a New York City writer , said she ’s living through some of the Pew report ’s trends as she returns to work three months after having twins while her husband — laid off from his corporate branding job a year ago — helps out with child care amid occasional freelance work .
“ For men , being laid off is such a huge ego blow , ” said Ms. Siegel , author of “ Sisterhood Interrupted . ”
“ The recession may be ending , but we ’re still working out our dynamics . ”
The Pew report found that unmarried women in 2007 had higher household incomes than their 1970 counterparts at each level of education , while unmarried men without post - secondary education lost ground because their real earnings decreased and they did n’t have a wife ’s wages to offset that decline .
Unmarried men with college degrees made income gains of 15 percent , but were outpaced by the 28 percent gains of unmarried women with degrees .

Yesterday was absolutely terrible .
I ’m going to share my whole experience because I ’m hoping it will be therapeutic .
In any case I think I ’m going to have nightmares for a long time .
I spent the day in Port au Prince getting a loaner vehicle from the Toyota dealer and then taking care of some mission business .
On my way out of town in the afternoon , I was on Delmas 9 ( I think ) and the loaner vehicle I had just picked up broke down .
I called the dealer to come get it .
Shortly after they arrived , the earthquake hit .
I ’m ashamed of the first thought that went through my mind , which was “ Cool , I ’ve never been in a big earthquake before ! ”
As the quake rolled on , though , I remembered the conversations I ’ve had with the other missionaries about what an earthquake would mean for Haiti .
Of course , it would be devastating .
Construction materials and methods are n’t just shoddy , they ’re suicidal , but now is n’t the time to rampage , just to tell you about my experiences .
I did n’t actually fall on the ground , but I stumbled around quite a bit .
When the tremors ceased , a large dust cloud was rising from the building a few doors down .
A 3 story school full of teenage girls had collapsed .
I stood around looking stupid for longer than I ’d like to admit .
I looked at the truck from Toyota , tried to call my wife ( the service was out ) and looked around me at people ’s reactions .
Virtually everyone reacted in strange ways .
Eventually , I went to the school and started working to pull trapped students from the wreckage .
The work was very hard because I was working by myself .
People would come up and shout into the wreckage , “ Is so - and - so inside ? ” at the top of their lungs repeatedly .
I would ask for help in moving rubble and they would say they have to find their own people .
One guy stayed and helped , on and off .
I got one girl out , who was very frantic .
I told her to stop shouting and pray for help .
She was about 10 feet deep under the collapsed cement roof of the building .
At one point I went and borrowed a hammer from someone to break up the large piece of cement that she was trapped behind .
The aftershocks scared the crap out of me , and I really did n’t like being under that cement slab .
There was an obviously dead woman under the slab with us .
When the girl was out , I took my hammer and moved over to find the next trapped girl .
All I could see was her face and left arm , and she frantically called out to me .
I asked her to calm down because it would help me to work and asked her to pray for both of us .
She calmed down and became very brave .
I was having trouble seeing her where she was jammed under the slab .
I pulled out a very large piece of rubble that did n’t really help Jacqueline at all ( her name was Jacqueline ) .
There was some sort of object behind that rubble and when I went to move it it turned out to be another girl ’s bottom .
The girl cried out but I could barely hear her – her whole head was underneath rubble .
At this point I began to realize that I was in over my head .
All I had was a hammer , and it was quickly becoming pitch dark with twilight fading and no electricity anywhere .
I tried to borrow a flashlight , but it was impossible .
I had a moment of feeling intense helplessness .
After thinking and praying for a minute , I told Jacqueline that I had to leave her and find more help .
I could n’t do anything without a flashlight , and she needed to keep praying and remember that her parents were coming to look for her .
I walked 4 or 5 miles to a place where I could get a bus , then got on one eventually made it home just after 9 pm .
On my way home , I resolved to return to Port au Prince the next day with 2 trucks full of tools and workers to do whatever we could .
I met a guy on the bus who was holding a sandwich .
He had left his house to go buy a sandwich when the earthquake hit .
He returned to his home to find it flattened , then went to the school that he teaches at to find it flattened .
With nothing left but a sandwich in his hand , and $ 7 in his sock , he set out for Cap Haitien to be with the rest of his family .
I slept a little bit last night even though I kept thinking of Jacqueline and her classmate stuck in the rubble , in the dark .
This morning all of the workers enthusiastically loaded all the tools we could use into the trucks along with food and water and set off for Port au Prince .
I took them to the school and quickly made my way to the place Jacqueline and the other student were but both of them were dead .
Some of the local people had been working through the night to rescue their loved ones .
They had found lighting and hack saws and had already pulled some people out , including a lot of bodies .
We joined their efforts with our power tools .
Quickly , we pulled out two more living girls and then a third .
The fourth and fifth were a lot more work and each had a severely crushed foot .
After that , there were no more cries for help , even when everybody went quiet in order to listen .
Lots of dead bodies were still stuck , but getting at them would require large machines .
At that point , I decided to tackle the problem of the growing pile of bodies , which were starting to smell .
A volunteer from the community collected all the identifying information he could , and the various family members all signed off .
It turned out to be a mistake .
The General Hospital , which houses Port au Prince ’s only government run morgue , has been destroyed .
After we had already loaded the bodies ( 10 or so ) the problem was explained to me .
I saw some nuns driving by and asked them where I could find a morgue and they told me that they buried their dead directly , and they heard talk of a big hole being dug out by Ti Tanyen for the others .
So we unloaded the bodies back into the lane , where I ’m sure they still remain .
We spent an hour boring a hole through a floor into a collapsed chamber to try to rescue a 2 year old child but the cries had stopped before we even began .
We ’re not going to go back tomorrow because I strongly suspect that most people that can be rescued have already been rescued , and buildings that still have survivors will have plenty of volunteers from now on .
Today was by far the most important day for rescues .
This has been a very emotional experience for me .
The bodies stopped bothering me after a while , but I think what I will always carry with me is the conversation I had with Jacqueline before I left her .
How could I leave someone who was dying , trapped in a building !
That ’s so wrong !
At the very least , she needed someone to sit and comfort her in her last hours .
But if I had n’t found my way home last night , then today I would n’t have been able to bring the CWH crew in .
Still , leaving her was one of the hardest things I ’ve ever done .
She seemed so brave when I left !
I told her I was going to get help , but I did n’t tell her I would be gone until morning .
I think this is going to trouble me for a long time .
Russia announces expansion of nuclear capabilities , sanctions pre-emptive nuclear strikes
By Andrea Peters
7 January 2010
In late December , Russian President Dmitri Medvedev announced that his government intended to develop a new generation of nuclear weapons .
Medvedev ’s statement came in the midst of ongoing and thus far unsuccessful negotiations with the US over the signing of a new treaty that would replace the recently expired START - I agreement on nuclear weapons .
Speaking on television on Christmas Eve , the Russian president presented the Kremlin ’s plans to build new missiles as part of its effort to protect the country ’s “ national interests . ”
According to press reports , the main point of disagreement between Russia and the US in the nuclear talks is Washington ’s continuing plans to build a missile defense system in Europe .
In September of last year , the Obama administration stated that it was scrapping plans originated under President George W. Bush to station an anti-missile shield in Poland and the Czech Republic .
However , the administration has never completely abandoned the idea of developing some sort of alternative elsewhere on the European landmass , a prospect to which the Kremlin in equally opposed .
On December 29 , in response to a reporter ’s question regarding the stalled START - I talks , Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin explained , “ What is the problem ?
The problem is that our American partners are building an anti-missile shield and we are not building one .
…
If one is not to develop missile defense systems , then a threat appears , because having created such an umbrella , our partners may feel completely protected and will do what they want . ”
While Medvedev claims that the new weapons Russia is planning to develop will be in accord with whatever arms control agreement is ultimately reached with the US , the Kremlin ’s announcement makes it clear that it has no intention of taking the threat of nuclear war off the table .
Indeed , the Russian president ’s announcement comes on the heels of a revision of the country ’s military doctrine to allow for pre-emptive nuclear strikes .
As reported in Russia Today , the Kremlin - sponsored English - language news agency , in mid-December the Russian Security Council approved the draft of a new policy that will permit not only nuclear attacks to “ prevent any military threat , ” but also the “ use of nukes in small - scale conflicts . ”
This change to the country ’s nuclear policy , which is similar to revisions made by the US to its military doctrine under the Bush administration , is part of a broader effort by Russia to both strengthen its armed forces and increase their profile in the international arena .
Also in December , the upper house of the Russian Duma , the Federation Council , passed a resolution giving the president broad powers to authorize the use of force outside the country ’s borders without recourse to parliament .
According to a December 10 article in the Jamestown Foundation ’s Eurasia Daily Monitor , President Medvedev can now “ send troops into action abroad anywhere , anytime ; decide on the size of force , specify the enemy , with no legal restraints or limitations , ‘ to defend the interests of the Russian Federation and its citizens . ’ ”
This move is widely seen as providing the Kremlin with the legal basis to pursue military action akin to that which it took in August 2008 during its war with Georgia over the contested region of South Ossetia .
At that time , taking advantage of the opportunity given to it by provocations orchestrated from Tbilisi , Russia entered Georgian territory , routing Georgian forces .
In the aftermath of the war , questions arose within the Russian political establishment about the constitutionality of the Kremlin ’s actions and the necessity for creating a clear basis within Russian law for similar measures in the future .
The fact that the recently - passed legislation gives the president explicit power to take action to defend Russian citizens abroad is significant , as large ethnic Russian populations , portions of which have or can claim Russian citizenship , reside in countries throughout the former Soviet sphere .
Over the course of the past year , Russia has been involved in a reform of its military , which has been in a state of general decline on all fronts since the collapse of the USSR .
The overhaul is aimed at modernizing the armed forces both organizationally and technologically .
Roger McDermott of the Jamestown Foundation notes that the reforms are driven by the Russian military ’s efforts to draw the lessons of the 2008 war with Georgia , which demonstrated , despite Russia ’s success , that the country ’s armed forces were poorly equipped for rapid - deployment , small - scale operations .
“ The extent of the changes under way , ” wrote McDermott in August 2009 , “ is unparalleled in the history of the Russian armed forces since the end of World War II , perhaps even earlier . ”
“ While any comment on the policy implications is premature , ” he added , “ it is likely that the Russian conventional armed forces will emerge in the next five years as an unrivaled dominant force within the former Soviet space , capable of sudden , decisive intervention . ”
The recent changes made in Russia ’s military doctrine and structure are a reflection of the ruling elite ’s nervousness about ongoing challenges to Moscow ’s geopolitical position in areas traditionally within its sphere of influence .
These also seem to be interspersed with concerns about the future inviolability of Russia itself .
On December 17 , Interfax quoted the commander of Russia ’s strategic missile forces , Andrei Shvaichenko .
Commenting on the changes to the country ’s nuclear strike policy , he stated : “ ( Today ) one must take into account the geopolitical and geostrategic changes that are not in Russia ’s favor .
In the future , it can not be ruled out that Russia , being a nation with unlimited natural reserves and resources , could become a target of a large - scale military aggression . ”
On Russia ’s western flank the country confronts NATO ’s ongoing efforts to expand eastward .
Both Georgia and Ukraine underwent US - backed “ color revolutions ” during the 2000s , the immediate consequences of which were the installation of regimes with close ties to Washington .
The two countries are of strategic significance to Moscow because of , among other things , the role they play as transit points for energy resources bound for European markets .
At the same time , Russia is facing an expanding American intervention in Central Asia in the form of the escalation of the war in Afghanistan .
While in the short term the Kremlin may view the possibility of a US defeat in Afghanistan with wariness , as this could stoke up pro-Islamist sentiments in the region and undermine its own agenda , the expansion of US military action is also a major cause for concern for the Kremlin .
It understands that the Obama administration ’s intensifying focus on Afghanistan is driven by an agenda that has its sights on control of the energy resources and pipeline routes of Central Asia , where Russia has longstanding economic and geostrategic interests .
Russia ’s anxieties about the challenge to its geopolitical position in these regions have been worsened by its economic crisis .
In 2009 , the country ’s gross domestic product fell by 8.8 percent .
It was , according to Nezavisimaia Gazeta , “ the deepest slump in 15 years . ”
The intensity and speed of the collapse took the Kremlin by surprise .
Over the course of the year , it had to continually revise its economic projections downwards .
Among the BRIC countries ( Brazil , Russia , India and China ) , Russia distinguished itself by the size of its contraction relative to the others in the group , with Brazil ’s GDP declining by 0.25 percent and India and China ’s growth continuing , albeit at a slower pace .
Russia ’s poor performance compared to other BRIC nations even led some experts to question whether it should continue to be considered among the world ’s leading developing economic powerhouses .
The economic crisis exposed the depth and intensity of Russia ’s dependence on energy resources to sustain its economy .
To the degree that the hemorrhaging of the Russian economy has stopped over the course of the past two months , it is largely because oil prices have rebounded somewhat .
While elements within the political establishment have responded by advocating a change in Russia ’s economy away from its , as Medvedev observed , “ humiliating dependence ” on energy resources , a whole series of factors will prevent the ruling elite from pursuing , much less finding , an alternative source of political power and wealth .
The experience of the economic crisis of the past year , alongside the intensification of American military action under the Obama administration , has heightened the determination of the Russian ruling elite to prepare to militarily defend its oil wealth and its control over energy transit routes through Central Asia and the Caucasus .

Everyone seems to have forgotten why it was we all first became involved in his personal life : that car crash in the early morning hours after Thanksgiving .
Public opinion has coalesced around the conclusion that Tiger Woods was the victim of domestic abuse – that his wife became enraged upon discovering he was unfaithful and attacked him ; and that when he tried to flee , she attacked his car with a golf club leading to his crash – during which he also may have been disoriented by a blow to the head .
He was saved apparently by a call to 911 by one of his neighbors .
We do not know what transpired here with any certainty .
All we have are some alarming facts which everyone from late night comics to pundits seem to agree suggest an enraged spouse .
And yet , the lesson we are being asked to take is not that domestic abuse is unacceptable under any circumstances , but as Maureen Dowd opines :
Tiger ignored the obvious rule :
Never get involved with women who have 8 - by - 10 glossies .
Or , as the Christian Science Monitor ’s editorial board wrote :
The moral of the Tiger Woods story is that adultery leaves a trail of destruction .
It can be avoided .
Or perhaps this from Bill Shuler at Fox News :
The issue of private sin is not exclusive to Tiger Woods .
It is an epidemic in America .
Or any of a hundred variations on these lessons by pundits and late night comics .
Yet who asked Chris Brown why he beat Rihanna ?
It does n’t matter if she was cheating on him or what ever else she might have done to lead to him beating her .
As a society , there was broad agreement that what he did to her was wrong and that it should be condemned .
Chris Brown ’s career has likely been trashed , and good riddance , while Rihanna ’s has gone on .
Why is it different for Tiger ?
Why did the story move from the details of the events of that early morning quickly to what he did to provoke his wife ?
The implicit message seems clear : if a man hits a woman , no matter the provocation , it is wrong ; if a woman hits a man , he probably deserved it .
This is simply sexism , and part of the legacy of gender discrimination in which women were regarded as weak and inferior .
While overall , men do more damage in violent attacks on their partners , domestic violence by women is a serious issue as well , despite the sexist attempts to write it off .
All this reminded me of a story ABC News did several years ago – in which , after they had done several segments simulating male - on - female domestic violence in a public setting , and found that many people intervened , it occurred to the producers to try the opposite .
ABC
News staged female - on - male violence – and over several hours 163 people walked by , one of whom eventually intervened .
Several made gestures supportive of the woman .
Almost all the women assumed that the man had did something wrong , that he deserved what he got – which was not what they would assume if a man had been attacking a woman .
As one woman recalled her reaction :
“ Good for you .
You Go , Girl ! ” is how Lynda recalls her reaction .
“ I was thinking he probably did something really bad , ” she said .
“ Maybe she caught him cheating or something like that …and [ it ] made her lose it and slap him in the face .
I reacted like , ‘ Yes. Woman power . ' ”
The story is on YouTube as well .
Watch for the gleeful reaction of Lynda as she sees the woman hitting the man .
The academic experts on gender violence I have contacted pointed out that academic studies have demonstrated this same point , as this chart sent to me by a professor of sociology shows :
Tiger was taken the hospital with what were described by those at the scene as “ serious injurious ” including lacerations to his face .
He was in and out of consciousness , woozy , seemingly from head trauma .
But , the news coverage has focused almost exclusively on why he was beaten – on his adultery , on his wife demanding and getting more money from him .
I do n’t blame feminists for this .
I blame latent sexism , the vestiges of a patriarchy that protected women because it considered them weaker .
But the question that arises is clear :
Are women to be the only beneficiaries of a feminist revolution that seeks women ’s empowerment by any means necessary , even by hypocritically accepting the benefit of patriarchal assumptions if they benefit women ?
Are men to be mere victims of this feminism ?
Or is feminism about transforming society for the better for men as well as women ?
If feminism is about more than mere rooting for women , if feminism is about more than genitalia , then feminists should be condemning Tiger Woods ’ wife as loudly as they condemned Chris Brown .
Perhaps some are .
I do n’t mean to call everyone out .
( desifeminists on the Feministing Community page sees what I mean . )
But the loudest voices have been gossips and busybodies who gather around every scandal .
Where are you Jessica Valenti ?
Where are you Feministing , which so loudly ( and rightly ) pointed out that it did n’t matter what Rihanna was supposed to have done ?
Violence against women is abhorrent and should be condemned .
It ’s time to take on the patriarchal attitude that a man hit by a woman probably deserves it .
It ’s time to stand up for victims of domestic violence , even if they are men , even if they are Tiger Woods .

When strong governments wish to impose their will on weaker regimes , they often resort to sanctions .
The effects have included the death or debilitation of millions of innocent people .
Two good examples are Cuba , on which draconian U.S. sanctions have been enforced since 1960 , and Iraq , where brutal sanctions were enforced from 1990 to 2003 .
In 1959 the Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista was overthrown .
He had ruled with the approval of Washington and the Mafia ( who gave him a percentage on their casino operations ) .
The dictator Castro took over and declared himself a communist , prompting the U.S. government to attempt to overthrow him .
The illegal attempt to invade the country  the Bay of Pigs fiasco  was a national embarrassment for Washington , and the obvious revenge was to punish the country by the use of sanctions .
Almost no contact with Cuba was allowed , and the effects have been monstrous .
Earlier this year the Cato Institute recorded ,
The embargo has been a failure by every measure .
It has not changed the course or nature of the Cuban government .
It has not liberated a single Cuban citizen .
In fact , the embargo has made the Cuban people a bit more impoverished , without making them one bit more free .
Dr. Michèle Barry points out in Annals of Internal Medicine ,
Because economic sanctions result in shortages of food and medical supplies , their most severe consequences are often felt by the persons who are least culpable and most vulnerable ….
The U.S. embargo against Cuba , one of the few that includes both food and medicine , has been described as a war against public health with high human costs ….
 Most severe consequences  were experienced by the people of Iraq when Washington succeeded in having UN sanctions imposed after Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990 .
After the Iraqis were forced out of Kuwait , it was declared that the sanctions were intended to make Iraq comply with UN Security Council Resolution 687 , which demanded that Iraq eliminate its weapons of mass destruction and that it recognize the nation - state of Kuwait , which , like Americas major Arab ally , Saudi Arabia , is ruled by an entirely nondemocratic regime .
The absurdity of UNSC 687 was that Rolf Ekeus , the UN representative responsible for identifying and destroying Iraqs weaponry , had already certified that 817 out of Iraqs 819 Iraqi long - range missiles had been destroyed .
In 1999 a panel of the Security Council announced that all biological and chemical facilities have been destroyed and rendered harmless .
But that did not deter the sanctions proponents , who imagined that immense national suffering would somehow bring down the despot Saddam .
In 1998 Christian Aid stated ,
The policy of sanctions has also been used to pursue political goals  for example , the removal of the Iraqi regime  beyond the overt scope of Resolution 687 , which contained no prescriptions regarding Iraqs form of government or the conduct of domestic policy .
The Iraqi populations economic and social rights have been seriously infringed by the impact of a prolonged embargo .
In an authoritarian state which continued to hold most of the levers of control , much of the burden caused by the embargo fell on the civilian population .
But innocent civilians did not matter to the rest of the world , much of which was duped by the United States and Britain into concluding that Iraq presented a threat to global security , a ridiculous notion .
Killing innocents
In one of the most outrageously illegal acts of the many carried out by Washington and London , it was decided that there should be no - fly zones in the north and south of Iraq  covering about half the country  in which no Iraqi aircraft or radar was permitted to operate .
( France at first joined in this travesty of legality but then withdrew after realizing that it was absurd and that it had no UN endorsement . )
The purpose of the no-fly zones was ostensibly to protect the Shia population of the south and the Kurds in the north , but in fact they were intended , most successfully , to destroy Iraqs civilian and defense infrastructure .
The zones had no basis in international law and complemented sanctions in a particularly savage manner .
British and American fighter and bomber aircraft roamed the skies , attacking what they considered to be legitimate targets .
But scores of civilians died , as in January 1999 , when six children were killed by a plane - fired missile .
But we know that foreign children dont always matter to war planners and their supporters .
After all , when U.S. Ambassador to the UN Madeleine Albright was asked on television whether she considered the deaths of half a million children a reasonable result of U.S. sanctions , she replied ,  This is a very hard choice , but … we think the price is worth it . 
This callous , pitiless , utterly heartless statement by a most senior official of the U.S. government could have been made by any other U.S. government official .
If anyone in an official position in America or Britain disagreed with the pronouncement that the avoidable deaths of half a million children were justified , he kept very quiet about it .
They all knew what the policy was .
It is notable that during Albrights confirmation hearings preliminary to her becoming secretary of State , none of the senators questioned her on this point .
The fact is that they didnt disagree with it , making them complicit in the horrible deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi children .
U.S. attacks on Iraq in the no-fly zones were carefully planned , especially in the months immediately before the 2003 U.S. - led invasion by the deluded coalition that Washington cobbled together by means of deceit and downright lies about weapons of mass destruction . 
On September 5 , 2002 , for example , some 100 coalition aircraft bombed and rocketed a desert airstrip called H - 3 , deep in the far west of Iraq .
There was no threat from the airfield , but it was planned that it be a base for U.S. Special Forces inserted from Jordan before the war began .
It had to be neutralized .
And this is but one example of cynical manipulation of an already illegal decree .
According to U.S. Lt. Gen. Michael Moseley , the coalition flew 21,736 sorties over southern Iraq between June 2002 and the start of the war in April 2003  more than 60 a day .
Three hundred forty - nine targets were attacked and Moseley claimed that U.S. and other aircraft were fired at 651 times .
He had the grace to admit to the New York Times ( which helped the Bush administration to convince Americans that the war was justified ) ,
We became a little more aggressive based on them shooting more at us , which allowed us to respond more … .
Then the question is whether they were shooting at us because we were up there more .
So there is a chicken and egg thing here .
In fact Britains Ministry of Defense let the cat out of the bag by admitting that from March to November 2002 there were 8 alleged violations by Iraqi forces of the No - Fly Zone and 143 instances of recorded threats .
In response , 253,000 pounds of bombs were dropped on Iraq .
The number of rockets fired was not stated .
Bombs and rockets
While illegal sanctions caused the premature but prolonged and usually agonizing death of countless innocent Iraqis , the illegal bombings and rocketings played a major part in destroying a country that will take decades to recover , if it ever does .
The social consequences of attacks and sanctions have been truly terrible .
Electricity systems , wrecked beyond repair , were unable to supply power to hospitals and the civil population in general .
But Saddam and his henchmen were not affected : they had plenty of generators  which were one of the thousands of items forbidden to be imported for ordinary people .
Christian Aid observed in 2000 ,
The immediate consequence of eight years of sanctions has been a dramatic fall in living standards , the collapse of the infrastructure , and a serious decline in the availability of public services .
The longer - term damage to the fabric of society has yet to be assessed but economic disruption has already led to heightened levels of crime , corruption and violence .
Competition for increasingly scarce resources has allowed the Iraqi state to use clan and sectarian rivalries to maintain its control , further fragmenting Iraqi society .
And that was before intensification of bombing and the tightening of already harsh controls on imports .
These included six - month examinations of requests for importing such things as medical prescription drugs and substances required for water purification .
By the time of approval ( if given ) , most drugs were useless and thus dangerous , which may have been the intention .
( Such things as aspirin and other pain - relievers were said to be ingredients for making chemical weapons . )
There were some principled people who went public about the appalling human crisis inflicted on Iraq by the United States and its British ally .
Dennis Halliday , who was head of the UNs humanitarian program in Iraq , resigned in protest , as did his successor , Hans von Sponeck .
They wrote ,
The death of some 56,000 children a month is mostly due to contaminated water , lack of medicines and malnutrition .
The US and UK governments  delayed clearance of equipment and materials is responsible for this tragedy , not Baghdad .
Their statement was blunt , to the point , and accurate  and completely ignored by the barbarians who considered the deaths of hundreds of thousands of children was a price that was worth it .
The only honorable officials in the entire squalid sanctions horror were Halliday and von Sponeck , but of course they were reviled by those who knew well what effect the cruel sanctions would have and were having .
Oil for no food
Then there was the  Oil for Food program , which was begun in 1996 and became one of the biggest scams of modern times .
According to the BBC , the Oil for Food program was a $ 60 bn ( 32 bn ) scheme which was supposed to allow Iraq to buy food , medicine , and other humanitarian supplies with the proceeds of regulated oil sales , without breaking the sanctions imposed on it after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait . 
Actually , it was a license for fraud and embezzlement and proved most lucrative to all sorts of lowlifes who profited from a government plan that purported to alleviate misery .
Instead of trying to alleviate starvation and disease , the sanctions administrators deliberately stalled on approving Oil for Food arrangements .
The UN found that it took an average of 66 days for agreement to be reached on contracts and a further 59 days for food to be delivered .
The intention was clear : no matter the desperate plight of children in Iraq , the sanctions would continue to be imposed with the utmost severity .
In spite of criminality and willful disruption of food and medical supplies , the child mortality rate declined as a result of the Oil for Food program .
This was no thanks to such agencies as Britains Department of Trade and Industry , which prevented diphtheria and yellow - fever vaccines from being sent to Iraq , claiming that they could be used to make weapons of mass destruction .
In 1997 , according to UNICEF , 25 percent of children under five were severely malnourished .
They were especially vulnerable to water - borne diseases , such as typhoid and cholera , that were unknown in Iraq before the Gulf War of 1991 .
To end this sad tale of death and despair on Iraq , the words of the honorable Dennis Halliday are appropriate .
Sanctions , he said ,
do not impact on governance effectively and instead [ they damage ] the innocent people of the country … .
For me what is tragic , in addition to the tragedy of Iraq itself , is the fact that the United Nations Security Council member states … are maintaining a program of economic sanctions deliberately , knowingly killing thousands of Iraqis each month .
And that definition fits genocide .

この本 " Fifty Dangerous Things ( You Should Let Your Children Do ) " （ 「 子どもがすべき５０の危険なこと」）は，
Kevin Kelly
（ Wired の創始者の一人として有名な編集者）のブログで紹介されていたものだ。この本には，例えば「指を接着剤で貼り合わせてみる」だとか「９Ｖ電池を舐めてみる」だとか，そういった「あまり深刻ではない，ちょっと危険なこと」が５０項目載せられている。
この本が伝えようとしていることは，著者が 2007 年の TED において行った講演 「 子どもがすべき５つの危険なこと」を見ればよく分かる（下記のリンクから日本語字幕付きで見ることができる）。
TED2007 - ゲーバー・タリー：子どもがすべき５つの危険なこと
現代社会は子どもを危険から遠ざけようとする傾向にある。これは，本当に子供とって必要なことだから行われているのか，それとも単に企業が訴訟のリスクを最小化しようとして行っているのか，僕にはどちらなのかよく分からない。しかし少なくとも著者のゲーバー・タリーは，このような傾向によって，子どもたちが周囲の世界との接し方を学ぶ機会から遠ざけられていると考えている。
この本のタイトルはちょっと挑発的だけれど，実際に教えようとしていることは，身の回りの世界をコントロールするための知識と経験であり，それは結果として安全へと繋がるものでもある。
とてもユニークで創造的な発想の本だと思う。
ところで，上の TED のプレゼンで特にユニークだと感じたのは，５つ目の「 危険なこと」が
" Break the DMCA " （「デジタル著作権法を破ってみる」）であるということだ。法律というものは，ごくありふれた一連の行動によって，ふいに破られてしまうことがある。特に著作権法について，僕は子供の頃にそういった事実を教えてもらった記憶が無い。今の子どもたちはいつの時点で，著作権法を破るという「危険なこと」を学ぶんだろう？
( CNN ) --
The University of California San Diego has suspended a student who admitted to hanging a noose in a campus library , school officials announced Friday .
" We are feeling real pain , and we will take real action , " said UCSD chancellor Marye Anne Fox told reporters .
" The safety of our students , faculty , and staff is my primary concern . "
The student , whose identity was not released , admitted Friday to police at the University of California San Diego that she hung a noose Thursday night in the library , police said .
" Detectives have interviewed the student and taken a statement , " UCSD police said in a release .
" The investigation is ongoing as we continue to identify and interview witnesses . "
After Thursday 's discovery , hundreds of people joined a campus rally to oppose racial intolerance .
" It 's OK to feel hurt and angry about this , " said one participant .
" We 've been silent for too long . "
Watch iReport of campus protest
One student said she feared for her safety .
The student 's admission came the day after police were alerted to the presence of the noose in a library bookcase at the school .
Fox said the admission was a result of " pressure from our UC San Diego community . "
" This underscores the fact that our university is banding together , " she said .
In a crime alert bulletin , police said they received several reports Thursday around 10:30 p.m. of the noose on the seventh floor of the Geisel Library .
It was found hanging in an aisle facing windows .
" Officers spoke with people who were in the area , but no one witnessed the noose being placed on the bookcase , " police said in a campus notice .
Hanging a noose with intent to terrorize is a crime , it noted .
On Friday , the school announced several measures it was taking in response to recommendations from its Black Student Union .
They include the establishment of a task force on minority faculty recruitment , a new commission to addressing declining African - American enrollment and finding space for an African - American resource center .
" I want to emphasize these are the initial steps , and I realize we have a lot of work ahead of us , " Fox said .
The noose incident occurred two weeks after Black History Month was mocked in an off - campus party that was condemned by the school .
It 's unclear how long the student is suspended for .
More than half of all the jobs claimed  325,000  were those of educators that states said they were able to keep on the job thanks to stimulus aid .
But some school districts said that they might not have actually laid off teachers without the stimulus money .
Many Head Start programs reported saving the jobs of employees who in fact had simply been given raises with stimulus money  putting their claims of 8,000 jobs under review .
Many states and private companies seem to have used different criteria when estimating whether stimulus aid had saved jobs or not , and when calculating full - time positions .
The reports , for all their shortcomings , do provide the first check of how the stimulus bill is working so far .
They suggest that more than half the jobs claimed so far are in the public sector  despite the fact that President Obama has said that he expects only 10 percent of stimulus jobs to be in the public sector .
A computer analysis by The New York Times of government reports showed that at least 30,000 of the jobs were being claimed in highway , street and bridge construction , and at least 14,000 were with transit agencies .
The analysis found that the $ 5 billion push to weatherize homes , which was delayed in many states because of uncertainty over how much money the workers should be paid , had yielded only a little over 5,000 jobs so far , nearly half of which were in Ohio .
The reports , which have been posted on the government ’s Web site , www.recovery.gov, provide unusual transparency for government spending , showing how much money each contractor has received and where the work has been done , right down to the ZIP code .
But they seem to raise as many questions as they answer .
The reports make no distinction between a newly created job and a saved job .
They do not specify whether a job is in the public or private sector .
And descriptions of the work vary in detail , making it difficult to categorize some work and to compare how various programs are doing .
TAIPEI , Taiwan —
The first time Taiwanese metal band Chthonic toured America , audiences did n't exactly give them a warm welcome .
" They stood there with open mouths , and some shouted that they wanted to see the headline band instead , " recalled bassist Doris Yeh , in an interview early this month .
But Chthonic would typically silence the hecklers with their first tight , bone - crunching number .
" I do n't think they were prepared for seeing a band from the Orient , " said Yeh .
" They were shocked by our outfits and songs . "

Chthonic has played Taiwan since the mid-1990s , mixing an " extreme metal " sound , derived from Scandinavian bands , with Asian flavors and a strong pro-Taiwan political stance .
Now , the band is starting to win converts abroad , too .
They 're recently back from a second tour of the U.S. and Europe , which featured songs from their latest album , " Mirror of Retribution , " slickly produced by Anthrax guitarist Rob Caggiano in English and Chinese versions .
Chthonic was named second best band in Terrorizer magazine 's 2009 reader poll , after Behemoth .
Chad Bowar , the heavy metal editor at About.com , said in an email that when it comes to the best - known Asian metal band on the scene now , it 's now a " toss - up " between Chthonic and two Japanese acts , Sigh and Dir En Grey .
" Their look is definitely unique , with the makeup , and using traditional Taiwanese instruments like the erhu ( a mournful string instrument ) also sets them apart , " said Bowar , explaining Chthonic 's appeal .
" Their political activities help keep them in the spotlight . "
" The music is also very good , and without that the other things would n't matter . "
Bassist
Yeh 's sex appeal can't hurt , either .
She 's posed for FHM Taiwan and , to judge by fan websites , has already inspired more than a few metalhead crushes .
" She 's like three or four fetishes rolled into one , " quipped one fan at Chthonic 's recent show in Taipei .
Yeh 's on a roll :
She was voted the second most popular bassist in the Terrorizer reader poll , made Revolver magazine 's " Hottest Chicks in Metal " calendar and was featured as GQ Taiwan 's " GQ girl " for this January .
Strong politics
In Taiwan , the band — especially 33 - year - old songwriter and vocalist Freddy Lim — is well known for their outspoken politics .
" Freddy , " as he 's known here , was a regular on political talk shows in the lead - up to the 2008 presidential election , and rallied youth support for the pro-independence party .
Now , Lim says he 's told producers he's not interested in more talk show appearances , despite the easy pay ( about $ 150 per show ) .
He 'd rather go on the unpaid university lecture circuit to speak out on his favorite causes .
" I want to influence young people on issues like Tibet , and global human rights , " said Lim .
" Tibetans , Uighurs , people in Myanmar — they face even worse situations than Taiwan .
As Taiwanese , I feel we have the power and responsibility to support them . "
Such causes have n't made Chthonic any friends in the Chinese government .
Lim says he 's been to China seven times , but has n't been able to go after he organized a " Free Tibet " concert in 2003 .
Said Yeh : " We know we 're on the blacklist . "
Lim says he would love to tour China again , and that he stands on the side of Chinese human rights fighters .
" I 'm not anti-China , I 'm anti-Chinese government , " he emphasizes .
The problem is n't the Chinese Communist Party 's ideology , but its repression .
" China 's communists are n't communists , " said Lim .
" They 're communist in name , but they 're really just tyrannical bastards . "
Historical anger
Lim started the band in 1996 , inspired by Scandinavian acts like Norway 's Emperor and Sweden 's
At the Gates .
But though he loved such music , he could n't relate to the cultural symbols and messages , especially the anti-Christian themes .
" I 'm always an outsider in their culture , " said Lim .
" The percentage of Christians here is very low , so there 's no reason for us to be anti-Christian . "
A search for themes to inspire Chthonic 's lyrics and message led him to local history instead .
" I felt like , if I want to write my own extreme metal songs with the same anger and feeling , it would n't be anti-Christian , or Satanic , because I have no emotion or passion about that . "
" So I started to think more locally .
What I really care about is my homeland . "
In Taiwan 's history , Lim found plenty to be angry about .
" The whole of Taiwan 's history is one of oppression by different empires — Dutch , Spanish , Japanese and Chinese , " he said .
The oppression persists , this time from China 's current government , which has some 1,300 missiles pointed at Taiwan and has vowed to some day absorb the self - ruled island , by military force if need be .
" We 're under another kind of oppression , so we write our songs from these roots , and we put in stories from history , " said Yeh .
Hear more from
Yeh in this interview :
One album 's theme was Taiwan Aborigines ' resistance to Japanese colonial rule ( 1895 - 1945 ) .
The latest album , " Mirror of Retribution , " tells the story of a spirit medium who journeys to hell to try to steal the book of life and death so he can rewrite Taiwan 's history .
The backdrop is the real - life 228 massacre of 1947 , when Kuomintang troops under Chiang Kai - shek slaughtered tens of thousands of local Taiwanese who had risen up against the KMT 's bumbling , tyrannical rule .
Lim said the story was one way to introduce fans to the " oriental philosophy of hell , " which includes 18 levels , 100 small levels and 10 courts presided over by 10 ghost kings .
Welcoming confrontation
In a packed basement club in Taipei in late December , scores of Taiwanese banged their heads in unison and made the " devil 's horns " sign with their upraised hands .
Now and then a fan threw in the air a fistful of paper " ghost money , " traditionally burned here to appease ancestors or wandering spirits .
On stage , Lim screamed into the microphone between strands of long black hair , one booted foot planted on a monitor .
His voice was nearly drowned out by a thunderous wall of distorted guitar and furious drumming .
When the number was over , two well - dressed youngsters took the stage to hand Freddy a bouquet of flowers .
The gift was from a pro-independence candidate , who just won a county commissioner 's post , to thank Freddy for his support .
It was clearly a love - fest for Chthonic and their loyal Taiwanese fans .
On the first U.S. tour , though , Freddy said they heard that some Chinese students — angered by the band 's pro-Taiwan stance — wanted to protest outside one of their gigs in California .
In the end , it did n't happen .
" Most of our fans there were very strong guys with tattoos — Mexicans , white guys — and some older Taiwanese - Americans too , " said Lim , with a chuckle .
" I do n't think the Chinese students wanted to fight them . "
He said he has n't yet been confronted by Chinese students at lectures , as happened recently here to a prominent , exiled Chinese democracy activist .
( Taiwan 's government is allowing Chinese students to study here in increasing numbers . )
In any case , Lim welcomes such showdowns and said they 're healthy for Taiwan .
" If you do n't deal with Chinese people and talk to them , you do n't know how different you are , and how different your values are , " said Lim .
" Without the people you hate , you do n't know the people you love . "
Chthonic hopes to tour the U.S. and Europe again before September , when their American visas expire .
Another album is in the works for 2011 .
They 're currently looking for a new manager .
Engadget 's iconic and recognizable logo has a long history of being used in unauthorized ways .

Nice work , Canada !

I ’m about two months late with this post but I thought I should at least read the Twilight books and see the New Moon film before I made any comment .
( Note : Spoilers follow ) .
For a while there , almost every Google alert I got for the phrase “ porn for women ” came from some columnist or blogger declaring the books and films to be thus .
It ’s an offhand way of dismissing the immense popularity of these teenage vampire books , similar to the way romance novels are marginalised .
“ Oh , ” huff the critics , “ it ’s all just fluffy romantic nonsense .
Porn for women . ”
( Because women do n’t like real porn , of course .
We ’re too girly for that .
Sex is icky , remember ? )
I ’d like to declare that the Twilight Saga is not porn for women .
Mainly because it ’s not porn .
Duh .
Oh sure , the films certainly offer female viewers plenty of eye candy , especially New Moon which features a whole pack of buff young men running around without shirts on .
“ You ’re kind of beautiful , ” Bella tells Jacob , saying out loud what we ’re all thinking .
Meanwhile , Edward ’s brooding , yellow - eyed paleness has its own distinctly emo appeal .
Yes , no doubt about it , the guys are gorgeous and it ’s great that the female gaze is so evident in this movie .
It ’s absolutely a film made FOR female viewers , something that ’s still quite rare .
But it ’s not porn because there ’s just not enough sex .
Rather , it ’s romance , plain and simple .
The Twilight books stick firmly to the old - fashioned Mills and Boon script of love , marriage , then sex followed almost immediately by children .

I found myself having something of a love - hate relationship with the books as I read them , both guiltily enjoying the luxury of a good romantic novel while still feeling very frustrated about the sexual dynamics of the whole thing .
Almost everyone agrees that vampirism is a metaphor for sex and that ’s part of the appeal .
The first three Twilight novels seem to be an ode to abstinence which is perhaps not surprising that the author is a Mormon .
Despite Bella ’s determination to do the wild thing with Edward it does n’t happen until the fourth book and even then , only when they ’re safely married and on honeymoon .
And what ’s worse … she fades the scene to black before anything happens !
I must confess , I actually yelled at the book at that point .
“ No ! ” I said .
“ Where are the goddam juicy bits ?!
How could you do this to me , you bitch ! ”
Despite the coyness of Meyer ’s writing , it ’s apparent that “ sex ” for Edward and Bella can only mean penis - in - vagina intercourse ; there ’s no scope for any other kind of loveplay , despite the fact that the act is extremely dangerous for Bella .
Have n’t vampires heard of mutual masturbation ?
And then the couple seem to get pregnant on their very first shag .
Porn for women ?
Pah !
The whole thing just felt too white - picket - fence and conservative for me to find it intellectually appealing .
And yet … having expressed that frustration , I should now acknowledge two things .
The first being that the book is for teenage girls and thus blow - by - blow descriptions of human - vampire sex may be a bit inappropriate and also decrease possible sales .
Secondly , part of the appeal of the Twilight series is the thrill of delaying the moment .
As Dr Frank - n- Furter might have said , the books and movies make us shiver with anticip ….ation .
I ploughed my way through thousands of pages waiting for them to finally get it on and , if nothing else , it kept me motivated .
While I ca n’t support the idea of abstinence as a good thing simply because someone declares it to be “ right ” , Twilight at least makes it seem appealing for it ’s own sake .
There ’s something to be said for the idea of delayed satisfaction , of holding back and letting the mouth water a little longer than necessary .
And that , perhaps , is another reason why these books are n’t porn .
Because porn is about self gratification and fantasy , something that often does n’t include any kind of anticipation or delay .
So part of me rebels against the ideological grounding behind the book and at the same time I found myself enjoying the results .
See what I mean about love - hate ?
Others have criticised the way Bella is so passive and self absorbed .
They say the books promote the idea of giving everything up for a boy if your emotions dictate that you must .
I do n’t really have an issue with those things .
It is , after all , a teenage love story and I remember feeling the same way when I was 16 .
Twilight is emotionally honest , even if it seems angst - filled or over - the - top to adults .
And if nothing else , I see the books as a gateway to the literature upon which Meyer based her plot .
There ’s one more thing that makes me want to wave the flag for these books and films , despite their many flaws .
It ’s the fact that Twilight unashamedly speaks to women .
The author and the filmmakers know their audience and they ’ve made an effort to cater to that audience without compromising .
The result is a multi-million dollar franchise that has spawned a bunch of imitators and made Hollywood realise that the much derided “ chick flick ” might actually be worth pursuing .
It ’s also created a spiteful anti-Twilight backlash that may simply be motivated by scorn for “ girly nonsense . ”
Hence the derogatory use of the phrase “ porn for women . ”
For an excellent critique of the way Twilight ’s popularity has been marginalised in the mainstream media , read Sady Doyle ’s excellent article Girls Just Want To Have Fangs .
Twilight is more than a teen dream .
It ’s a massive cultural force .
Yet the very girliness that has made it such a success has resulted in its being marginalized and mocked .
Of course , you wo n’t find many critics lining up to defend Dan Brown or Tom Clancy , either ; mass - market success rarely coincides with literary acclaim .
But male escapist fantasies — which , as anyone who has seen Die Hard or read those Tom Clancy novels can confirm , are not unilaterally sophisticated , complex , or forward - thinking — tend to be greeted with shrugs , not sneers .
The Twilight backlash is vehement , and it is just as much about the fans as it is about the books .
Specifically , it ’s about the fact that those fans are young women .??
Doyle also points out that because Edward is not your stereotypically macho hero ( he ’s pale , beautiful , talks about his feelings , sparkles occasionally ) , he ’s easily derided by men as being not manly enough .
Never mind that women find him extremely attractive , the guys wo n’t have a bar of it .
Bring on the muscles , they demand .
This Edward bloke is n’t enough of a proper vampire !
He ’s just so… poofy !
I find Edward to be very appealing , if a little … stalky .
He ’s infintely superior to the boofy and obnoxious Jacob who I was ready to kill by the end of the third book ( buffed abs or no ) .
So there it is , my delayed critique on the whole Twilight shebang .
Not a literary masterpiece by any means but still a cultural phenomenon worth studying and , yes , occasionally praising .
The only question that remains is this : can Twilight ever be porn for women ?
Well , I ’m thinking the rights might be a little hard to acquire .
But beyond that … it might be a project worth doing .
Think of the possibilities : Gorgeous pale vampire guy , hot buffed werewolf guy , cute human girl … cue the MMF threesome .
I think most of us would n’t mind seeing that .
Scientists conduct weightless experiments with an electron beam designed to fabricate spare parts .
A prototype may head to the International Space Station .
Space explorers have yet to get their hands on the replicator of " Star Trek " to create anything they might require .
But NASA hasdeveloped a technology that could enable lunar colonists to carry out on - sitemanufacturing on the moon , or allow future astronauts to create critical spareparts during the long trip to Mars .
The method , called electron beam freeform fabrication ( EBF3 ) , uses anelectron beam to melt metals and build objects layer by layer .
Such an approachalready promises to cut manufacturing costs for the aerospace industry , andcould pioneer development of new materials .
It has also thrilled astronauts on the InternationalSpace Station by dangling the possibility of designing new tools or objects , researchers said .
" They get up there , and all they have is time andimagination , " said Karen Taminger , the materials research engineer headingthe project at NASA ?s Langley Research Center in Virginia .
Taminger 's project has undergone microgravity tests aboard NASA 's " vomit comet " aircraft .
Now she hopes to get EBF3 scheduled forlaunch to the International Space Station , so that space trials can commence .
Shaping metals at will
EBF3 requires a few crucial components : power for its electron beam , avacuum environment , and a source of metals .
While Star Trek ?s replicatorcould work without a supply of subatomic particles , reality is a different story .
" It 'd be nice if we could build something from nothing , but itdoes n't work that way , " Taminger told SPACE.com .
For EBF3 , metal wires continually feed into the tip of an electron beam .
The beam melts the wires and applies them carefully on top of a rotating plateto build an object up slowly , layer by layer .
A few similar technologies exist , but EBF3 has several advantages .
First , its electron beam requires far less power than comparable devices andproduces less radiation compared to more powerful beams .
Its dual wire feeders alsoallow scientists to create mixes of new materials that vary in strength orother properties within the same solid piece .
" We can change the composition on the fly , " Tamingerexplained .
" You can add alloys of different chemistries and then adjustthe speed that you feed the wires , and that would change the chemistry of theparts we build . "
The flexibility of the manufacturing could also embed fiber optic cablesinside a solid piece of metal , either for use in communication or formonitoring stresses within the manufactured part .
Major aerospace manufacturers have already begun running thousands ofstrength tests with the EBF3 device to see whether it can produce certifiedparts for engines and airframes , researchers said .
They foresee cost savings ofup to $ 1,000 per pound of manufactured parts , compared to the usual forging andmachining methods that require a 6,000 - pound block of titanium to produce a300 - pound part .
Testing in microgravity
Early " vomit comet " tests on NASA 's C - 9 aircraft showed thatEBF3 could work well in a zero -g environment .
Taminger and her team managed tobuild a number of parts that looked exactly the same as parts built on Earth , down to the microstructure scale .
Some researchers had predicted that the method would fail to produceanything but " ball bearings , " or liquid metallic spheres in zero -g .
But the wire feeders successfully deposited the metal layers onto the rotatingplate as usual , except for the occasional misaligned wire that would create agrowing sphere on its end .
" We learned a lot more when things went wrong , " Taminger said .
" When things go wrong in zero - gravity , you just do n't have as muchexperience to guess what would happen . "
The effects of zero-g often comically exaggerated any mistakes , andallowed the team to improve the overall process for Earth manufacturing aswell .
They even ran a few experimental tests going from zero-g to two gees asthe C - 9 aircraft would pull out of its steep dive .
The big next step for EBF3 involves going to the space station .
Tamingerhas already gotten the device down to a " suitcase style experiment " that fits within a volume of less than eight cubic feet , but still needsfunding and a possible slot aboard one of the remaining space shuttle missions .
The device could also go up on a contracted NASA flight with the Russian Soyuzrockets , or even a private launch .
Going to the space station means that EBF3 can take advantage of thevacuum environment in space , and sit on an outside rack -- perhaps the " back porch " of Japan 's Kibospace lab .
Spare parts for Mars
Beyond low - Earth orbit , such new manufacturing technology could enablespace colonists to use local metal resources mined fromthe moon , Mars or in the asteroid belt .
Past simulations have also shown that spaceships would require manyspare parts for the long journey to Mars , because different parts failed duringeach simulation .
But the total weight of parts that failed during each run wasroughly the same , which suggests a Mars mission could simply take along metalfeedstock and an EBF3 device .
" If we 've got a broken part , we can even repurpose that intofeedstock , or can we mine new material , " Taminger said .
" The shortterm solution is that you bring along the material you need , but you do n't needto bring the parts that you need . "
The EBF3 device probably wo n't churn out spare parts immediately , if itreaches the space station .
But astronauts who have seen the device in actionhave expressed excitement over the idea of making their own tools , 21st centurypioneer style .
" They can build a shovel , or a clamp or a widget , or whatever theymight come up with , " Taminger said .
" They 're not just stuck with thetoolbox they brought along . "

The Apollo astronauts knew that moon dust was troublesome stuff .
Now that dust could limit our ability to find cracks in Einstein ’s general theory of relativity .
Many of our best tests of relativity come from lunar ranging experiments .
Several times a month , teams of astronomers from three observatories blast the moon with pulses of light from a powerful laser and wait for the reflections from a network of mirrors placed on the lunar surface by the Apollo 11 , 14 and 15 missions , as well as two Soviet Lunokhod landers .
By timing the light ’s round trip , they can pinpoint the distance to the moon with an accuracy of around a millimetre – a measurement so precise that it has the potential to reveal problems with general relativity .
But now Tom Murphy from the University of California , San Diego , who leads one of the teams at the Apache Point Observatory in Sunspot , New Mexico , thinks the mirrors have become coated in moon dust .
“ The lunar reflectors are not as good as they used to be by a factor of 10 , ” he says .

Photons gone missing
The fainter light is a problem for lunar ranging experiments .
Out of every 100 million billion ( 1017 ) photons Murphy ’s team fires at the moon , only a handful make it back to Earth .
Most of are absorbed by Earth ’s atmosphere on the way to the moon and back , or miss the mirrors altogether .
Murphy first suspected two years ago that the dust problem was cutting the light down even further .
He was puzzled to detect far fewer photons than he expected , even when the atmospheric conditions were perfect .
His team also saw a further drop when the moon was full and used to joke about the full moon curse .
This gave Murphy some clues .
He suspects that moon dust is either coating the surface of the mirrors or has scratched them .
Both scenarios would increase the amount of heat the mirrors absorb , and so during a full moon , sunlight falling on the mirrors would heat them up and change their optical properties .
As a result , the mirrors would not reflect light as efficiently .
Even though the moon has no atmosphere , dust can be stirred up from the surface by the impact of micrometeorites .
Traces of dust
Murphy has scoured measurements stretching back to the 1970s and found that the problem first appeared between 1979 and 1984 , and has been getting worse .
However he is unwilling to predict if the mirrors will deteriorate further .
The Apache Point experiment can still make measurements , but the degradation is a bigger problem for other lunar ranging experiments that use less powerful lasers .
More measurements from different sites would improve the limits on general relativity .
Murphy ’s findings also highlight problems that astronomers might face if they ever build a telescope on the moon .
The results were reported at the American Physical Society meeting in Washington DC and have been submitted to the journal Icarus .
George Lucas ' live - action Star Wars TV series is still moving forward in Australia , and little clues are slowly popping up here and there as to which characters will turn up , and which Star Wars film will it most emulate .

Author Karen Traviss announced a while back that she is no longer writing her long - awaited Boba Fett novel .
The author explained that contract issues were getting in the way of her story line , and it seems like what she was planning for Boba Fett , and what Lucas was planning on his new TV series , conflicted .
Yes , the Boba Fett novel was canceled by the publisher because of potential canon clashes with the upcoming TV series , as you have already heard from other sources .
No , I really do n't have a clue what those clashes might be .
Sorry .

We can only assume that Traviss was planning to base her portrayal of Boba Fett on the canon already established in the six movies — and the TV series is planning to make some major change , or addition , to that canon .
Still , this means more Boba on the screen , which is always a good thing .
So where is this new series set ?
According to Wookiepedia and The Celebrity Cafe , it takes place in the " dark times " between the last prequel and A New Hope .
And if you remember , that 's when most of the Jedi and anti-emperor politicians were hunted down and killed .
It 's being toted as a gritty and dark series , which will star many minor characters as we now know Boba Fett , but also C - 3PO , and Emperor Palpatine ( nothing has been officially confirmed yet ) .

As far as past Star Wars characters like Han , Luke and Leia , Mark Hamill says he does n't think there would be a role for him as in this time period Luke would be even younger than he was in A New Hope .
But the actor did praise the decision to return to focusing on the story , instead of the sizzle of CG FX and tedious lightsaber fights .
In an interview with Total Film Magazine Lucas explained that it would be more like the original than the prequels , "
It 's [ a ] lot more talky .
It 's more of what I would call a soap opera with a bunch of personal dramas in it .
It 's not really based on action - adventure films from the '30s - it 's actually more based on film noir movies from the ' 40s ! "

And , of course , they wo n't have Star Wars - type funds to make everything CG , so hopefully this will reinforce the " story comes first " motto .

Twenty bucks ?
It cost a friend of mine $ 50 to see Air Supply at a local casino ( and yes , I am reevaluating our friendship based upon her musical tastes ) .
But $ 20 - - what a deal .
So how'd they do ?
Though the Arkansas Republican Party sold differently priced upper - level and lower - level tickets to the event at the 18,000 - seat Verizon Arena , less than half of the seats in the lower bowl were occupied , and the entire upper level was shrouded by black drapes .
Pictured : Sarah Palin at Verizon Arena .
The news was n't all bad :
The dining tables that had been set up on arena ’s floor , however , were full with suckers donors who had contributed $ 175 .
And no Palin diary would be complete without at least one bit of idiocy :
When she was asked what she believed was the number one threat to America today , several audience members shouted , " Obama ! "
Palin then chimed in as many in the crowd laughed .
" See , they said that , I did n’t , " she said .
" Just you watch now , too , because somebody will be here with their little Twittering thing , and it ’s going to be on the Internet any minute now . "
The " little Twittering thing " ?
Does that have something to do with the internets or the Google ?
It ’s been 16 months since Eugene and Patricia Harrison last paid the mortgage on their Perris home .
Eleven months since the notice got slapped on their front door , warning that it would be sold at auction .
A terse letter from a lawyer came eight months ago , telling them that their lender now owned the house .
Three months later , the bank told them to pay up or get out by the end of the week .
Still , they remain in the yellow ranch - style home they bought seven years ago for $ 128,000 , with its views of the San Jacinto Mountains .
They ’re not planning on going anywhere .
“ We ’re kind of on pins and needles , but who ’d want to leave when you put this kind of energy into a house ? ” said Eugene Harrison , 70 , gesturing toward a bucolic mural of mountains , stream and flowers the couple painted on the living room wall .
Throughout the country , people continue to default on their home loans -- but lenders have backed off on forced evictions , allowing many to remain in their homes , essentially rent - free .
Several factors are driving the trend , industry experts say , including government pressure on banks to modify loans and keep people in their homes .
And with a glut of inventory in places like Southern California ’s Inland Empire , Nevada and Arizona , lenders are loath to depress housing prices further by dumping more properties into a weak market .
Finally , allowing borrowers to stay in their homes helps protect the bank ’s investment as it negotiates with the homeowners , said Gary Kirshner , a spokesman for Chase bank , a major lender .
“ If the person ’s in the property , there ’s less chance for vandalism , and they ’re probably maintaining the house , ” he said .
Economists say the situation wo n’t last forever , but in the meantime the “ amnesty ” may allow at least some homeowners to regain their financial footing and avoid eviction .
In the Inland Empire , an estimated 100,000 homeowners are living rent - free , according to economist John Husing , who based that number on the difference between loan delinquencies and foreclosures .
Industry experts say it ’s difficult to say how many families are in that situation nationally because only banks know for sure how many customers have stopped paying entirely .
But Rick Sharga of Irvine data tracker RealtyTrac notes that the number of loans in which the borrower has n’t made a payment in 90 days or more but is not in foreclosure is at 5.1 % nationally , a record high .
And yet the number of foreclosures last year was 2.9 million , below the 3.2 million that RealtyTrac economists predicted .
More evidence is provided by another firm , ForeclosureRadar , which says it now takes an average of 229 days for a bank to foreclose on a home in California after sending a notice of default , up from 146 days in August 2008 .
“ For some reason , banks are being more lenient with homeowners who are behind on their loans , ” Sharga said .
“ Whether it ’s a strategy to try and slow down the volume of foreclosures or simply a matter of the banks being able to keep up with volume is something that banks only know for sure . ”
Lenders say the trend reflects their efforts to work with borrowers to modify loans to avoid foreclosure .
Bank of America “ continues to exhaust every possible option to qualify customers for modification or other solutions , ” spokeswoman Jumana Bauwens said .
Some lenders are making it a policy to partner with delinquent borrowers .
Citibank said this month that it would let borrowers on the brink of foreclosure stay at their homes for six months , whether or not they make payments , if they turn over their property deed .
Such policies may partly reflect the fact that lenders can’t keep up with all the foreclosures , some say .
“ The mortgage lenders are so backlogged that some people are able to slip through the cracks , ” said Kathryn Davis , a real estate agent at America ’s Real Estate Advocates in Corona .
That was apparently the case for the Harrisons , who were told at various times that their house had been sold , that it belonged to someone else and that it was empty .
“ It ’s been frustrating , a real major pain in the buttocks , ” said Eugene Harrison , a nondenominational minister with a clipped mustache and a sudden laugh .
The Harrisons missed their first payment in October 2008 , shortly after Patricia Harrison , 57 , lost her job as a healthcare aide and her husband ’s part - time towing work dried up .
They said they applied for a loan modification with Countrywide Financial ( since acquired by Bank of America ) but were told that they could n’t receive one until they were three months behind on their payments .
So they stopped paying .
In April 2009 , they received a notice warning them that their property “ may be sold at a public sale , ” and in July , they were told their house was a bank - owned property .
he bank sent a notice by FedEx in October demanding $ 3,000 , and when the Harrisons called to discuss this notice , they were told they had four days to vacate the house .
Panicked , they arranged to stay with family in New Mexico and started packing their things , filling their garage with boxes of books , camping equipment and art .
But no one came to kick them out .
“ We were afraid to leave the house , afraid the sheriff was going to come , ” said Patricia Harrison , an amateur painter .
After contacting consumer advocates about their situation , the Harrisons decided to stay put .
Soon after , two men in a white pickup truck showed up at the house and peeped in the windows , telling the Harrisons that they thought the house was abandoned .
The Harrisons suspected they were planning to move in themselves and chased them away .
The couple do n’t want to leave but are in the midst of a running dispute with Bank of America about the terms of their loan modification .
The bank says it mailed them documents this month .
As they wade through the red tape , the Harrisons can’t imagine abandoning a house where they ’ve left their mark in the goldenrod and potpourri rose walls , the new fixtures and stenciling in the bathrooms , the fruit trees planted in the yard .
Although the Harrisons ’ future is uncertain , industry observers agree that the rent - free life ca n’t last forever .
As home values climb , banks will find it financially advantageous to foreclose on delinquent borrowers and sell their properties .
“ In many cases , particularly in California , people owe a boatload of payments , and no bank is going to forgive that , ” said Guy Cecala , editor of Inside Mortgage Finance , a trade publication .
In Diamond Bar , the Fraguere family is finally moving on after living rent - free for 18 months .
Job loss and other setbacks prevented them from paying their mortgage , but they say they did n’t hear anything from the bank , First Franklin , until a real estate agent showed up at their door last month saying she was going to sell their house .
Sandy Fraguere was n’t surprised that it had taken the bank so long to ask them to move .
“ I do n’t think they really knew what was going on or who was there , ” she said .
Next stop for the Fragueres is a hotel , where they plan to stay for two weeks until their apartment in Chino Hills is ready for them to move in .
Their dogs are being boarded and their belongings stored until they can retrieve them someday .
Their children , ages 8 and 9 , are being steeled for more instability .
The Fragueres have started saying goodbye to their neighbors , adding yet another empty house to a block that has already seen two other families forced to pack up and leave .

Earlier this week we asked you what your email prejudices were .
We dug through the comments , and now we 're back to highlight how you feel about certain email addresses and what they say about the people who use them .
Advertisement
Opinions were passionate in comments on the article , and as of the writing of this followup are approaching nearly 500 strong .
From among all the comments several clear opinions emerged on the state of email and selecting an email provider and username .
Advertisement
The username you select is vastly more important than the provider you use .
Firstname.lastname@aol.com is preferred to and more respectable than sexkitten2010@aol.com — cutesy , offensive , or unprofessional nicknames are big mistakes .
Domains are important , especially in technology - related fields .
An AOL address might be just as serviceable as any other address when it comes to sending and receiving mail but to most people in tech fields it says " Hi. I 'm from 1996 .
What is this internet you speak of ? "
As an IT exec , I definitely made judgments against prospective hires based on email addresses ( as well as a wide array of other factors ) .
It was n't uncommon for me to have 100 - 500 resumes for a single open position , and I did n't care to rely on HR to sort through them , so I did it myself , and I needed some way to get down to a short - list of around 10 people .
As such , it was pretty easy to toss a resume because somebody had a goofy email address .
And I would certainly raise an eyebrow at a supposed IT tech who had an AOL.com address .
- Mike De Lucia
As an IT manager in the tech field , I have to say that I 'm a little prejudice when it comes to using a Hotmail or AOL address for business or on a resume .
AOL is a more dated personal email address .
Hotmail is known as an email for kids , for people who do n't care if their mail is thrown out if they do n't log in for awhile , and for a spam throwaway address .

More concerning than people using inappropriate emails handles on their resumes ?
Businesses that do n't have their own domain and personalized email .
SomeCompany@sbcglobal.net or SomeDude2049@yahoo.com were huge turn offs to readers and many expressed that they would question the professionalism of a company with such an unpolished image and do business elsewhere .
I'm a photographer and also wonder when I see other photographers without a domain name email .
It seems as though they are n't serious about their career if they have n't taken the time to create a website and therefore have a domain name email .
- veronykah
The flood of comments was n't without dissenting opinion by any measure ; many commenters weighed in pointing out that it was superficial and judgmental to make snap decisions based on an email address .
I do n't understand the prejudice against hotmail .
I 've had my hotmail address for like 15 + years .
Though I 've had it so long I was able to choose @msn.com for my address .
Fortunately I took it over hotmail.com so maybe people do n't look down on me quite so much .
When I see a hotmail.com address , I think , 'wow , that person 's been using email for a long time . '
Read the rest of mrknowitall 's comment here ..
One astute observation made by several readers was that it's a huge hassle to switch email providers so most people never bother .
One reader even noted that the hassle - factor could be a big reason why people get defensive :
This issue comes up every now and then , and it always gets people so riled up .
People get defensive because so many e-mail services entrench their users - they can't switch to a new one without a lot of hassle .

As we noted in the original post , email addresses have become ubiquitous and because we hand them out so liberally in professional and social situations it is worth taking the time to assess what your email address says about you .
Your cute username might have been novel back in high school or college but entering the professional world it 's definitely time to retire SexyStud99 in favor of John .
R.Smith .
Like your clothing , your hair style , and your manner of speaking , your email address is part of your personal image .
Certainly it 's a type of prejudice that a hiring manager might look over you because you have an " antiquated " email address or a " stupid " username , but that 's not entirely different than a hiring manager being unimpressed that you showed up to a job interview sans a neck tie .
Sure it might be unimportant or silly to you and you might say " I would n't want to work at a company that uptight anyhow , " but it 's worth taking into consideration because whether or not a prejudice — big or small !— is fair or reasonable , it is still out there .

Have an email - related story ?
An awkward moment revolving around an email address ?
Some insight as someone who handles applications or other hiring processes ?
Let 's hear about it in the comments .
Iranian police have stated strenuously that security forces were n't armed with guns during Dec. 27 clashes in Tehran between security forces and protesters .
But newly discovered amateur video , apparently taken with a cellphone , tells a different story .
In the video , a man can be seen and heard opening fire on a crowd of unarmed demonstrators as a man cries out , " Dishonorable Basiji ! "
The gunman appears to be a plainclothes security official , perhaps a Basiji militiaman or an intelligence operative working for the Revolutionary Guard .
Witnesses say such forces have been trying to terrorize protesters .
But there 's a twist .
Even though he opens fire on the crowd , possibly wounding or killing demonstrators , the protesters do n't scatter away .
Instead they fight back .
" Attack ! " someone calls out .
The 47 - second clip then shows the crowd of unarmed demonstrators , mostly men of all ages , chasing after the gunman .

What happens when you bring together Britain 's former top policeman with two of its most successful crime writers ?
Crime novelist PD James , one of the Today programme 's guest editors , persuaded the former Met commissioner Sir Ian Blair into a studio with fellow crime novelist Lynda Le Plante to discuss the realities of crime fiction .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Sir Ian Blair has a bit of a problem with crime fiction , especially on television .
A friend of the Morse author Colin Dexter , he quips that after reading Dexter 's books " nobody is going to want to be a head of house in Oxford : the average life expectancy is about three weeks " .
But it 's not just the rarity of murder which exercises the former head of the Met - he quotes figures indicating that there are just 130 killings a year in London , a city with a population of eight million - but the frequency of " heavy violence " in crime fiction .
Crime drama is unrecognisable from the days of Sgt. Dixon " The more we see of this the more people are going to be afraid that is what happens so often .
And it does n't happen that often , " he adds .
Beyond this , he believes that on - screen representations of court cases can blur reality , " because evidence that would be acceptable on CSI does n't exist in the British court room .
" As always , literature is a part of art and it mimics real life , but it 's also slightly behind the curve . "
Sir Ian says that the " Nova Scotia effect " is partly to blame for the UK 's fear of crime .
" The murder rate in Nova Scotia and in Great Britain is about the same per head of population , " he says .
" Nova Scotia feels quite safe , in Britain everyone feels pretty unsafe .
" That 's because in Nova Scotia , you only hear about crimes that are either committed in Nova Scotia or that are so appalling they are on CBS News .
" Whereas here , whether its in Aberdeen or Aberdovey , you hear about every incident that happens in Britain ...
Statistically it is still very rare , that does n't make good drama . "
" Order out of disorder " Crime fiction is " slightly behind the curve " according to Sir Ian Blair Crime writer Lynda La Plante , the woman behind Prime Suspect , Widows and Trial & Retribution , does n't worry about violence .
" I suppose I should .
Every time you open the paper there 's another horror , " she admits .
But she sees that , by showing there is a conclusion , crime fiction plays a very important role .
" Case closed .
One is successful in bringing horrendous perpetrators to justice . "
For Sir Ian , the representation of what goes on in court remains problematic .
" There is actually a thing called the CSI effect . " he reveals .
" Juries do n't understand why in this particular case no forensic evidence has been brought forward .
That is because in routine cases the police use very little forensic evidence because it is very expensive to do . "
In reality , he says , detective work can be quite boring .
" Sometimes I find [ CSI ] almost laughable , " La Plante smiles .
" Because you see the woman with long blonde hair - she looks about 18 - she 's one minute a ballistics expert and the next minute she 's doing virtually a pathology test .
" Whereas in forensics when they go into a cadaver they are gowned up for a reason , they are shedding hairs , they are shedding fibres .
Whereas this girl is swishing her hair back from her face and they 're leaning over the body having great conversations over the cadaver , its very unreal . "
Lynda La Plante finds some of CSI to be " laughable " PD James , whose novels featuring the poetic detective Adam Dalgleish have delighted millions of readers , is quick to stand up for the detective story , as opposed to the crime novel , for " bringing order out of disorder " .
" You do n't in the end really get justice , because you only get the fallible justice of men , you do n't get infallible divine justice , you get the best of which you are capable , but you do get a conclusion , and you do get an ending . "
La Plante agrees : " The truth is , we have had a litany of crimes recently that do beggar belief .
When you do have horrendous crimes covering the front page sometimes you think about it .
" Over and over again , we are faced with horrors .
To me , the closure is of great importance .
So I will continue to write crimes that I see in the paper . "

Getting on the freeway the other morning on the way to the office , I noticed the car ahead of me had a Barack Obama ’08 sticker on its bumper .
While that ’s nothing unusual here in Seattle — it ’s practically required — this sticker caught my eye .
It was in Hebrew .
Guessing that the other car must belong to a neighbor or near - neighbor , I was curious to see the face of the person — actually , my uncharitable thought at the moment called him something else — behind the wheel .
I was in for a surprise .
On pulling up parallel with him I realized it was a friendly acquaintance with whom I had enjoyed chatting just the day before .
The guy is far from a fool .
He is someone who , having traveled a spiritual distance from earlier secular commitments , has been striving to bring his and his family ’s life in line with Orthodox Judaism , arguably the world ’s most conservative religion .
Experiences like this underline the enigma that Norman Podhoretz , Commentary ’s legendary longtime editor , seeks to resolve in his new book .
He does so ably , learnedly , charmingly , with his characteristic lucidity and incisiveness — but in a way that falls short , in the end , of solving the mystery .
That ’s not to say there is n’t a lot to learn and enjoy in this valuable work of scholarly journalism .
On the contrary , you ’ll find revelations in every chapter .
The question of why most Jews are liberal has a parallel in the question of why many non-Jews have been anti-Semitic .
You can narrate the history of Jewish liberalism , as Podhoretz does , or the history of anti-Semitism , and still emerge puzzled .
Those two histories can be seen as a single tangled narrative .
There ’s a human tendency to form your opinions , including those about politics , in conformity with the social group to which you feel attached through feelings of warmth and acceptance .
At some point an association crystallized linking the political Right with the Jews ’ traditional persecutor , the Church , and the Left with their liberators , the intellectual movement of the Enlightenment .
Even when the Church changed its stance and when the Right emerged more recently as a much sturdier ally of the Jewish people and the Jewish state , the Jews remained locked in a mindset born in the Middle Ages .
Podhoretz starts his story with the origins of Christian efforts to isolate Jews , in ghettos and specially designated geographic areas .
In France , Poland , and Russia , as early as the ninth century , Church leaders worried that newly Christianized populations were falling under the sway of “ Judaizing ” tendencies .
After the rule of Ivan the Great , in the late 15th century , it seemed a close thing whether the state religion of Russia would be a Jewish heresy .
The “ Heresy of the Judaizers ” ( Zhidovstvuyushchiye ) apparently involved such deviations as denying the Trinity and the divine personhood of Jesus .
Responding with bloody vehemence , the Orthodox Church prevailed , initiating the technique of the pogrom .
The Enlightenment , hostile to Christianity , seemed the Jews ’ ticket to acceptance — except that its spokesmen were often no less hostile to Judaism .
Still , the logic of “ the enemy of my enemy is my friend ” prevailed among the Jews , and the Left because permanently identified with tolerance .
Podhoretz rightly finds this mysterious :
“ The question thus arises of why the Jews who joined the radical camp were not put off by the egregious anti-Semitism of Marx or that of several other major figures of the socialist movement , including Charles Fourier ( to whom the Jews were ‘ the leprosy and the ruin of the body politic ’ ) and Pierre - Joseph Proudhon ( to whom the Jews were ‘ the race which poisons everything [ and ] the enemy of the human race ’ ) . ”
Podhoretz quotes Paul Johnson ’s observation that Marx ’s Capital “ became a new kind of Torah . ”
Through it all , the Jews meanwhile remained oblivious to trends in Christianity that would profoundly alter the attitude of many churches to them .
The Judaizing tendency that had earlier stirred in Russia appeared in a different form among English Puritans who circumcised their boys and observed the Sabbath on Saturday .
One leader , John Traske , was put in prison from 1618 to 1620 for taking Judaic views to an extreme .
Some Pilgrims , on seeking refuge in Amsterdam , went so far as to join the local synagogue .
Their Jewish - themed Christianity fed , of course , one of the roots of American Christianity .
Among 19th - century New England intellectuals , some peculiar ideas sprang up as a result .
Harvard literary scholars Barrett Wendell and James Russell Lowell independently hit on a theory proposing that the Yankee Puritans had not only an affinity with the Old Testament but actual Jewish family roots .
Wendell traced the connection back to Norfolk and Lincolnshire counties , which had once been home to many Jews .
When they were formally expelled from the country in 1290 , some Jews converted and remained , never totally giving up their Jewishness .
These , so the questionable theory goes , were the ancestors of America ’s Puritan settlers .
In a further oddity , Lowell and his fellow literary philo - Semite John Jay Chapman later reversed their views and became raging Jew - haters .
“ Philo - Semitism has often turned into its opposite , ” Podhoretz darkly observes .
The American Civil War initiated a period of anti-Semitism , mostly of the patrician variety , that lasted right up to World War II .
In the world of electoral politics , meanwhile , the Jewish romance with the Democratic party began with Roosevelt and has been going strong ever since .
Since 1928 , in election after election , Jews have supported the Democratic presidential candidate , with , on average , 75 percent of their votes .
Podhoretz documents the deepening “ reversal of roles between Left and Right on issues of Jewish interest . ”
When the Democratic party stood for meeting the Nazi threat aggressively while the Republican party tended to isolationism , voting Democratic made sense .
But why did Jews favor a presidential candidate like McGovern , an isolationist who threatened Jewish economic interests by endorsing race - based quotas , and had little to recommend him other than — note this well — an ersatz intellectual aura ?
Over the same period , on moral issues , the Democrats became the party associated with views anathema to Jewish tradition .
Yet the enamored Jews stayed stunningly loyal .
Whether on gay marriage , suicide , or euthanasia , Jews became the most liberal of all liberal demographic opinion groups .
What accounts for it all ?
Podhoretz goes back to Johnson ’s observation about Capital as the new Torah of the Jews .
Much as in religion , where most Jewish families downgraded their faith from the Orthodoxy of ancient tradition to various modern compromise positions , so , too , having become born again in the socialist church , the Jews nevertheless progressively loosened their orthodoxy there too .
Liberalism is to Marxism what , among Jewish denominations , Reform is to Orthodox .
The problem with the parallel is that there are few if any fervent Reform Jews .
Liberal Jewish religion is by its nature blasé .
But there are many fervent Jewish liberals , and that is precisely the enigmatic fact we are trying to shed light on .
In seeking to do so , an analyst is drawn to settling on one special reason for Jewish liberalism , above all the other possible reasons .
Yet it may be that this particular condition can only be explained by reference to several different causes .
Here are a couple to consider .
Podhoretz too quickly dismisses the most popular explanation , favored by Jewish liberals themselves , that there is an essential Jewish quality — compassion — to which liberalism , or least liberal rhetoric , speaks in a way conservatism does n’t .
This is n’t necessarily to say Jews are more compassionate , but rather that we think of ourselves that way .
The Talmud goes so far as to say if you meet someone claiming to be a Jew who shows no mercy to the needy , you should consider his lineage suspect : “ Be certain he is not a descendant of our forefather Abraham ” ( Beitzah 32 b ) .
Maimonides codifies the observation as a matter of Jewish law .
But the contributing factor that Podhoretz leaves out entirely , and I find this surprising from the author of a book with the title Making It , is the social prestige conferred by one political stance as compared to the other .
“ One of the longest journeys in the world is the journey from Brooklyn to Manhattan — or at least from certain neighborhoods in Brooklyn to certain parts of Manhattan , ” goes the memorable and very Jewish opening sentence in Podhoretz ’s memoir .
You would have a hard time finding a people more finely attuned to degrees of prestige .
Once , religious scholarship was the highest merit among us .
Now , it ’s a certain melding of academic and material accomplishment that really impresses .
And boy , does it impress .
On just these terms , there can be no question that of the two poles in American politics , one is a prestige accoutrement .
Call it the McGovern Factor .
In the circles in which Jews overwhelmingly travel , liberalism is a sign of having made it intellectually and socially , where conservatism smells of everything backward and retrograde .
I speak of perception , of course , not reality .
An Obama bumper sticker , whether in Hebrew or in English , says “ I ’m smart .
I ’m enlightened . ” A McCain - Palin bumper sticker , like the one I ’ve still got on my car , says , “ I ’m not . ”
For many Jews , I regret having to report , that makes all the difference .
Okay so i have been reading up for a day or so and i thought i would need to post this .
Basically in past 2 days people found a way to use a deleted too called Source Film maker , the same tool used to make meet the team videos , that came with First tf2 public beta ( 2 years ago ) i am not yet sure if it is okay to post links or anything as it COULD potentially be considered warez , but it is no different than the method to keep demos from getting broken .
Anyway here are few videos of it in action and i will keep you guys up to date with any needed download links and such for this to work .
Here are few sample videos of it in action .
Not all very good as they are only tests .
And the DODs video is made by valve apparently only shows what its capable of .

You could definietely say they were screencaps from new meet the team videos cause of the quality .
Here is a guide to get it working .
AND A VIDEO HERE
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaHN1tHk1dI
Step 1 : Download Team Fortress 2 Beta .
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3819765/Team_Fortress_2_beta_NoSteam
Step 2 : Install it .
DO NOT INSTALL IN STEAM FOLDER just in case they would be able to track it .
( Yes i know install is weird , a naked guy with his dick censored skulls and some weird music playing but it works i used it . )
Step 3 : Open FINAL_FIXX.rar and put these files in the installation folder of your beta TF2 .
Replace everything .
Step 4 : Download the bin files .
http://www.flamehaus.com/snakez/enginetools.zip
Step 5 : Open the .zip file and put everything in the bin folder of your beta TF2 .
Step 6 : Make a shortcut of hl2.exe Step 7 : Right click , go to properties and in the end of target field put this in
“ - game tf - applaunch 440 - window - noborder - novid - tools ” without the quotes .
Step 8 : Launch the shortcut and it should now work .
Now a little guide how to use it .
1 . To use : Ctrl +
L to load a map
2 . Press the record button to record some actions .
3 . Do Step 2 as many times as you ’d like .
4. Click the Active Camera / Work Camera button to take control of the camera .
5 . Place camera .
6 . Trim timeline down to properly record the shots .
7 . Crank the motion blur and / or depth of field .
8. File > Export >
Movie > change the renders settings to your liking .
9 . Find something to do for a while because rendering takes forever .
And here is a video tutorial for lazy people .

Here is a moving camera tutorial .
SUPER USEFUL thanks to pandamobile .
Here are few videos of it in use , VERY COOL .
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9XvVNwTlTQ
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Juj21Gylc
Step 1 .
Record any action the way you normally would .
Step 2 . Rightclick on your shot in the sequence timeline and press ‘ Set new camera ’ Step 3 .
Click on the camera selector ( Work Camera / Active camera button ) above the viewport .
Step 4 .
Now we record the path for your camera by moving as you would normally record action .
( Sometimes it ’s recommended that you tick the “ Noclip ” option before you start the recording ) .
Step 5 . Move about .
Step 6 . Press Esc when you ’re done your camera-ing .
Step 7 . Rightclick on the Shot in the timeline .
Hit “ New Animation Set ” , and select the camera you used for the recording .
Step 8 . Open the Animation Set Editor , and press the red circle .
Step 9 .
Now you ’ll see a shit - ton of lines everywhere on your timeline , and a bar around your time - mover - thingy .
Step 10 .
Drag the right side of bar out ( this part is still somewhat confusing to me , I ’ll have to play around with it some more to figure it out 100 % ) to the end of your shot .
Step 11 .
You can add effects like smoothing , jittering , etc. by grabing the sliders :
http://img12.imageshack.us/img12/6686/tutorial1v.png
Step 12 .
Play around with it for a while , do a lot of test shots before trying anything in a film .
Step 13 .
Press the Green Arrow to quit the edit - thing mode .
Step 14 .
Right click on your shot >
Zoom in Step 15 .
Make sure you ’re all the way at the beginning of your clip ’s timeline .
Step 16 .
Un - tick “ Take 1 ” ( or which ever take your camera happened to be ) and this will stop your arms from floating around with the camera .
( If someone knows how to hide the view model , please tell me ) Step 17 .
Right click on the clip , and Zoom out .
Now you should have a fairly decent shot to use for your movies .
Just be mindful , when you Un - tick the Camera ’s take , your arms will still be there , at the exact moment in the time line where you un-ticked it .
So just make sure your final shots wo n’t be looking the same direction as where you started the clip .
( You can see your floating arms through walls too )
Here is a very good animation tutorial , walks you through steps you need to know to animate your models face , bones and so on check it out .

More LINQ with System .
Interactive – Functional fun and taming side - effects Thursday , January 07 , 2010 3:43 AM bart
With the recent release of the Reactive Extensions for .
NET ( Rx ) on DevLabs , you ’ll hear quite a bit about reactive programming , based on the IObservable < T > and IObserver < T > interfaces .
A great amount of resources is available on Channel 9 .
In this series , I ’ll focus on the dual of the System .
Reactive assembly , which is System .
Interactive , providing a bunch of extensions to the LINQ Standard Query Operators for IEnumerable <T > .
In today ’s installment we ’ll talk about EnumerableEx ’s facilities to tame side - effects in a functionally inspired manner :
To side effect or not to side effect ?
Being rooted in query comprehensions as seen in various functional programming languages ( including ( the ) pure one (s ) ) , one would expect LINQ to have a very functional basis .
Indeed it has , but being hosted in various not functionally pure languages like C# and Visual Basic , odds are off reasoning about side - effects in a meaningful and doable manner .
As we ’ve seen before , when talking about the Do and Run operators , it ’s perfectly possible for a query to exhibit side - effects during iteration .
You do n’t even have to look that far , since every lambda passed to a query operator is an opportunity of introducing effects .
The delayed execution nature of LINQ queries makes that those effects appear at the point of query execution .
So far , nothing new .
So , the philosophical question ought to be whether or not we should embrace side - effects or go for absolute purity .
While the latter would be preferable for various reasons , it ’s not enforceable through the hosting languages for LINQ , so maybe we should exploit side - effects if we really want to do so .
The flip side of this train of thought is that those side - effects could come and get us if we ’re not careful , especially when queries get executed multiple times , potentially as part of a bigger query .
In such a case , you ’d likely not want effects to be duplicated .
Below is a sample of such a problematic query expression :
var xrs = EnumerableEx . Generate ( new Random ( ) , rnd => EnumerableEx .Return( rnd.Next ( 100 ) ) , /* iterate */ _ => _ ) ; xrs. Zip ( xrs , ( l , r ) => l + r ) .
Take ( 10 ) .
Run( Console . WriteLine ) ;
Using Generate , we generate a sequence of random numbers .
Recall the first argument is the state of the anamorphic Generate operator , which we get passed in the lambdas following it : once to produce an output sequence ( just a single random number in our case ) and once to iterate ( just keeping the same random number generator here ) .
What ’s more important is we ’re relying on the side - effect of reading the random number generator which , as the name implies , provides random answers to the Next inquiry every time it gets called .
In essence , the side - effect can ( not ) be seen by looking at the signature of Random .
Next , which says it returns an int .
In .NET this means the method may return the same int every time it gets called , but there are no guarantees whatsoever ( as there would be in pure functional programming languages ) .
This side - effect , innocent and intentional as it may seem , comes and gets us if we perform a Zip on the sequence with itself .
Since Zip iterates both sides , we ’re really triggering separate enumeration ( “ GetEnumerator ” ) over the same sequence two times .
Though it ’s the same sequence object , each of its iterations will produce different results .
As a result , the expected invariant of the Zip ’s output being only even numbers ( based on the assumption l and r would be the same as they ’re produced by the same sequence ) does n’t hold :
52
114
112
103
41
135
78
114
59
137
While random number generation is a pretty innocent side - effect , not having it under control properly can lead to unexpected results as shown above .
We can visualize this nicely using another side - effect introduced by Do :
var xrs = EnumerableEx . Generate ( new Random ( ) , rnd => EnumerableEx .Return( rnd.Next ( 100 ) ) , /* iterate */ _ => _ ) . Do( xr => Console .
WriteLine ( " ! -> " + xr ) ) ; xrs .
Zip ( xrs , ( l , r ) => l + r ) .
Take ( 10 ) .
Run( Console . WriteLine ) ;
This will print a message for every number flowing out of the random number generating sequence , as shown below :
! -> 97
! -> 78
175
! -> 11
! -> 6
17
! -> 40
! -> 17
57
! -> 92
! -> 63
155
! -> 70
! -> 13
83
! -> 41
! -> 1
42
! -> 64
! -> 76
140
! -> 30
! -> 71
101
! -> 1
! -> 81
82
! -> 65
! -> 45
110
If we look a bit further to the original query , we come to the conclusion we can’t apply any form of equational reasoning anymore : it seems that the common subexpression “ xrs ” is not “ equal ” ( as in exposing the same results ) in both use sites .
The immediate reason in the case of LINQ is the delayed execution , which is a good thing as our Generate call produces an infinite sequence .
More broadly , it ’s the side - effect that lies at the heart of the problem as equational reasoning breaks down in such a setting .
For that very reason , side - effect permitting languages have a much harder time carrying out optimizations to code and need to be very strict about specifying the order in which operations are performed ( e.g. in C# , arguments to a method call – which is always “ call - by - value ” – are evaluated in a left - to - right order ) .
Moving Take ( 10 ) up does n’t change the delayed characteristic either :
var xrs = EnumerableEx . Generate ( new Random ( ) , rnd => EnumerableEx .Return( rnd.Next ( 100 ) ) , /* iterate */ _ => _) . Take ( 10 ) . Do( xr => Console .
WriteLine ( " ! -> " + xr ) ) ; xrs.
Zip ( xrs , ( l , r ) => l + r ) .
Run( Console . WriteLine ) ;
What would help is forcing the common subexpression ’s query to execute , persisting ( = caching ) its results in memory , before feeding them in to the expression using it multiple times :
var xrs = EnumerableEx . Generate ( new Random ( ) , rnd => EnumerableEx .Return( rnd.Next ( 100 ) ) , /* iterate */ _ => _) . Take ( 10 ) . ToArray ( ) .
Do( xr => Console .
WriteLine ( " ! -> " + xr ) ) ; xrs.
Zip ( xrs , ( l , r ) => l + r ) .
Run( Console . WriteLine ) ;
Do n’t forget the Take ( 10 ) call though , as calling ToArray ( or ToList ) on an infinite sequence is not quite advised on today ’s machines with finite amounts of memory .
It ’s clear such hacking is quite brittle and it breaks the delayed execution nature of the query expression .
In other words , you ca n’t really hand out the resulting expression to a caller for it to call when it needs results ( if it ever does ) .
We ’re too eager about evaluating ( part of ) the query , just to be able to tame the side - effect :
var xrs = EnumerableEx . Generate ( new Random ( ) , rnd => EnumerableEx .Return( rnd.Next ( 100 ) ) , /* iterate */ _ => _) . Take ( 10 ) . ToArray ( ) ; var randomEvens = xrs. Zip ( xrs , ( l , r ) => l + r ) ; //
What if the consumer of randomEvens expects different results on each enumeration ...
Hard cheese !
randomEvens .Run ( Console . WriteLine ) ; randomEvens .
Run ( Console . WriteLine ) ;
It ’s clear that we need some more tools in our toolbox to tame desired side - effects when needed .
That ’s exactly what this post focuses on .
Option 1 : Do nothing with Let
A first way to approach side - effects is to embrace them as - is .
We just allow multiple enumerations of the same sequence to yield different results ( or more generally , replicate side - effects ) .
However , we can provide a bit more syntactical convenience in writing queries that reuse the same common subexpression in multiple places .
In the above , we had to introduce an intermediate variable to store the common expression in , ready for reuse further on :
var xrs = EnumerableEx . Generate ( new Random ( ) , rnd => EnumerableEx .Return( rnd.Next ( 100 ) ) , /* iterate */ _ => _ ) ; xrs. Zip ( xrs , ( l , r ) => l + r ) .
Take ( 10 ) .
Run( Console . WriteLine ) ;
Ca n’t we somehow write this more fluently ?
The answer is yes , using the Let operator which passes its left - hand side to a lambda expression that can potentially use it multiple times :
EnumerableEx . Generate ( new Random ( ) , rnd => EnumerableEx .Return( rnd.Next ( 100 ) ) , /* iterate */ _ => _ ) . Let ( xrs => xrs. Zip ( xrs , ( l , r ) => l + r ) ) .
Take ( 10 ) .
Run( Console . WriteLine ) ;
You can guess the signature of Let just by looking at the use above , but let ’s include it for completeness :
public static IEnumerable < TResult > Let < TSource , TResult >( this IEnumerable < TSource > source , Func < IEnumerable < TSource > , IEnumerable < TResult >> function ) ;
Because of the call - by - value nature of the languages we ’re talking about , the expression used for the source parameter will be fully evaluated ( not the same as enumerated ! ) before Let gets called , so we can feed it ( again in a call - by - value manner ) to the function which then can refer to it multiple times by means of its lambda expression parameter ( in the sample above this is “ xrs ” ) .
Let comes from the world of functional languages where it takes the following form :
let x = y in z
means ( in C#-ish syntax )
( x => z ) (y )
In other words , there ’s a hidden function x => z sitting in a let - expression and the “ value ” for x ( which is y in the sample ) gets passed to it , providing the result for the entire let - expression .
In EnumerableEx .
Let , the function is clear as the second parameter , and the role of “ y ” is fulfilled by the source parameter .
One could create a Let - form for any object as follows ( not recommended because of the unrestricted extension method ) :
public static R Let < T , R > ( this T t , Func < T , R > f ) { return f( t ) ; }
With this , you can write things like this :
Console .
WriteLine ( DateTime .Now .
Let(x => x - x ) . Ticks ) ;
This will print 0 ticks for sure , since the same DateTime .
Now is used for x on both sides of the subtraction .
If we were to expand this expression by substituting DateTime .
Now for x , we ’d get something different due to the duplicate evaluation of DateTime .
Now , exposing the side - effect of reading from the system clock :
Console .
WriteLine (( DateTime . Now - DateTime . Now ) .
Ticks ) ;
( Pop quiz : What sign will the above Ticks result have ?
Is it possible for the above to return 0 sometimes ? )
Option 2 : Cache on demand a.k.a.
MemoizeAll
As we ’ve seen before , on way to get rid of the side - effect replication is by forcing eager evaluation of the sequence through operators like ToArray or ToList .
However , those are a bit too eager in various ways :
They persist the whole sequence , which wo n’t work for infinite sequences .
They do so on the spot , i.e. the eagerness ca n’t be delayed till a later point ( ‘ on demand ” ) .
The last problem can be worked around using the Defer operator , but the first one is still a problem requiring another operator .
Both those things are what MemoizeAll provides for , essentially persisting the sequence bit - by - bit upon consumption .
This is achieved by exposing the enumerable while only maintaining a single enumerator to its source :
In the figure above , this is illustrated .
Red indicates a fetch operation where the original source ’s iterator makes progress as an element is requested that has n’t been fetched before .
Green indicates persisted ( cached , memoized ) objects .
Gray indicates elements in the source that have been fetched and hence belong to the past from the ( single ) source - iterators point of view : MemoizeAll wo n’t ever request those again .
Applying this operator to our running sample using Zip will produce results with the expected invariant :
var xrs = EnumerableEx . Generate ( new Random ( ) , rnd => EnumerableEx .Return( rnd.Next ( 100 ) ) , /* iterate */ _ => _ ) . Do( xr => Console .
WriteLine ( " ! -> " + xr ) ) . MemoizeAll ( ) ; xrs. Do( xr => Console .
WriteLine ( " L -> " + xr ) ) .
Zip ( xrs.Do( xr => Console .
WriteLine ( " R -> " + xr ) ) , ( l , r ) => l + r ) .
Take ( 10 ) .
Run( Console . WriteLine ) ;
Now we ’ll see the xrs-triggered
Do messages being printed only 10 times since the same element will be consumed by the two uses of xrs within Zip .
The result looks as follows , showing how the right consumer of Zip never causes a fetch back to the random number generating source due to the internal caching by MemoizeAll :
! -> 71
L -> 71
R -> 71
142
! -> 18
L -> 18
R -> 18
36
! -> 12
L -> 12
R -> 12
24
! -> 96
L -> 96
R -> 96
192
! -> 1
L -> 1
R -> 1
2
! -> 54
L -> 54
R -> 54
108
! -> 9
L -> 9
R -> 9
18
! -> 87
L -> 87
R -> 87
174
! -> 18
L -> 18
R -> 18
36
! -> 12
L -> 12
R -> 12
24
What about lifetime of the source ’s single enumerator ?
As soon as one of the consumers reaches the end of the underlying sequence , we got all elements cached and are prepared to any possible inquiry for elements on the output side of the MemoizeAll operator , hence it ’s possible to dispose of the original enumerator .
It should also be noted that memoization operators use materialization internally to capture the behavior of the sequence to expose to all consumers .
This means exceptions are captured as Notification < T > so they ’re repeatable to all consumers :
var xes = EnumerableEx . Throw < int >( new Exception ( ) ) . StartWith ( 1 ) .MemoizeAll ( ) ; xes.
Catch (( Exception _ ) => EnumerableEx . Return ( 42 ) ) .
Run ( Console . WriteLine ) ; xes.
Catch (( Exception _ ) => EnumerableEx . Return ( 42 ) ) .
Run ( Console . WriteLine ) ;
The above will therefore print 1 , 42 twice .
In other words , the source blowing up during fetching by MemoizeAll does n’t terminate other consumers that have n’t reached the faulty state yet ( but if they iterate long enough , they ’ll eventually see it exactly as the original consumer did ) .
Finally , what ’s All about MemoizeAll ?
In short : the cache used by the operator can grow infinitely large .
The difference compared to ToArray and ToList has been explained before , but it ’s worth repeating it : MemoizeAll does n’t fetch its source ’s results on the spot but only makes progress through the source ’s enumerator when one of the consumers requests an element that has n’t been retrieved yet .
Call it a piecemeal ToList if you want .
Option 3 : Memoize , but less “ conservative ”
While MemoizeAll does the trick to avoid repetition of side - effects , it ’s quite conservative in its caching as it never throws away elements it has retrieved .
You never know whether someone – like a slow enumerator or a whole new enumerator over the memoized result – will request the data again , so a general - purpose Memoize ca n’t throw away a thing .
However , if you know the behavior of the consumers of the memoized source , you can be more efficient about it and use Memoize specifying a buffer size .
In our running sample of Zip we know that both uses of the source for the left and right inputs to Zip will be enumerated at the same pace , so it suffices to keep the last element in the cache in order for the right enumerator to be able to see the element the left enumerator just saw .
Memoize with buffer size 1 does exactly that :
var xrs = EnumerableEx . Generate ( new Random ( ) , rnd => EnumerableEx .Return( rnd.Next ( 100 ) ) , /* iterate */ _ => _ ) . Do( xr => Console .
WriteLine ( " ! -> " + xr ) ) . Memoize ( 1 ) ; xrs. Do( xr => Console .
WriteLine ( " L -> " + xr ) ) .
Zip ( xrs.Do( xr => Console .
WriteLine ( " R -> " + xr ) ) , ( l , r ) => l + r ) .
Take ( 10 ) .
Run( Console . WriteLine ) ;
In pictures , this looks as follows :
Another valid buffer size – also the default – is zero .
It ’s left to the reader , as an exercise , to come up with a plausible theory for what that one ’s behavior should be and to depict this case graphically .
( Question : Would it be possible to provide a “ smart ” memoization operator that knows exactly when it can abandon items in the front of its cache ?
Why ( not ) ? )
Derived forms
The difference between Let and the Memoize operators is that the former feeds in a view on an IEnumerable < T > source to a function , allowing that one to refer to the source multiple times in the act of producing a source in return .
Let is , as we saw , nothing but fancy function application in a “ fluent ” left - to - right dataflowy way .
Derived forms of Memoize exist that have the same form where a function is fed a memoized data source :
Replay is Memoize on steroids
Publish is MemoizeAll on steroids
The following snippets show just what those operators do ( modulo parameter checks ) :
public static IEnumerable < TResult > Publish < TSource , TResult >( this IEnumerable < TSource > source ,
Func< IEnumerable < TSource > , IEnumerable < TResult >> function ) { return function ( source. MemoizeAll ( ) ) ; } public static IEnumerable < TResult > Publish < TSource , TResult > ( this IEnumerable < TSource > source ,
Func< IEnumerable < TSource > , IEnumerable < TResult >> function ,
TSource initialValue ) { return function ( source.MemoizeAll ( ) . StartWith ( initialValue ) ) ; } public static IEnumerable < TResult > Replay < TSource , TResult > ( this IEnumerable < TSource > source ,
Func< IEnumerable < TSource > , IEnumerable < TResult >> function ) { return function ( source .
Memoize ( ) ) ; } public static IEnumerable < TResult > Replay < TSource , TResult > ( this IEnumerable < TSource > source ,
Func< IEnumerable < TSource > , IEnumerable < TResult >> function ,
int bufferSize ) { return function ( source. Memoize ( bufferSize ) ) ; }
So we could rewrite our Zip sample in a variety of ways , the following being the cleanest one - sized buffer variant :
EnumerableEx . Generate ( new Random ( ) , rnd => EnumerableEx .Return( rnd.Next ( 100 ) ) , /* iterate */ _ => _ ) . Do( xr => Console .
WriteLine ( " ! -> " + xr ) ) .
Replay ( xrs => xrs .
Do( xr => Console .
WriteLine ( " L -> " + xr ) ) .
Zip ( xrs .
Do( xr => Console .
WriteLine ( " R -> " + xr ) ) , ( l , r ) => l + r ) , 1 ) . Take ( 10 ) .
Run( Console . WriteLine ) ;
Option 4 : Fair ( ? ) sharing with Share and Prune
The Share operator shares an IEnumerator < T > for any number of consumers of an IEnumerable < T > , hence avoiding duplication of side - effects .
In addition , it also guarantees that no two consumers can see the same element , so in effect the Share operator has the potential of distributing elements across different consumers .
Looking at it from another angle , one consumer can steal elements from the source , preventing another consumer from seeing it .
Prune is derived from Share as follows :
public static IEnumerable < TResult > Prune < TSource , TResult >( this IEnumerable < TSource > source ,
Func< IEnumerable < TSource > , IEnumerable < TResult >> function ) { return function ( source .
Share ( ) ) ; }
The naming for Prune follows from the effect consumers inside the function have on the sequence being shared : each one consuming data effectively prunes elements from the head of the sequence , so that others can not see those anymore .
An example is shown below , showing another way a Zip could go wrong ( practical scenarios for this operator would involve sharing ) since the left and right consumers both advance the cursor of the same shared enumerator under the hood :
EnumerableEx . Generate ( new Random ( ) , rnd => EnumerableEx .Return( rnd.Next ( 100 ) ) , /* iterate */ _ => _ ) . Do( xr => Console .
WriteLine ( " ! -> " + xr ) ) .
Prune ( xrs => xrs.Do( xr => Console .
WriteLine ( " L -> " + xr ) ) .
Zip ( xrs.Do( xr => Console .
WriteLine ( " R -> " + xr ) ) , ( l , r ) => l + r ) ) . Take ( 10 ) .
Run( Console . WriteLine ) ;
The result of this is of interest since the logging will reveal the sharing characteristic .
Looking at the first
Do ’s output we ’ll see it gets triggered by any consumer on the inside of Prune :
! -> 37
L -> 37
! -> 51
R -> 51
88
! -> 98
L -> 98
! -> 89
R -> 89
187
! -> 4
L -> 4
! -> 71
R -> 71
75
! -> 43
L -> 43
! -> 30
R -> 30
73
! -> 18
L -> 18
! -> 24
R -> 24
42
! -> 17
L -> 17
! -> 41
R -> 41
58
! -> 45
L -> 45
! -> 68
R -> 68
113
! -> 83
L -> 83
! -> 53
R -> 53
136
! -> 64
L -> 64
! -> 69
R -> 69
133
! -> 0
L -> 0
! -> 22
R -> 22
22
In pictures , this looks as follows :

A look at the Asynchronous and Remotable operators , dealing with some infrastructure - related concepts , wrapping up this series for now .
J.D. is the funniest character on Scrubs .
He can bring a chuckle with a 2 words , or send us to the ground with one of his classic imaginations .
When he came back this season , he was just as funny and gave us more laughs than any other character , but his character was an overbearing mess that was unlikable to the fullest extent .
His cries for attention and acceptance were something we 've already seen and something we'd thought he 'd gotten past .
J.D. exits , Elliot enters , and magnificently , it works .
Without showing Elliot teaching , or trying to make people like her , the writers transformed her into a confident , competent doctor and mentor .
Instead of having her her own problems , she helped others without being intrusive or annoying .
At the same time , she was funny while helping Lucy and Denise in a way J.D. could n't .
She maintained some of the quirks we like , and was still the Elliot we could recognize and appreciate .
The Drew story shed light on who he was and was very run -of - the - mill .
He used to be a crazy about being on top and is afraid of reverting to that .
Finally we learned more about him , and shows the possibilities the show has .
There 's all these character we know little about .
The second episode of the night tried to justify the Lucy , Cole relationship and failed .
For the first six episodes , Cole was a complete douche to everyone including Lucy who was sleeping with him the whole time .
Now we 're supposed to accept that he 's a good guy that just wanted Lucy to acknowledge she is sleeping with him because he likes her that much ?
There is still much work to fix the show .
If the main story focusing on the main character was n't strong , we used to be able to rely on the other stories .
The rest of the coupling subplots were n't anything special and while amusing , got very few laughs from me .
Denise and Drew pulling the prank on the security guys went on way too long .
Turk and Dr. Cox was by far the most interesting and showed the new side to their relationship as more colleagues than Dr. Cox looking down on Turk .
There is mutual respect between them , and there 's great potential for them .

Wintek Suzhou , an affiliate of Wintek Corporation and a major supplier of components for Apple 's iPhone and iPod Touch , has been exposed by China Central Television for hazardous work conditions and disputes about employee welfare .
According to Focus , a program broadcast by CCTV , employees at a Wintek factory in Suzhou , Jiangsu province , went on strike in mid-January 2010 and this sparked the exposure of n- hexane poisoning cases at the factory .
Zhang Lisheng , the deputy general manager of Wintek China , is reported as saying that the striking employees were mainly protesting the company 's cancellation of year - end bonus , and the company denied that the employees ' protest was to do with n- hexane poisoning .
However Lu Zhenwei , the director of Suzhou Industrial Park Safety Production Management Bureau admitted that some employees at the company were indeed affected by n-hexane poisoning .
The CCTV report said that as at August 2009 , 49 employees at Wintek had showed symptoms of hexane poisoning and were receiving treatment at a Suzhou hospital .
The report said that the company illegally used hexane in place of alcohol for cleaning mobile phone screens , and this was the main cause of the n-hexane poisoning .
The report said that the company has been asked to stop using this chemical and has been punished , with some of its management being dismissed .
Elsewhere , reports show that in May 2009 the Taiwan Labor Organization went to protest at Apple 's office in Taiwan , accusing Wintek Corporation , the parent company of Wintek for ignoring worker 's rights , offering bad working conditions , and cutting staff illegally .
We are all Melmottes now
Hot / cold on the heels of Iceland ’s quasi - default , the Roger Lowenstein in the NY Times urges underwater / negative equity homeowners to “ Walk Away From Your Mortgage ! ” . .
Lowenstein ’s key point is that businesses ( including those owned or controlled by the banks themselves ) treat default as a straightforward business decision , to be adopted whenever it is profitable to do so .
Lowenstein gives a number of examples where leading banks like ( inevitably ) Goldman Sachs have engaged in strategic default and urges his readers to do likewise .
The piece is in a section headed “ The Way We Live Now ” and it ’s striking that it ’s taken more than 100 years for the business ethics of Augustus Melmotte to percolate through to the American middle class
To be fair , it ’s only in the last thirty years or so that such ethics have become dominant in the corporate sector , to the point where a board that rejected profitable opportunities to stiff their creditors would now be regarded as having violated its fiduciary obligations to shareholders ( particularly if the creditors are workers ) .
And despite all the talk about shareholder value , a CEO who passed up opportunities for personal enrichment at the expense of shareholders would be regarded by his or her fellows as a mug .
Millions have defaulted already – ( one in eight mortgages is currently in arrears ) .
Bankruptcy is once again as common as divorce .
When defaulting on debt is this common , it is hard to sustain any sort of social stigma or internalised notion that this is anything other than a financial option , like refinancing an existing loan .
And , as with divorce , we must soon be reaching the point where most people who take out loans will do so in the knowledge that default is an option .
The question is – can the consumer credit system survive this ?
Probably it can , but the system will need some radical changes .
It ’s worked for several decades on the basis of creditworthiness criteria that work on the assumption that ( nearly ) everyone will repay their debts if they can .
Until recently , the checks could also rely on the assumption that people would be more - or - less honest in the information they provided in their applications .
The financial system , by promoting ‘ liar loans ’ colluded in the destruction of the second assumption , and by leading the way in strategic default , helped to destroy the first .
The problem for lenders now is that they will increasingly have to act on the assumption that their borrowers ( including those who appear creditworthy on the old standards ) are planning , at a minimum , to use default as an insurance option .
The only good way to protect against this is to demand lots of secure collateral .
That means less liberal credit ( and , given higher default rates , higher interest rates ) for everyone and no credit at all for lots of us .

During the final editing process , it became clear that a simple summary of the main points would be helpful to those looking for guidance .
It seemed that our first post in over a month ( congratulations on the new delivery , Bryce ! ) should be something big and useful ...
This post covers the following top - line points about designing karma systems , drawn from our book and other blog posts :
Karma is user reputation within a context
Karma is useful for building trust between users , and between a user and the site
Karma can be an incentive for participation and contributions
Karma is contextual and has limited utility globally .
[ A chessmaster is not a good eBay Seller ]
Karma comes in several flavors - Participation , Quality and Robust ( combined )
Karma should be complex and the result of indirect evaluations , and the formulation is often opaque
evaluations , and the formulation is often opaque Personal karma is displayed only to the owner , and is good for measuring progress
Corporate karma is used by the site operator to find the very best and very worst users
Public karma is displayed to other users , which is what makes it the hardest to get right
Public karma should be used sparingly - it is hard to understand , is n't expected , and is easily confused with content ratings
Negative public karma should be avoided all together .
In karma - math - 1 is not the same magnitude as +1 , and information loss is too expensive .
Public karma often encourages competitive behavior in users , which may not be compatible with their motivations .
This is most easily seen with leaderboards , but can happen any time karma scores are prominently displayed .
[ i.e. : Twitter follower count ]
Why bother with karma ?
[ Preface ]
How long has this person been a member of the community ?
What types of activities has she engaged in ?
How well has she performed at them ?
What do other people think about this person ?
Karma is a reputation score for a user in a community , it may be comprised of many components , such as :
Having access to a person 's reputation might help you make better informed judgments .
Judgements like …
Can I trust this person ?
Should I transact with this person ?
Is it worth my time to listen to this person ?
Besides providing a means for trust between users , karma is often used as an incentive to encourage contributions to a service , or to identify specific users for special action - either recognition or corrective action .
The tricky part is balancing the producer incentives against the potential for abuse and the consumers need for good filters over the content .
Karma is contextual ( local ) and has limited scope [ Chapter 1 ]
Karma is built based on the actions of a user within a context , such as a web site , or even as a member a sub-community of a site .
And those contributions are often limited to a very narrow range of actions - care must be taken to not over - generalize the value of a karma score .
For example a eBay seller feedback karma only reflects the feelings of the buyers for the exact transactions completed .
One of the known scamming patterns is for a scammer to develop strong positive karma selling a large number of smaller items and then switch to simultaneously listing a large number high - ticket items for auction at low prices , collecting the funds and then canceling their account .
This is an evil form of reputation bankruptcy ( see below ) .
There is a common misconception about karma - that it can be used across contexts , just as the FICO credit score is broadly used in the United States to determine suitability for issuing credit cards , purchasing a home , or even being hired for a job .
Chapter 1 talks about this idea of a " Web Fico " :
Several startup companies have attempted to codify a global user reputation for use across web sites , and some try to leverage a user 's preexisting eBay seller 's Feedback score as a primary value in their rating .
They are trying to create some sort of “ real person ” or “ good citizen ” reputation system for use across all contexts .
As with the FICO score , it is a bad idea to co-opt a reputation system for another purpose , and it dilutes the actual meaning of the score in its original context .
The eBay Feedback score reflects only the transaction worthiness of a specific account , and it does so only for particular products bought or sold on eBay .
The user behind that identity may in fact steal candy from babies , cheat at online poker , and fail to pay his credit card bills .
Even eBay displays multiple types of reputation ratings within its singular limited context .
There is no web FICO because there is no kind of reputation statement that can be legitimately applied to all contexts .
Participation vs. quality , and robust karma [ Chapter 4 ]
There are two primitive forms of karma models : models that measure the amount of user participation and models that measure the quality of contributions .
When these types of karma models are combined , we refer to the combined model as robust .
Including both types of measures in the model gives the highest scores to the users who are both active and produce the best content .
Participation karma
Participation karma :
As a user engages in various activities , they are recorded , weighted , and tallied .
Counting socially and / or commercially significant events by content creators is probably the most common type of participation karma model .
This model is often implemented as a point system ( Chap_4 - Points ) , in which each action is worth a fixed number of points and the points accumulate .
A participation karma model looks exactly like the figure above , where the input event represents the number of points for the action and the source of the activity becomes the target of the karma .
There is also a negative participation karma model , which counts how many bad things a user does .
Some people call this model strikes , after the three - strikes rule of American baseball .
Again , the model is the same , except that the application interprets a high score inversely .
Quality karma
A quality - karma model , such as eBay 's seller feedback ( Chap_4- eBay_Merchant_Feedback_Karma ) model , deals solely with the quality of contributions by users .
In a quality - karma model , the number of contributions is meaningless unless it is accompanied by an indication of whether each contribution is good or bad for business .
The best quality - karma scores are always calculated as a side effect of other users evaluating the contributions of the target .
In the eBay example , a successful auction bid is the subject of the evaluation , and the results roll up to the seller : if there is no transaction , there should be no evaluation .
Robust karma
By itself , a participation - based karma score is inadequate to describe the value of a user 's contributions to the community : we will caution time and again throughout the book that rewarding simple activity is an impoverished way to think about user karma .
However , you probably do n't want a karma score based solely on quality of contributions either .
Under this circumstance , you may find your system rewarding cautious contributors - ones who , out of a desire to keep their quality - ratings high - only contribute to “ safe ” topics , or - once having attained a certain quality ranking - decide to stop contributing to protect that ranking .
What you really want to do is to combine quality - karma and participation - karma scores into one score - call it robust karma .
The robust - karma score represents the overall value of a user 's contributions : the quality component ensures some thought and care in the preparation of contributions , and the participation side ensures that the contributor is very active , that she 's contributed recently , and ( probably ) that she 's surpassed some minimal thresholds for user participation - enough that you can reasonably separate the passionate , dedicated contributors from the fly - by post - then - flee crowd .
The weight you 'll give to each component depends on the application .
Robust - karma scores often are not displayed to users , but may be used instead for internal ranking or flagging , or as factors influencing search ranking ; see Chap_4 - Keep_Your_Barn_Door_Closed , for common reasons for this secrecy .
But even when karma scores are displayed , a robust - karma model has the advantage of encouraging users both to contribute the best stuff ( as evaluated by their peers ) and to do it often .
When negative factors are included in factoring robust - karma scores , it is particularly useful for customer care staff - both to highlight users who have become abusive or users whose contributions decrease the overall value of content on the site , and potentially to provide an increased level of service to proven - excellent users who become involved in a customer service procedure .
A robust - karma model helps find the best of the best and the worst of the worst .
Robust karma : A robust - karma model might combine multiple other karma scores - measuring , perhaps , not just a user 's output ( Participation ) but their effectiveness ( or Quality ) as well .
Unlike most content reputation , karma is implicit , opaque , and complex [ Chapter 7 ]
A reputable entity is potentially any entry in a database , including users and content items , with one or more reputations attached to it .
All kinds of reputation score types and all kinds of display and use patterns might seem equally valid for content reputation and karma , but usually they 're not .
To highlight the differences between content reputation and karma , we 've categorized them by the ways in which they 're typically calculated : simple and complex reputation .
Simple Reputation Simple reputation is any reputation score that is generated directly by user evaluation of a reputable entity and that is subject to an elementary aggregation calculation , such as simple average .
For example , simple reputation is used on most ratings - and - reviews sites .
Simple reputation is direct and easy to understand .
Complex Reputation Complex reputation is a score aggregated from multiple evaluations , including evaluations of different but related targets , calculated with an opaque method .
email IP spammer , Google PageRank , and eBay feedback reputations are examples of complex reputation .
It 's an indirect evaluation , and users may not understand how it was calculated even if the score is displayed .
Content reputation is about things - typically inanimate objects without emotions or the ability to directly respond in any way to its reputation .
But karma represents the reputation of users , and users are people - they are alive , they have feelings , and they are the engine that powers your site .
Karma is significantly more personal and therefore sensitive and meaningful .
If a manufacturer gets a single bad product review on a web site , it probably wo n't even notice .
But if a user gets a bad rating from a friend - or feels slighted or alienated by the way your karma system works - she might abandon an identity that has become valuable to your business .
Worse yet , she might abandon your site altogether and take her content with her .
( Worst of all , she might take others with her . )
Take extreme care in creating a karma system .
User reputation on the web has undergone many experiments , and the primary lesson from that research is that karma should be a complex reputation and it should be displayed rarely .
Karma is complex , built of indirect inputs
Be careful with Karma - sometimes making things as simple and explicit as possible is the wrong choice for reputation :
Rating a user directly should be avoided .
Typical implementations only require a user to click once to rate another user and are therefore prone to abuse .
When direct evaluation karma models are combined with the common practice of streamlining user registration processes ( on many sites opening a new account is an easier operation than changing the password on an existing account ) , they get out of hand quickly .
See the example of Orkut in Chap_7 - Display_Numbered_Levels .
is an easier operation than changing the password on an existing account ) , they get out of hand quickly .
See the example of Orkut in Chap_7 - Display_Numbered_Levels .
Asking people to evaluate others directly is socially awkward .
Do n't put users in the position of lying about their friends .
Using multiple inputs presents a broader picture of the target user 's value .
Economics research into “ revealed preference , ” or what people actually do , as opposed to what they say , indicates that actions provide a more accurate picture of value than elicited ratings .
Karma calculations are often opaque
Karma calculations may be opaque because the score is valuable as status , has revenue potential , and / or unlocks privileged application features .
Display karma sparingly
In Building Web Reputation Systems we separate reputation display into three categories : public ( shown to other users ) , personal ( shown only to the owner ) , and corporate ( for company internal use . )
Corporate karma is normally used to identify the very best and the very worst users for special actions , such as PR contact or account termination .
Personal karma is typically used for reflecting progress against some goal - as a dieter tracks their body weight over time .
Where karma display becomes challenging is when it is public .
There are several important things to consider when displaying karma to the public :
Publicly displayed karma should be rare because , as with content reputation , users are easily confused by the display of many reputations on the same page or within the same context .
Publicly displayed karma should be rare because it can create the wrong incentives for your community .
Avoid sorting users by karma .
See Chap_7-Leaderboards_Considered_Harmful .
If you do display it publicly , make karma visually distinct from any nearby content reputation .
Yahoo !'s EU message board displays the karma of a post 's author as a colored medallion , with the message rated with stars .
But consider this : Slashdot 's message board does n't display the karma of post authors to anyone .
Even the display of a user 's own karma is vague : “ positive , ” “ good , ” or “ excellent . ”
After originally displaying karma publicly as a number , over time Slashdot has shifted to an increasingly opaque display of karma .
Public displayed karma should be rare because it is n't expected .
When Yahoo !
Shopping added Top Reviewer karma to encourage review creation , they displayed a Top Reviewer badge with each review and rushed it out for the Christmas 2006 season .
After the New Year had passed , user testing revealed that most users did n't even notice the badges .
When they did notice them , many thought they meant either that the item was top rated or that the user was a paid shill for the product manufacturer or Yahoo !.
Though karma should be complex , it should still be limited to as narrow a context as possible .
Do n't mix shopping review karma with chess rank .
It may sound silly now , but you'd be surprised how many people think they can make a business out of creating an Internet - wide trustworthiness karma .
Yahoo !
holds reputation for karma scores to a higher standard than reputation for content .
Be very careful in applying terminology and labels to people , for several reasons :
Avoid labels that might appear as attacks .
They set a hostile tone that will be amplified in users ' responses .
This caution applies both to overly positive labels ( such as “ hotshot ” or “ top ” designations ) or negative ones ( such as “ newbie ” or “ rookie ” ) .
Avoid labels that introduce legal risks .
What if a site labeled members of a health forum “ experts , ” and these “ experts ” then gave out bad advice ?
These are rules of thumb that may not necessarily apply to a given context .
In role - playing games , for example , publicly shared simple karma is displayed in terms of experience levels , which are inherently competitive .
Avoid negative public karma [ Chapter 6 ]
This point is covered in detail in an earlier post The Dollhouse Mafia , or " Do n't Display Negative Karma " - which anyone considering having negative karma effects in public reputation should read carefully .
We 'll only excerpt a small portion here :
This thinking — though seemingly intuitive — is impoverished , and is wrong in at least two important ways .
There can be no negative public karma - at least for establishing the trustworthiness of active users .
A bad enough public score will simply lead to that user 's abandoning the account and starting a new one , a process we call karma bankruptcy .
This setup defeats the primary goal of karma - to publicly identify bad actors .
Assuming that a karma starts at zero for a brand - new user that an application has no information about , it can never go below zero , since karma bankruptcy resets it .
Just look at the record of eBay sellers with more than three red stars - you 'll see that most have n't sold anything in months or years , either because the sellers quit or they 're now doing business under different account names .
It 's not a good idea to combine positive and negative inputs in a single public karma score .
Say you encounter a user with 75 karma points and another with 69 karma points .
Who is more trustworthy ?
You can't tell : maybe the first user used to have hundreds of good points but recently accumulated a lot of negative ones , while the second user has never received a negative point at all .
If you must have public negative reputation , handle it as a separate score ( as in the eBay seller feedback pattern ) .
Even eBay , with the most well - known example of public negative karma , does n't represent how untrustworthy an actual seller might be - it only gives buyers reasons to take specific actions to protect themselves .
In general , avoid negative public karma .
If you really want to know who the bad guys are , keep the score separate and restrict it to internal use by moderation staff .
If you 're still considering negative reputation , please [ re ] read the story of the Dollhouse Mafia and imagine your enemies attacking your system .
Public karma can discourage some contributors
Putting user reputations in a public ranked list , creates a competitive environment and some users ' motivations are not at all compatible with being being publicly recognized .
Still others will see high karma as the goal of the activity instead of the benefit and start to change their behavior to optimize their actions around their karma instead of using the site as intended .
In Leaderboards Considered Harmful , we pointed out :
KEEPING unwanted immigrants out of America is a costly business .
Thousands of miles of fence have been erected along the border with Mexico and the annual budget for the US Border Patrol has risen to $ 2.7 billion in 2009 from $ 326.2 m in 1992 .
Nonetheless , illegal immigration is reckoned to have trebled in that time , in part because many people enter the country legally , for example as tourists , but then stay on permanently .
According to new data from the Center for American Progress , a think - tank , the cost of apprehending immigrants is rising .
Over 791,000 arrests were made by the border patrol in 2008 ( the latest year for which data are available ) , at a cost of just over $ 3,000 for each arrest .

The men were jailed after a failed bid to seek asylum in the US Two men have lost their appeals against the UK 's first conviction for inciting racial hatred via a foreign website .
Simon Sheppard , 51 , was sentenced to four years and 10 months , and Stephen Whittle , 42 , to two years and four months at Leeds Crown Court in July .
However , the Court of Appeal has reduced Sheppard 's sentence by one year and Whittle 's jail term by six months .
Sheppard , from Selby , North Yorks , and Whittle , of Preston , Lancs , controlled US websites featuring racist material .
During their first trial in 2008 , they skipped bail and fled to California , where they sought asylum claiming they were being persecuted for their right - wing views , but were deported .
The police investigation began after a complaint about a leaflet called " Tales of the Holohoax " , which was pushed through the door of a Blackpool synagogue and traced back to a post office box in Hull registered to Sheppard .
' Abusive and insulting '
Published material found later included images of murdered Jews alongside cartoons and articles ridiculing ethnic groups .
The pair were charged under the Public Order Act with publishing racially inflammatory material , distributing racially inflammatory material and possessing racially inflammatory material with a view to distribution .
Sheppard , of Brook Street , Selby , was found guilty of 16 offences and Whittle , of Avenham Lane , Preston , was found guilty of five .
Sentencing them , Judge Rodney Grant said he had rarely seen material which was so abusive and insulting .
Sheppard 's counsel Adrian Davies told the Appeal Court the sites were " entirely lawful " in the US .
He said that there was no evidence that anyone in England and Wales - except for the police officer in the case - had ever seen any of them .
Excessive sentences Giving the Court of Appeal ruling , Lord Justice Scott Baker said the material had been available to the public despite the fact that the evidence went no further than establishing that one police officer downloaded it .
He said the trial judge had been right to hold that he had jurisdiction to try the pair because much of the activities constituting the crime took place in England .
However , although the Appeal Court judges agreed that " this was truly pernicious material " , the sentences handed down had been excessive .

The Hamas government in Gaza has distanced itself from an earlier statement in which it expressed regret for harming Israeli civilians in rocket attacks .
The apology was part of the government 's response to a UN report that alleged both Hamas and Israel committed war crimes during Israel 's Gaza offensive last winter .
The UN report accused Hamas of firing rockets indiscriminately at Israeli civilians .
The Hamas government wrote to the U.N. that " we apologize for any harm that might have come to Israeli civilians . "
However , the government also said it has the right to resist Israeli occupation .
On Saturday , Hamas reaffirmed that right but said " the report it submitted does not include any apologies in this regard . "
It offered no explanation for the contradiction .
Earlier , Hamas has expressed regret for the deaths of Israeli civilians in Palestinian rocket attacks during fighting in Gaza a year ago .
Israel , where Hamas suicide bombers have killed hundreds of civilians over two decades , dismissed any apology for the three non-combatants hit by rockets from Gaza in the war as insincere .
Italian Support Berlusconi to Knesset : Goldstone tried to incriminate you Ynet
At end of official visit to Israel , Italian prime minister speaks at plenary session :
We will fight every instance of anti-Semitism .
Knesset Speaker Rivlin welcomes guest , asks him to wake Europe up to Iranian threat Berlusconi to Knesset : Goldstone tried to incriminate you
In a report by a committee set up by Hamas to examine UN allegations of war crimes by its fighters , the authors said : " We regret any harm that may have befallen any Israeli civilian .
" We hope the Israeli civilians understand that their government 's continued attacks on us were the key issue and the cause , " added the report , of which Reuters obtained a copy .
In response to the report , delivered to the United Nations this week , Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said on Friday : " For years Hamas has boasted about deliberately targeting civilians , either through suicide bombings , by gunfire or by rockets .
Who are they trying to fool now ? "
At least one senior Hamas official , who declined to be named , said the movement remained ready to conduct " martyrdom operations " - suicide bombings of Israeli buses , cafes and the like , which have not , however , been seen for several years .
The Hamas report , after listing Palestinian grievances such as the Israeli embargo on Gaza , reaffirmed comments by officials of the 22 - year - old Islamist movement that its improvised rockets were fired purely defensively and were aimed at Israeli military targets .
They simply lacked the necessary accuracy , Hamas said .
" It should be noted that the Palestinian resistance ... is not an organized army that possesses developed technological weapons , " the report said .
" It may target a military site or a tank position and their fire goes astray ... and hit a civilian location , despite their efforts to avoid hurting civilians . "
' No change in the movement 's policy '
Israel and independent rights groups say Hamas has broken the laws of war by indiscriminately firing thousands of rockets and mortars around Israeli towns , notably Sderot , close to the Gaza border , in the years since the group won a parliamentary election in 2006 and seized full control in Gaza in 2007 .
Some 1,400 Palestinians , including hundreds of civilians , were killed in a three - week Israeli offensive launched on December 27 , 2008 .
Israel and the Palestinians were urged by UN investigator Richard Goldstone in September to conduct credible inquiries into possible war crimes committed by their forces .
Both sides presented documents to the United Nations in recent days which they say showed they had conducted suitable investigations .
In a message on Thursday to the General Assembly , UN Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon withheld judgment on whether either party had met Goldstone 's recommendations .
UN member states " will consult on the further course of action , " General Assembly spokesman Jean Victor Nkolo said .
Rights group Amnesty International called Ban 's message " deeply disappointing . "
" Amnesty International believes that the information ( Ban ) had received was sufficient to show clearly that the steps taken by both sides have been completely inadequate , " it said in a statement .
Israel , which has furiously rejected Goldstone 's report as unbalanced , says Hamas deliberately puts Palestinian civilians in harm 's way in order to shield its fighters and to exploit international pressure on Israel over civilian deaths .
Diaa al - Madhoun , a Palestinian judge who took part in drafting the report to the United Nations , told Reuters that the expression of regret conformed to what he said was Hamas ' " commitment to international humanitarian law . "
" It is part of our religion not to target civilians , women , children and the elderly , who do not take part in the aggression against us , " he said , echoing language in the Hamas report .
Over 500 Israelis were killed in suicide bombings during a Palestinian uprising from 2000 .
Many of those bombers were sent by Hamas , pursuing what it calls " martyrdom operations . "
Asked whether the expression of regret to the United Nations marked a change in that strategy , a Hamas official in Gaza told Reuters : " There is no change in the movement 's policy , and that includes our position on the martyrdom operations . "
Children wo n't digest feeble tales of vegetarian wolves
Encouraging children to read more is a great idea , and as Christmas fades and school looms ahead it ’s impossible to ignore the fact they have too many toys already .
As the Tory philosopher Roger Scruton has said : ‘ Like a hydra - headed monster for every toy that is culled , a hundred new ones spring up in place of it .
By my calculations every western child must have received by the age of reason ( supposing he ever reaches it ) , 50 times his own weight of non-biodegradable , aesthetically poisonous and morally corrupting rubbish - all delivered with the best of intentions . ’
It ’s so much better to give books instead .
But care must be taken .
Not all the ‘ classics ’ on sale are quite how we might remember them .
Children 's favourite :
The BBC's TV adaptation of the ever - popular Gruffalo storybook delighted audiences this Christmas
In Tempar 's version of Little Red Riding Hood ( The True Story of Little Red Riding Hood by Agnese Baruzzi and Sandro Natalin ) the Wolf is shooed away , makes friends with Little Red Riding Hood , and becomes a vegetarian .
In the Usbourne Illustrated Fairy Tales the wolf discovers healthy eating and lives on boiled carrots .
In the original , by the Brothers Grimm , the fate of the wolf is perfectly clear .
For those who can't get hold of some kind of Samizdat copy ( mine comes from the Folio Society ) , it says : ‘ Red Riding Hood brought some big stones and they filled the wolf with them , so that when he woke up and tried to spring away he could n't move and fell down dead . ’
When it comes to Jack and the Beanstalk one can no longer rely on the ogre saying : ‘ Fee , fi , fo , fum . ’
The phrase originated from Shakespeare 's King Lear .
You can't even assume Jack kills the ogre .
In the Macmillan version by Nick Sharrat and Stephen Tucker he just gets buried in a compost heap .
What is so staggering is the sheer audacity of the people who come up with these new versions .
It 's like the trendy Anglican clerics who took it upon themselves in the early 1960s to knock out an ‘ improved ’ version of the King James Bible .
Yet just as we allow our local vicars to get away with using the enfeebled modernised Bible , so we let bookshops get away with flogging emaciated versions of children 's classics .

Creative : Writer Julia Donaldson has written many great books
Fortunately there is a lot of good stuff out there if you look for it .
There are the modern classics by writers like Julia Donaldson , whose Gruffalo is enjoying its tenth anniversary .
But rather than coast on past glories , she is now offering Tabby McTat published by Alison Green books .
It is the story of a cat and its owner - a busker - who get separated and find their way back together .
Last year 's classic Stick Man from the same team is still a great hit with my own children .
Judith Kerr 's bestsellers include The Tiger Who Came To Tea which has become a great industry with spin off cups and saucers .
Then we have Lynley Dodd whose Hairy Maclary series are among New Zealand finest exports .
The Horrid Henry series by Francesca Simon and published by Orion goes from strength to strength too .
There are also some old favourites which are well illustrated in new versions with all the lavish flaps and bright colours now expected .
Jim , one of Hilaire Belloc 's Cautionary Tales , has been printed without the grisly wording being changed ( although some rather good health and safety notices for the zoo have been added . )
Most beautiful book of the year must surely go to Miki by Stephen Mackey .
The book has some of the prettiest pictures of polar bears , penguins and whales I have ever seen in a children 's book .
It will take your child to another time and place , and give them a really magical feeling .
If you want your child to be introduced to beautiful things – and what parent does n’t - buy them this book .
Three cheers for Hodder for re-releasing The Extraordinary Adventures of Mr Benn by David McKee .
Have enough young children seen the cult TV series to make them appreciate this book ?
CBeebies should certainly be re-showing this regularly , rather than producing more shows where small creatures talk in whimsical gobbledegook .
Mr Benn is an ordinary bloke who lives in an ordinary British street , who has the most extraordinary adventures .
It ’s a book to widen your child 's imagination and make them feel that anything is possible .
There is some inspired stuff out there and some authentic tales .
But scan the stories carefully before your children turn the pages .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The GOP 's 2008 presidential nominee has earned a primary challenge from the right on Presidents Day .
J.D. Hayworth , a former congressman from Arizona and radio host , formally announced Monday that 's he 's challenging Republican John McCain for his U.S. Senate seat .
" You could say they are two John McCains .
The one who campaigns like a conservative and the one who legislates like a liberal , " said Hayworth at a news conference at his new campaign office in Phoenix , Arizona .
Hayworth also announced Monday that another conservative candidate who was challenging McCain had dropped out of the race and endorsed the former congressman .
Hayworth 's announcement kicked off what is scheduled to be a three - day , 10 - stop campaign swing through the state .
Hayworth , who served six terms in the House of Representatives before losing his 2006 re-election bid , stepped down last month as host of a conservative talk - radio program in Phoenix .
He said he respects McCain 's service but said the senator 's been in Washington too long and is n't conservative enough .
" We all love and think the world of John and John 's place in history is secure , " the 51 - year old Hayworth said Friday .
" But John no longer represents the common sense conservative philosophy that most Arizonans share . "
McCain , 73 , is running for a fifth term in the Senate .
He was in the House six years before being elected to the Senate in 1986 .
McCain has n't faced a difficult re-election since 1992 .
Hayworth 's
Web page bills him as " The Consistent Conservative , " challenging McCain on health care , the national debt and illegal immigration .
A Hayworth press release notes that McCain " voted for the massive bank bailout bill in 2008 , which included $ 150 billion in earmarks . "
McCain , meanwhile , is in the middle of an eight - day campaign swing through the state .
" I do n't know what kind of support that Mr. Hayworth has , " McCain said when asked by a reporter if Hayworth is getting some grassroots conservative support .
" I have n't seen much so far , but maybe I missed it .
And the voters in his district threw him out in 2006 , in a heavy Republican district . "
At a campaign event Monday in Tempe , Arizona , where he received the official backing of 31 mayors from across the state , McCain said " I intend to go out there and earn every single vote . "
He told CNN : " I 'm tenacious , I fight and I love a good campaign . "
Over the past few weeks , McCain has announced endorsements from top conservatives such as former U.S. House Majority Leader Dick Armey of FreedomWorks and Grover Norquist , president of Americans for Tax Reform .
Last month , McCain 's 2008 running mate , former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , announced that she would travel to Arizona to campaign with the senator in March .
Palin 's popularity with voters on the right could help McCain with some Republican voters who question his commitment to conservative values and goals .
Sen . Scott Brown , whose victory in last month 's special Senate election in Massachusetts energized the GOP , also has said he 'll stump with McCain early next month .
And Arizona 's Republican congressional delegation announced Wednesday that it will support the senator .
" I think it 's safe to say that McCain , coming out of the presidential race , was concerned about his possible re-election .
I think he was expecting a challenge from the right , " said Dan Nowicki , political reporter for The Arizona Republic .
McCain 's already facing a primary challenge from Chris Simcox , a co-founder of the Minuteman movement .
Simcox announced his candidacy in April and then resigned from the organization , which tries to prevent illegal crossings of the U.S. border .
McCain 's past support to overhaul immigration legislation in Congress nearly derailed his presidential bid two years ago .
But Hayworth announced Monday that Simcox ended his bid for the GOP senate nomination , and endorsed Hayworth .
Simcox 's withdrawal could help Hayworth consolidate support on the right .
" When J.D. got into this race , I thought long and hard about the decision I had to make , and it became obvious to me that the right thing to do was to remember the mission : Elect a consistent conservative to the United State Senate , " said Simcox .
" My friends , that is exactly what we are here to do .
So it is with great pleasure that I stand with J.D. Hayworth and endorse his campaign . "
Businessman Jim Deakin is also challenging McCain .
" The primary election in Arizona is slated for August 24 .
CNN 's Casey Wian and Chuck Conder contributed to this report .
Research from the Atlanta Federal Reserve shows how the proportion of young people ages 16 to 24 in the work force has collapsed .
If this was simply a phenomenon of the recent crisis , then perhaps it would n't be too surprising given the paucity of jobs these days .
But there 's more to it :
Ever since 2000 , fewer and fewer young people have been working .
See for yourself ; even between recessions the green line below has been falling :
Federal Reserve of Atlanta : Moreover , the most recent recession has seen youth participation rates decline at a rate similar to that seen in the early 2000s .
In contrast , the labor force participation by individuals over 24 years of age has varied much less , implying that the decline in youth labor force participation has been a major contributor to the reduction in the overall rate of labor force participation ( see the above chart ) .
It also appears that the decline in youth participation is most dramatic among teenagers , and for that group it is an equally sized decline for both males and females ( see the next two charts ) .
So , first of all , as stated above , the decline in labor participation from America 's young accounts for the majority of the decline in overall labor market participation .
So it 's not that older workers are dropping out of the rat race , it 's that the younger people are .
The Economist 's Free Exchange thinks this could be partly a good thing -- falling labor market participation is a function of more young people focusing on education .
Maybe , but at the same time it might just be that , for some reason , they find less reason to work , or have less " fire in the belly . "
Free Exchange :
That makes the decline seem a little less troubling .
At least those not able to find work in the labour market are actively investing in human capital .
But this also suggests that young people are developing far less work experience in early adulthood than did previous generations — a factor which could make it more difficult for them to find work when they finally leave school , and which may influence things like levels of student indebtedness in the meantime .
TRENTON , New Jersey ( Reuters ) - New Jersey Governor Chris Christie on Thursday declared a “ fiscal emergency , ” allowing him to reserve or freeze state spending as part of his plan to tackle one of the largest 2011 deficits among U.S. states .

“ These are among the hardest decisions any governor could be called upon to make , ” said the Republican , according to a copy of his speech to legislators in a special session .
The deficit in the current budget , which ends on June 30 , is $ 2.2 billion , while the gap in the following budget has spiked to $ 11 billion from a forecast of $ 8 billion in November , Christie said in his first major policy address to state lawmakers .
Next year ’s deficit is the largest per-capita budget shortfall of any U.S. state , said Christie who is scheduled to deliver his budget for the coming fiscal year on March 16 .
Christie cut $ 2.203 billion from the current budget in a series of measures that include reducing aid to school districts and using unspent funds from some agencies .
In all , 375 budget lines are subject to cuts , efficiencies , and program eliminations .
Cuts include $ 475 million in aid to school districts ; $ 62 million in cuts to colleges , and $ 12 million in aid to hospitals .
The cut in school - district funding will force them to use budget surpluses for the remainder of the fiscal year , Christie said .
Also helping to close the budget gap is the capture of $ 158 million in unspent funds from a state - run clean energy program ; $ 13.8 million in homestead rebates , and $ 15.9 million in unused grant money from the division of youth and family services .
Delayed programs and capital projects totaled more than $ 115 million .
There was no reduction in municipal aid .
Christie already has won over some bond investors .
Since his election , spreads for the state ’s general obligations have narrowed to 25 basis points to 30 basis points over prices for top-rated municipal bonds , said Timothy McGregor , a fund manager with Northern Trust Global Investments in Chicago .
Until Christie won in November , the spreads “ had been closer to 40 basis points to 50 basis points , ” McGregor said .
Democratic leaders blasted Christie ’s plan to balance the current budget as dictatorial and unnecessary .
Louis Greenwald , Democratic chairman of the Assembly Budget Committee , called the action to reduce school aid a “ reckless ” move that would force school districts to raise property taxes .
“ This has taken money out of the school district ’s pocket and put money in his pocket , ” Greenwald said .
He accused Christie of acting without consulting the legislature , and promised to hold public hearings on the budget plan next week .
Senate Majority Leader Barbara Buono accused Christie of “ overreacting to the fiscal circumstances as a pretext for circumventing legislative involvement . ”
Buono cited the last paragraph of the executive order used by Christie to make the cuts , which says it remains in effect “ until , rescinded , modified , or supplemented by me . ”
Christie blamed New Jersey ’s financial problems on the previous budget enacted under his predecessor , former Democratic Governor Jon Corzine .
Elected in November after promising to reduce the size of government , Christie also said deep cuts could not be avoided and faulted “ defenders of the status quo . ”
He said : “ New Jersey has been steaming toward financial disaster for years due to that kind of attitude .
The people elected us to end the talk and to act decisively . ”
Christie also warned that the fiscal 2011 budget will contain more tough spending cuts and more “ dramatic ” reforms .

One of the strangest themes of Rupert Murdoch 's long relationship with Britain is his habit of expressing the pain of a persecuted outsider .
It 's a peculiar trait for someone who makes and breaks governments , who can ignore parliament and bypass British tax laws .
For as long as most of us can remember , this dynast posing as an anti-establishment newcomer , this patriotic Australian who became a citizen of the United States , this family - values diehard who went off with another woman , has been running things behind the scenes .
We are used to his power and sardonic disdain for Britain but last week a line was crossed when Murdoch 's News International dismissed a parliamentary committee 's report on the phone - hacking scandal at the News of the World by saying that the all - party membership of the committee had formed some kind of a conspiracy .
The accusation of persecution is typical – a gangster reflex made in the knowledge that the company can't be touched by MPs , or the media .
Apart from the BBC , the FT , the Independent and the Guardian , the Observer 's sister paper , which investigated these allegations of phone hacking and £ 1 m paid in hush money , the media has remained shamefully silent .
The hacking operation and use of inquiry agents , which for legal reasons has yet to be fully disclosed , is bad enough but the company 's defiance represents a sharp new humiliation because it forces us to acknowledge the decline of national resilience and impotence of our institutions .
Even a paper such as the Daily Mail seems to tremble at the thought of what the 78 - year - old mogul might do , and it is no exaggeration to say that what we 've seen since the culture , media and sport select committee began investigating " the near industrial scale " of the hacking is the suppression by many news organisations of a story that Downing Street declared was " absolutely breathtaking and an extreme cause for concern " .
This is a matter of grave public interest .
It is inconceivable that any agency , party or commercial concern in Britain would be able get away with spying on the military , royals , celebrities , sports figures and government ministers and then react with the what the report identified as " collective amnesia " and " deliberate obfuscation " – in other words the default response of a crime family .
The all - party members of Tory John Whittingdale 's committee could not have been clearer .
They say : " We strongly condemn this behaviour …
News International in particular has sought to conceal the truth about what has really occurred . "
It is significant that they also criticised the metropolitan police for not broadening their 2006 investigation into Clive Goodman , the News of the World journalist who was jailed and caused the departure of the then editor Andy Coulson .
You may well ask why such large - scale criminal activity fell victim to what approximates to Balkan lassitude .
The money sloshing around , the scores of important people hacked , the dormant police files , the two dozen journalists who may have made illegal requests and the private detectives , one of whom was employed by Andy Coulson at the News of the World after a seven - year jail sentence for a serious crime against a vulnerable woman , add up to more than a story of overzealous tabloid reporting .
The whole thing stinks .
The affair becomes much more worrying when you consider the way the Murdoch organisation has lined up behind David Cameron to maintain privileged access to No 10 .
No doubt there was a sense of timely conferment among Conservatives when the Sun announced it was deserting Labour after 12 years and backing Cameron instead .
Rebekah Brooks , the News International chief executive and Cameron 's neighbour in Oxfordshire , was almost certainly as happy as her former colleague Andy Coulson , now David Cameron 's communications director , who still has quite a few questions to answer on all this .
So media power and political power achieve an ever greater degree of merger , just as in Italy , but let us be quite clear that Murdoch 's primary interest is commercial , as it has been ever since he bought into the News of the World 41 years ago .
Already we see the pressures that the Murdoch family will bring to bear on David Cameron if he becomes prime minister .
On Friday the Times , which now barely disguises its pro-Sky agenda , ran an editorial on the BBC 's cuts , accusing its websites of " dumping free content on to markets where its rivals have no public subsidy " .
The phrase bears an uncanny resemblance to James Murdoch 's MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh last year when he talked about the BBC " dumping free , state - sponsored news on the market . "
The editorial read as if the Times editor James Harding had been taking dictation .
Neither James mentions the dumping of free Murdoch news on the market by the Sky website , which is just as likely to put local journalists out of work as the BBC , but the more important point is that the Times shows that it has already become part of the corporate campaign against what is , despite all its faults , the greatest public broadcaster in the world .
Murdoch 's agenda has never been more naked , and if the Conservatives win , News International will have a government that feels in its debt , as well as an important ally on the inside – Andy Coulson .
We may very soon be back to the days under Blair when the News of the World executives went into No 10 and drafted legislation on paedophiles , only this time the BBC and broadcasting regulators will be in News International 's sights .
As the business secretary Lord Mandelson said after the Sun dumped Labour : " There are some in the commercial sector who believe that the future of British media would be served by cutting back the role of the media regulator .
They take this view because they want to commandeer more space and income for themselves and because they want to maintain their iron grip on pay - TV …
They also want to erode the commitment to impartiality .
In other words , to fill British airwaves with more Fox - style news . "
We should pay attention to what he says – he understands the beast very well .
Given what is known about the practices of Murdoch 's print journalists , most people would regard the extension of News International 's influence in TV as a very bad thing , which is precisely why the company acted to try to cover up the scandal .
A total of £ 700,000 has been paid to Gordon Taylor , head of the Professional Footballers ' Association .
This is to say nothing of the £ 792,000 paid out to a sports journalist because of alleged bullying by Andy Coulson .
But this is scuttlebutt in comparison to the spectacle of News International getting away with outright contempt for our law and for parliament .
Berlusconi's Italy is not such a distant nightmare .
• The head of the PFA is Gordon Taylor ; this article has now been amended .
According to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas , the atmosphere at State of the Union addresses is too partisan , making it unfitting for a judge to attend .
But Thomas ’ complaints about partisanship apparently did n’t stop him from taking a not - so - subtle shot at the Democratic president during a speech on Thursday .
The Associated Press reports , “ Thomas told an audience Thursday at the University of Florida law school that some of the comments ‘ border on being irresponsible ’ and ‘ run the risk in our society of undermining institutions that we need to preserve our liberties . ' ”

The controversial judge “ did not speak specifically about the court ’s recent decision on campaign financing or mention President Barack Obama , ” the AP notes , “ [ b ] ut his comments come a week after Obama took the rare step of openly criticizing the decision during his State of the Union speech . ”
During his SOTU speech a week ago Wednesday , Obama said , “ Last week , the Supreme Court reversed a century of law to open the floodgates for special interests — including foreign companies — to spend without limit in our elections .
Well , I do n’t think American elections should be bankrolled by America ’s most powerful interests , and worse , by foreign entities .
They should be decided by the American people , and that ’s why I ’m urging Democrats and Republicans to pass a bill that helps to right this wrong . ”
Thomas ’ fellow conservative on the court , Justice Samuel Alito , was seen mouthing “ not true ” during Obama ’s criticism of the court ’s ruling on the Citizens United case .
The moment was likened to Rep. Joe Wilson ’s “ You Lie ! ” outburst during a speech Obama gave on health care to Congress last September .
“ Depending upon political persuasion , both Democrats and Republicans cried a breach of etiquette .
Regardless , the sparring of a sitting president , especially during his State of the Union , and a sitting Supreme Court Justice , no matter how subtle , is an unprecedented occurrence , ” ASU ’s Alana Arbuthnot wrote for State Press .
“ Those erring on a more conservative note felt that Obama had infringed upon the separation of powers ; others felt Alito was out of his bounds for conveying his opinions . ”
Tuesday night at Stetson University , Thomas told students why he skipped the address last week .

The AP reported ,
“ I dont go because it has become so partisan and it ’s very uncomfortable for a judge to sit there , ” he said , adding that “ theres a lot that you do n’t hear on TV – the catcalls , the whooping and hollering and under - the - breath comments . ”
Politico ’s Ben Smith notes , “ A Supreme Court spokeswoman , Kathy Arberg , said Thomas has made exceptions to that rule , according to the Court ’s unofficial records .
He attended the 2009 State of the Union , and then was absent for most of the Bush years , returning in 2006 — a moment of particularly deep partisanship which may have reminded him why he skipped them , as he was absent again in 2007 and 2008 . ”
“ He attended President Obama ’s remarks to a joint session last February , a moment of relative partisan goodwill , and ( wisely , it seems ) skipped this year ’s , ” Smith adds .

Thomas ’ past was n’t exactly non-partisan before his appointment to the Supreme Court .
After graduating from
Yale law school in 1974 , Thomas promptly went to work as a clerk for Republican Missouri Attorney General John Danforth , and as an aide for him after he was elected to the US Senate three years later .
ADVERTISEMENT
In 1984 , while serving in the Reagan Administration as head of the EEOC , the Washington Post reported , “ The chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission says that black leaders are ‘ watching the destruction of our race ’ as they ‘ bitch , bitch , bitch ’ about President Reagan but fail to work with the administration to solve problems . ”
In an 1987 interview with Reason , Thomas said that he held “ some very strong libertarian leanings . ”
“ I tend to really be partial to Ayn Rand , and to The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged , ” Thomas said in 1987 .
“ But at this point I ’m caught in the position where if I were a true libertarian I would n’t be here in government . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
However , in that rare 1987 interview , Thomas did criticize the GOP for showing “ very little interest in black Americans . ”
“ But I know that the vote of 9 out of 10 black Americans for the Democratic Party or for leftist kinds of policies just is not reflective of their opinions , ” Thomas said .
“ The Republican Party and the conservatives have shown very little interest in black Americans and have actually done things to leave the impression among blacks that they are antagonistic to their interests .
Even as someone who ’s labeled a conservative – I ’m a Republican I ’m black , I ’m heading up this organization in the Reagan administration –I can say that conservatives do n’t exactly break their necks to tell blacks that they ’re welcome . ”
New York stylist Ashley Javier used to have a code word to ease the pain for young clients going prematurely grey .
He 'd call the unwanted hair " sparkles . "
Now he calls them stylish .
If you think it 's been a grey winter , just wait until summer when silver strands that have been sprouting up on the fashion runways are expected to hit the streets and the heads of fashion - forward twenty - and thirtysomethings .
" A lot of these women are n't old enough to remember blue rinses and those beauty - school granny colours – the women they thought of as ' older ' did n't do that , " says Javier .
" So for their generation , ( grey ) seems a little undiscovered . "
Supermodel Kate Moss showed up at a Longchamp handbag launch in Paris last month sporting silver streaks , causing fashionistas of all ages to wonder whether hard partying was coming back to haunt the 36 - year - old .
Young models were sporting steely streaks in elaborate bouffants at Chanel 's recent haute couture show .
Even 13 - year - old fashion blogging phenom Tavi Gevinson had gone grey at last week 's New York fashion week – a look that Javier describes as more Golden Girl than It Girl .
" She looked just like Estelle Getty ( the elderly star of the 1980s sitcom ) with her glasses and pillbox hat , " Javier chuckles .
Toronto hair stylist Mike Baronowski bleached his brown locks platinum last fall and loves the light look , which he says has started catching on among young Asians because it 's such a break from black .
His boss , Yorkville stylist Greg May , sees silver as rebellious and retro – a throwback to the 1980s and a way for young people to make their mark on a new decade .
" I find it actually makes me look younger , " says Baronowski , 22 .
" I do n't even remember the ' 80s , so this just seems futuristic to me . "
May says some older clients have been asking for silvery highlights and he 's getting more demand for grey .
" I have men coming in asking for that Richard Gere older - man look – and they 're 30 years old . "
Rosedale hair stylist Rita Renouf , 55 , finds all this quite amusing , having spent decades fighting back grey before letting her own wavy locks return to their natural silver a few years ago .
" It used to be that young girls hated my hair – I looked old .
Now all of a sudden I 'm finding that a lot of girls are very envious of my colour .
I 've never had 20 - to 25 - year - olds go crazy over my hair .
But it 's quite beautiful , I have to admit . "
Javier describes the ideal look as streaks of Japanese anime - style colours , such as slate grey , blue or seafoam green .
Do n't go all grey " or you 'll look like you 're wearing a wig , " he warns .
The man who has styled the hair of Hollywood icons such as Penelope Cruz and Uma Thurman cautions that this " new wave of possibilities " requires meticulous bleaching and toning .
Otherwise you risk walking out of the shop looking like the blue - rinsed Mrs. Slocombe from the British comedy Are You Being Served ?

" These colours are meant to be empowering .
The sexiness comes from the fact that not every girl at the party looks like you or has this colour , " says Javier .
" It 's so tricky to make sure it does n't look tragic that , when you do get it right , there 's a certain aura about you .
People remember you . "
Dear Cecil : Quick scenario : deserted island , colorful fruits and vegetation .
How do I know what I should eat and what I should feed to my mother - in - law ?
Is there any way to differentiate between poisonous fruits and nonpoisonous ones ?
Jermain
Cecil replies :
The traditional method , which admittedly works better on a group - project basis , is to try some .
If you throw up , get convulsions , or die , it ’s poisonous .
The scientific method , as explained in the U.S. Army Survival Manual , is to memorize the local edible plants prior to getting marooned .
Too late for that ?
The implicit message of the manual is : soldier , you ’re hosed .
However , it does offer a plan B , namely the 13 - step Universal Edibility Test .
This boils down to cautiously trying whatever potential edible you have a lot of and seeing if you throw up , get convulsions , or die .
That may not seem like the world ’s most helpful advice , but there ’s no foolproof way of avoiding poisonous plants .
The best you can do is avoid high - risk items while keeping your fingers crossed about everything else .
That said , while I do n’t claim to be a survival expert , I think we can expand a bit on the sketchy advice in the army manual .
Herewith some tips .
1 . First see if you can find fresh water , meat , or fish .
Without water you ’re doomed .
Fish or meat , if you can get it , is higher on the food chain than plants and provides a better nutritional mix .
2 . Do n’t eat mushrooms or fungi .
They ’re not all lethal , obviously , but when they ’re bad , they ’re really bad .
For example , as we ’ve discussed in the past , consumption of Amanita phalloides may result in nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , cramping , kidney and / or liver failure , coma , and death .
The thing is , this mushroom does n’t say Amanita phalloides on it .
It looks like a mushroom .
How likely are you to encounter one ?
I have no idea ; you did n’t specify where your deserted island was .
If you do know where it is , why are you writing me ?
Do like the army says , and memorize those edible plants .
3 . Skip anything that smells like almonds .
Cyanide .
4 . Do n’t eat anything that ’s rotten , mildewed , growing in stagnant water , or otherwise disgusting .
You ’d think this would go without saying , but all the survival guides make a point of mentioning it , so I figure so should I .
5 . Boil it , if you ’ve got the means .
The army disparages this practice , saying boiling does n’t destroy all toxins .
Maybe not , but it ’ll destroy some toxins , and at the same time get rid of the tannins that render foods like acorns unpalatable .
Nonetheless , apply the Universal Edibility Test ( which we ’ll get to below ) before chowing down .
6 . Watch what animals eat .
This is another thing the army manual thinks is a bad idea , since humans and animals have different vulnerabilities .
No doubt , but come on .
If an animal eats something and drops dead , I submit that tells you something .
More seriously , if an animal eats something without apparent harm , I ’d say it warrants further study using the UET .
7 . Avoid white or yellow berries , as well as plants with beans , seeds , or milky white sap .
Castor bean seeds , for example , contain the deadly toxin ricin ; a couple can be fatal .
Purple or black berries are worth a try .
Red fruit is iffy .
Some are fine ; many others ( yew , holly , woody nightshade ) not .
Take no chances .
UET ’em all .
8. Avoid plants that look like parsley or carrots — could be hemlock .
Also , remember : “ leaves of three , let them be ” — groups of three leaves being the sign of poison ivy and oak .
That gets us past the first cut .
Now we run the Universal Edibility Test on what ’s left .
I have a hard time believing you ’re going to remember 13 steps , and anyone together enough to bring the manual listing them would surely also stash a copy of World ’s Edible Plants .
So here ’s a simplified version :
Find something abundant .
No sense wasting time on a plant that could turn out to be both poisonous and scarce .
Pick out one part of the plant to test — for example , just the leaves and not the roots .
One may be poisonous while the other is n’t .
Which is more likely ?
No idea .
That ’s why you ’re doing the test .
Fast for eight hours , to give anything you ate earlier time to act up .
While waiting , hold the plant against your wrist or inside elbow for 15 minutes to see if it irritates your skin .
Touch a small amount to your lips for three minutes .
Touch it to your tongue for 15 minutes .
Chew it but do n’t swallow for 15 minutes .
Swallow .
If you do n’t get sick after eight hours , try a quarter cup of the plant and repeat the above .
Still breathing ?
Good sign .
Coughing blood ?
That ’s bad .
Maybe next time you ’ll memorize those edible plants .

An employee of All Nippon Airways Co. works at Narita international airport in Narita April 29 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Issei Kato
TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Women flying Japan ’s All Nippon Airways will have a toilet all to themselves from next month , with the airline designating one restroom on most international routes as female - only .
The airline said in a statement it was responding to “ numerous requests for this service , ” adding that the toilet would be located in the rear of the plane and be available to women passengers from all classes .
An airline official told Kyodo news agency that ANA decided to designate women - only lavatories based on a 2007 online survey in which 90 percent of the women polled said they found the idea attractive .
The official also said women do not like using shared toilets as men sometimes leave the seat up .
She said demand for women - only toilets was especially high among passengers taking long flights .
Men would be allowed to use the lavatory only in emergencies or when there were very few female passengers on the flight , the ANA statement said .
South Korea ’s Korean
Air has been offering similar facilities and ANA rival Japan Airlines designates lavatories for priority use by women , the ANA official told Kyodo .
Toilet etiquette appears to be an important part of ANA ’s policy -- the airline had previously asked passengers to use the lavatories before they board flights so as to reduce the overall weight of the plane , which would ultimately be better for the environment as it would mean less fuel usage .
Here ’s a glorious bit of design nostalgia for the New Year .
It ’s hardly a new find on the web ; designer Nick Job first started this archive of the British Rail identity manuals in 2011 , but I ’ve just been reminded of it .
Somehow I ’ve never written about it either , which is a bit of an oversight given the entirely - unofficial and tongue in cheek name of this site : the British Rail alphabet and signage guidelines were also used by the British Airports Authority and National Health Service , making them as much a government standard as Britain ever usually manages .
The alphabet had two variants , one for dark - on - light type and one for light - on - dark .
Light ( and illuminated ) type on dark backgrounds creates an optical effect known as ‘ halation ’ - i.e. it develops a halo , a slight sense of the letterforms being thicker than they are .
To cope with this , the letterforms are reduced by the width of an outline for the lighter type , shown in the last panel above — while retaining the same spacing and other details of the type .
It ’s worth pointing out that a revival of the typeface is now available to license and as a web font from FontDeck .
For the non-British ( or the very young ) British Rail was the nationalised entity that ran the vast majority of railways ( and a few ferry routes and other transport - related things ) in the UK , beginning in 1948 ¹ .
It was rarely out of the news ( more so on slow news days ) for ‘ record losses ’ , ‘ strikes ’ , ‘ failures ’ , ‘ delays ’ and so on .
Starting in 1994 the network was dismantled and sold off , with the last few bits sold in 1997 .
Instead of a nationally - owned monopoly , we have regional monopolies owned by a variety of companies and ( perhaps amusingly ) , the nationalised rail corporations of other countries .
The headlines are now about ‘ record price rises ’ , ‘ record profits ’ ( also : greedy executives and shareholders ) , ‘ overcrowding ’ , and yes , ‘ delays ’ .
According to the polls² , privatisation is generally considered to have been a Very Bad Idea and Can It Go Back To How It Was , Please .
Whatever your view or politics on the matter are , running an at - capacity rail network will never make you popular with the people who have to use it .
I ’m being charitable there .
Despite each of the rail operating companies having their own brands , for most British people the British Rail identity is still a familiar part of the landscape , with the logo being the road sign symbol for any rail station , and much of the signage ( especially at smaller stations ) unchanged from pre-privatisation days .
But what an identity !
The whole thing is such a brilliantly consistent and well - designed system , owing much of its strength to its crisp , stark simplicity , to its minimalism and almost - total reliance on typography alone .
There ’s so little to it that there ’s very little ( virtually nothing ) that can ever really look out of date or old fashioned — sure in the 80s everyone³ had a thing for Rotis ( for heaven ’s sake ) and there was that grunge stuff in the 90s and we ’ve had the web and all that⁴ , but nothing that was really so outstandingly superior or more modern .
What made the identity look bad was the usual thing that ruins most good things : neglect and apathy .
A faded peeling sign in a shabby , half - ruined station with leaky roofs and deathtrap toilets is never going to look great , and by the time privatisation came along that was the caricature we were being presented with , and so out it went .
And that ’s a real shame , for so many reasons .
Először a Mandinernek adott bloginterjút Ausztrál Tom , a mulatságos videói miatt itthon egyre népszerűbb , magyarul önszorgalomból tanuló ausztrál egyetemista , aki talán a legtávolabbi Magyarország - rajongók egyike a Földön .

Do you know what it 's like to have a sudden , sharp pain in your back that you know is going to lead to several days of terrible pain and stiffness ?
I am very familiar with this scenario from my own experiences with back pain and from my work as a chiropractor for many years .
If you know what this feels like , then you might find what I have to say next to be surprising .
The best thing that you can do for yourself as soon as you feel that familiar spasm or pull in your back muscles is the following :
Nothing .
No matter what you are doing - shovelling snow , carrying groceries , painting , laundry , or exercising - stop immediately and lie down on the closest comfortable surface .
You want to lie down with your knees bent up so that your feet are flat on the floor , or so that your calves are resting on several pillows or on a chair .
As you lie down , try to relax all of your muscles , especially the ones in your back .
You can facilitate effective relaxation by taking slow , deep breaths from your tummy .
Depending on how badly you have pulled your muscles or ligaments , you can lie like this for 15 minutes or 1 hour .
When you feel very relaxed , try to get up slowly , turning on your side and using your arms to help lift your upper body off the ground .
Be sure to use your thigh muscles to stand up .
If you feel any pain as you try to stand up , lay down again and relax some more .
Following this recommendation will significantly decrease the severity of your injury , and will have you back to normal much sooner than if you had continued on with your activities .
Here 's why ...
The first moment that you experience sharp pain in your back is a signal that a muscle or ligament has been stressed beyond its natural capacity .
From that moment on , if the muscle or ligament in question is still being asked to work , your body will create inflammation in that area , which brings pain , stiffness , and swelling .
Why does your body do this ?
Because pain , stiffness , and swelling are parts of a protective response that your body uses to get you to rest that area until it heals .
Can you see why popping a pain killer in this situation is not in your best interest ?
If you numb yourself to pain , then you 'll probably continue being active , not giving your injured tissues a chance to rest and recover .
This is a great way to worsen your injury and prolong your suffering .
And let 's not forget the negative side effects that pain killers have on your stomach , liver and kidneys .
At the first sign of sharp pain in their backs , many people choose to continue working , finding that if they stay active and warm , they do n't stiffen up and they are able to remain functional for a few hours or the rest of the day .
Continuing to be active after the initial injury causes your body to produce natural pain killers like endorphins , which gives you the illusion that you are fine .
The problem with this is that while you are not feeling much discomfort , your injured tissues are continuously being stressed , which will increase your pain and stiffness later on that day or the next morning .
By lying down at the first twinge of back pain , you will minimize damage to your injured tissues .
You will also minimize inflammation , which will lead to less pain and stiffness .
Sometimes , if the injury is n't too severe and you are able to lie down right away , you might be totally fine as soon as you stand up .
Following this recommendation can mean the difference between having back pain for one hour or for one week .
Please try it the next time you feel that awful pull or twinge in your back .
Note : some people make a trip to a physical therapist , chiropractor , or massage therapist right after injuring their backs .
Unless your injury is causing you to lose control over your urine flow and bowel movements , I highly recommend that you first try my suggestion .
Why ?
Think about all of the stress that your back faces in going for treatment .
You have to get into your car , make the drive to the office , get out of the car , sit in the waiting room , get up onto the treatment table , and all of the above in reverse .
Believe me , in most cases , it is far more beneficial to lie down on your living room floor for an hour than to put your back through all of these steps .
And your floor is free .
If you still have pain or stiffness after resting right after your injury and do not experience gradual improvement over the next few days , that might be a good time to visit a practitioner who can provide treatment that will hopefully help your injured tissues heal properly .

Is your brain making you fat ?
We 're getting fatter , but it 's not all our fault , says physiologist Professor Michael Cowley .
Spend enough time in public places or even watching television and it's clear that people are becoming more overweight .
Indeed rates of obesity are rising in both adults and children .
But the average adult 's weight increases by less than 500 grams a year — the equivalent of just a few potato chips a day .
This demonstrates the remarkable job our bodies do of balancing our food intake and energy output .
So for those of us whose waistlines are expanding — what 's going wrong ?
And are we solely to blame ?
^ to top
' Crisis of plenty '
The recent increase in the amount of fat in our bodies is due to dramatic changes in our lifestyle over the past 100 years or so — a change we 're not equipped to deal with from an evolutionary perspective .
For many people , physical effort has become optional , and with the increasing availability of energy - rich , tasty foods , in larger and larger portions , we 've created a ' crisis of plenty ' in our pantries and refrigerators .
So we are pushing ourselves to gain weight on both sides of the energy balance .
And our bodies are all in favour of that .
In evolutionary terms , it 's good to put on weight .
We need energy stores to carry out activities that use lots of energy , like growing and repairing muscle , as well as carrying pregnancies , and raising children — and historically , food supplies were n't always a given .
Our brains developed ways to maintain our fat stores by detecting the levels of a hormone called leptin , which is secreted into the blood by fat cells .
The brain mostly tries to keep this hormone level constant , by making us hungry and burn less energy when our leptin levels drop .
It 's an effective system for people whose lives depend on having reserves of energy to survive famine , but for those of us battling obesity in a time of plenty it 's got some serious downfalls .
For starters , leptin makes it difficult for most of us to lose weight easily through dieting .
When we diet , leptin levels drop rapidly .
The brain notices this decline and triggers strong hunger , and also makes us burn less energy , trying to preserve body fat — effectively counteracting the diet .
On top of the diet dilemma , obesity itself interferes with the brain 's regulatory system .
It seems that the high levels of leptin from excess body fat makes the brain leptin - resistant , and less able to detect levels of stored fat .
The brain actually gets tricked into thinking we are leaner than we really are — so too much fat seems to reprogram the brain into thinking we 're starved .

Addicted to eating
Leptin aside , there 's another factor working to increase bodyweight for some obese people — compulsive food consumption mirrors drug addiction .
Recent brain imaging studies have shown that addictive drugs activate a set of ' reward ' pathways in the brain .
These brain systems seem to tell the brain that something is very important , and are usually activated by things that are essential for survival .
Addictive drugs highjack these brain pathways .
For some obese people , food also activates these pathways , to them we could say that food has characteristics of an addiction .
The downside of weighing more With increased body weight , and more importantly increased levels of body fat , come increased risks of many diseases .
The diseases most commonly associated with obesity are diabetes , and cardiovascular diseases like heart attack and stroke .
Unfortunately it seems that having one of these diseases increases the risk of having the others : this is called ' metabolic syndrome ' .
We do not understand the basis of these diseases occurring together , but there is growing evidence that fat which accumulates around the belly , termed ' visceral fat ' , or ' abdominal fat ' contributes to the increased risks .
This may be because abdominal fat secretes different things into the bloodstream than does fat in other parts of the body .
These factors seem to activate the immune system , and cause it to secrete infection - fighting chemicals that can also have problematic effects on the whole body , leading to increased disease risk .
While it seems like a flawed system , our body fat regulation evolved under pressure to cope with too little food .
In our evolutionary past we have n't really needed to evolve ways to deal with too much fat — it has n't happened often enough to have been a burden to survival .
But while our lifestyle has changed our brains have n't yet caught up , they 're still operating like we 're living in times of regular famine .
However , not everyone becomes obese in our current food rich environment , so it 's clear that individuals have different tendencies to become overweight or obese .
This suggests the high rates of obesity present today are due to an interaction between our genetic predisposition and our environment .
While a number of individual genes have been shown to cause obesity , it is unlikely that these gene mutations alone are responsible for the current rising rates of obesity .
What 's more likely to have a bigger impact on our tendency to gain weight is our recent evolutionary history .
Although all humans share a common ancient ancestry , our recent evolutionary histories differ depending on where our recent ancestors lived .
For example some people come from places where the environments were less productive , or where the food supply was less reliable .
They have evolved a ' thrifty ' genotype that enables them to thrive with periodic low food availability : they store food efficiently when they can , to prepare for a possible future famine .
This is a really good adaptation when there is regular famine , but with most of us in the developed world trying to decrease our food consumption what was once an evolutionary advantage now causes increased risks .
Our different genetic histories also show up in the way that some people can become obese and not become unwell , while for others only a moderate increase in weight can bring on serious disease .

Resisting obesity
Evolutionary biologist Professor Jared Diamond has pointed out that the relative abundance of food in Europe for many hundreds of years might have created conditions that would have allowed someone to become obese if they were determined to overeat and not exercise .
He suggests that there may have been a selective pressure in Europe to develop resistance to obesity , and obesity - induced diseases .
If this is correct then we might sadly discover that as people from non-European backgrounds become more affluent and more obese , they will have even higher prevalence of diabetes and heart disease .
Our understanding of the pathways in the brain that sense stored fat , stomach contents , and blood sugar has helped us understand obesity and how it contributes to diabetes and heart disease , and has led to the development of several new drug therapies .
But we cannot wait for magic bullets to help us lose weight .
We have a responsibility to ourselves and our children to develop ways of living that incorporate better eating habits and more active lifestyles , to make vigorous activity part of our day not a special occasion .

He conducts research into how our brains control metabolism , and develops therapies for obesity and related diseases .

“ War is peace , freedom is slavery and ignorance is strength ” — more than a quarter - century after those oxymorons were supposed to pervade an Orwellian 1984 , today ’s media make such newspeak even more preposterous :
On economic issues , we are often told that right is center , center is left , and left is fringe .
For a year , national reporters ( with help from conservative talk - radio goons ) have depicted the center - right Obama administration and its corporatist policies as quasi-Marxist .
We ’ve heard that a government - run public health care option is a “ liberal ” cause , even as polls confirm that most Americans — not just liberals — support the idea .
We ’re told that legislators backing no -strings - attached bank bailouts are mainstream “ centrists , ” while bailout opponents are extremists — even as public opinion surveys say the opposite .
This is Washington ’s “ fair and balanced ” journalism ( or “ journalism , ” as it were ) and as two of the most respected metro newspapers show this week , its distortions can bleed into local coverage .
Reporting on independent Bernie Sanders , the Boston Globe headlined its recent profile : “ Sanders a growing force on the far , far left — Vermont senator is gathering clout as he takes on the Fed ’s Ben Bernanke . ”
Polls , mind you , prove that disdain for the Fed chairman transcends “ the left . ”
As a failed regulator and architect of unpopular bailouts , Bernanke is despised by the public at large .
Even within the Senate , his renomination faces transpartisan opposition from Republicans like Jim Bunning ( Kentucky ) and red-state Democrats like Byron Dorgan ( North Dakota ) .
So depicting Sanders ’ fight against Bernanke as a “ far , far left ” crusade tilts the definition of the economic “ center ” — the premium label in politics — to the far , far right .
Then came a Denver Post editorial ( in fairness , billed honestly as opinion ) urging the city ’s mayor , restaurateur John Hickenlooper , a Democrat , to run for governor .
In an earlier interview with the paper ’s editors , Hickenlooper told the Post that his candidacy will be motivated by his belief that “ there should be a lot more people in government who come out of the business community . ”
The Post responded in its editorial not by pointing out that the business - government revolving door is already spinning out of control , nor by noting that we ’re approaching the historical zenith of corporate - government corruption .
Instead , the newspaper gushed .
“ Even though he governs a left - leaning city , Hickenlooper has been a pro-business Democrat … making ( city services ) more cost - effective , ” the paper wrote , before criticizing Hickenlooper ’s potential Democratic rival , Congressman Ed Perlmutter , as unacceptably “ farther to the left than Colorado ’s electorate . ”
Notice the suggestion of conflict between “ left - leaning ” and “ pro-business . ”
There was no mention that the politicians typically labeled “ pro-business ” were the same ones who pushed deregulatory schemes that destroyed so many businesses in this recession .
Likewise , there was no mention that more “ left - leaning ” initiatives might have averted the disaster .
Notice , too , the technocratic euphemism describing old - line conservatism : “ Cost - effective ” is code for a mayor who most recently threatened layoffs unless police agreed to give up previously negotiated pay raises .
And , most important , notice the newspaper ’s line about Perlmutter .
Unlike Hickenlooper , this eminently moderate congressional Democrat with ties to organized labor has twice won a formerly Republican swing district that is a microcosm of his state .
Perlmutter , in fact , is living proof that pragmatically progressive economic credentials are n’t “ farther to the left ” than the electorate — they are squarely in the election - winning center .
The Globe and Post examples , of course , epitomize the larger problem that arises when media voices — whether deliberately or inadvertently — skew the terms of our political debate .
War is not peace and right is not center .
But such newspeak to the contrary can destructively alter the public ’s perception of acceptable and unacceptable , possible and impossible .

Under growing pressure from conservatives and " tea party " activists , Sen .
John McCain of Arizona is having to defend his record of supporting the government 's massive bailout of the financial system .
Q & A
McCain discusses issues
Hayworth , McCain trade jabs
In response to criticism from opponents seeking to defeat him in the Aug. 24 Republican primary , the four - term senator says he was misled by then - Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke .
McCain said the pair assured him that the $ 700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program would focus on what was seen as the cause of the financial crisis , the housing meltdown .
" Obviously , that did n't happen , " McCain said in a meeting Thursday with The Republic 's Editorial Board , recounting his decision - making during the critical initial days of the fiscal crisis .
" They decided to stabilize the Wall Street institutions , bail out ( insurance giant ) AIG , bail out Chrysler , bail out General Motors .
. . .
What they figured was that if they stabilized Wall Street - I guess it was trickle - down economics - that therefore Main Street would be fine . "
Nearly 15 months later , commercial lenders still are in shaky condition and the commercial real - estate industry is in trouble , he said .
On Friday , President Barack Obama announced $ 1.5 billion in funding for new measures to help Arizona and four other states hit hard by the tanked housing market and by joblessness .
But McCain stopped short of calling the TARP a mistake .
" Something had to be done because the world 's financial system was on the verge of collapse , " he said .
" Any economist , liberal or conservative , would agree with that .
The action they took , I do n't agree with . "
Republican Senate primary challenger J.D. Hayworth is using the TARP vote as a bludgeon against McCain 's reputation as a fiscal hawk .
Tea partyers point to it as the start of a new explosion of federal spending that has continued into the Obama administration .
Paulson , President George W. Bush 's
Treasury secretary from 2006 to 2009 , also is dishing out criticism of McCain , who on Sept. 24 , 2008 , temporarily suspended his ultimately unsuccessful presidential campaign to go to Capitol Hill to confront the economic crisis .
In his new book " On the Brink : Inside the Race to Stop the Collapse of the Global Financial System , " Paulson belittles McCain 's contribution to the response , noting that " when it came right down to it , ( McCain ) had little to say in the forum he himself had called . "
He also called McCain 's decision to return to Washington , apparently without a plan , " impulsive and risky " and even " dangerous . "
McCain said Bush called him in off the campaign trail , saying a worldwide economic catastrophe was imminent and that he needed his help .
" I do n't know of any American , when the president of the United States calls you and tells you something like that , who would n't respond , " McCain said .
" And I came back and tried to sit down and work with Republicans and say , ' What can we do ? ' "
McCain last month voted against confirming Bernanke for a second term as Fed chairman , saying he should be held responsible for his contribution to the meltdown .
Bernanke still won easy Senate approval .
An investigational drug that inhibits serotonin synthesis in the gut , administered orally once daily , effectively cured osteoporosis in mice and rats reports an international team led by researchers from Columbia University Medical Center , in the Feb. 7 issue of Nature Medicine .
Serotonin in the gut has been shown in recent research to stall bone formation .
The finding could lead to new therapies that build new bone ; most current drugs for osteoporosis can only prevent the breakdown of old bone .
" New therapies that inhibit the production of serotonin in the gut have the potential to become a novel class of drugs to be added to the therapeutic arsenal against osteoporosis , " said Gerard Karsenty , M.D. , Ph.D. , chair of the Department of Genetics and Development at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons , lead author of the paper .
" With tens of millions of people worldwide affected by this devastating and debilitating bone loss , there is an urgent need for new treatments that not only stop bone loss , but also build new bone .
Using these findings , we are working hard to develop this type of treatment for human patients . "
The Nature Medicine paper follows on a major discovery , also made by Dr. Gerard Karsenty 's group ( published in the Nov. 26 , 2008 issue of Cell ) , that serotonin released by the gut inhibits bone formation , and that regulating the production of serotonin within the gut affects the formation of bone .
Prior to this discovery , serotonin was primarily known as a neurotransmitter acting in the brain .
Yet , 95 percent of the body 's serotonin is found in the gut , where its major function is to inhibit bone formation ( the remaining five percent is in the brain , where it regulates mood , among other critical functions ) .
By turning off the intestine 's release of serotonin , the team was able , in this new study , to cure osteoporosis in mice that had undergone menopause .
Based on their findings reported in the Cell paper , Dr. Karsenty and his team postulated that an inhibitor of serotonin synthesis should be an effective treatment for osteoporosis .
Shortly thereafter , they read about an investigational drug , known as LP533401 , which is able to inhibit serotonin in the gut .
" When we learned of this compound , we thought that it was important to test it as proof of principle that there could be novel ways to treat osteoporosis with therapies that can be taken orally and regulate the formation of serotonin , " said Dr. Karsenty .
Dr. Karsenty and his team developed a research protocol to test their theory , where they administered the compound orally , once daily , at a small dose , for up to six weeks to rodents experiencing post - menopausal osteoporosis .
Results demonstrated that osteoporosis was prevented from developing , or when already present , could be fully cured .
Of critical importance , levels of serotonin were normal in the brain , which indicated that the compound did not enter the general circulation and was unable to cross the blood - brain barrier , thereby avoiding many potential side effects .
Implications for the Treatment of Osteoporosis
Most osteoporosis drugs , including those currently under clinical investigation , do not generate new bone but rather , prevent the breakdown of old bone .
Only one drug currently on the market can generate new bone - but it must be taken by injection once a day , and because it may increase the risk of bone cancer , at least in rats , its use is restricted for short - term use in women with severe osteoporosis .
" There is an urgent need to identify new , safe therapies that can increase bone formation on a long term basis and to such an extent that they compensate for the increase in bone resorption caused by menopause , " said Dr. Karsenty .
" Furthermore , it is important to note that since this study was conducted in rodents , it will need further confirmation in human subjects . "
Osteoporosis : A Disease of Bone Mass Decline
Osteoporosis is a growing public health concern , with the aging population and the incidence of post - menopausal osteoporosis on the rise .
It is a disease of low bone mass , most often caused by an increase in bone resorption not compensated by a similar increase in bone formation .
Far from being inert , bone constantly undergoes renovation , with some cells responsible for removing old material and other cells responsible for creating new bone .
In humans , after age 20 , the balance between bone formation and breakdown tips toward breakdown , and bone mass starts to decline .
In women , the rate of decline increases after menopause , when estrogen levels drop and cells that tear down old bone become overactive .
Osteoporosis is a disease in which bones become fragile and porous , increasing the risk of breaks .
It is diagnosed when bone mass drops below a certain level .

It took PayPal which is owned by eBay in San Jose , Calif. , more than a week to notify customers after being flagged by Indian regulators .
The Reserve Bank of India said it asked the company on Jan. 27 to immediately suspend PayPal payments to and from India as well as transfers to local banks in India .
PayPal said it complied with the request the next day .
Executives from both Indian and American information technology companies say they were caught off - guard by the announcement .
“ Like all the freelancing sites , we rely on PayPal , ” said Alok Maheshwari , founder and chief executive of Harmony Infotech , a nine - employee Web development company in the south India state of Andhra Pradesh .
“ We used to get a check in our company name mailed to us instead , but we stopped because PayPal is very easy to use . ”
Harmony Infotech has been relying on PayPal since 2005 , and now averages about $ 1,500 a month in PayPal transaction payments .
On Feb. 2 , Harmony Infotech got a payment via PayPal from Rent A Coder , a Tampa , Fla. , company that connects computer engineers with jobs , and Mr. Maheshwari said he moved the payment to his company ’s bank account in India .
Two days later , the payment was reversed , leaving him with a negative PayPal balance .
The payment was a “ commercial ” and not personal payment , he said .
PayPal says that only personal payments should have been reversed , and that if a commercial payment was reversed , the payer should resend the money .
Some PayPal users send commercial payments as personal payments to avoid the fees on commercial payments .
In a notice on its Web site to the Indian companies it hires , Rent A Coder said “ We have never received a coherent answer from PayPal as to why they blocked any of the payments . ”
To avoid the uncertainty , Rent A Coder suggested a switch to Payoneer , an alternate online payment site , which is “ offering a special to Indian workers . ”
Police who play burglar in the middle of the night
Operation Golden : PCSO Stuart Mortimer from Cheshire Police demonstrates the door hangers that will be given to householders
A shadowy figure lurking in the garden in the early hours .
A rattle on a window latch .
It must be a burglar .
But do n't panic too soon and call the police .
That could be them outside .
Officers have begun testing windows and doors at night as part of a campaign to increase home security .
If they find one open , they are under orders to knock on the door and drag sleepy residents from their beds and lecture them .
The move is part of an initiative called Operation Golden which aims to slash burglary rates in Macclesfield , Cheshire .
Police say their actions are necessary as almost 40 per cent of all burglars gain access through an unsecured window or door .
But some residents have condemned the plan , saying it could cause alarm and increase the fear of crime , especially among the elderly .
One 82 - year - old resident , who did not want to be named , said : ' If they 're not careful the police will end up arresting their own officers .
It 's going to get very confusing for them .
If I got a knock on my door at 1 am I 'd tell whoever was there where to get off and I would n't be polite about it . '
Resident Adrian Dodd , 42 , said : ' I think it is preposterous .
It is all well and good advising people but you can't come trespassing on property in the dead of night and waking people up .
Someone will have a heart attack .
The operation should be restricted to daylight hours . '
Inspector Gareth Woods , who is heading the operation , said that it would be in effect from 4 pm until 2am .
He admitted that some residents will not be happy about the wake - up call , but said : ' If we 're told to get lost then that 's a risk we take .
The bottom line is officers get a mixed reception when doing anything like this , but I would say to any of my officers that if they see an unsecured car or house to let the owner know no matter what time of day or night .
' Most reasonable people will say thanks for letting them know and be grateful . '
Chief Inspector Peter Crowcroft said : ' There are burglars who specialise in sneakins .
They walk around streets , nipping in and out of gardens and trying doors until they find one unlocked .
' Even if the family is in the next room watching television or eating , the criminal will walk into the kitchen or hallway , grab a bag , purse , or some other item of value and be out again in seconds .
These burglaries can be avoided by locking the door . '
Last year a 38 - year - old woman from Hove in East Sussex was stunned when she walked into her lounge to find a PCSO clambering through her window .
The woman , who did not want to be named , was then given a stern lecture by the officer on home security .
' I thought it was a bit much really , but it did make me think , ' she said .
Officers and police community support officers are also distributing thousands of door hanger cards which list security checks to be carried out before anyone leaves home .
California voters are overwhelmingly unhappy with Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and the state Legislature , according to a poll being released today .
Just 27 percent of the 1,232 registered voters surveyed in a telephone poll this month approved of the job Schwarzenegger is doing , and only 16 percent approve of Sacramento lawmakers , according to the Field Poll .
The bleak view of Sacramento politicians is shared by Democrats and Republicans and across demographic groups , poll director Mark DiCamillo said .
" It 's a pretty dismal report , and there are really no real changes from what we saw last October , " he said .
" What 's sort of overhanging these ratings is the huge budget deficit that the state has to deal with and the public is aware of .
They are sort of bracing themselves for what is coming .
...
And they fault legislative leaders and the governor for getting us into this situation . "
A majority of voters - 59 percent - also said that Schwarzenegger , who will be termed out at the end of this year , will leave the state in worse shape than when he won office in 2003 , after Gov. Gray Davis was recalled .
At the time , he enjoyed some of the highest approval ratings of any governor ever elected - 64 percent .
But his numbers have fluctuated drastically over the past six years .
" The legacy question is interesting - this is a governor who was elected as an outsider that would come into Sacramento and make a series of reforms , blow up boxes and make things better , " he said .
" The verdict from voters is that he has really failed in that effort .
...
There 's a great deal of disappointment . "
By contrast , DiCamillo noted that Gov. Pete Wilson , who served from 1991 to 1999 , enjoyed relatively positive reviews at the end of his tenure - 38 percent of voters said he left the state in better condition than he found it , 19 percent said it was worse and 40 percent said it was about the same .
But Wilson , DiCamillo said , entered office at the beginning of an economic downturn and left at a time when the economy was fairly strong .
" A lot of what happens to governors is really dependent on the circumstances they find themselves in , " he said .
" But for Schwarzenegger , a lot also has to do with the fact that he said he saw the problems of Sacramento and got elected to do something about it , and the assessment of most voters is that he failed at that . "
Schwarzenegger is also different from most politicians in that opinions of him are usually shared across party lines , DiCamillo said .
" When he was receiving very high ratings , he also was getting high ratings among Democrats , " but the reverse was also true , he said .
" When his ratings declined significantly , he also lost his own party .
The rank - and - file Republicans have deserted him to a greater extent than you usually see . "
The Legislature is viewed even more negatively , with a whopping 72 percent of those polled disapproving of its performance .
Lawmakers have n't enjoyed majority approval since 1998 , and DiCamillo said they have consistently received approval ratings of less than 20 percent in recent years .
Is the Pinochet era finally over ?
By 6 o’clock Sunday night , the news had filled the streets of Santiago with honking :
For the first time in 52 years , Chile had elected a conservative president , unseating the left - leaning “ Concertación ” coalition that has ruled the country for the last two decades .
From a crowded hotel ballroom at the Crown Plaza in Santiago , a posh - looking crowd of supporters for the winning candidate , billionaire businessman Sebastian Piñera , listened as the vote tallies were called out on television , district by district .
Within minutes , his supporters were celebrating , waving flags from car windows and apartment balconies .
In the end , Piñera took 52 percent to his opponent Eduardo Frei ’s 48 in the runoff election .
Piñera ’s campaign theme was a familiar one : change .
“ After 20 years of the same coalition , the same people , it ’s getting old , ” Arturo Alessandri C. , a prominent lawyer who supports Piñera and who worked in the minister of planning under former military dictator Gen.
August Pinochet , told me at a downtown polling station .
“ People want change .
It ’s a feeling that has been present for the last two or three elections . ”
Just how big a change is unclear .
Since 1990 , Concertación governments , including the current one led by Socialist Michelle Bachelet , have helped transform this long sliver of South America into one of the region ’s most stable democracies , but have n’t made fundamental changes to Pinochet ’s economic policies .
So , though voters were clearly looking for aesthetic change , a new face to leadership , they may also have been hoping for more of the same .
Piñera seemed the perfect candidate for such an environment .
While Concertación ’s Frei was a familiar character in politics , having already served as president once from 1994 to 2000 , the charismatic , Harvard - educated Piñera promised to usher in a new era .
“ It ’s a change of attitudes in politics , ” said Piñera supporter Percy Marin Vera at the winner ’s victory party Sunday , when asked to explain what the president - elect represented .
But he and other supporters struggled to describe exactly what else they expected would be different about the new administration .
During the campaign , Piñera promised to create 1 million new jobs and double Chile ’s per capita income in four years , but left his path to achieving that vague .
One key policy , at least , might be up for review .
At present , the country puts revenue from its largest revenue source , copper , into a rainy day fund .
Government budgets are based on the projected long - term price for the metal rather than the short - term booms and busts that doom so many other resource - dependent economies .
But Piñera ’s administration may choose to tap into the surplus funds that high commodity prices have put into Chile ’s coffers in recent years , said Alessandri C .
News reports and polls had indicated in the days leading up to the election that Frei was gaining strength , as the candidate and his allies reminded voters that many in Piñera ’s right - wing base — though not , apparently , Piñera — had also backed Pinochet during the 1970s and 80s .
“ We were not afraid , ” Frei said Friday of that era .
“ We have continued since then with courage and conviction . ”
Monday ’s politically charged opening of the Museum of Memory , the first collection of testimonies and materials from Pinochet ’s victims , has been met with a mix of acclaim and criticism .
Right - leaning protestors picketed the doors , complaining that the museum should include not only the abuses under Pinochet but the economic collapse that took place under his predecessor , the Marxist Salvador Allende .
“ It ’s an abomination , ” said retired Senator Arturo Alessandri B. , a Pinochet supporter whose uncle Jorge was the last democratically elected rightist president 52 years ago .
“ It ’s another effort by the Marxists to keep the flame alive against the military government . ” ( Alessandri B. , whose son is quoted above , ran against Frei in 1993 and lost . )
Many in Concertación are still anxious about Piñera ’s perceived ties to the Pinochet period .
But they are even more anxious about his business ties , which he has failed to relinquish despite campaign promises to do so .
Piñera , a pioneering credit - card entrepreneur , owns part of the national airlines , LAN , as well as a TV station .
Allessandri C. said before the results were announced that Piñera was planning to sell his stakes if he was indeed elected , but “ wanted to wait and see ” before making a move .
He added that in his capacity as a corporate lawyer , he had been working to drum up foreign interest in buying stakes in the airline , LAN .
The TV station , he explained , will be put “ under a non-profit foundation ” that Piñera would not run .
Pedro Garcia , minister of health from 2003 to 2006 , worries that Piñera ’s business - friendly approach would blind him to public - sector approaches , particularly in areas of social services such as health .
Garcia , who has worked with some of Piñera ’s team on other projects , told me : “ They do n’t know how to do public policy , because they only think in the short term . ”
Some in Concertación seemed to welcome their chance to be in the opposition .
“ It ’s been the same people for 20 years , ” said Cristián Solano , a Frei supporter at Concertación headquarters Sunday night .
It is time to send a clear signal about the party ’s willingness to reorganize and renew , said fellow supporter Nelson Morales .
Among other things , a stint in the opposition might allow the left to boost its voice in Chile ’s press , which has been dominated by the right since Pinochet ’s time .
“ This finishes the transition , ” said Carlos Larrain , Jr. , a lawyer and Piñera supporter , from the candidate ’s headquarters on Sunday night .
“ This closes the Pinochet chapter , and now we have a chance to start over . ”
LOS ANGELES ( MarketWatch ) -- Taco Bell restaurant - chain founder Glen Bell Jr. passed away Sunday at the age of 86 , according to Yum Brands Inc.'s YUM , +0.65 % Taco Bell Corp .
Bell 's first venture in the restaurant business was in 1948 , when he opened Bell 's Drive - In , in San Bernardino , Calif. , originally serving hamburgers and hot dogs , but later moving to differentiate the menu by adding Mexican fare .
" Once he perfected his taco shell recipe , taco sauces and the convenient drive - thru concept he was ready to introduce the tastes and textures of Mexican food to mainstream America , " the Taco Bell statement said .
Taco
Bell now serves more than 36.8 million consumers each week in more than 5,600 restaurants in the U.S. , the company said .

Archaeologists have unearthed a massive red granite head of one Egypt 's most famous pharaohs who ruled nearly 3,400 years ago , the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities announced Sunday .
The head of Amenhotep III , which alone is about the height of a person , was dug out of the ruins of the pharaoh 's mortuary temple in the southern city of Luxor .
The leader of the expedition that discovered the head described it as the best preserved sculpture of Amenhotep III 's face found to date .
" Other statues have always had something broken : the tip of the nose , the face is eroded , " said Dr. Hourig Sourouzian , who has led the led the Egyptian - European expedition at the site since 1999 .
" But here , from the tip of the crown to the chin , it is so beautifully carved and polished , nothing is broken .
"
The head is part of a larger statue found several years ago , along with the parts of the body , the back slab , and the ceremonial beard which Souruzian says will soon be connected with the head .
Amenhotep III , who was the grandfather of the famed boy - pharaoh Tutankhamun , ruled from 1387 - 1348 B.C. at the height of Egypt 's New Kingdom and presided over a vast empire stretching from Nubia in the south to Syria in the north .
Sourouzian said the pharaoh was famous for leading Egypt at the peak of its ancient civilization , when peace and luxury were prevalent throughout the kingdom .
Craftsmen were also honing their artistic techniques during the period , which may explain the symmetrical features of the unearthed head .
" But he may have looked exactly as this statue and he may have been avery beautiful , very handsome man , " Sourouzian told the Associated Press .
Amenhotep III 's massive mortuary temple was largely destroyed , possibly by floods , and little remains of its walls .
Theexpedition , however , has unearthed a wealth of artifacts and statuaryin the buried ruins , including two statues of Amenhotep made of blackgranite found in March .
On January 19 , Spanish newspaper ABC , a newspaper of record in Spain , published a story entitled Chavez accuses US of causing earthquake in Haiti .
The story was quickly picked up by websites around the globe - most quoting Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez as saying the U.S. used a new tectonic weapon to induce the Haitian earthquake .
This was , according to Chavez - " only a drill , and the final target is destroying and taking over Iran " .
Within the actual story , ABC noted that the information came from an obscure opinion post on the website of a Venezuelan state television channel , VIVE Television .
The post referenced a supposed Russian military report on American seismic weapons .
All quotes subsequently attributed to Chavez regarding Haiti and earthquake weapons were in fact direct quotes from this web posting - none of which was ever uttered by Chavez .
Spurred on by the international attention being received by its first story , ABC posted a second article on January 20 under the banner The Secret Weapon to Cause Earthquakes in which it cites Chavez as having blamed the US for razing Haiti .
By the time the story had run its course , it had been covered with varying degrees of accuracy by corporate news channels , foreign outlets eager to accuse the U.S. of another evil deed , and conspiracy websites happy to have their ideas officially validated .
In the end , it serves as one more reminder to those who prefer truth over ideological delusion : there are some subjects for which the myths of journalistic standards will still be displayed - stories about the government of Venezuela are not one of those subjects .
An Israeli army unit on Sunday crossed the borders with Lebanon in the direction of the occupied part of al - Ghajar village , Lebanon 's state - run National News Agency ( NNA ) reported .
" An intense Israeli build - up of forces during the past 24 hours has been observed along the eastern sector of the Blue Line , with mobile and fixed patrols , " said NNA .
It added that " Israeli tank emplacements were spotted amid intense overflights by helicopter gunships and warplanes . "
" Earlier , an Israeli mechanized infantry unit comprised of two Hummers crossed the UN - designated Blue Line for 300 meters in the direction of the occupied part of al - Ghajar village , " said NNA .
On the Lebanese side , UN Interim Force in Lebanon ( UNIFIL ) and Lebanese army personnel intensified patrolling activities .
The Blue Line , which is the line for Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon in 2000 , now serves as the borderline of the two countries and runs through the middle of the al - Ghajar village .
Lebanon accuses Israel of intruding its airspace on a daily basis , saying it is a violation of UN Security Council Resolution 1701 .
The resolution put an end to the 2006 war between Israel and Lebanese Shiite armed group Hezbollah , and mandates peacekeepers to monitor the armistice along the border .

Top House Republicans throw cold water on health - care summit
By Michael D. Shear
Leading House Republicans raised the prospect Monday night that they might refuse to participate in President Obama 's proposed health care summit if the White House chooses not to scrap the existing reform bills and start over .
In a letter to White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel , House Minority Leader John A. Boehner ( Ohio ) and Minority Whip Eric Cantor ( Va. ) expressed frustration at reports that Obama intends to put the Democratic bills on the table for discussion at the Feb. 25 summit .
" If the starting point for this meeting is the job - killing bills the American people have already soundly rejected , Republicans would rightly be reluctant to participate , " Boehner and Cantor wrote .
Obama proposed the half - day summit on national television Sunday , but in their letter , the two GOP leaders offer their suspicion that the president is not serious about opening a bipartisan negotiation on health care .
" ' Bipartisanship ' is not writing proposals of your own behind closed doors , then unveiling them and demanding Republican support , " Boehner and Cantor wrote .
" Bipartisan ends require bipartisan means . "
White House press secretary Robert Gibbs responded by saying that Obama has sought Republican input since early last year , and the president remains interested in hearing ideas that the GOP believe will advance the cause of health care reform .
But he appeared to give little ground on the idea that Obama might abandon the months of work that produced Democratic bills that passed the House and the Senate late last year .
" He 's been very clear about his support for the House and Senate bills because of what they achieve for the American people : putting a stop to insurance company abuses , extending coverage to millions of hardworking Americans , getting control of rising premiums and out - of - pocket costs , and reducing the deficit , " Gibbs said in a statement .
" The President looks forward to reviewing Republican proposals that meet the goals he laid out at the beginning of this process , and as recently as the State of the Union Address .
He 's open to including any good ideas that stand up to objective scrutiny .
What he will not do , however , is walk away from reform and the millions of American families and small business counting on it . "
The Republican letter , and Gibbs 's response , follow :
February 8 , 2010
The Honorable Rahm Emanuel
Chief of Staff
The White House
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW
Washington , DC 20500
Dear Mr. Emanuel :
We welcome President Obama 's announcement of forthcoming bipartisan health care talks .
In fact , you may remember that last May , Republicans asked President Obama to hold bipartisan discussions on health care in an attempt to find common ground , but he declined and instead chose to work with only Democrats .
Since then , the President has given dozens of speeches on health care reform , operating under the premise that the more the American people learn about his plan , the more they will come to like it .
Just the opposite has occurred : a majority of Americans oppose the House and Senate health care bills and want them scrapped so we can start over with a step - by - step approach focused on lowering costs for families and small businesses .
Just as important , scrapping the House and Senate health care bills would help end the uncertainty they are creating for workers and businesses and thus strengthen our shared commitment to focusing on creating jobs .
Assuming the President is sincere about moving forward on health care in a bipartisan way , does that mean he will agree to start over so that we can develop a bill that is truly worthy of the support and confidence of the American people ?
Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said today that the President is " absolutely not " resetting the legislative process for health care .
If the starting point for this meeting is the job - killing bills the American people have already soundly rejected , Republicans would rightly be reluctant to participate .
Assuming the President is sincere about moving forward in a bipartisan way , does that mean he has taken off the table the idea of relying solely on Democratic votes and jamming through health care reform by way of reconciliation ?
As the President has noted recently , Democrats continue to hold large majorities in the House and Senate , which means they can attempt to pass a health care bill at any time through the reconciliation process .
Eliminating the possibility of reconciliation would represent an important show of good faith to Republicans and the American people .
If the President intends to present any kind of legislative proposal at this discussion , will he make it available to members of Congress and the American people at least 72 hours beforehand ?
Our ability to move forward in a bipartisan way through this discussion rests on openness and transparency .
Will the President include in this discussion congressional Democrats who have opposed the House and Senate health care bills ?
This bipartisan discussion should reflect the bipartisan opposition to both the House bill and the kickbacks and sweetheart deals in the Senate bill .
Will the President be inviting officials and lawmakers from the states to participate in this discussion ?
As you may know , legislation has been introduced in at least 36 state legislatures , similar to the proposal just passed by the Democratic - controlled Virginia State Senate , providing that no individual may be compelled to purchase health insurance .
Additionally , governors of both parties have raised concerns about the additional costs that will be passed along to states under both the House and Senate bills .
The President has also mentioned his commitment to have " experts " participate in health care discussions .
Will the Feb. 25 discussion involve such " experts ? "
Will those experts include the actuaries at the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) , who have determined that the both the House and Senate health care bill raise costs - just the opposite of their intended effect - and jeopardize seniors ' access to high - quality care by imposing massive Medicare cuts ?
Will those experts include the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office , which has stated that the GOP alternative would reduce premiums by up to 10 percent ?
Also , will Republicans be permitted to invite health care experts to participate ?
Finally , as you know , this is the first televised White House health care meeting involving the President since last March .
Many health care meetings of the closed - door variety have been held at the White House since then , including one last month where a sweetheart deal was worked out with union leaders .
Will the special interest groups that the Obama Administration has cut deals with be included in this televised discussion ?
Of course , Americans have been dismayed by the fact that the President has broken his own pledge to hold televised health care talks .
We can only hope this televised discussion is the beginning , not the end , of attempting to correct that mistake .
Will the President require that any and all future health care discussions , including those held on Capitol Hill , meet this common - sense standard of openness and transparency ?
Your answers to these critical questions will help determine whether this will be a truly open , bipartisan discussion or merely an intramural exercise before Democrats attempt to jam through a job - killing health care bill that the American people can't afford and do n't support .
' Bipartisanship ' is not writing proposals of your own behind closed doors , then unveiling them and demanding Republican support .
Bipartisan ends require bipartisan means .
These questions are also designed to try and make sense of the widening gap between the President 's rhetoric on bipartisanship and the reality .
We cannot help but notice that each of the President 's recent bipartisan overtures has been coupled with harsh , misleading partisan attacks .
For instance , the President decries Republican ' obstruction ' when it was Republicans who first proposed bipartisan health care talks last May .
The President says Republicans are ' sitting on the sidelines ' just days after holding up our health care alternative and reading from it word for word .
The President has every right to use his bully pulpit as he sees fit , but this is the kind of credibility gap that has the American people so fed up with business as usual in Washington .
We look forward to receiving your answers and continuing to discuss ways we can move forward in a bipartisan manner to address the challenges facing the American people .
Sincerely ,
House Republican Leader John Boehner ( R - OH )
House Republican Whip Eric Cantor ( R - VA )
****
Please find below a statement from White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs in response to a letter sent today from House Republican Leader John Boehner and House Republican Whip Eric Cantor :
" The President is adamant that we seize this historic moment to pass meaningful health insurance reform legislation .
He began this process by inviting Republican and Democratic leaders to the White House on March 5 of last year , and he 's continued to work with both parties in crafting the best possible bill .
He 's been very clear about his support for the House and Senate bills because of what they achieve for the American people : putting a stop to insurance company abuses , extending coverage to millions of hardworking Americans , getting control of rising premiums and out - of - pocket costs , and reducing the deficit .
" The President looks forward to reviewing Republican proposals that meet the goals he laid out at the beginning of this process , and as recently as the State of the Union Address .
He 's open to including any good ideas that stand up to objective scrutiny .
What he will not do , however , is walk away from reform and the millions of American families and small business counting on it .
The recent news that a major insurer plans to raise premiums for some customers by as much as 39 percent is a stark reminder of the consequences of doing nothing . "
When it comes to sexual arousal , a woman 's mind and body are less in sync than a man's , a review of research finds .
Men who reported feeling turned on tended to also sport an erection , while a matchup between the mind and body was n't so consistent for women , according to the review published online Jan. 4 in the journal Archives of Sexual Behavior .
" We wanted to discover how closely people 's subjective experience of sexual arousal mirrors their physiological genital response — and whether this differs between men and women , " said researcher Meredith Chivers , a psychology professor at Queen 's University in Canada .
Chivers and colleagues reviewed more than 130 studies published between 1969 and 2007 involving participants ' arousal responses .
In total , the review included more than 2,500 women and 1,900 men .
Men 's subjective ratings of arousal were in agreement with their body 's level of sexual arousal about 66 percent of the time , while women's were in line only about 26 percent of the time .
" The general pattern that I have seen in my laboratory is that women experience a genital response but do not report feeling sexually aroused , " Chivers told LiveScience .
Overall , the findings suggest women and men have different experiences of sexual arousal .
" For men , their experience is strongly related to physiological arousal whereas for women it is less so , " Chivers said .
Supporting the conclusions , a study reported in 2003 showed men's arousal clearly tracks sexual orientation , with gay men getting turned on by images of men , and straight guys by images of women .
In contrast , that 2003 study showed both heterosexual and lesbian women were sexually aroused by male and female erotica , regardless of their sexual orientation .
Figuring out how measures of arousal ( mental vs. physiological ) differ between men and women will help scientists study human sexuality and understand the nature of these differences , Chivers said .
LOS ANGELES  From San Diego to Mount Shasta , voters are expressing mounting disgust over California ’s fiscal meltdown and deteriorating services , and they are offering scores of voter initiatives that seek to change the way the state does business .
Over 30 such initiatives  among over 60 total initiatives so far  are now wending their way toward the ballot box .
Every day , it seems another vexed voter adds a proposal to the fray .
Some verge on the radical , like one to establish the state ’s first constitutional convention in over a century , to rewrite California ’s most fundamental legislative rules .
There are initiatives in circulation that would reduce the time the Legislature is in session , punish legislators for late budgets and criminalize “ false statements about legislative acts . ”
Other states , of course , are also suffering through red ink , but none have quite the same mechanism as California ’s to let voters get involved with the process .
Despite the fact that past initiatives helped get California into its budget crisis  forcing spending in some areas while limiting taxation in others  the pileup of new ones suggests that many voters still believe they hold the solution to the state ’s mess .
Few seem to believe that elected officials are up to the job .

The housing boom and bust has created one of the most corrupt financial systems in history .
Now this in itself is n’t the shocking news since throughout history countries have proved over and over that connected governments and toxic businesses will siphon off money from the productive classes for exercises in bubbles ( i.e. , South Sea , tulips , technology stocks , housing , etc ) .
Yet this is probably one of the first financial collapses where nothing was really done after the knocks were taken .
The vast majority of Americans are scratching their head ever more impatiently wondering when the real reform is going to come down the pipeline .
Was n’t it only in March of 2009 that the global financial system was melting down like the Wicked Witch in Oz ?
Many are now referring to the optics of the current situation .
The fact that banks received $ 14 trillion in financial backstops , backed by the American taxpayer and government , has left many believing that our government is willing to backstop the most ill managed companies in the entire country .
If you look at a list of who received bailouts , it looks like a list of the primary culprits of this economic mess .
When people think about the bailout , they usually only think about the TARP list :
TARP is merely a tiny sliver of the entire financial bailout .
Keep in mind that banks indirectly benefit from the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve cooking up schemes to buy up mortgage backed securities and artificially lower interest rates .
In fact , anyone looking at current actions would assume that the U.S. government and Wall Street have a mission of keeping home prices unaffordable for most Americans .
The reason Americans went off and took on such enormous amounts of debt is because home prices were simply distorted and much of this came from the irresponsible banking sector .
In the past such excessive risk was punished by those perpetrating the bubble being annihilated .
The market in some sort of disjointed way would wipe this excess out .
However , in this case those responsible have actually gotten bigger and infiltrate the way policy is done .
This is like you crashing your Geo Metro and getting a Lexus as a replacement .
Crash that Lexus and who knows , you might get a Ferrari .
There is very little in the way of payment protection insurance in the current market .
I ’ve been getting many e-mails from readers and what they share tells me a lot about the current housing situation .
People , like banks are looking for the easiest way out .
Not everyone is looking for this obviously but many that I have talked to in California are .
Some quotes that I have gotten go like :
“ Unless the banks work with me , I ’m not paying anymore on this mortgage . ”
“ How dare we bail out banks and we get nothing back .
I ’m going to stop paying on my mortgage and see if they still want to negotiate . ”
“ I ’ve been sitting in my house making no payments after 1 year and the bank has n’t contacted me .
I ’m just saving up and when they come , I am out and getting a rental .
No way am I paying for this . ”
This or a variation of the above is usually what I see .
Rarely do you see someone say , “ I take full responsibility and even though my payment is high , I ’m going to stretch it out to pay as my rightful duty . ”
And why should homeowners do this ?
Banks are the most irresponsible culprits in this mess and look at the amount of bailouts they are getting !
So any outsider looking at this system would find this gleaming rule :
Take as much risk as possible to the point that if you fail , the government has to bail you out .
If you succeed , all the profits are your own .
In other words socialize the losses and privatize the gains .
A perverted form of corporate welfare .
The Alt - A and option ARM products are only one example of what occurs when people believe in the above system .
Now think of someone that took out that option ARM .
Implicitly they were believing housing prices were going to go up ( a bet ) .
Many went zero down so this was the equivalent of a call - option .
That is , if the home price went down your only loss was your credit ( which at this point matters little since crony Wall Street with all their horrible bad bets seems to have access to more and more money ) .
On the other hand , if home prices went up which they were for decades you would make out handsomely with no money down .
A very hard bet to resist especially if you are not familiar with economic history ( and many are n’t ) .
If we look at the overall composition of loans in the U.S. we will find many toxic mortgages are still outstanding :
I find it to be the height of hypocrisy that banks are now “ discussing ” principal reductions as if they are doing some kind of favor .
These banks would have been nationalized long ago without taxpayer funds !
Their record profits have come from gambling in the recent Wall Street rally .
So now , after they placed all their money ( taxpayer funded ) on 7 red and won , they now want to give some money back to underwater homeowners as if they were doing the nation some kind of favor .
You really ca n’t make this kind of thing up :
And guess what happened ?
This mega bet paid off for the banks :
So now the issue of strategic default , that is not paying your mortgage even if you can , is becoming bigger and bigger :
“ ( NY Times ) John Courson , president and C.E.O. of the Mortgage Bankers Association , recently told The Wall Street Journal that homeowners who default on their mortgages should think about the “ message ” they will send to “ their family and their kids and their friends . ”
Courson was implying that homeowners — record numbers of whom continue to default — have a responsibility to make good .
He was n’t referring to the people who have no choice , who ca n’t afford their payments .
He was speaking about the rising number of folks who are voluntarily choosing not to pay .
Such voluntary defaults are a new phenomenon .
Time was , Americans would do anything to pay their mortgage — forgo a new car or a vacation , even put a younger family member to work .
But the housing collapse left 10.7 million families owing more than their homes are worth .
So some of them are making a calculated decision to hang onto their money and let their homes go .
Is this irresponsible ? ”
This perception is permeating throughout the country .
People ask , why should I be paying on my bad bet if the financial leaders in this country not only are ignoring their bad bets but getting handouts as well ?
It is a good question to ask .
And thanks to the flow of information both manias and busts spread much faster .
I remember when Zillow was in its infancy during the bubble and people kept looking at “ Zestimates ” to confirm their bias that housing prices only go up .
Then they would e-mail that link to friends and families and say , “ look , I made $ 100,000 in equity in one year ! ”
In California this was common yet never in the e-mail would they say , “ and all this was due to the help of my Alt - A and option ARM . ”
What is more troubling is the inconsistent amateur hour at how banks are handling this mess .
One major issue is in some areas , banks are moving on foreclosures in eradicate patterns .
That is , they seem to take over homes in the normal fashion ( NOD - NTS - Auction - REO ) in timelines that make sense in some cases and in others they do n’t follow any pattern .
Here in California , we have some homes that go 18 months without payment and finally are taken over !
The timeline discrepancy is huge and probably encourages many to opt to do a strategic default .
I mean think about the actual numbers .
Let us assume a best case scenario where you bought a home with a 30 year fixed mortgage and your loan was $ 500,000 at 6.5 percent :
You bought at the peak in 2006 or 2007 and now that home is worth $ 250,000 to $ 300,000 .
In other words , you are massively underwater .
But now knowing that you have 12 months to even an 18 months of a window before you are kicked out , what do you do ?
If you are smart , you can play hardball with the bank and flat out stop making your payment .
Now , you are even in a better spot than a renter since most people that stop paying their rent face evictions rather quickly .
In this case , you have bought yourself some time .
How much can you save with a strategic default ?
Now here is where it gets interesting .
Say that your current monthly payment consumes a large part of your net take home pay .
You were always planning on selling the home for a massive profit .
Now you are underwater like 30 + percent of California mortgage holders .
It is unlikely that you will see your peak price anytime soon .
Short of the bank dropping your home price to market value ( aka principal reduction ) it might make sense to stop paying .
Just look at the above chart and see how much money you can “ save ” before the bank kicks you out .
Many people never get a window of 1 to 2 years of no housing payment ( rent or mortgage ) once they enter their full adult life .
So you can understand why so many people are gearing up for strategic default .
And this psychology stems from one item that seems to be ignored .
Upping the down payment requirement .
Assume we had a minimum 10 percent down payment someone walking away from the above mortgage is leaving $ 50,000 on the table .
That is a sizeable amount and would make someone think twice .
But with zero or little down , the numbers are very beneficial to those walking away and many in Alt - A and option ARMs are running the above scenarios ( assuming they can even pay their mortgage ) .
And banks with shady one sided information hubs know this :
“ ( Bloomberg )
When principal reductions were granted for pay - option adjustable - rate mortgages — loans with high default rates because they enabled borrowers to pay less than the cost of interest as the principal increased — the re-default rate after 60 days fell to 6 percent , according to Mortgage Metrics .
“ In terms of incentive , you have more skin in the game or less negative equity to deal with , ” said Fred Phillips - Patrick , director of credit policy for the Office of Thrift Supervision .
Many banks do n’t want word to get around that they reduce principal .
They fear that homeowners who can afford their payments will demand better deals .
John Lashley , a 44 - year - old salesman in Huntersville , North Carolina , is making his payments .
But he is thinking about walking away from his four - bedroom home unless his lender , Sun Trust Mortgage , agrees to cut the principal on his $ 345,000 loan .
The house next door recently sold for $ 260,000 , and Lashley does n’t see the point of pouring money into his house when he may never recoup the investment he made in 2007 .
“ Why should I stay in my house ? ” he says .
“ It ’s not a moral decision .
It ’s a financial decision . ”
Well of course re-default rates fell .
You cut the loan !
Cut my monthly expenses by 30 , 40 , or even 50 percent and life would be much better .
Of course banks do n’t want this kind of idea to spread because they want to suck dry struggling / non - struggling home buyers as much as possible while leaching off the U.S. government which only gets its funding from the same exact source of people .
Banks are screwing people on both sides of the fence .
And look at the above quote .
They are right , this is n’t a moral decision but a financial one .
Those in the banking and housing industry that argue the morals of paying your mortgage are absolute hypocrites and really have a major source of cognitive dissonance .
If we want reform we first have to institute a minimum 10 percent down payment requirement .
Period .
No government tax breaks etc .
For most of the good healthy history of housing 20 percent down payments were required .
No wonder why we did n’t have ridiculous bubbles .
This also moderated price inflation .
Plus , people will be walking away from a sizeable amount of money they saved if they decide to walk away .
That is why even in the previous bust in California we saw people walk away but it was more painful .
Now , psychologically people are walking away and sleeping like babies at night .
Nothing wrong with that .
Banks have been sleeping like babies in a gold crib for decades .
Yet the majority of prudent responsible owners are furious .
Let us run the numbers of who is really getting screwed :
Should be pretty clear that our housing reward system is not functioning at all .
The vast majority are not happy with what is currently going on and the numbers above show that something will have to really change , the number of those being fleeced is too big to those who are gaining .

Ah , the fun you can have with survey data .
It 's well known that if you get to control how survey questions are worded , you can get large groups of people to support almost anything .
Take , for example , what 's happening down in Australia with the fight over the government 's latest plan ( after many previous attempts ) to force filters on the entire internet , requiring ISPs to block a secret list of sites the gov't does n't like .
A lot of people are up in arms about this blatant censorship .
But supporters of the plan can eagerly point to a recent survey that got 80 % of people to say they were in favor of " having a mandatory Government Internet filter that would automatically block all access , in Australia , to overseas websites containing material that is Refused Classification . "
80 % ?
That seems really surprising .
But , it should n't be if you saw how the question was asked .
SG points us to the news about how that particular question was prefaced by asking people to read the following " definition " of what kinds of content would be blocked :
You read that list -- especially given what it starts off with -- and who 's going to say " no , I want to make sure that 's available " ?
Not that many people .
Obviously , they 're going to say they support blocking it .
But that does n't really mean they support government censorship .
It seems quite likely that what people want is for the government not to focus on useless and expensive censorship campaigns , but to focus that same effort on catching those who are actually breaking the law and stopping them from engaging in the illegal activities .
In fact , the very same study found thatdo n't like the fact that the government will be censoring the internet via a .
Basically , people do n't want government censorship , but that does n't mean they support the things in the list .
It 's just that they would prefer the government do somethingto stop it , rather than brushing it under a digital rug .

J.J. Abrams 's " Star Trek " was over looked this year for several Oscar Nominations like best picture or director , but it did manage to score a few noms ( not the little bunny eating a carrot kind ) for Best Achievement in Sound , Best Achievement in Sound Editing , Best Achievement in Visual Effects , and Best Achievement in Makeup .
The Oscar nominated team responsible for Star Trek 's fantastic Vulcans , Romulans , and other creatures consisted of Barney Burman , Mindy Hall , and Joel Harlow .
In a recent interview Mindy Hall recalls the task of convincing Zachary Quinto and Eric Bana , among others , to shave their heads and eyebrows .
" It took a little bit of negotiating with casting , " Says Hall .
" Our characters had to look as organic , as real as possible .
We were working with really tight closeups and we could n't hide behind the lighting so , we had to be very precise .
Doing eyebrow covers was n't an option .
Even a slight cover can alter the bone structure . "
Apparently all of the prosthetics were made on set in their own makeshift lab .
" We sculpted all the appliances -- the ears , all the Romulans ' foreheads , " she explains .
" These seamless molds were developed by ( prosthetic makeup supervisor ) Joel Harlow , and ' Star Trek ' is the first film to use this almost three - dimensional process . "
Commanding as few as 20 and as many as 70 makeup artists at a time , Mindy ran an assembly line for Vulcans and Romulans .
" The makeup artists were their own city , " says Hall .
" Two artists and a hairdresser could turn out a Vulcan in 1 1 / 2 to two hours , with one artist putting on ears , another doing the face and another laying the hair .
A single Romulan was a two- to 2 1/2 - hour application for three makeup artists . "
One key aspect of her job was to make sure the prosthetics did n't end up in the wrong hands or on auction sites like Ebay .
" We insisted that everyone have scissors at their station when they did the removals , " Hall says .
" We had to make sure those pieces were n't going anywhere . "
Watch the 82nd Annual Academy Awards March 7th , 2010 to see if Star Trek will pick up an Oscar .

( Health.com ) --
It 's shocking , but it 's true : Being a woman who 's more than 20 pounds overweight may actually hike your risk of getting poor medical treatment .
In fact , weighing too much can have surprising -- and devastating -- health repercussions beyond the usual diabetes and heart - health concerns you 've heard about for years .
Recent studies have found , if you are an overweight woman you :
• May have a harder time getting health insurance or have to pay higher premiums
• Are at higher risk of being misdiagnosed or receiving inaccurate dosages of drugs
• Are less likely to find a fertility doctor who will help you get pregnant
• Are less likely to have cancer detected early and get effective treatment for it
What 's going on here ?
Fat discrimination is part of the problem .
A recent Yale study suggested that weight bias can start when a woman is as little as 13 pounds over her highest healthy weight .
" Our culture has enormous negativity toward overweight people , and doctors are n't immune , " says Harvard Medical School professor Dr. Jerome Groopman , M.D. , author of " How Doctors Think . "
" If doctors have negative feelings toward patients , they 're more dismissive , they 're less patient , and it can cloud their judgment , making them prone to diagnostic errors . "
With nearly 70 million American women who are considered overweight , the implications of this new information is disturbing , to say the least .
Here , what you need to know to get the top - quality health care you deserve -- no matter what you weigh .
When Jen Seelaus , from Danbury , Connecticut , went to her doc's office because she was wheezing , she expected to get her asthma medication tweaked .
Instead , she was told she 'd feel better if she 'd just lose some weight .
" I did n't go to be lectured about my weight .
I was there because I could n't breathe , " says the 5 - foot - 3 , 195 - pound woman .
" Asthma can be dangerous if it gets out of control , and the nurse practitioner totally ignored that because of my weight . "
Health.com : 25 diet - busting foods you should never eat
Seelaus 's nurse made a classic diagnostic error , according to Groopman .
" It 's called attribution , because your thinking is colored by a stereotype and you attribute the entire clinical picture to that stereo­type .
Because obesity can cause so many health problems , it 's very easy to blame a variety of complaints , from knee pain to breathing troubles , on a patient 's weight .
That 's why doctors -- and patients -- need to constantly ask , ' What else could this be ? ' "
There are n't statistics on how many diagnostic errors are due to weight , but the data for the general population is disturbing enough .
" Doctors make mistakes in diagnosing 10 to 15 percent of all patients , and in half of those cases it causes real harm , " Groopman says .
Based on anecdotal evidence -- patients who 've told her that their doctors are often too quick to blame symptoms on weight -- Rebecca Puhl , Ph.D. , director of Research and Weight Stigma Initiatives at the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale University , suspects that being heavy could further increase the odds of being misdiagnosed .

Even if doctors are aware of the potential traps they can fall into when diagnosing an overweight patient , extra body fat can literally obscure some illnesses , including heart disease and different types of cancer .
" It 's more difficult to hear heart and lung sounds in heavy people , " says Dr. Mary Margaret Huizinga , M.D. , M.P.H. , director of the Johns Hopkins Digestive Weight Loss Center .
" I use an electronic stethoscope , which works well , but I 'm very aware of the issues that can crop up in overweight patients .
Not all doctors have these stethoscopes -- or are aware they need one . "
Dr. Jeffrey C. King , M.D. , professor and director of maternal - and - fetal medicine at the University of Louisville School of Medicine , says that " the more tissue between the palpating hand and what you 're trying to feel , the harder it is to detect a mass . "
That may be what happened to Karen Tang [ not her real name ] , a 5 - foot - 8 , 280 - pound woman who went to the doctor for pelvic pain .
Her doctor palpated her uterus but did n't feel anything .
" By the time I was referred to a gynecologist , I had a fibroid the size of a melon -- so large it was putting pressure on my bladder , " she recalls .
Even a routine pelvic exam can be tricky , especially if you 've had children .
" The vaginal walls become lax and collapse into the middle , obscuring the cervix , " King says .
Larger or modified speculums can help , but not all docs have them and they can make the exam more uncomfortable , says Dr. Lynda Wolf , M.D. , a reproductive endocrinologist at Reproductive Medicine Associates of Michigan .

That may explain the disturbing finding that obese women are less likely to get Pap smears than normal - weight women .
But doctors may be partly to blame for the screening lapse , too .
A University of Connecticut study of more than 1,300 physicians found that 17 percent were reluctant to do pelvic exams on obese women and that 83 percent were hesitant if the patient herself seemed reluctant .
Why diagnostic tests are difficult
Physical exams are n't the only things hampered by obesity .
Large patients may not fit into diagnostic scanning machines -- computed tomography ( CT ) and magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , for instance -- and X - rays and ultrasounds may not be as effective , says Dr. Raul N. Uppot , M.D. , a radiologist in the Division of Abdominal Imaging and Intervention at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston .
" Ultrasound is the approach that 's the most limited by body fat , because the beams can't penetrate the tissue if you have more than 8 centimeters of subcutaneous fat , " he says .
This affects women , in particular , because ultrasound is used to diagnose uterine tumors and ovarian cysts and to evaluate the mother 's and baby 's health during pregnancy .
Just last May , researchers at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas reported a 20 percent decrease in the ability to detect problems in fetuses of obese women with ultrasound .
In another study , obese women were 20 percent more likely to have false - positive results from mammograms -- readings that can lead to unnecessary biopsies and anxiety .
While CT scans are less affected by body fat , getting clear images in heavy patients typically requires a lot more radiation than with normal - weight patients , making it riskier , especially if numerous CT scans are required .
But trying to diagnose a health problem without proper imaging is like driving blindfolded .
Doctors are sometimes left with little to go on except symptoms and intuition , especially in the emergency room , where physicians make life - and - death decisions in minutes .
" If we can't get the imaging because of a patient 's weight , and we are concerned about a pulmonary embolism or appendicitis , for example , we have to go ahead and treat based on our clinical impression , " says Dr. Archana Reddy , M.D. , a Chicago - area ER physician .
Being overweight can get in the way of effective cancer treatment , too , experts say .
The problem : underdosing .
" Oncologists usually base chemo on patients ' ideal weight rather than their true weight , partly because chemo is so toxic and partly because drug trials typically include only average women , so we do n't know the correct dose for bigger women , " says Dr. Kellie Schneider , M.D. , a gynecologic oncologist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham .
" But underdosing can mean the difference between life and death . "
Health.com : America 's top 10 healthiest diets
Doctors have long known that obese women are more likely to die of ovarian and breast cancers , but when Schneider and her colleagues recently gave a group of overweight ovarian cancer patients chemotherapy based on their actual weights , they found that the women were as likely to survive the illness as thinner patients .
" Doctors are n't intentionally under - treating overweight women , " Schneider says .
" We 're just working with limited information . "
Why heavy patients can't find help
There are no studies on how often doctors refuse to treat patients because of their weight .
But Sondra Solovay , an Oakland , California , attorney and author of Tipping the Scales of Justice : Fighting Weight - Based Discrimination , says she hears enough anecdotes to believe it 's commonplace .
Because of recent studies about various complications , Dr. A.J. Yates Jr. , M.D. , associate professor in the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center , says there are legitimate concerns about operating on patients with a very high body mass index ( BMI ) .
But Yates also notes that some surgeons are reluctant to offer surgery to very overweight patients because the operations are more difficult and time - consuming .
And because data on surgical - complication rates is often calculated without accounting for the higher risk of an obese patient , even a few patients with complications can make the surgeon or hospital look bad to insurance companies .
" If hospitals feel they 're not looking good they could put subtle pressure on surgeons to avoid risky patients , " Yates says .
His concern is that overweight people could be increasingly discriminated against because of this .

How to quit smoking without gaining weight
Suzy Smith , a 5 - foot - 3 , 400 - pound woman from Colonial Beach , Virginia , believes she was one of those people .
When her doctor found a large tumor on her kidney , she struggled to find a surgeon who would treat her .
Her urologist said that the hospital where he practiced did n't have a table sturdy enough to hold her , and he referred her to a surgeon several hours away .
" As soon as that doctor walked in the room , I could tell something was wrong by the look on his face , " she says .
" He told me he would n't operate .
He would n't risk it , " she says .
Instead , he offered her cryoablation -- a technique that freezes and removes tissue but is less effective than surgery for large tumors .
" I was so shocked , " Smith says .
" He was basically telling me he would n't do the thing that was the most likely to save my life . "
Finally , in early - December 2008 a doctor removed the tumor .
The surgery , after all the preceding drama , was anticlimactic .
" It went fantastically well , " Smith says .
" My doctors were really pleased . "
But the overall experience , she says , was degrading and disheartening .
" Here I was trying to deal with a diagnosis of cancer , worrying that the cancer might spread with every day that went by , and the medical field was closing doors on me left and right . "
Infertility issues
Infertile couples who are told they can't have in vitro fertilization ( IVF ) because of the woman 's weight also feel doors shutting .
Most fertility clinics have stringent rules .
" I 'd say 95 percent wo n't do IVF on a woman with a BMI higher than 39 [ 5 - foot - 4 , weighing 228 pounds , for example ] , and they usually require an electrocardiogram ( EKG ) and blood tests if it's higher than 34 , because being overweight reduces your chance of getting pregnant and having a healthy pregnancy , " says Dr. Laurence Jacobs , M.D. , of Fertility Centers of Illinois .
In most cases , he can't accept a patient with a BMI of 40 , even if she has no other health issues , because IVF typically takes place in an outpatient setting that 's not set up for the higher anesthesia risks associated with obese patients .
" No anesthesiologist is going to take that risk for someone who 's not willing to make the effort to lose weight , " Jacobs says .
Even more worrisome , a study from Duke University found that obese patients were less likely to receive procedures like cardiac catheterization that can help diagnose and treat heart disease , perhaps because doctors are concerned about potential complications , says lead author Dr. William Yancy Jr. , M.D. , an associate professor at Duke and a staff physician at the VA Medical Center in Durham , North Carolina .
Because of the high risk of heart disease in obese patients , the benefits of catheterization may outweigh the risks , he says .
" But if the tests are n't performed , heavy patients may not receive appropriate therapy . "
Even organ transplants may be withheld because of weight .
Patients with BMIs higher than 35 -- if you 're , say , 5 feet 4 inches tall and weigh 205 pounds -- are typically less likely to be given a kidney or liver transplant because of the increased risk of postsurgery complications , including infections , blood clots , and pneumonia .
" It 's a very difficult issue , " says Dr. Shawn Pelletier , M.D. , surgical director of liver transplants at the University of Michigan Health System in Ann Arbor .
" We have an obligation to use donor organs in a responsible way .
But this is lifesaving surgery , and we do n't want to turn people away .
Obese kidney - transplant patients may not survive as long as thinner patients , but they live an average of three times longer than if they did n't get the transplant .
That 's a big benefit , even if there are risks . "
Many experts believe the issue goes beyond the strictly medical and into the arena of ethics .
" Doctors need to ask themselves , ' Is this obese person less deserving of medical care than the same person would be after weight - loss surgery ? ' " says Barbara Thompson , vice - chair of the Obesity Action Coalition , a nonprofit advocacy group .
" How do we determine whether a person 's weight somehow justifies withholding needed medical care or whether bias by providers is the reason treatment is denied ? "
Yale 's Rebecca Puhl asks .
" It 's an extremely important question with significant implications . "
Fat people get no respect
When Celina Reeder , a 5 - foot - 5 , 185 - pound woman with a torn ligament in her right knee , was told by her surgeon she needed to stop eating so much fast food before he would schedule surgery , the Woodacre , California , woman was astounded .
" I left his office feeling ashamed , " she recalls .
" And I do n't even eat fast food !
The more I thought about it , the madder I got .
So I switched surgeons .
Anybody who thinks doctors treat heavy women the same as thin women has obviously never had a weight problem .
I really felt like my doctor did n't respect me . "
She may have been right .
University of Pennsylvania researchers found that more than 50 percent of primary care physicians viewed obese patients as awkward , unattractive , and noncompliant ; one third said they were weak - willed , sloppy , and lazy .
In addition , researchers at Rice University and the University of Texas School of Public Health in Houston found that as patient BMI increased , doctors reported liking their jobs less and having less patience and desire to help the patient .
Whether they know it or not , doctors ' attitudes may actually encourage unhealthy behavior .
Feeling dissed about their weight can make some women turn to food for comfort .
" Stigma is a form of stress , and many obese women cope by eating or refusing to diet , " Puhl says .
" So weight bias could actually fuel obesity . "
Studies have also found that overweight women are more likely to delay doctors ' appointments and preventive care , including screenings for cancer , because they do n't want to face criticism .
" It can be frustrating to treat obese patients , " admits Dr. Lee Green , M.D. , M.P.H. , a professor of family medicine at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor .
" I spend most of my time treating the consequences of unhealthy lifestyles instead of actual illnesses .
People come in complaining of foot or knee pain , and I 'm thinking , Do you not see that you 're in pain because you 're 60 pounds overweight ?
I do n't say that , of course .
I try to encourage them to lose weight . "
Green seems to be in the minority when it comes to focusing on weight - loss solutions .
One study found that just 11 percent of overweight patients received weight - loss counseling when they visited a family - practice doctor .
A healthy - weight wake - up call
Without a doubt , the medical community needs to take a hard look at the secret biases that may be coloring how they care for overweight women .
But some progress is being made .
The National Institutes of Health has been encouraging researchers to start identifying and fixing the barriers heavy people face when trying to get health care , says Dr. Susan Yanovski , M.D. , co-director of the Office of Obesity Research at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases .
And some hospitals are adding larger surgical instruments , wheelchairs , and other equipment .
There 's an even bigger problem , though : when heavy women are ignored , the obesity epidemic is ignored , too -- and that has to stop , experts say .
" Being mistreated or dismissed by your doctor because of your weight is unacceptable .
But what 's just as important is that doctors are missing an opportunity to help their patients lose weight and improve their health , " says Huizinga of Johns Hopkins .
" Doctors and patients need to be able to speak openly about weight - related issues , whether it 's the diseases caused by excess weight or the reasons why a patient overeats .
That level of conversation requires a certain degree of comfort , and the basis for that is mutual respect , plain and simple , " she says .
" That 's how we can help all women get healthier . "

If you 're going to watch Avatar on the move , why not watch it in 3D ?
At the Mobile World Congress on Wednesday , TI showed off a tablet - sized device with a 3D display that does n't require glasses , running on an existing TI OMAP3 chipset .
The company also promised high - def , 3D movies with its new OMAP4 chips .
The 3D demo showed images and video in 3D by using a standard 120 - Hz LCD with a special overlay film from 3 M that can direct images either towards your left or right eye .
By flickering two images very quickly  running at 60 frames per second rather than the usual 30  the display transmits a different picture to each eye , creating a simulated 3D image .
Still images looked good to me , with some depth , though movies were n't quite as convincing .
The 3D picture can be created using a handheld with dual 3 - megapixel cameras and an 800 - MHz TI OMAP 3630 chipset , which are all components that are available today .
At any time , the display can switch back to 2D .
And it does n't require glasses  though at the cost , clearly , of really convincing 3D video .
This is only the start of 3D for TI , OMAP platform marketing manager Brian Carlson said .
The new OMAP4 chipset announced at this show supports " dual 720 p , " which lets you display real , high - def 3D movies and send them over an HDMI cable to a TV .
With dual cameras on the front of OMAP4 phones , TI will be able to record 3D images as well .
If you want to watch an ordinary 2D image , you can do it in 1080 p high definition resolution with OMAP4 , Carlson said .
" Anything that comes out of Hollywood will end up on your mobile phone , " Carlson said .
Blades & Warriors Live From Saskatoon On Rogers Sportsnet
