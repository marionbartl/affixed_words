Religious leaders have united to express their dismay at a custom range of Lego figures - including a " Toy Taliban " armed to the teeth with C96 broomhandle Mauser pistol , AK Assault Rifle and M67 frag grenades .
The offending terrorist - made by US firm BrickArms and punted for £ 9.50 to impressionable UK kiddies here - did n't much impress Mohammed Shaffiq , of Muslim organisation The Ramadhan Foundation , who slammed the toy as “ absolutely disgusting ” .
He told the Sun : “ It is glorifying terrorism - the makers should be ashamed .
We should be coming together to unite against terrorism , but how is that possible when children are playing with toys like this ? ”
Parents who feel uneasy about their kids reenacting exciting moments in recent Afghan history might consider buying their offspring an SS major instead - a snip at just eight quid .
Or maybe not .
As Edie Friedman , director of the Jewish Council for Racial Equality , explained : “ These distasteful toys are something we could all well do without , especially when there is so much tension around . ”
Lego today issued a statement which reads : " LEGO ® UK is not associated with the toys being sold by BrickArms , which have been customised without LEGO UK ’s knowledge or permission .
" BrickArms is not licensed by LEGO UK to customise LEGO figures and has no links to the LEGO brand .
LEGO UK is committed to developing toys which enrich childhood by encouraging imaginative and creative play - and does not endorse products that do not fit with this philosophy . " ®

So , you want to buy your wife or girlfriend something special .
Something that you might like as well .
What makes a better gift than lingerie ( well , for you at least ) ?
So you go to the store and maybe just buy some ordinary lingerie .
But wait , Brazilian designer Lucia Loria has designed an even fancier lingerie .
This one comes with a GPS tracking system .
Supposedly it ’s for her protection from kidnappings and such .
Kind of a wearable Lo -Jack .
But now you can track your significant other and keep tabs on them from your home .
Think your wife is cheating on you ?
Who needs a private eye or clunky stalking ?
Just go online and see where she ’s at !
Plus , imagine this awkward conversation : “ Happy Birthday , honey !
Now I know I thought you were cheating on me , but I bought you these new undies to show how much I love you .
Have fun out with the girls tonight . ”
A Fairfield woman whose car was adorned with celebratory signs for President - elect Barack Obama says she is furious that a priest singled her out during Mass Sunday morning and ordered her to leave .
Elizabeth Caster said the Rev. Sebastian Meyer humiliated her in front of the congregation at Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church in Fairfield , saying from the pulpit , “ We cannot have a car with Obama signs written on it on these premises .
And I do n’t care who Obama is . ”
He continued : “ I want this car off the premises in 10 minutes or it will be towed .
Whoever ’s vehicle this is , I want it removed .
I do n’t want to see that car anywhere around here , ” she said .
Meyer did not return calls .
An attempt to speak to him in person ended abruptly Wednesday morning when he announced , “ No , we ’re not writing that , ” and reportedly lunged at a reporter , attempting to snatch the reporter ’s notebook away .
That incident was reported to police and the Diocese of Sacramento , which oversees Roman Catholic churches in the Fairfield area .
Kevin Eckery , a spokesman for the diocese , said that because police had been notified , he could n’t comment on any specifics involving Wednesday ’s incident .
Still , he acknowledged the right of the reporter to ask questions .
Caster said the priest followed her and her 10 - year - old son out of the church and refused to let her move her Toyota Sequoia , which was parked between two other cars in a loading zone outside the church , anywhere else in the parking lot .
Caster , who was contacted by many concerned church members the next day , believes it was the Obama slogans that riled the priest .
Among those who watched Sunday ’s incident was Joanne Smith , who said she has seen vehicles parked in the yellow zone with signs supporting John McCain .
She also was curious about why Caster ’s vehicle was singled out .
Caster ’s husband , Joe , had stayed home that morning because he was feeling ill .
He was outraged when she called to tell him about it .
“ Her right to free speech was violated , ” he said .
The Casters say they have given $ 25 a week to the church for the past six years , but that has come to an end .
Peggy Sherrod , a parishioner since 1989 who teaches a religious study session to sixth - graders , also witnessed the incident and said it made her sad .
“ It took a lot out of me to sit there and not walk out , ” Sherrod said .
Eckery said Meyer told him that he was merely concerned about an illegally parked vehicle that was partially blocking access to the church .
Meyer told Eckery he admitted leaving the pulpit to make the announcement and only referenced the Obama writing to identify the car .
“ The congregation and Father Sebastian are very sorry for any misunderstanding and there certainly was no intent to say anything bad about our president - elect , ” Eckery said .

We 're probably all very familiar with phrases uttered by U.S. politicians that have gone down in history .
The good : FDR 's " The only thing we have to fear is fear itself "  and Teddy 's " Speak softly and carry a big stick . " 
And the bad : the elder Bush 's " Read my lips : no new taxes , "  Clinton 's " I did not have sexual relations with that woman , "  and Senator Larry Craig 's " I have a wide stance . " 
But the same thing happens in other countries , of course , we just do n't often hear as much about them .
I thought we'd check some of those out today .
And , if we have any natives of those countries reading , let us know if these statements really are widely known and / or mocked .
1. Carlos SaÃºl Menem , the President of Argentina from 1989 - 1999 , has a whole host of phrases .
During his tenure as President , he was accused of corruption , unemployment rates soared to more than 20 percent , and Argentina entered a terrible recession .
So when you consider his campaign catchphrase , " Â¡SÃ­ganme , no los voy a defraudar ! "
( " Follow me , I wo n't let you down ! "  ) you can see how it became the laughingstock of his Presidency ( kind of like the No New Taxes debacle ) .
He apparently was also famous for saying , " Hermanito querido " ¦ "  which means " My dear little brother " ¦ "  .
He would say it condescendingly in speeches and debates .
2. Austrian Chancellor Fred Sinowatz ( his term was from 1983 - 1986 ) is often quoted tongue - in - cheek .
He once said , " Ich weiÃŸ , das klingt alles sehr kompliziert ... " , which means , " I know , this all sounds complicated . " 
People now use the phrase to try to hide when they do n't know much about the subject .
It 's done ironically , though " “ as soon as you say , " I know , this all sounds complicated " ¦ "  people immediately know you are no expert on the subject at hand .
Sinowatz just recently died , actually , on August 11 .
3. Former Canadian Prime Minister Jean ChrÃ©tien - " I do n't know ...
A proof is a proof .
What kind of a proof ?
It 's a proof .
A proof is a proof , and when you have a good proof , it 's because it 's proven . "
4. " Mit Verlaub , Herr PrÃ¤sident , Sie sind ein Arschloch . "
This was said by German foreign minister and Vice Chancellor Joschka Fischer .
What does it mean ?
It 's something we 've probably all wanted to say at one point or another to at least one of our Presidents : " With all due respect , Mr. President , you are an asshole . " 
They were having a heated debate in parliament and the President had threatened to eject him from the meeting ( it 's just like baseball ! ) .
5 . And yet another " No new taxes "  " “ esque statement : " Niemand hat die Absicht , eine Mauer zu errichten . "
This was said by Walter Ulbricht , a German communist politician who has held several public office roles .
The translation ?
" No one intends to build a wall . " 
Of course , the Berlin Wall was built a couple of months later .
6. Venezuelan President Hugo ChÃ¡vez got his rear handed to him by Juan Carlos I of Spain last year during the Ibero - American Summit .
First , he called former Prime Minister of Spain Jose Maria Aznar a fascist .
Then when the current Prime Minister , Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero , tried to respond during his allotted time , President Chavez kept interrupting , even when his microphone was turned off on him .
Finally , Juan Carlos reached his breaking point , turned to Chavez and said , " Â¿ Por quÃ© no te callas ? " 
Translation : " Why do n't you shut up ? " 
7. Another zinger from Spain : Then - Prime Minister Felipe GonzÃ¡lez was campaigning to keep his position in 1996 .
His opinion of his opponents were quite clear : " Aznar y Anguita son la misma mierda . " 
You can probably figure this one out if you know how to curse in Spanish " “ " Aznar and Anguita are the same shit . " 
8 . As current Polish President Lech Kaczy Å „ ski was about to get into his car in 2002 after attending an event for the Warsaw mayoral campaign , he was stopped by a passerby .
The passerby said ( in Polish ) , " You 've changed the part , you 've run away like rats . " 
The distinguished politician 's response ?
" Sir , piss off Sir !
That 's what I 'll say to you . " 
Passerby : " Piss off sir ??
Sir , you are just afraid of the truth ! " 
Kaczy Å „ ski : " Piss off , old man ! " 
Ever since , the phrase " Piss off , old man ! "  has been seen on t- shirts , movies and cartoons " “ albeit , in a milder form for cartoons .
In the Polish versions of Open Season , the Simpsons Movie and Shrek , the form , " Get lost , old man , "  was used .
9 . At the time this quote was originated , Romanian President Traian BÄƒsescu was the Minister of Transport .
After a particularly heavy snow , numerous streets were blocked and seemingly nothing was being done about it .
When asked about what measures he was taking to be more effective next time , his response was , " Iarna nu- i ca vara " - " When it 's winter , it 's not like summer . " 
10 .
This last one is probably my favorite .
I guess , in some parts of the world , " Fuddle Duddle "  is a popular euphemism for the F - Bomb .
Similar to " fudge , "  I suppose .
In 1971 , Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau was accused of mouthing " Eff off "  during a discussion at the House of Commons .
Of course , the press was all over it .
Trudeau denied saying it or mouthing it or anything of that nature , although admitted he may have moved his lips at the moment in question .
Here 's the transcript of an interview from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation :
Pierre Trudeau :
Well what are they , lip readers or something ?
Press : Did you "¦?
Pierre Trudeau :
Of course I did n't say anything .
I mean that 's a " ¦
Press : Did you mouth anything ?
Pierre Trudeau : I moved my lips and I used my hands in a gesture of derision , yes .
But I did n't say anything .
If these guys want to read lips and they want to see something into it , you know that 's their problem .
I think they 're very sensitive .
They come in the House and they make all kinds of accusations , and because I smile at them in derision they come stomping out and what , go crying to momma or to television that they 've been insulted or something ?
[ later in the press conference ]
Pierre Trudeau :
Well , it 's a lie , because I did n't say anything .
Press : Sir , did you mouth it ?
Pierre Trudeau : [ visibly annoyed ]
What does " mouth "  mean ?
Press :
Move your lips .
Pierre Trudeau : Move your lips ?
Yes I moved my lips !
Press :
In the words you 've been quoted as saying ?
Pierre Trudeau : [ half smile ]
No .
Press : ( After murmurs by other press ) What were you thinking " ¦ when you moved your lips ?
Pierre Trudeau :
What is the nature of your thoughts , gentlemen , when you say " fuddle duddle "  or something like that ?
God , you guys " ¦!
[ walks away ]
Needless to say , the press had a blast with this .
When his wife became pregnant with their first child , a popular radio station declared , " Margaret Trudeau has been fuddle - duddled ! "
An algal bloom fills the Baltic Sea in this image from 2005 Large sources of pollution to the Baltic Sea have been missed by existing monitoring efforts , according to research from Sweden .
The health of the Baltic Sea has been declining since the 1960s , due to the disposal of untreated human waste and toxic materials such as heavy metals .
Countries bordering the Baltic have put together an action plan to stem the tide of contaminants entering the sea .
The pollution hotspots are deceptively small settlements near the coast .
Professor Gia Destouni , from Stockholm University , said these areas were being left without systematic environmental monitoring .
The Baltic Sea is also being harmed by the " nutrients " from fertiliser used in agriculture .
The lack of water exchange between the Baltic and the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans makes the sea water naturally more prone to dead zone episodes , where the water has very low concentrations of dissolved oxygen .
But the problem is exacerbated by the use of fertiliser - including nitrogen and phosphorus - which runs off fields into streams and rivers .
When it reaches the ocean , it provides nutrients for algae , which can form blooms .
This in turn leads to more organic matter reaching the bottom of the sea , where bacteria break it down , using up the oxygen required by marine animals on the sea floor .
Comparing countries " Because of practical difficulties , you cannot monitor everywhere .
So people do focus on the big rivers , for a number of different reasons , " Professor Destouni told BBC News .
" You have these ' blind spots ' in coastal zones all over the world .
But the Baltic Sea is one of the most polluted and ( nutrient - filled ) seas in the world . "
She added : " In earlier work , when we tried to quantify these holes , we saw that Sweden had an extra large fraction of these blind spots and an extra large population in them . "
Although the areas themselves may be small , they extend along most of Sweden 's coastline and are home to a large proportion of the country 's population .
Sweden was found to have an unmonitored area where water drains into the Baltic of 20 % .
This same area is home to 55 % of the country 's population .
The new research shows that concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus and organic pollutants in the water flowing from these unmonitored areas may be much larger than in the main rivers that are subject to systematic environmental monitoring .
In the journal Global Biogeochemical Cycles , Professor Destouni and her colleagues found that the reported loads of nitrogen and phosphorous from Sweden to the Baltic Sea are significantly smaller than would be expected .
This expectation is based on strong connections , found by the study , between a country 's loads of different contaminants and its population size , area and economic activity .
Bridging the gap Professor Destouni explained : " If we look at the reported nutrient loads from all around the Baltic Sea drainage basin , and compare the rest of the countries - which have a much more similar fraction of blind spots - with the Swedish reports - which have a higher fraction of blind spots - we should see a significant difference .
" We see a very significant difference between what Sweden is reporting and what the other countries are reporting in relation to the area that is contributing , to the population that is contributing , and the GDP of each country . "
This year , Sweden has set up 10 new stations to augment the monitoring network .
And some observers stress that calculations of the pollutant load are not based on water monitoring data only .
For example , populations connected to waste water treatment plants are monitored , and leakage from agricultural land is modelled .
The unmonitored areas are taken into account when Swedish nutrient loads to the Baltic Sea are estimated .
The data gaps are bridged with the help of computer modelling .
However , the authors of the latest study point out that because these results cannot be checked against real data for the unmonitored areas , they could be significantly wrong .

While supercomputer maker Silicon Graphics was showing off its existing Altix lines of Xeon and Itanium servers at the SC08 supercomputing show in Austin , Texas , this week , the most interesting thing the company touted was not yet a real computer , but a concept system , called Molecule .
The Molecule machine takes a few pages out of IBM's BlueGene massively parallel supercomputer book , and the main one is that for some workloads , where a large number of compute nodes need to be brought to bear to run a simulation , sometimes it makes more sense to have relatively modest processors instead of big fat ones .
IBM built the BlueGene / L super from its embedded PowerPC 440 dual - core processors .
SGI 's Molecule concept machine would be built from Intel dual - core Atom x64 chips , which are based on 45 nanometer processes and are designed for netbooks and other portable computing devices where long battery life , not computing power , is the limit of usefulness .
The chips run at between 800 MHz and 1.67 GHz and implement HyperThreading , so they can deliver up to two virtual threads per core .
With the BlueGene box , IBM controlled not only the chip but also the interface off the chip and out into the system interconnect .
Michael Brown , sciences segment manager at SGI who was showing off the Molecule concept box , says that SGI can't really control the interconnect Intel will put on Atom boards .
But presumably a fast enough interconnect could be designed to plug multiple Atom boards into a chassis .
The Molecule concept machine puts a dual - core Atom N330 , code - named " Diamondville , " on a system board that is about the size of a credit card .
This particular chip runs at 1.6 GHz and has a thermal design point of about 8 watts .
The Atom N330 is not a true dual - core chip , but rather two single - core Atoms side - by - side in a single chip package ( it really is n't even a socket ) that is mounted to the board .
Brown said that the future " Lincroft " iteration of the Atom chip , which will put a DDR2 memory controller on the chip , and thereby eliminate the need for an external chipset since the Molecule boards have no direct attached storage other than main memory , would be an interesting possibility .
But Brown made no commitments to SGI actually using this chip .
In any event , the Molecule board had four memory DIMMs soldered directly to the board and linked to the chip , which provided 2 GB of memory capacity .
The interconnect is along the side of the board as the memory chips , and would plug into a backplane of some sort that would reach out to external storage and networks , much as blade servers do inside their chassis .
The Molecule design glues two of these Atom boards to a hollow ceramic cartridge that is used to hold the boards in place , to draw heat off the boards , and to channel cooling air that comes in through the bottom of the chassis and is diverted at a 90 degree angle out the back of the chassis .
The cartridges interlace to create a bunch of channels , and have fins and baffles inside to direct airflow very precisely .
SGI calls this Atom board packaging Kelvin .
Kelvin , lording over the Atoms in the Molecule
The concept machine at the SC08 show was a 3U rack that contained 180 of the Atom boards , for a total of 360 cores .
These boards would present 720 virtual threads to a clustered application , and have 720 GB of main memory ( using 512 MB DDR2 DIMMs mounted on the board ) and a total of 720 GB / sec of memory bandwidth .
The important thing to realize , explained Brown , is that if the interconnect was architected correctly , the entire memory inside the chassis could be searched in one second .
That memory bandwidth , Brown explained , was up to 15 TB / sec per rack , or about 20 times that of a single - rack cluster these days .
This setup would be good for applications where cache memory or out - of - order execution do n't help , but massive amounts of threads do help .
( Search , computational fluid dynamics , seismic processing , stochastic modeling , and others were mentioned ) .
The other advantages that the Molecule system might have are low energy use and low cost .
The aggregate memory bandwidth in a rack of these machines ( that 's 10,080 cores with 9.8 TB of memory ) would deliver about 7 times the GB per second per watt of a rack of x64 servers in a cluster today , according to Brown .
On applications where threads rule , the Molecule would do about 7 times the performance per watt of x64 servers , and on SPEC - style floating point tests , it might even deliver twice the performance per watt .
On average , SGI is saying performance per watt should be around 3.5 times that of a rack of x64 servers .
One more thing :
It has no moving parts , and that increases reliability .
And if storage needs to be added to the Molecule architecture , it will be flash memory .
The Molecule aims to run off - the - shelf HPC applications on top of Linux or Windows .
Brown said that SGI was showing off the concept box to solicit input from prospective customers even before it creates an alpha box .
If SGI sees enough interest , it could take 12 to 18 months to produce the concept .
If the idea is sound , let 's hope it does n't take that long . ®
Senator Larry Craig ( R - ID ) was turned down today in his appeal to have his guilty plea overturned .
In the Minnesota Court of Appeals decision , they rejected his claims that the sentencing judge did n’t have all the facts .
In part , this was because it was Craig ’s job to provide them and he did n’t .
Also , it ’s pretty tough to try to go into court to have your own guilty plea overturned .
According to Politico.com , Sen Craig issued this statement :
“ I am extremely disappointed by the action of the Minnesota Court of Appeals .
I disagree with their conclusion and remain steadfast in my belief that nothing criminal or improper occurred at the Minneapolis airport .
I maintain my innocence , and currently my attorneys and I are reviewing the decision and looking into the possibility of appealing .
I would like to thank all of those who have continued to support me and my family throughout this difficult time . ”
I was not among those who supported him , but believe it or not , the ACLU was .
They filed amicus briefs on his behalf claiming that his conduct was protected under the First Amendment , but their argument was , likewise , rejected by the court .
All I can say now is , Good Luck , Senate Queen :

He keeps roaming the bath stalls
In his favored habitat
‘ Let me have men ’ , he says
Just like Marie Antoinette
A built - in sympathy
For closets and secrecy
At anytime an invitation
He ca n’t decline
D.C. bars for gentlemen
Well - versed in etiquette
Extraordinarily nice
He ’s a Senate Queen
Goes prowlin ’ toilet scenes
Dynamite in the men ’s latrines
Guaranteed to blow some guy
Anytime
Recommended by the right
Insatiable in appetite
What a guy
To avoid implications
He never used the same commode
In desperation
He spoke just like a homophobe
Met a cop in St Paul
He found him in the next stall
And then asked him , incidentally ,
If he ’s that way inclined
Bad boys come naturally from Congress .
For facts he could n’t care less .
Fastidious and precise .
He ’s a Senate Queen
Goes prowlin ’ toilet scenes
Dynamite in the men ’s latrines
Guaranteed to blow some guy
Anytime
Drop of hat he ’s as horny as
Lustful as an alley cat
Then momentarily robbed of action
Temporarily out of ass
It absolutely drives him wild , wild
They ’re out to get him
He ’s a Senate Queen
Goes prowlin ’ toilet scenes
Dynamite in the men ’s latrines
Guaranteed to blow some guy
Anytime
Decommissioned by the right
And possibly a sodomite
What a guy
You ’re quite a guy
A second referendum on the Lisbon Treaty is set to take place in the Republic next October .
And if the country votes ' no ' again , there will be a massive push by other countries to leave them out of the loop .
The first referendum was rejected in June this year .
Already , one German MEP has launched a scathing attack on the Irish demand for new incentives , and said Prime Minister Brian Cowen has acted as if he were at a flea market .
And the President of the European Parliament , Hans - Gert Pottering , told the Herald that there will be " very serious consequences " if the treaty is rejected again .
As part of a deal negotiated between Brian Cowen and other European leaders , all 27 member states of the EU will retain a permanent commissioner and a set of legal declarations will be made on topics such as neutrality and abortion .
While Mr Cowen is expected to release limited details of the package today , several MEPs from across Europe have told the Herald that the fresh vote will take place four months after next June 's European elections .
Vice President of the European Commission , Margot Wallstrom of Sweden , described October as a " realistic " date for Lisbon Two .
However , some have heavily criticised the fact that the Republic has demanded a permanent position on the commission .
German MEP
Alexander Alvaro told the Herald yesterday that he thought the Irish ultimatum was " rubbish " .
" Imagine a situation where Poland says 'we wo n't sign the treaty unless we get the high commissioner for foreign affairs ' .
We are not at a bazaar here , " he said .
The member of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe said he blamed the heads of states for not getting the message across last time .
And he hit out at " all this crap " that was put out during the last referendum debate .
" I 'm not sure if people in Ireland were aware what ' no ' means - 27 minus Ireland , " he warned .
British MEP Richard Corbett also criticised the Irish proposal , noting that countries keeping the commissioner for two out of three years " was actually a victory for the smaller countries " .
" It 's not unreasonable that if 25 or 26 say yes and one says no , to ask the one if it 's willing to reconsider , " he said .

Grandson of German prince who helped ' Valkyrie ' plot to kill Hitler loses bid to win back his family 's £ 6 m estate
Prince Friedrich zu Solms - Baruth III was swept up by the Gestapo the day after the failed bombing attempt on Hitler in 1944
A German nobleman whose family estates were seized on the orders of Adolf Hitler after a failed plot to kill him has lost his bid for restitution .
A court near Berlin threw out the claim despite the expert testimony from British Third Reich - era historian Anthony Beevor , who backed Prince Friedrich zu Solms - Baruth , 45 , in his bid to gain back the £ 6 million ancestral lands .
His grandfather signed away the rights to the estate after he was arrested by the Gestapo for his involvement in the plot to assassinate Hitler in July , 1944 .
The prince claims that after German reunification , his own father had ' fought the German authorities tirelessly for restitution of the family 's estates and property - until his death in January 2006 ' .
A settlement was achieved between his father , the 4th Prince of Solms - Baruth , and the German government regarding the bulk of the estates in 2003 .
Prince Friedrich says what was now being claimed – over 17,000 acres of land worth over £ 6 million - is the rest .
Yesterday the Administrative Court in Potsdam near Berlin rejected the attempt to regain the family estate and dictated there could be no appeal in Germany .
The prince had already vowed to go before the EU with his claim if he failed .
' I am disappointed , ' said Prince Friedrich .
' The court did not recognise sufficiently my grandfather ’s fight against the Nazis .
But my fight goes on .'
The court found that previous restitution for the land was sufficient and that it could not hand back land later expropriated from aristocrats seized by the Soviet Army at the end of World War II .
Most of the prince ’s family land was seized by Hitler in his wide - sweeping vengeance after the failed bomb plot .
Some 7,000 people were murdered by the Gestapo after the assassination attempt at Hitler ’s Wolf ’s Lair HQ in East Prussia .
Hermann Goering ( in the light uniform ) inspects the wrecked room after the bomb exploded under the table close to Hitler
The prince , who was betrayed as a sympathiser , was thrown into the Gestapo main jail in Berlin because of his association with the nobles who plotted the Fuehrer ’s death and his estates seized .
But he survived the war .
The case came amid a renewed focus in recent months on the bomb plot , which was led by Col.
Claus Graf Schenk von Stauffenberg , in part because of the upcoming Tom Cruise film ' Valkyrie ' based on the event .
Cruise plays the aristocratic colonel in the film .
Von Stauffenberg placed the bomb in a conference room where Hitler was meeting with his aides and military advisers , but the dictator escaped with scrapes and bruises .
Solms - Baruth 's grandfather , a long - time anti-Nazi , was involved in discussions of the plot and provided two of his mansions as meeting places .
The Hitler assassination plot is the subject of the 2008 film Valkyrie starring Tom Cruise who plays plot leader Col. Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg
But the evidence against Solms - Baruth was thin , and he was kept alive in an attempt to extract information about other plotters , according to his grandson .
Incarcerated in the Prince Albrechtstrasse Gestapo prison in Berlin , dubbed the ' House of Horror ' , he was kept in solitary confinement and interrogated incessantly , according to his family .
The prince dismisses suggestions his grandfather received preferential treatment .
' He was banished under pain of death from his former properties , and his rights of ownership over his companies and estates were taken from him , ' he said .
The day after his arrest , the Nazis ' ransacked the prince 's castles , threw out the family , felled timber in vast quantities and organised large Nazi Party hunts , treating the estates as if they were their own , ' claims Prince Friedrich .
Released near war 's end , his grandfather fled to a small farming property he owned in Saxony , close to the Elbe river , with his wife , youngest daughter , and loyal staff , then to the home of his brother - in - law , the Duke of Schleswig - Holstein .
Later he stayed at Castle Hega , the home of the Crown Princess of Sweden in Stockholm , before leaving Europe to ' begin a new life in Namibia with his wife , son and three daughters ' , explained Prince Friedrich .
The IPv6 Workgroup of the Linux Foundation has announced that all major Linux distributions are now in compliance with Department of Defense certification policies , several months after the DoD began enforcing the requirements in its procurement practices .
The compliance effort was driven by a collaboration involving IBM , Red Hat , Novell , Nokia , and several other major Linux stakeholders .
IPv6 , which stands for Internet Protocol Version 6 , boosts the size of IP addresses to 128 bits .
This simplifies routing by dramatically expanding the number of available addresses .
IP v6 adoption will be necessitated by the eventual exhaustion of available IP v4 addresses , but the transition has been slow and challenging .
The United States Department of Defense ( DoD ) accelerated its own move to IPv6 - enabled technology and set 2008 as the target year for completion of the process .
Major software vendors have had to fulfill specific requirements and validate their products against the Defense Information System Agency 's IPv6 Special Interoperability Certification in order to avoid being excluded from DoD procurements .
The DoD made certification mandatory in June .
According to the Linux Foundation , the most popular enterprise Linux distributions now meet the DoD 's standards .
The foundation 's IPv6 workgroup was led by Venkata Jagana , IBM 's chief architect of linux networking .
IBM was an early participant in the Internet Engineering Task Force 's efforts to devise IPv6 and implemented the protocol in its own AIX UNIX operating system in 1997 .
They began contributing to Linux 's IP v6 development efforts a few years later .
" In early 2000 , IBM recognized the need for Linux to be both IPv6 compliant and interoperable and started making development contributions by working with the Linux community and distros , " said IBM 's Kathy Bennett in a statement .
" Today , that effort , along with Linux Foundation 's IPv6 WG efforts , have benefited the Linux industry in achieving the Department of Defense IPv6 certification at a level which is leading in the industry . "
Linux has had relatively robust IP v6 support since 2005 , but further work was needed for for the open source platform to achieve full compliance with DoD standards .
The Linux Foundation 's IPv6 workgroup analyzed the DoD certification requirements and identified key areas where Linux 's IP v6 stack needed adjustments in order to guarantee compliance .
They collaboratively filled in the gaps and have succeeded in bringing the shared technology into alignment with the DoD 's standards .
In August , Red Hat announced that its enterprise Linux distribution had officially received the certification after it passed the DoD IPv6 Master Test Plan .
The Linux Foundation contends that all major distros are now properly equipped to pass the tests and should achieve certification .
The effort highlights the value of the Linux Foundation , which serves as a forum for bringing together companies that use and deploy Linux so that they can collectively solve shared problems .
" The IPv6 mandate and ensuing requirements are such major undertakings that it makes it difficult for any one company to deal with it all on its own , " said Linux Foundation director Jim Zemlin in a statement .
" This is exactly the kind of work and collaboration that the Linux Foundation can facilitate , and which results in real technology advancements for the Linux operating system . "
IPv6 support is starting to grow in mainstream software .
A recent study conducted by Google showed that global IP v6 penetration is still at less than one percent , but its growth is accelerating in North America as a result of Apple 's growing market share and support for the protocol in its router products .
For a technical introduction to IP v6 , check out the detailed guide that we published last year .

Is there a bird that ’s better than brined ?
For the last decade or so , many of us have adopted as part of our Thanksgiving ritual soaking our turkeys in salt water for several days before roasting them .
This is n’t weird ; it really works .
Birds that have been brined stay much moister than turkeys that have not .
Still , there ’s no arguing with the fact that there are drawbacks to the technique .
You ’ve got to find a bucket big enough to hold a turkey , to start with -- and a clean one .
And then you ’ve got to find room in your refrigerator to store it for the better part of a week .
Is there a better way ?
Last Thanksgiving , we at the Food Section introduced readers to a steam - roasting technique .
Turkey baked in a covered roaster pan -- you know , the kind your grandma used -- stays moist in a different way .
During normal uncovered roasting , any juices that leak out of the bird are converted to steam by the hot pan and evaporate .
Covering the pan reduces the amount of steam that gets away .
A moist turkey with no advance preparation -- we really liked that idea .
And then there are those who swear by high - heat roasting for turkeys -- they claim quick cooking keeps the meat moist and improves the flavor because of the improved browning .
For the last year , I ’ve been on a dry - salting craze .
Almost every piece of protein that comes into my kitchen sits under a light sprinkling of salt for anywhere from an hour to several days before I cook it ( as you can imagine , my wife and daughter have been hiding in other parts of the house ) .
Meat that has been left to sit under salt has a deeper , more concentrated flavor and the texture is moist , but firm and more meaty .
This technique is something I learned from Judy Rodgers , chef at San Francisco ’s landmark Zuni Cafe .
I ’ve used it with fish fillets ( which take only an hour or so of curing ) , chicken , both parts and whole ( anywhere from eight hours to a couple of days ) , and even a beef tenderloin ( several days ) .
I call it “ Judy- ing , ” and it has worked wonders with everything I ’ve tried it on .
But how would it work with turkey , which is so much larger than any of the meats I cook during the rest of the year ?
Would the salt penetrate all the way to the center of the breast and thighs ?
I was a little skeptical ( and so was Judy when I asked her ) , but it was worth a try .
Thus was born the Great Turkey Smackdown of 2006 : Four turkeys , four ovens , four techniques tested side by side : one brined , one steam - roasted , one high - heat - roasted and one “ Judy-ed . ”
Once and for all , we ’d find the best way to roast a turkey .
Fire up the ovens
IT ’S no wonder so many Thanksgiving turkeys wind up so disappointing .
Turkeys are notoriously difficult to get exactly right , even for experienced cooks .
In the first place , they ’re composed of two contradictory meats -- white breast meat that dries out in a flash and dark leg meat that seems to take forever to get done .
On top of that , they are huge , which magnifies any mistake in timing .
Most cooks know about brining , which not only adds moisture to the bird and seasons it throughout but also helps the muscles hold on to that moisture during cooking by altering the electrical charges of the protein strands .
Salting works similarly to brining , except it does n’t use any water .
It ’s remarkably simple .
You just sprinkle the turkey with salt , then set it aside for four days for a 12 - to 16 - pound bird .
At first , the salt pulls moisture from the meat , but as time passes , almost all of those juices are reabsorbed , bringing the salt along with them .
But maybe I was over - thinking the whole thing ; perhaps high - temperature roasting was n’t such a bad idea .
If a 400 - degree oven makes a chicken with crisp brown skin and moist flesh , why would n’t it do the same thing for a turkey ?
Would n’t it be great if the solution to all of our turkey woes could be so easy ?
The Smackdown , we hoped , would answer these questions .
We bought four fresh free - range turkeys as close to the same size as we could find -- about 15 pounds .
We started the two that needed advance preparation , salting one , brining the other and storing them in 2 1/2 - gallon sealable plastic bags .
The Times Test Kitchen ’s ovens had recently been calibrated , assuring accurate temperatures .
We assembled four similar heavy - gauge , anodized aluminum roasting pans .
For the brining , we used a standard ratio of two - thirds cup salt to 1 gallon water .
For the salting , we allowed 1 tablespoon of salt for every 4 pounds of turkey -- just short of one - fourth cup -- and concentrated the distribution on the thickest parts of the meat , the breast and the thigh .
After three days , we removed both from their bags and let all four turkeys air - dry in the refrigerator overnight -- the fan that circulates cold air also works very well at drying poultry skin .
On the big day , we salted the two that had not been seasoned .
Then we put them all in the oven , without stuffing .
We started the brined and salted birds at 375 degrees , breast - side down , and then after 30 minutes we flipped them and reduced the temperature to 325 degrees .
Following the recipe , we started the covered - pan turkey at 425 degrees then immediately turned it down to 325 degrees before removing the lid and browning the turkey at 350 degrees for the last half - hour .
We simply roasted the high - heat turkey at 400 degrees , breast - side up , from beginning to end .
None of the birds were basted .
For all , we were aiming for a final temperature of 165 degrees measured in the deepest part of the thigh .
The first surprise was an unpleasant one .
When we took the temperatures after only a little more than two hours of cooking , the covered - pan turkey had already soared past 180 degrees -- well past well - done .
We would have to try that one again .
The other three finished cooking within a very short time of each other -- roughly three hours .
The one roasted at high temperature ended up being done only about 15 minutes faster than the birds roasted at the conventional temperature .
We let the birds set for 30 minutes to finish cooking and enable the juices to re-distribute evenly through the meat .
The Times Tasting Panel waited eagerly as I carved the birds , both white meat and dark .
Joining me on the panel were staff writers Charles Perry , Corie Brown and Amy Scattergood , test kitchen director Donna Deane , restaurant critic S. Irene Virbila , assistant food editor Betty Hallock , food editor Leslie Brenner and deputy features editor Michalene Busico .
The best - browned bird was the one we had brined .
It was very moist -- both in the breast meat and in the thigh .
And the flavor was good , not salty at all but well - seasoned throughout .
So we had n’t been crazy for all those years .
However , as we ’d learn after tasting all the birds , it did n’t have the best texture -- it was slightly spongy .
The high - temperature experiment was not nearly as successful as the brined .
Far from solving the problem of the difference in doneness between dark and white meat , this magnified it .
The flavor was fine , and the skin was brown and crisp .
But though the breast meat had already started to dry out , the dark meat was still a little underdone -- it had that slightly rubbery rare - poultry texture and there was a little pink juice in the hip joint .
But the bird that got people most excited was the one we had Judy - ed .
Unlike the brined turkey , which had a slightly spongy texture , the one that had only been salted was firm , meaty and smoothly dense .
And though it was a bit too salty as prepared this first go - round , the underlying flavor of the turkey was amazing -- deep and full .
Suddenly , my Thanksgiving menu plans took a turn .
This was one serious bird .
People sampled it , went thoughtfully quiet a minute and then grabbed for more .
The opinion of the panel was unanimous -- the Judy - ed bird , though it needed a bit of refinement to tone down the salt and crisp and brown the skin , was the clear winner .
To be fair to the steam - roasted turkey , we retested that one , but that did n’t change the results of the Smackdown .
Though it was certainly moist , the flavor was pallid in comparison with the other birds ; it tasted more steamed than roasted .
To further refine the pre-salted turkey , we tried it again , this time reducing the salt , allowing only a tablespoon for every 5 pounds of bird .
To improve the browning , we started roasting the bird at 425 degrees for 30 minutes instead of 375 degrees .
And we threw in one further wrinkle -- we brushed half of the bird with melted butter before it went into the oven to see what effect that had on browning and on flavor .
This time we hit it right on the money .
The turkey was a glorious brown all over -- the side brushed with butter might have had a slightly more golden color but only ever so slightly ( and there was no difference in flavor at all ) .
The skin was nicely crisp .
The dark meat was firm and meaty and still incredibly moist -- enough that even after a half - hour ’s sitting there was a flood of juice when I carved it .
The white meat was only slightly less so .
The problem with saltiness was solved .
If anything , the breast meat could have used just a little more passed at the table for those of us with a salty palate .
So next time , I might try upping the salt just a bit -- this is a recipe that will evolve over time .
And , maybe best of all , you no longer have to wrestle that big bucket of brine - soaked bird out of the refrigerator .

Roast salted turkey
Total time : 2 hours , 50 minutes
Servings : 11 to 15
Note :
This is more a technique than a recipe .
It makes a bird that has concentrated turkey flavor and fine , firm flesh and that is delicious as it is .
But you can add other flavors as you wish .
Minced rosemary would be a nice finishing addition .
Or brush the bird lightly with butter before roasting .
1 ( 12 - to 16 - pound ) turkey
Kosher salt
1 . Wash the turkey inside and out , pat it dry and weigh it .
Measure 1 tablespoon of salt into a bowl for every 5 pounds the turkey weighs ( for a 15 - pound turkey , you ’d have 3 tablespoons ) .
2. Sprinkle the inside of the turkey lightly with salt .
Place the turkey on its back and salt the breasts , concentrating the salt in the center , where the meat is thickest .
You ’ll probably use a little more than a tablespoon .
It should look liberally seasoned , but not over - salted .
3 . Turn the turkey on one side and sprinkle the entire side with salt , concentrating on the thigh .
You should use a little less than a tablespoon .
Flip the turkey over and do the same with the opposite side .
4 . Place the turkey in a 2 1/2 - gallon sealable plastic bag , press out the air and seal tightly .
Place the turkey breast - side up in the refrigerator .
Chill for 3 days , turning it onto its breast for the last day .
5 . Remove the turkey from the bag .
There should be no salt visible on the surface and the skin should be moist but not wet .
Place the turkey breast - side up on a plate and refrigerate uncovered for at least 8 hours .
6 . On the day it is to be cooked , remove the turkey from the refrigerator and leave it at room temperature at least 1 hour .
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees .
7 . Place the turkey breast - side down on a roasting rack in a roasting pan ; put it in the oven .
After 30 minutes , remove the pan from the oven and carefully turn the turkey over so the breast is facing up ( it ’s easiest to do this by hand , using kitchen towels or oven mitts ) .
8 . Reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees , return the turkey to the oven and roast until a thermometer inserted in the deepest part of the thigh , but not touching the bone , reads 165 degrees , about 2 3/ 4 hours total roasting .
9 . Remove the turkey from the oven , transfer it to a warm platter or carving board ; tent loosely with foil .
Let stand at least 30 minutes to let the juices redistribute through the meat .
Carve and serve .

Dozens of families left homeless after a fire at a Burnsville apartment complex have an early Christmas present waiting for them — a $ 1 million donation .
An anonymous donor contributed the money today to a community fund set up by the Goodman Group , the Chaska - based firm that owns and manages the Burncliff Apartments .
The contribution averages more than $ 15,000 for each of the 64 households left homeless by Monday ’s blaze , which displaced between 180 and 190 people .
Details of how the money will be distributed have not yet been disclosed .
Jean Golden , a spokeswoman for the Goodman Group , said company chairman John Goodman set up a $ 50,000 fund at U.S. Bank after the fire .
A business executive contributed an additional $ 50,000 , and donations also began flooding U.S. Bank locations across the metro area .
The whopper came this afternoon .
Golden said the contribution already had been deposited with the bank and no one at the Goodman Group knows the identity of the donor .
The challenge now will be to locate the scores of displaced residents , some of whom may have left the state to stay with relatives .
“ We spent the majority of the day verifying and confirming that it was a legitimate gift , ” said Dan Peterka , president of the Goodman Group .
Cashier ’s checks will be distributed from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Wednesday at the Burncliff Apartments .
Residents should bring a driver ’s license or passport .
The complex at 12312 Parkwood Drive consists of two three - story buildings with 64 units each .
Residents of Building A , which was considered a total loss , are eligible for the funds .
At 2:30 p.m. Monday , residents began returning to the neighboring Building B , which was evacuated overnight as a precaution .
Minnesotans ’ holiday spirit was on full display elsewhere today as donations poured in at nearby Burnsville High School , where 29 fire victims from 16 different families spent Monday night in the gymnasium .
For Tammy Brynteson , life ca n’t get anything but better .
She lost everything but the clothes on her back .
“ But honestly , this has been great , ” Brynteson said of the piles of presents stacked on tables inside the high school .
“ We walked in the door and got toys for my grandkids . ”
Brynteson estimated she lost about $ 1,000 worth of gifts , but now her grandchildren will still have Christmas .
Carrie Nolan , director of communications and marketing for the Twin Cities chapter of the American Red Cross , said she was n’t sure how many would remain at the high school ’s shelter on tonight .
Others who were displaced but had found somewhere else to stay came to sift through the piles of donated clothing , diapers and toiletries as the school morphed into a service center .
The Red Cross also provided counseling to victims .
“ We ’re helping people deal with the aftermath of this horrible disaster , ” Nolan said .
Nearly 200 people were left homeless by the fire , but no one was injured .
More than 120 firefighters from six departments fought the blaze for six hours after it was reported about 4 p.m. Monday .
The apartment building , which was constructed in 1969 , did not have a sprinkler system .
The fire ’s cause had n’t been determined , but one resident said Monday night that there was smoke coming from an electrical box above a washer and dryer in a third - floor laundry room .
A history of fire inspections at the Burncliff Apartments was not available today .
For most victims gathered at Burnsville High School , losing their homes three days before Christmas was all but overwhelming .
Sharon Rhymes was on a bus coming home from Chicago , where she had just buried her mother , when a loved one called her to tell her about the fire .
A few days before her mother died , she had gotten some personal bad news .
“ In 10 days , I got diagnosed with cancer , I lost my mother , and I lost my home , ” Rhymes said through tears .
“ It ’s just terrible . ”
Rhymes is living with relatives until she finds a new place to live .
Frank French , the CEO of the Goodman Group , said his company is helping residents relocate into other area apartments .
About 20 of the 64 households in the fire - ravaged Building A had Section 8 vouchers , said Mark Ulfers , executive director of the Dakota County Community Development Agency .
Ulfers said his agency was offering lists of available apartments .
He said some local apartment owners had contacted the agency to say they had openings and would offer good rates to tenants who had been displaced .
French said his firm , which plans to rebuild Building A as soon as possible , was touched by the local support .
“ It ’s amazing , ” French said .
“ I ’m so proud of the community . ”
After Thanksgiving , 21 - year - old Janice Cotton wrapped her 1 - year - old daughter a doll and her 4 - year - old son a portable Nintendo video game system for the holidays .
On Monday , she watched the Christmas presents she had been hiding and everything else she owns disappear in flames .
“ Everything — we lost everything , ” she said .
Cotton was the first person displaced by the fire to stop by the Salvation Army ’s toy giveaway at the Rosemount Armory today .
Cotton , who has been staying with her godparents in Prior Lake , selected a doll and Legos for her kids .
Shortly after the fire , people , organizations and businesses flooded the Burnsville High School gym with donations , including food , car seats , diapers and gift certificates .
The high school girls basketball team was the first on the scene Monday night , said Ruth Dunn , spokeswoman for the Burnsville - Eagan - Savage School District .
The team was playing a game in the gym when the fire started .
Students sent text messages to each other asking for donations of toys and wrapping paper .
Students donated more than 500 toys within hours .
They stayed up until early this morning wrapping them .
The next day , the student council started a fund drive throughout the school .
By 10:30 a.m. , they had raised more than $ 5,000 .
Teachers canceled health and physical education classes today so families could use the gym and volunteers could collect donations .
Fire victim Rhonda
Hayes was waiting at the gym to return to her apartment .
She said she was touched by the outpouring of generosity .
“ The way the community came together , it ’s enough to make you cry , more than not having a place to stay , ” she said .
“ Now you know you can depend on the community .
We live in the right place . ”

In PGD , a cell is taken from an eight - cell embryo for testing A woman from London will give birth next week to the first British baby screened to be free of an altered gene which causes breast cancer .
Women in three generations of her husband 's family have been diagnosed with the disease in their 20s .
A girl born with the altered gene would have a 50 - 80 % chance of breast cancer - but screening can prevent this .
But one expert warned the technique would not be suitable for all couples with this disease in their family .
It will not be suitable for everyone who has experience of breast cancer in their family
Professor Peter Braude , Guy 's Hospital Pre-implantation genetic diagnosis ( PGD ) involves taking a cell from an embryo at the eight - cell stage of development , when it is around three - days old , and testing it .
Using PGD to ensure a baby does not carry an altered gene which would guarantee a baby would inherit a disease such as cystic fibrosis , is well - established .
But in 2006 , the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority said doctors could test for so - called susceptibility genes , such as BRCA1 .
Everybody carries a version of these genes - in fact a properly functioning BRCA1 protein helps stop cancer before it starts - but some particular variations of the genes greatly increase the risk of cancer .
Carrying the key BRCA1 mutation in this family 's case would have given up to an 80 % chance of developing breast cancer later in life .
BRCA1 and a related version of another gene , BRCA2 , account for around 5 % of breast cancers .
Many women who discover they have inherited one of the gene mutations choose to have a double mastectomy to remove their breasts .
' A new era '
In this case , the 27 - year - old woman and her husband , who are being treated by fertility expert Paul Serhal at University College Hospital London , do not yet know if they are having a girl or a boy .
The couple , who wish to remain anonymous , want to eradicate the gene flaw from their family .
The husband 's grandmother , mother , sister and a cousin have been diagnosed with the disease .
While a daughter could have been affected by breast cancer herself if she carried the altered gene , a son could have been a carrier and passed it on to any daughters .
This is an exciting new era
Paul Serhal Mr Serhal said : " The whole objective of this exercise is not just to make sure the child does n't have the gene , but to stop the transmission from generation to generation . "
He said it was " an exciting new era , " adding that it would be possible to screen for any mutated gene which had been linked to a specific cancer .
But he said that , in this case , not carrying an altered BRCA1 gene would not guarantee any daughter born to the couple would be unaffected by breast cancer because there are other genetic and environmental causes .
Dr Alan Thornhill , scientific director of the London Bridge Fertility , Gynaecology and Genetics Centre , said : " While the technology and approach used in this case is fairly routine , it is the first time in the UK that a family has successfully eliminated a mutant breast cancer gene for their child .
" It is a victory for both the parents and the HFEA that licensed this treatment .
' Not a cure ' But Professor Peter Braude , director of the Centre for PGD at Guy 's Hospital in London , said : " The decision as to whether PGD is appropriate for a couple will be made after a thorough discussion with knowledgeable genetic counsellors and clinical geneticists .
" It will not be suitable for everyone who has experience of breast cancer in their family , nor where the chances of the IVF needed for PGD has a low chance of succeeding . "
Dr Lesley Walker , of Cancer Research UK , said : " This is an exciting step forward in preventing this inherited form of breast cancer but very few people have sufficiently high risk genes to warrant this sort of intervention . "
Josephine Quintavalle , of the campaign group Comment on Reproductive Ethics said : " The most important thing is that people realise this is not a cure for breast cancer .
" In addition , we must not forget the embryos which were discarded because they did carry the gene .
" Moving to screening embryos for susceptibility genes , rather than inherited conditions , has broken through a barrier .
" What next ?
It is going further along the line which ultimately ends in designer babies . "

We 've all heard the old adage : never judge a book by its cover .
But judging it by its title ?
Hell yeah .
Can just those few words tell us whether a book is worth reading ?
Probably not .
Can they make us wonder if the author was batshit insane ?
Definitely .
Especially if it has a title like ...

( CNN ) -- Belgian police Thursday arrested a woman they called an " al Qaeda living legend " as part of an operation to thwart a terror attack being planned to coincide with an EU summit in Brussels , a Belgian police source told CNN .
Malika El - Aroud is the widow of one of the men who killed Afghan anti-Taliban leader Ahmad Shah Massoud .
Police seized 14 people , one of whom was planning to carry out a suicide attack in Belgium , the source said .
They had contacts at the " highest levels of al Qaeda , " the source said .
The police source said officers " had only 24 hours to act . "
The leaders of the European Union 's 27 member states are meeting in Brussels Thursday and Friday .
It is not clear that the heads of state and government themselves were the target of the planned attack .
The federal prosecutor 's office in Belgium identified one of the suspects as Malika El - Aroud , the widow of one of the men who assassinated a key opponent of the Taliban in Afghanistan two days before September 11 , 2001 .
El - Aroud 's late husband was one of two men who killed Ahmed Shah Massoud , a leader of the Northern Alliance , in a suicide mission ordered by Osama Bin Laden .
Belgian police aimed to prevent El - Aroud , whom the police source called an " al - Qaeda living legend , " from moving to Afghanistan to play a role in the fight against the coalition forces there , the source said .
She is thought to be a recruiter for the anti-Western network , rather than a fighter , the source said .
El - Aroud described the " love " she and her late husband felt for Osama bin Laden in a 2006 interview with CNN .
" Most Muslims love Osama .
It was he who helped the oppressed .
It was he who stood up against the biggest enemy in the world , the United States .
We love him for that , " she told CNN then .
Gazing into CNN 's cameras she said , " It 's the pinnacle in Islam to be the widow of a martyr .
For a woman it's extraordinary . "
" Most of those arrested " Thursday had Belgian passports , the police source said .
All 14 are of Moroccan descent .
Three of the suspects had traveled to the Afghanistan - Pakistan border region to participate in fighting or training camps , and were in contact with an unnamed suspect who had direct links to important al Qaeda figures , police said .
Two of those three returned to Belgium several months ago and started surveillance operations , and the third returned to Belgium a week ago , police said .
Intelligence showed that third person was ready to carry out a suicide attack , police said .
Information showed the suspect who was to carry out the attack had received the green light to execute the operation , police said .
Investigators noted the suspect had said goodbye to his family " because he wanted to go to paradise with a clear conscience , " police said .
Authorities also found a video meant for the suspect 's family , which police said was probably a farewell tape .
They did not find any explosives , the police said in a statement .
The 14 suspects were arrested after police carried out 16 search warrants in Brussels and one in the western Belgian city of Liege .
During those searches , police seized computer equipment and documents and the 14 people , including the three who traveled to Afghanistan and Pakistan and 11 others suspected of having given them logistical and material support .
Police said their investigation has been under way intensively since the end of 2007 .

Regardless of what is the cause of stress the degree in which stress affects us depends on how we think about it .
To manage stress effectively we need first to be able to manage our thoughts and the way of thinking .
Each situation and each event gets the value that we give them , and thus causing us suchstress , as we allow them to .
Each person things and reacts differently from all other people .
Also , the same person things and reacts for the same events differently at different times , depending on the circumstances .
What upset us is not the events themselves , but the perception we have for them .
If this perception changed , then it is possible to manage , change or reduce the degree of stress we feel .
A very good way to manage stress , is to examine whether the situation or the causes of stress are really so bad as we think , or they are only bad in our thoughts .
The steps below will help you manage your stress by first managing your thoughts .
Steps to manage Stress and your life
1. Defining the exact cause of the source of stress .
Find exactly what is that bothers you .
The stress you feel for something concrete is less than the stress you feel for something abstract .
Also , you can more easily find specific ways to address a certain problem when you know what exactly the problem is than trying to solve a problem that is abstract and un -defined .
2. Check and re-evaluate your thoughts .
After you identify what is causing you stress , it is useful to look at your thoughts about the source of stress and your connection with the source of stress , etc .
The reassessment of the situation may lead you to a more accurate assessment of the situation and to help locate thoughts that “ misrepresent ” reality .
Replacing these thoughts with other more adapted to reality or even more optimistic or positive will reduce the degree of stress you experienced .
3. Implementation of specific strategies for solving the problem .
Having isolated the problem , you should deal with the problem and resolve it so as not to become a permanent or recurring source of stress .
Different techniques can help each person to manage stress .
Apart from those described above , there are some other ideas that may be useful in a pressing and stressful situation .
1. Plan your time .
It is important to schedule your responsibilities and your actions both long term ( for the next few weeks or months ) and short ( for the next day or days ) .
You can manage this as follows :
Make a list of commitments and activities .
Assess their importance and the urgency .
Make a list of commitments and activities to be completed on the day , the next few days , the coming months .
Try to deal first with the more important and urgent matters .
Do not set unrealistic goals .
Do not put new things on the list unless it is necessary or when there is sufficient time .
Note any obligation or activity you have completed .
At the end of each day check what you have achieved and make the necessary corrections to the program of the next day .
DO NOT forget to arrange adequate time for fun and relaxation .
Try to be flexible in planning and create a flexible schedule .
Make the changes needed , when needed
2. Engage with pleasant activities .
The physical exercise , dealing with a pleasant activity or having free time can significantly help in managing stress .
The exercise , walking , dancing , swimming and hobbies relieve the tension and prevent negative consequences , such as health problems .
Although competitive sports are good , try not to bother with any competitive sport or hobby , and do not deal in a competitive manner .
There are also benefits from exercise and from being more ‘ active ’ in our daily lives : for example , you can walk to work and not drive .
Use the stairs rather than the lift , do some light exercise at home .
3 . Make sure that there is free time in your daily schedule .
Actual leisure is the one in which you do not have to do anything .
Sit somewhere comfortable and listen to music and do not do anything .
4 . Try sleeping as much as you need .
The application of the relaxation methods presented above , light exercise or a walk can help you sleep better .
Also , try to keep a stable sleep schedule .
Sleep and wake up the same hours every day .
Stress and sleep are strongly bound together .
Lack of sleep can cause stress and stress can be the cause for lack of sleep .
5 . The dietary habits play an important role in our health and stress management .
Our food and diet should be balanced : you should not eat much or too little , but you should eat as much food as your body needs .
Your diet should be balanced in vitamins , protein , carbohydrate and other nutrients .
Do not rely your nutrition on fast food or sweets .
Try a variety of flavours and food types .
Managing stress with food is about consuming those foods that can give your body those ingredients and energy to cope with the daily life obligations that are the major causes of stress .
6 . An escape from the daily routine may prove beneficial .
Try to organise a trip for the weekend or a day trip every now and then .
Just for a while escape from your office , your work , the library , the kitchen , your home .
Forget for a moment the obligations and problems and try to relax .
7 . Talk to someone you trust , love , or feel comfortable with .
Go out with your friends for a coffee and talk about what concerns you .
You may struggle to achieve this , but the relief you will feel will surprise you .
In addition , you may hear a proposal or solution they have to offer that may be useful to you .
Do not hesitate to ask for help when you need it .
Ask what others would do if faced with the problem that you have .
It is likely that they will give you good ideas .
8 . Surely you had problems , difficulties and stress in the past .
Refer to these cases and try to remember what helped you that time to overcome the difficult moments .
It is likely that you will also find it useful now .
9 . Alcohol , drugs and smoking when used for a long time is not a good solution for dealing and managing with stress .
The problems are not resolved by forgetting them .
On the contrary they persist and cause additional stress and extra difficulties .
Alcohol , drugs or smoking do not really help but cause serious problems .
Do not rely on them to fight stress .
10 .
Get help from professionals .
If you have tried everything we described in this article , or other techniques and you feel that they have not helped you substantially , or if you feel that you are experiencing much stress and you do not have the strength to manage it or if you feel tired and depressed then do not hesitate to ask the help of experts .
To do something , however small , to manage your stress is incomparably better than not do anything at all !

Audio of the KCDZ - FM news report
As we reported yesterday , the Marine Corps Air and Ground Combat Center has dispatched uniformed and presumably armed ( we have no confirmation of the latter ) soldiers to assist the California Highway Patrol ( CHP ) in the operation of unconstitutional sobriety checkpoints in San Bernardino County , California , the largest county in California and the country ( San Bernardino County is directly east of Los Angeles ) .
On the Alex Jones Show today , Gary Daigneault , News Director at KCDZ-FM based in Joshua Tree , California , said the California Highway Patrol was less than forthcoming with their plan to team up with the military police , a direct violation of the Posse Comitatus Act preventing the military from performing civilian law enforcement duties .
Press releases faxed to KCDZ - FM .
Click to see a larger image .
After running an editorial last week reminding the Marines stationed at the Marine Corps Air and Ground Combat Center of the illegality of such an operation , the California Highway Patrol sent the radio station a fax indicating that the action would not include military police ( see faxes at right ) .
As a KCDZ - FM news report broadcast today points out , by law — to avoid entrapment — the California Highway Patrol is required to provide the location of its checkpoints to the media at least two hours prior .
Although the CHP did provide the radio station with a telephone number to get this information , when the number was called there was no answer .
Moreover , “ to add insult to injury , ” Marine Corps military police , in uniform and in marked military police cars , were indeed teamed up with CHP outside of a Home Depot in the town of Yucca Valley .
After examining the documents faxed to KCDZ - FM , it becomes obvious that the CHP in Joshua Tree deliberately released disinformation to the media designed to cover its participation with the Marines , as noted a direct violation of Posse Comitatus .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The first CHP News release dated December 10 indicated the police planned to work with the Marines , while a second press release dated December 12 , after KCDZ -FM aired a critical news editorial , had this reference removed .
Both documents include a note indicating the media would be able to contact the Barstow Dispatch Center on December 12 to receive location information required by law .
As noted above , calls to the number provided went unanswered .
As Alex mentioned on his show today , the Marines are well aware of Infowars coverage of the story and made reference not only Alex by name but Infowars staff members Aaron Dykes and Kurt Nimmo as well .
It should be obvious the Marines and the California Highway Patrol are engaged in a disinformation campaign against the media in order to cover up their illegal and unconstitutional behavior .
Not only do they want to entrap the residents of San Bernardino County in their “ sobriety / driver license checkpoint ” in violation of the Fourth Amendment protecting the people against unreasonable searches and seizures , they also want to send a message that the military will henceforth be involved in domestic law enforcement in direct violation of Posse Comitatus .

Let ’s start out with my in - the - moment string of notes during the Press Preview at this year ’s NAIAS ( Detroit Auto Show ) .
This covers the main ideas about this year ’s program at the time .
I ’ll add a few more comments and expanded thoughts at the end .
Not sure if it ’s an actual color trend , but there ’s a lot of orange at this year ’s # NAIAS # NAIAS2018
Attendance seems down and space more open at # NAIAS2018 .
Things just seem off this year .
First thought it was decline of auto industry .
There ’s been gap - filling of various kinds over the last few years , suppliers and related fields , but not the vacant corridors this year .
The concept of automotive ownership may be starting to decline , but it ’s not to that level yet .
More media info is being released directly from the companies ’ media sites directly – cheaper and easier than preparing press kits .
The political environment ca n’t help .
I do n’t have # NAIAS info , but my personal impression is that foreign journalist turnout seems low .
Even the “ rides ” are empty .
Maybe journalists are all jaded , and these will fill during the public show .
But lotsa folks standing around .
There ’s a hominess to a number of the displays .
Wood flooring , even on the turntables .
And a giant cozy shadowbox wall display .
Maybe fewer booth babes ( of the stand next to the car on the turntable variety ) at # NAIAS2018 Do n’t know about public show in comparison .
Pretty sure this display was also at #naias2017 so there ’s some recycling going on , even if - green - is no longer part of the program .
Again , I do n’t have specific numbers , but there seem to be fewer cars per display .
There ’s a subduedness , even in all the flash &bombast
Outrageous seems to be the antithesis of # NAIAS2018
There ’s too much of it in the world already , and adding to it wo n’t go far .
They get it .
Not sure if # NAIAS is relevant to @ecogeek anymore .
Transport is an important element in a greener world , but carmakers have moved on .
It was n’t the first thing that occurred to me , but gradually , I had the growing sense that this was not nearly as full of a show as previous years .
There are several things that could be causing that , and it ’s likely some combination of all of those factors .
( And I could be completely wrong , the numbers might be different , but it ’s my sense of what I observed this year . )
I ’m fairly certain that foreign coverage was down from previous years .
The increased travel difficulties ( getting a visa at all , let alone a working visa ) mean fewer reporters .
A few years ago , I recall the big , welcoming banner in the giant media room with flags of many nationalities .
In 2011 , I wrote elsewhere : “ The polyglot nature of the show is reinforced both by the numbers of national flags hanging from the ceiling overhead as well as the languages one overhears walking through the room . ”
There was none of that in 2018 .
The cost of travel could be another factor .
With the big automakers increasingly running their own media , the handouts and press kits are in decline .
Now , all a writer needs to do to get lots of press releases and images is go to the media website of the company ( media.carcompany.com or some such ) and download all the information they need .
No travel and dealing with Michigan winter required .
Could it be that ownership of automobiles is beginning to decline , and with it a waning interest in cars in general ?
I ’m not sure that we are quite at that point yet , but there could be an overall fading of interest in cars , and a matching reduction in the amount of coverage that media outlets are willing to provide for it .
Even the local TV and radio stations , that have had a notable presence at recent years ’ shows were less present this year .
There were cars to be seen , of course , but very much a less compelling show , especially for an EcoGeek .
Sure , there are still electric vehicles as part of the mix , and some ongoing forward steps from a couple of the companies that seem to be doing some things toward being greener .
But , at the end of the day , not a strong show , and not one with much in the way of green news at all .
After a week of controversy over the potential cost to taxpayers , Los Angeles County supervisors voted Tuesday to send 112 sheriff ’s deputies -- a fraction of the personnel initially proposed -- across the country next month to aid in the presidential inauguration .
The narrow approval , although for far fewer than the 500 deputies first requested by Sheriff Lee Baca on behalf of the Washington , D.C. , police , will still make the L.A.
County department one of the largest contingents helping with crowd control and other duties at what are expected to be high - turnout festivities surrounding President - elect Barack Obama ’s swearing in .
Supervisors Mike Antonovich , Don Knabe and Zev Yaroslavsky had complained that the trip would deprive county residents of law enforcement protection and cause unnecessary expense to local taxpayers .
A letter sent by Baca to the board last week estimated the cost of sending about 347 deputies -- already fewer than the number first proposed -- to Washington at about $ 1.6 million , with as much as $ 1 million in salary and other expenses to be paid by the county .
Advertisement
Knabe brokered a compromise to send about a third that many deputies , with the assurance that the trip would be fully reimbursed by Washington ’s police department .
The one exception is the cost of the deputies ’ employee benefits during the four days they will be in the nation ’s capital .
Supervisors Antonovich and Gloria Molina joined him to support the deal .
Yaroslavsky opposed sending any deputies , and Supervisor Mark Ridley - Thomas abstained after failing to gain support for his compromise proposal to send 250 deputies .
“ I think that we could and should have done better than this , ” Ridley - Thomas said .
“ We will be making many requests of the Obama administration , and it is important to get off on the right foot .
. . .
We need to be smart about change . ”
Ninety - six agencies are sending 4,000 officers for inauguration events , according to a District of Columbia police spokeswoman .
Advertisement
Some agencies have opted out .
The New York Police Department decided in 2004 that sending officers would open the agency to unwanted liability .
So , it was not asked to help .

Un-fucking - believable .
I 'm floored by this footage .
Ellen , I 'm so happy you got this on film and posted -- it 's even MORE outrageous than I ever could 've imagined .
Telling you to stay calm and then CUFFING YOU with NO WARNING ?
Did they even read you your rights ?
My abject disgust with Snipes and her skeevy Broward Co. election officials / puppet - poondog police is counter - weighted by my tremendous pride in your actions and demeanor under these outrageous circumstances .
Shame on them .
This video is so important .
You have total proof now , Hero mine , of this belligerent abuse of power in the face of citizen observation .
I hope you can use it to SUE THE PANTS OFF THOSE Broward Mo Fo's .

Ellen was visiting a public building to observe a meeting which is required to be open to the public under Florida law .
It ’s also required to be open under the First Amendment ’s freedom of the press , but there ’s no need to go that deep into those quaint old Constitutional rights .
Since Ellen ’s visit was authorized by law , she could not have been trespassing , and it is obvious that she was not disorderly .
So , could anyone have legally ordered her to stay away from these premises ?
Well , Florida Statute defines trespassing in a structure or conveyance .
Ellen was charged with this even though it appeared that she was not allowed to enter the building .
Under Florida Statutes § 810.08 , only an owner or lessee has authority to ask Ellen to leave the premises , and a police officer is not authorized to arrest someone for trespassing unless he has received written authorization from an owner or lessee .
Does n’t the public own public buildings or do the fascist clowns who work in them own them ?
Also , there is no provision for a judge to order someone not to enter a public building , but if a legal action had been brought by the Supervisor ’s office , then a judge could have issued an injunction if the Supervisor could have proven that Ellen was disruptive or threatening .
However , a judge sitting on the canvassing board has no power to enter any injunction at a canvassing board meeting , and as Ellen mentioned , she was not served with anything so no such order was entered unless it was entered without any semblance of due process .
You know , that quaint old notice and an opportunity to be heard thing .
However , since our government is out of control , these fascist clowns decided to treat Ellen like far too many people who question authority are treated by fascist regimes where the people have no rights .
They jailed her without any legal authority and under false pretenses .
That is a crime , but curiously , the fascist clown who plays the prosecuting prince has not dropped the charges against Ellen and has also failed to bring charges against the police officer who acted under color of law without any legal authority , other than a gun , and violated Ellen ’s rights as requested by Snipes and her deputy Bellis .
Oh , that ’s a felony violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 241 and 242 .
Let ’s see how that plays out .
Probably a lot like when Ann Coulter was caught committing voter fraud , the prosecuting prince let her get away with it .
So , these fascist clowns commit felonies to get rid of an opponent up who is asking questions .
Imagine what may have happened if someone had proven that the elections were stolen .
Oh , you do n’t have to imagine , just watch “ Justice ” in Florida ’s Supreme Court !?!
and do n’t miss the documents at the links below the video .
Also , see Fascism in Fantasyland for another example of how an election reform advocate was treated , and note that these clowns were much more professional .
Of course , they do work at Disney .
If you ’re wondering whether our Nation ’s Founders would have put a system together that allowed criminal acts committed by those in power , and those connected to them , to go unpunished , then check out the speeches by Patrick Henry and me at the Florida reform leader rally this past weekend and do n’t miss the links below the video .

was this just about bank of america flexing their muscles ?
or was it that gov b has fought for health care for every child in illinois even after bush sued him for it this looks like more bs from the not so just department to influence who is in charge patrick fitzgerald gave cheney a warning about the presidental records act and keeping his

My first though was , damn what the hell you got to do to poll watch show up with the armed forces ?
Yeah Anger .
Okay , let the anger go ...
How can the public provide oversight of an unbroken chain of custody when clearly the cops are either corrupt or ignorant of election laws ?
Kind of looked like she got arrested on hearsay to me .
But then that was only a small part of video .
Seems the only way to validate that would be having multiple video cameras running 24/7 on the entire place .
A tripod or two would have been nice in this situation also .
She needs more than one friend I think .
Perhaps several camera people , enough that such a choreograph is not allowed .
For example 1 , at the second cop car , there was no camera listening in .
Example 2 , the guy in the white shirt dialing that phone , could have been listened to and asked questions .
So who were the twenty five witness's ?
Did they all testify ?
Or is this one of those adept public figure successfully making a local terrorist out of a citizen who ain't doing nothing wrong .
...
What 's with that cop , not wanting to be on camera ?
That sounds like intimidation to me .
I would have pointed that camera wherever I want .
Is there a reason why the camera can't be pointed at him ?
Florida Law ?
I wo n't say face .
Because it was n't pointed exactly at his face .
Anyway , corruption sucks .
What can you do , other than have cops higher up than the sheriff and cronies available ?
There has to be election cops .
I been saying that , saying that , saying that .
Street cops are not trained for elections .
The white female cop looked like she was on meth .
Chewing , grinding those teeth .
She did n't listen at all , just dictated .
She did n't seem to have a problem with the camera .
Why did the camera go off ?
Where 's the friend ?
Keep taping .
Keep listening .
Keep asking questions .
What was she arrested for ?
Get that on tape .
What a cluster - F of nonsense .
From every angle .
If there were people near the ballots at that time , and no poll watchers , I would have to judge that that election be nullified completely as the chain of custody completely compromised by local law enforcement .
Why is the building unlocked without public oversight ?
Why is Bellis there in the first place ?
What did he say on the phone ?
Who was he calling ?
Why did n't someone accuse Bellis of false arrest at the time ?
And have him arrested also ?
Who were all those people going in and out unchecked ?
What 's the plan to fix this this time ?
What 's the plan to stop this next time ?
I guess well never know .
Maybe we should bring our troops home and use them for poll workers and poll watchers ?
No need for the Sheriff of Huddersfield to put down his baked beans and wrench his ass out of bed with a crane .. and go hassle the local citizens .

Ellen was arrested for BATA : Bad Attitude Towards Authority .
Asking questions or attempting to observe what they 're doing is disrespect .
Bellis said it straight out --- she was rude .
When the public is allowed to enter the halls of royalty , we 're supposed to bow , curtsy , and kiss their robes .
Kudos to Mark Adams and colleagues for waking people up .
I do hope Ellen Brodsky can successfully sue them , but of course even if the judge is n't corrupt , such cases take years .
Justice delayed is justice denied , as the saying goes , and the purpose of the justice system is to delay justice .
If they 're required to post a notice to the public , they can be sued for that also , since no correction was posted .
Just remember that you 're suing them in their courts .
When Robert Hillary King , the first member of the Angola 3 to be freed after 31 years in prison for a crime he did n't commit , 29 of those years in solitary confinement , is asked how he retained his sanity , he says that he was in maximum custody but that we on the outside are n't really free , we 're just in minimum custody .
He 's right .
But minimum custody is so comfortable that we do n't notice that we 're in custody until we try to challenge the system .
That 's when retaliation kicks in , and it goes from smears , to threats , to arrests , all the way to actual custody .
As long as we 're working , shopping , or watching TV and not challenging authority , we think we 're free .

This video does not provide enough information to judge whether or not Ms. Brodsky was treated fairly .
Based on other videos of election observers getting in trouble , it seems that an election observer can only observe — they cannot ask questions , they cannot challenge what is going on , they cannot say or do anything to slow down the vote - counting process .
They can only watch .
It ’s quite possible , based on what Ms. Brodsky herself says , that she has exceeded the role of observer .
She says that she wanted to ask questions at a Canvassing Board meeting .
Well , perhaps questions are not allowed at such meetings , or she asked them at the wrong time .
Her insistence on asking questions could constitute a disruption , justifying her removal and / or arrest .
Do n’t believe everyone who cries foul .
Not every gadfly knows what they are doing .
Private citizens are not always aware of the rules and procedures governing elections .
And certain liberal blogs do not bother to tell you both sides of the story .

John P. Garry wrote : " Well , perhaps questions are not allowed at such meetings , or she asked them at the wrong time . "
On the date in question , Mrs. Brodsky was told she could ask a question of the canvassing board , and waited an hour and a half to do so -- respectfully .
" Based on other videos of election observers getting in trouble , it seems that an election observer can only observe — they cannot ask questions , they cannot challenge what is going on , they cannot say or do anything to slow down the vote - counting process .

Maybe so .
But she was n't even allowed to WATCH .
That 's the point , here .
Public building , public process , mandated as such by the Florida Sunshine Laws -- and she was barred from doing so .
And not just on the date this video was filmed -- she was also harassed by Snipes and crew as an official designated observer during the Aug. 29th primary .
The reason she was given for her transgression ?
Her crime ?
STANDING UP .
If you do n't think this video is enough to prove whether or not Ellen Brodsky was treated " fairly " , if you read the excellent comment above from MBA Mark Adams detailing the legal transgressions against her on the part of the county , and if this video does n't scare the bejeezus out of you / disgust you as an America citizen and voter , then you do n't get it or you do n't care to .

Exactly who or what was Ellen Brodsky " STANDING UP " to ?
It is n't clear to me .
Needlessly pestering authority figures and being pumped up with self - importance is not the same as standing up to injustice .
You have n't provided any new information .
Okay , so she asked a question " respectfully . "
Did she do anything else ?
There are good reasons why someone might not be allowed to watch a vote count .
If they are disruptive , they can be removed .
I do n't find Mr. Adams analysis persuasive in the least .
Again , there are plenty of reasons why someone could be removed or barred from an open public meeting .
The right to attend a public meeting is not absolute .
What disgusts me is the knee - jerk paranoia and ideological rigidity of the politically motivated -- whether of the right or left .
What scares the bejeezus out of me is how easily manipulated and " outraged " people are .

John P. Garry seems to think it is perfectly okay for elections officials to violate the law and abuse the public .
Yes , it was the public , not just Ellen Brodsky who was treated unfairly in violation of the law .
The reason the notice of the public meeting was posted was to comply with the law .
If there was a change , which they claim that there was , that should have been posted , and it obviously was not .
If there was no change , then they were lying , and if they'd lie to the public about when a meeting is , why would n't they lie to the public about election results ?
There are laws that people whose salaries are paid by the public are required to obey , and the Canvassing Board was in violation of the law .
They 're the ones who should have been arrested .

She was standing up for you , even with your fascist leanings , and she was standing up for our democracy .

John P. Garry , try reading something before you jump in to claim that you know what you are talking about .
I included the link to the statute that the fascist clowns claim that Ellen was violating , and I explain that under the statute they had no authority to even give Ellen an order to leave the premises .
Furthermore , the video shows that Ellen was not being disorderly .
She was simply asking to enter a public building for a public meeting .
If you do n't understand that the law has been violated by these public officials and " law " enforcement officers , then either you are mentally challenged or a flack working to cover up their crimes .
Either way , it 's always funny to hear some Bushie clown claim that the law is not the law or that it dose n't apply to government agents .

A question that should be answered before the next election , in the " Video The Vote " spirit .
( Poorly executed in my opinion ) is ...
IN EACH STATE WHAT ARE THE LAWS FOR MAKING VIDEO ?
WHAT ABOUT VIDEO OF LAW ENFORCEMENT ? ( e.g .
If I would have sparked up my camera last time I voted , in the polling place .
I would have been potentially arrested in California ) ( e.g .
If the camera person kept that camera on the cop in Florida was that constitutional ?
Legal ? )
Now there 's exceptions and reasons to allow video , and reasons for not .
But even though my intent was n't to disrupt the voting process , or intimidate voters , there need to be clearly defined answers .
On the other hand an unbroken chain of custody can not be maintained .
When camera 's are forced off .
Those answers are not clearly defined for each state .
If videothevote want 's to have us video the vote then the answers must be easily accessible , not buried in some hidden PDF on some government website with a broken search engine .
PLAIN 12th GRADE ENGLISH .
And finally why do n't poll watchers have authority ?
What needs to happen for that to be , more powerful than some official with an agenda .

John P. Gerry said foolishly : Do n’t believe everyone who cries foul .
Not every gadfly knows what they are doing .
Private citizens are not always aware of the rules and procedures governing elections .
Perhaps .
But Brodsky certainly is aware of such " rules and procedures " and has followed them .
Her first instance of trying to ask a question , on a completely different day , was documented in our original coverage , which , it appears , you were too lazy or disinterested in transparent , accurate elections in which the citizenry ( of all parties ) can have confidence in , to actually bother to read .
If she had done something on that day to deserve arrest , then why was n't she arrested ?
Clearly , as the video shows , she did nothing on this day to deserve arrest , as even the female cop on the scene ( before the arresting officer , C.Y .
Bell showed up with cuffs ) admits on camera just seconds before Brodsky is cuffed .
And certain liberal blogs do not bother to tell you both sides of the story .
If the " other side of the story " is the one that you tell , then I 'm glad we did n't bother , since clearly , you 're pulling shit out of your ass , including the old " liberal blog " nonsense .
That Snipes is a supposed " Democrat " means nothing to ya , I guess .
Yeesh .
You have n't provided any new information .
Okay , so she asked a question " respectfully . "
Did she do anything else ?
There are good reasons why someone might not be allowed to watch a vote count .
If they are disruptive , they can be removed .
Right .
But that 's not what the video documents .
It documents Brodsky 's arrest , for having done nothing at all .
That you 're willing to be an apologist for such behavior would suggest you do n't give a damn about the need for clean elections in a democracy , the rule of law , or the abuse thereof .
Thankfully , folks like Brodsky are down there to fight for you anyway .
On her behalf , you 're welcome .

So Jeb bush appointed a reprobate and you wonder why ?
Nothing anyone named Bush has done has been right or honorable ever !
Jeb Bush another scion of a failed dynasty .
Phew , give me some air .

SEA & FSIJ 合同フォーラムでビット演算による最適化の妙味とJIT アセンブラの中でデモに使ったVMを紹介します．
JIT の紹介のために前日に2時間ででっちあげたVMなので本当に小さい(200行程度)ですが，エッセンスは楽しめるかなと思います．
ソースはXbyak.zipです．この中のxbyak/sample/toyvm.cppが今回作ったVMです( Win , Linuxと多 分Intel Macでも動きます ) ．
このサンプルはフィボナッチ数列を計算して表示するだけのものです．
ここではどのように作ったかの説明をします．一つ前のエントリの資料も参考にしてください．
話の流れ
高性能なVMを作りたいかもしれませんが，そこは本質ではないのでざくっと簡単なものを考えます．スタックベースかレジスタベースかなどの議論もあるのでしょうが，なんとなくレジスタベースにしました．スタックはばっさり捨てました．また命令長を4byte固定にすることで実行部が簡単になります．またその結果必然的に即値は32bit未満となり，四つ目の条件をつけました．
命令群は次のものを用意しました．
メモリとレジスタの間の転送命令と加算，減算命令にレジスタの内容を出力する命令と，分岐命令だけです．
スタックが無いのでcall/retもありません．興味があれば自分で作ってみるのもよいかもしれません．
命令は4byteのうち先頭1byteに命令種別(code ) ，次の1byteにレジスタ種別(r ) ，最後の2byteに即値( imm)を入れることにします．
使われない場合は全て0にします．( code , r , imm ) のペアと4byteデータの変換方法は次のようにします．簡単ですね．
アセンブラを作るといっても，外部ファイルに書いたものを読み込んでパースして，というのはまた大変なのでCの関数として作って関数を呼び出すことがアセンブルすること，としました．そうすると，パーサをざっくりCコンパイラに任せられるので極めて簡単になります．上で定義したencode()を呼び出す関数を作れば終わりです．
void run ( ) { uint32 reg [ 2 ] = { 0 , 0 } ; // A , B const uint32 end = code_.size ( ) ; uint32 pc = 0 ; for ( ; ; ) { uint32 code , r , imm ; decode ( code , r , imm , code_ [ pc ] ) ; switch ( code ) { ... } pc++ ; if ( pc >= end ) break ; } // for ( ; ; ) }
基本構造は上記のようになります．
pc(プログラムカウンタ)
を0から順に増やしつつ，4byteずつcode_からデータを読みます．
読んだデータをdecode ( ) でパラメータに分解し，codeに従って各命令を実行させるswitch文に突入します．
そのあとpcを一つ増やして繰り返します．
switch文の中身は各命令に対して実際行う処理を書きます．
switch ( code ) { case LDI : reg[r ] = imm ; break ; case LD : reg[ r ] = mem_[imm ] ; break ; case ST : mem_[imm ] = reg[r ] ; break ; case ADD : reg[r ] += mem_[imm ] ; break ; case ADDI : reg[r ] += imm ; break ; case SUB : reg[r ] -= mem_[imm ] ; break ; case SUBI : reg[r ] -= imm ; break ; case PUT : printf ( " %c %8d( 0x%08 x )
" , ' A ' + r , reg[r ] , reg[r ] ) ; break ; case JNZ : if ( reg[r ] != 0 ) pc += static_cast < signed short >( imm ) ; break ; default : assert ( 0 ) ; break ; }
とくに難しいところは無いでしょう．これでVM自体は完成です．なんと簡単．
4. toyVM用のフィボナッチ数列プログラムを作って実行する
フィボナッチと言えばちまたではやる再帰ですが，このVMにはスタックが無いのでそんなことはやってられません(苦笑 ) ．
#一応メモリはあるので，このスタックを実装することは可能かもしれませんが…．
素直にループで書きます．for ( ) を使うと分かりにくくなるのでgotoを使います．
まずCで書いてみましょう．
void fibC ( uint32 n ) { uint32 p , c , t ; p = 1 ; c = 1 ; lp : t = c ; c += p ; p = t ; n--; if ( n != 0 ) goto lp ; printf ( " c=%d ( 0x%08 x )
" , c , c ) ; }
このコードが正しく動作することを確認したら，これをtoyVMのアセンブリ言語で書きます．
その前に変数をどう扱うかを決めておく必要があります．
toyVMにレジスタは二つありますが，両方をフィボナッチで使う変数に割り当てると困るのでとりあえずcをAレジスタに割り当てることにします．
Bはテンポラリに残しておきましょう．
あと，fibCにはp , t , nという変数があるのでこれらはtoyVMのメモリ上に置くことにします．
ここではmem [ 0 ] : p , mem [ 1 ] : t , me m [ 2 ] : nとしました．
ではfibCのアセンブリ言語版を書きます．
Fib ( int n ) { vldi( A , 1 ) ; // c = 1 vst ( A , 0 ) ; // p = 1 vldi( B , n ) ; vst ( B , 2 ) ; // n // lp vst ( A , 1 ) ; // t = c vadd ( A , 0 ) ; // c += p vld( B , 1 ) ; // mem [ 1 ] の値を Bを経由してmem [ 2 ] に移動する vst( B , 0 ) ; // p = t vld ( B , 2 ) ; vsubi( B , 1 ) ; vst ( B , 2 ) ; // n-- vjnz( B , - 8 ) ; // PCを8減らせばlpのところにもどる． vput( A ) ; }
ちょっと分かりにくいかもしれませんが，1行ずつfibCと比べれば同じ処理をしようとしていることがわかるでしょう．
実行してみます ．
Fib fib ( 10 ) ; fib.run ( ) ; >A 144(0x00000090 )
正しく動作しているようです．
5. toyVMのマシン語をx86に変換するリコンパイラを作る
void recompile ( ) { push ( ebx ) ; push ( esi ) ; push ( edi ) ; const Reg32 reg [ 2 ] = { esi , edi } ; const Reg32 mem( ebx ) ; xor ( reg [ 0 ] , reg [ 0 ] ) ; xor ( reg [ 1 ] , reg [ 1 ] ) ; mov(mem , ( int ) mem_ ) ; const uint32 end = code_.size ( ) ; uint32 pc = 0 ; uint32 labelNum = 0 ; for ( ; ; ) { uint32 code , r , imm ; decode ( code , r , imm , code_[ pc ] ) ; L( toStr(labelNum ++ ) ) ; switch ( code ) { ... pc++ ; if ( pc >= end ) break ; } // for ( ; ; ) pop( edi ) ; pop( esi ) ; pop( ebx ) ; ret ( ) ;
違うのはx86用のコードを生成させるところです．と言っても見た目はそれほど変わりません．
switch ( code ) { case LDI : mov( reg[r ] , imm ) ; break ; case LD : mov( reg[r ] , ptr[mem + imm * 4 ] ) ; break ; case ST : mov( ptr [ mem + imm * 4 ] , reg[r ] ) ; break ; case ADD : add ( reg[r ] , ptr [ mem + imm * 4 ] ) ; break ; case ADDI : add ( reg[r ] , imm ) ; break ; case SUB : sub( reg[r ] , ptr [ mem + imm * 4 ] ) ; break ; case SUBI : sub( reg[r ] , imm ) ; break ;
概ねrun ( ) と一対一に対応していることがわかるでしょう．分岐のみちょっと変わったことをする必要があります．
toyVMでは命令長が4byte固定だったので命令数だけポインタを減らせば分岐ができたのですが，x86ではそうではありません．
ここでは簡単にすませるために，一命令毎に数値のラベルを生成させて，そのラベルへ分岐するようにしました．
L( toStr(labelNum ++ ) ) ; switch ( code ) { ... case JNZ : test ( reg[r ] , reg[r ] ) ; jnz ( toStr(labelNum + static_cast < signed short >( imm ) ) ) ; break ;
以下は実行時にrecompile ( ) して得たx86のコードです．
.lp : mov dword ptr [ ebx +4 ] , esi add esi , dword ptr [ ebx ] mov edi , dword ptr [ ebx + 4 ] mov dword ptr [ ebx ] , edi mov edi , dword ptr [ ebx + 8 ] sub edi, 1 mov dword ptr [ ebx +8 ] , edi test edi , edi jne .lp
問題なさそうです ．
6. パフォーマンスを見る
n = 10000 のときにかかった時間を測定しました．マシン はCore2Duo 2.6GHz + Visual Studio 2005 です．
通常VM JIT native C( fibC ) 1216 K 136 K 84 K
通常のVMではnative Cに比べて10倍以上遅かったのが一気に肩を並べる速度にまで向上しました．
これは通常のVMでの本質である，switch + jmpがパイプラインを乱すため最近のCPUではコストが大きいためです．
ネイティブなコードへの変換が如何に重要であるかがわかります．
注意:gcc 4.3.0でfibCをコンパイルするともっとよいコードが生成されていました．その場合は上記よりもnative Cが何割か性能がよくなります．
7. リコンパイラを改良する
そのためのレジスタをeax , ecx , edxとしました．それらを初期化するコードを追加します．
const Reg32 memTbl[ ] = { eax , ecx , edx } ; const size_t memTblNum = NUM_OF_ARRAY ( memTbl ) ; for ( size_t i = 0 ; i < memTblNum ; i++) xor ( memTbl[i ] , memTbl [ i ] ) ;
そしてrecompileでメモリにアクセスする部分を変更します．
case ADD : if ( imm < memTblNum ) { // add ( reg[r ] , memTbl[imm ] ) ; // 追加部分 } else { // add ( reg[r ] , ptr [ mem + imm * 4 ] ) ; } break ;
.lp : mov ecx , esi add esi , eax mov edi , ecx mov eax , edi mov edi , edx sub edi, 1 mov edx , edi test edi , edi jne .lp
すっきりしました ．
ベンチマークをとってみます．
通常VM JIT 改良 版JIT native C( fibC ) 1216 K 136 K 101K 84 K
3割ほど速度が向上しました．
このサンプルを基にいろいろVMをいじってみるのも面白いかと思います．

CHAMPAIGN , Ill . --
University of Illinois linebacker Martez Wilson has left the hospital where he had surgery for two stab wounds .
Illinois sports information director Kent Brown says the 19 - year - old Wilson left the hospital in Urbana on Tuesday and is expected to recover from the injuries .
The sophomore from Chicago was hurt early Friday during a fight at a Champaign bar near the Illinois campus .
Brown says Wilson was helping friend and former teammate D'Angelo McCray , who transferred from Illinois to Eastern Illinois this year .
Police have said the stabbing happened after a group of men surrounded another man at the bar .
No one has been arrested .
Illinois coach Ron Zook has said he was proud of Wilson for helping a friend in trouble .
Callie Rogers who won the U.K lottery at the age of 16 and is the second youngest to win it , got arrested after police raided the property and found thousands of pounds worth of cocaine and a stun gun .
It has been five years since she has won the total amount of 1,875,000 pounds .
Her life twisted from one drama to another since she won the 2 Million Pound worth lottery .
The twist in the drama came when her new partner , Mr. Ryan Thompson admitted that he was using Ms. Rogers house for dealing cocaine .
The pair was arrested right after her boyfriend admitted in dealing with cocaine .
They were arrested from Ms. Rogers house in Whitehaven , Cumbria which she had bought from her winning .
She was later released after being put behind the bars as no charges were imposed on her but her boyfriend Ryan Thompson could be facing jail after confessing to dealing drugs .
Later , before the town 's magistrate court she admitted possessing and supplying cocaine and possessing a gun .
The police officers who raided the house found four bags of cocaine , which contained two and a half ounces of the drug .
They also found a digital weighing machine , a black book containing names and addresses of debtors and lot of unused plastic bags .
Since winning the lottery , she has posed topless after having her breasts enlarged , repeatedly broken up with another criminal lover who slept with her younger sister and has been accused of a drunken brawl outside a nightclub .
She is now 21 and has two children .
Most sincere and mindful people would not dispute that the use of psychedelics can , under certain circumstances , have positive outcomes .
Psychedelics , after all , have played a crucial role in human culture for millennia and continue to be a part of many cultures , even today .
The recreational use of LSD and other mind altering substances during the psychedelic sixties is one of the main factors that frightened society away from the exploration of psychedelic realms .
As long as researchers and psychologists kept their experiments with LSD confined to their laboratories and clinics , everything was fine .
But the widespread use of psychedelics among large sectors of society , with many people having no knowledge about how to work with psychedelics , led western society into a state of media frenzy and paranoia regarding all forms of consciousness expansion .
Psychedelics were rashly demonized and then outlawed without any further discussion — a fact which has been lamented ever since by psychedelic advocates from fields such as psychology , theology and philosophy .
There ’s been little movement since the sixties toward the legalization of these substances .
Yet it seems that society ’s willingness to consider positive applications of psychedelics has grown lately .
Psychedelic research has finally begun to get back on its feet after being put on hold for decades , and the public discussion of psychedelics seems to be somewhat less ill informed than it had been in recent decades , as was noted in Daniel Pinchbeck ’s article on the future of psychedelics .
Those who can go beyond the veil of propaganda and misinformation that cloaks the entire territory can discover that , unlike many other perfectly legal and accepted substances ( such as coffee , alcohol or nicotine ) , psychedelics are actually non-addictive , non-toxic drugs which in the long term have no adverse side effect on body and brain functions .
When handled with care and in a knowledgeable , respectful manner , psychedelics can have many desirable personal , psychological , philosophical , spiritual and creative results .
These facts are well known to the societies in which psychedelics have been a part of the culture and religion for millennia .
The question of psychedelics
But despite the many merits they possess , psychedelics continue to have a highly ambivalent reputation in our society and are prohibited in most countries .
The reasons behind this global paranoia about psychedelics are complex , but can be summed up in the sentence : Psychedelics are n’t dangerous , but careless , ignorant use of psychedelics is .
Even Holland , which has the most liberal drugs laws in the world , is currently in the process of banning the selling of magic mushrooms in local “ smart shops . ”
The reason is , as it has been in the past , the occasional tragic cases in which newcomers to the field of psychedelics ( usually tourists , usually young people ) experiment with psychedelic drugs without much prior knowledge about their effects , the importance of set and settings , and how they interact with other drugs ( usually alcohol ) , etc .
Such blind sighted encounters with psychedelics are quite likely to lead to disaster .
And so we have the occasional jumping out of a window , or different forms of freak - outs .
It does n’t matter that the number of annual cases of this sort is less than a dozen , while cigarettes kill 400,000 people a year .
Such unfortunate encounters with psychedelics are a side effect of modern society , and are avoided by indigenous societies using psychedelics thanks to the ceremonial manner in which psychedelics are consumed .
This is because indigenous societies partake in psychedelics at specific dates and times , in a religious context , and in the company of shamans .
The recreational use of such substances is almost unheard of .
Thus the ceremonial use of psychedelics is considered safer , more “ dignified , ” and has been legalized in many parts of the world .
Movements advocating the use of psychedelics in a religious context have indeed seen a great surge in recent years , among them the Native American Church use of peyote , and ayahuasca use by the Santo Daime and Uniao de Vegetal religions .
Such religions have managed thus far to eschew the stigma shed upon psychedelics by society .
Their existence is indeed very positive , but while people might have safer access to psychedelics in these contexts , they do not support the use of psychedelics for creative , psychological and philosophical purposes .
These religious uses , as well as psychotherapeutic uses of psychedelics , sacrifice the individual ’s freedom to pursue psychedelic exploration in favor of being part of certain religious or psychological institutions .
Society does n’t know how to handle psychedelics , and since we live in a capitalistic society the choice about psychedelics has been reduced to : sell them or ban them .
It ’s not relevant that treating psychedelics as consumer products might not be a good idea from the psychedelic perspective .
Since our society is capitalistic , we quite automatically apply the model of consumerism to anything that comes along .
However , psychedelics are n’t your average consumer product .
Far from it .
And when the choice is between selling them or banning them , most countries choose what they consider the safe path : prohibition .
So , in an attempt to reverse the inertia associated with the image and legal status of psychedelics , those who do believe that psychedelics can be put to good use and benefit society have to find an alternative way to regulate them .
Various thinkers in the history of psychedelic thought have been aware of this issue .
Many of them believed that psychedelic substances need not be distributed in a mass - consumption , capitalistic manner .
Except perhaps for Ken Kesey , nearly every major psychedelic advocate has also called for strategies to make sure that psychedelics are properly handled and intelligently used .
Albert Hofmann cautioned against the recreational use of psychedelics and believed that their importance lies “ in the possibility of providing material help to meditation . ” [ 1 ]
Aldous Huxley wanted to give psychedelics to a small intellectual elite .
He spoke about the development of “ a technique of applied mysticism ” — a technique for helping individuals to get the most out of their transcendental experience and to make use of the insights from the “ OTHER WORLD ” in the affairs of “ This World . ” [ 2 ]
Timothy Leary wanted psychedelics to be distributed to small groups of people in a psychological or religious context .
[ 3 ]
Even Terence McKenna admitted that not everybody in a psychedelic society has to actually take any drugs . [ 4 ]
Yet the question remains , how will society determine which people it deems fit to experiment with psychedelic substances ?
Religious and psychological systems are , as mentioned above , unsatisfactory forums for tapping the full potential of psychedelic exploration in modern society .
At the same time , selling psychedelics as a standard consumer product has its own disadvantages , which is why we have prohibition .
The Psychonaut License Model
These questions and the need to advance the field of psychedelics have led me to develop an alternative model for the regulation and use of psychedelics in society .
I refer to it as the Psychonaut License Model .
This model , as I have recently found out , was actually already proposed by Leary in the Sixties .
But for some reason or another it seems to have been forgotten for all these years .
Here I would like to offer a variation of this model for your consideration .
Our society has mechanisms for the handling of objects which it deems both helpful as well as dangerous .
In order to drive a car or a plane , for example , you need a license .
What if we would have a psychonautic license ?
A license for exploring your mind .
A license that would ensure that use of psychedelics is guaranteed to those who are willing to approach them knowledgably and responsibly .
A person would receive such a license after taking part in a psychedelic course .
Such a psychonautic course could consist of 10 - 15 meetings , or a concentrated term of 7 - 10 days .
Each course would educate the aspiring psychonaut about a specific substance , such as LSD , Magic Mushrooms , Ayahuasca , Mescaline , Cannabis , etc .
Classes would deal with key questions about psychedelics , such as : the role of psychedelics in culture , the history of psychedelics , psychedelics and ecology , the chemistry of psychedelics , the medical aspects of psychedelics , psychedelic psychology ( how to psychologically deal with the various aspects of a psychedelic trip ) , psychedelic theory and psychedelic spirituality .
Thankfully our community is not suffering from a lack of valuable psychedelic knowledge .
The teachers would be cutting - edge experts from the various fields of psychedelics : psychedelic thinkers , shamans , medical doctors , historians of psychedelics and psychedelic psychologists .
Each course would also include 2 - 3 carefully built , practical psychedelic ceremonies , guided by knowledgeable individuals .
These teachers would strike the balance between allowing the freedom for individual exploration , while ensuring a structured ( at least partly structured ) psychedelic learning experience .
I believe that such a carefully guided tour through the psychedelic world might be a modern version of ancient initiation ceremonies .
It would allow for potential explorers of the psychedelic realms to start their journey in safer , more stable surroundings , setting the stage for more individualized psychedelic experiences in the future .
Such a solution could also set the stage for the reintegration of psychedelics into the social fabric in a way which would be better accepted by society .
It would also build the basis for a stronger psychedelic community and allow for the growth of psychedelic research and techniques .
The Psychedelic University
The establishment of such a psychonaut license would of course demand the establishment of a stable , professional institution .
Hence , the idea for the Psychedelic University , a nonprofit foundation devoted to spreading unbiased knowledge about psychedelics , and supporting individuals seeking safe , informed and inspirational access to psychedelic substances .
The establishment of such an institute demands a tolerant legal environment .
To the best of my knowledge , such an environment exists in only one place in the world at the moment .
So the Psychedelic University should be located in Amsterdam , Holland where it can act in total agreement with the Dutch law .
The Netherlands has been looking for various ways to regulate the use of psychedelics .
While Holland has been tolerant of psychedelics , recent tragedies have weakened its liberal stance .
Since the country continues to reform its drug laws every few years , it seems that Dutch authorities are still looking for a sensible solution regarding the regulation of psychedelics .
The Psychedelic University and the Psychonautic License model respond to the need for such models , and offer an alternative that enables a safe , responsible and yet imaginative introduction into the world of psychedelics .
The purpose of the Psychedelic University is not to polemicize , but to make an example of the psychedelic movement , displaying its radical commitment to the responsible and constructive use of psychoactive substances .
Referring to the future of the psychedelic movement , Terence McKenna said , “ Pointing back to my notion that the responsibility always rests on us and that you do n’t want to go out and really form a movement to change those guys or that bureau — I think the thing that should be done is : people who are involved in psychedelics should live life of such examplitude and impeccability that the notion that there was anything shay or wrong or curious about this phenomenon would be ludicrous . ” [ 5 ]
Making sure that psychedelically inclined individuals get the best drug education would be a first step in that direction .
While the Psychedelic University will not in any way seek to become a governmental institution , its success might encourage the Dutch government and other liberal governments to consider the implementation of this model elsewhere in the world .
Such a university would also , in time , become a center for psychedelic research , collaborating with institutions such as MAPS in the furthering of psychedelic knowledge
Our dream is to enable any person on the planet legal and safe access to these sacred substances , which we value so highly , and to help in the distribution of psychedelic knowledge .
While the criminalization of psychedelics has been seen as nearly irrevocable for decades , new possibilities are also emerging .
Legalization and the creation of a new path are not a dream .

Our anachronistic Electoral College makes no sense any more .
The Electoral College is left over from the days when presidents were elected by appointed representatives from each state .
Each state gets a number of electors to the Electoral College equal to the number of Representatives and Senators it has in Congress .
This distorts how much influence each state has on picking the president not only because of the extra two Senators , but also because states with extremely low populations still get at least one Representative .
As a result , voters from states with very low populations tend to be over - represented in the Electoral College , plus there are rounding errors .
This is shown in the following chart ( from the New York Times ) :
The light colored numbers in each state show how many actual voters are represented by each Elector , with the size of the state showing the relative influence of each voter .
The least represented voters this election are in Florida , where each Elector represents 479,878 voters .
The most represented voters are in Wyoming , where each Elector represents 134,783 voters .
That means that each Wyoming voter has 3.56 times more say than a Florida voter over who will be the next president !
So much for “ one person one vote ” .
This is way worse than any voter fraud we have ever seen — can you imagine the uproar if we found out that people from certain areas were voting three times instead of once ?

Obama taps evangelical for inauguration
Posted by Michael Paulson
President - elect Barack Obama ( right ) has tapped Rick Warren ( left ) , the most prominent evangelical preacher of the post - Billy Graham generation , to deliver the invocation at his inauguration .
The decision was announced today by the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies .
Warren pastors the Saddleback Church , a megachurch in Orange County , California , but he is best know as the author of the best - selling " Purpose Driven Life " and its many spinoffs .
And Warren has been a forceful advocate for reordering evangelical priorities -- he does not support abortion or same - sex marriage , but his public priority has been combatting AIDS in Africa , and he has criticized the politicization of evangelical Protestantism .
Warren has hosted Obama several times ; in 2006 , he invited Obama to speak at his church on World AIDS Day ( an invitation that drew some criticism of Warren from the right ) ; in August of this year Obama and the GOP nominee , Sen . John McCain , were interviewed on live television by Warren in an election forum ; and earlier this month , on World AIDS Day , Obama offered taped remarks praising President Bush 's work on AIDS , which was being recognized by Warren at Saddleback .
The choice is winning praise by anti-abortion groups that have been concerned about the Obama administration .
The Christian Broadcasting Network 's David Brody blogs , " Pro-life pastor Rick Warren will give the invocation at President - Elect Barack Obama ’s inauguration .
It makes a whole lot of sense .
Even though Warren and Obama disagree on the life issue , they do see eye to eye on many social justice issues .
This move is also classic Obama because it is a signal to religious conservatives that he ’s willing to bring in both sides to the faith discussion in this country .
Obama has never shied away from that . "
But advocates for abortion rights and same - sex marriage are furious .
People For the American Way President Kathryn Kolbert called the choice " a grave disappointment , '' citing Warren 's opposition to same - sex marriage and abortion , and writing , " Rick Warren gets plenty of attention through his books and media appearances .
He does n't need or deserve this position of honor .
There is no shortage of religious leaders who reflect the values on which President - elect Obama campaigned and who are working to advance the common good . ''
And blogger Andrew Sullivan , under the headline " Ugh " wrote : " Shrewd politics , but if anyone is under any illusion that Obama is interested in advancing gay equality , they should probably sober up now .
He wo n't be as bad as the Clintons ( who , among leading Democrats , could ? ) , but pandering to Christianists at his inauguration is a depressing omen . "

[ Republicans ] really do believe that bipartisanship is date rape -- they have done for the past 30 years .
And there are n't any Republican political professionals who did n't come up in that school .
To them , this is what politics are all about .
Since they have paid no price for this beyond a fairly even ebb and flow of electoral politics there 's been no reassessment of their methods .
Dems do n't play the blame game .
Republicans do .
Dealing with a ruthless obstructionist opposition party that always operates in bad faith and never misses an opportunity to weaken the president was always going to be part of Obama 's challenge .
( And it does n't matter if the public hates it -- the whole point is to wear them down until it 's just too exhausting to resist . )

By now I imagine everyone has heard the news .
Certainly from the time it oozed out this afternoon , it has spread like wildfire over the blogosphere , and in particular over the liberal blogosphere .
Pastor Rick Warren of the Saddlebrook megachurch will give the invocation at the presidential inauguration .
There 's plenty of time , and plenty of reason , for fulminating , but first I think it 's important to keep in mind that the announcement of the selection of the celebrated right - wing evangelical power broker and die - hard homophobe was bracketed with the announcement that the benediction will be given by , the hugely admired civil rights leader .
( There will also be performances by Aretha Franklin , violinist Itzhak Perlman , and cellist Yo - Yo Ma , among others . )
Here is Michael Paulson 's post from early this evening on the Boston Globe website :
There was apparently some effort to spin the news by fobbing it off on the inauguration committee , chaired by Senator Feinstein .
But that 's so silly as to be insulting .
Does anyone believe that the committee would do anything , anything at all , against the wishes of the president - elect ?
I 'll go further :
Does anyone believe thatdecision by the committee has been or will be made without clearance from the president - elect 's people ?
Not a chance .
I'm going to assume that the objections to Pastor Rick are too obvious , and audible around us , to be worth enumerating here .
If his selection for the invocation wasintended as a kick in the teeth for those who believe in women 's reproductive choice and those who believe in equal rights for LGBT Americans , that was accomplished nevertheless .
I do n't think the thinking here is mysterious .
It 's not just a matter of " inclusiveness . "
It 's surely an attempt to bring more people into President Obama 's planned Really Big Tent -- to recruit and perhaps even coopt people who are n't already part of the Obama coalition .
Since the president - elect truly does n't seem to care what progressives think , I guess all we can do -- beyond making our share of nasty noise -- is to hope that he 's right about the possibility of bringing people with such contrasting views together to find shared solutions .
Me ?
I 'm more persuaded by the argument Digby made for us the other day about Republicans .
( I think she would agree that it 's even more true of the Christian Right . )
Clearly , President - elect Obama believes otherwise .
I hope he 's right .
I hope we are n't looking at an administration whose policies are going to be tailored to acceptability by Pastor Rick .

Many homeowners will benefit from a cut in the Bank rate Banks and building societies are moving after pressure from MPs to pass on the latest cut in interest rates to their mortgage customers .
Some of the major lenders made an immediate decision to pass on the one percentage point Bank rate cut to customers with variable rate mortgages .
RBS / NatWest , which is majority owned by the government , will cut by 0.75 of a percentage point , it said on Friday .
The UK 's biggest lender HBOS will only pass on 0.25 of a percentage point .
A spokesman for HBOS said the government had expected it to be run along commercial lines , which was what it was doing .
Initially , it seemed that customers on mortgage tracker deals with the Nationwide would see only a 0.25 percentage point cut in interest rates .
But late on Thursday the UK 's biggest building society said it was passing on the full one percentage point cut to existing tracker customers .
See who has cut mortgage rates
The Halifax - part of HBOS with Bank of Scotland - has automatically passed Thursday 's Bank of England rate cut on in full to those with tracker mortgages .
Customers with a Halifax standard variable rate mortgage ( SVR ) will see their rate fall from 5 % to 4.75 % on 1 January .

The Halifax is benefiting from around £ 12bn of taxpayers ' money as part of a government bailout .
RBS / NatWest , of which 58 % is owned by the government , is cutting its SVR from 5.19 to 4.44 % , a 0.75 percentage point fall , from 1 January .
Bradford and Bingley said on Friday that it was dropping its SVR by the same amount to 4.84 % with effect from 4 January .
However , One Account SVR customers with RBS will see a one percentage point fall after failing to have the November Bank rate cut passed on in full .
The Chancellor , Alistair Darling , made a fresh appeal to banks to pass on the new rates to help individuals and businesses .
" Banks must treat their customers fairly , " he said .
" In the same way that banks expect their customers to stick to their side of the deal , customers should be able to expect that banks will stick to theirs . "
The chancellor insisted that while there were " some pretty difficult conditions " ahead , the UK would get through the current tough times .
' Decent margin ' Health Secretary Alan Johnson said on the BBC's Question Time that HBOS needed to explain its decision on rates .
" I 'd want to know what the logic is behind that .
We want these banks to continue to be effective and we want them to continue to ensure their own futures , " he said .
" So I think we'd have to see what their rationale is , what the circumstances are in which they 've made that announcement . "
But Shane O'Riordain , of HBOS , defended the bank 's decision .
He said : " I think it is worth remembering the government has said it expects our bank to be run on commercial lines , and that 's exactly what we 're doing .
" All we are simply doing is seeking to achieve a decent margin like any other business , nothing more and nothing less . "
HAVE YOUR SAY
The government should introduce a law which says all Bank of England rate cuts must be passed on by the banks Doris , Manchester Interest rate cuts might be good for mortgage - holders , but savers are likely to see their returns drop .
Sir Howard Davies , the former deputy Governor of the Bank of England , said the government should stop trying to dictate terms to the banks .
" The banks have got to raise money both from depositors and indeed from the inter - bank market , " he said .
He added that the balance was not the same for every bank , so they would take a slightly different attitude to whether they would pass it through .
" I think that for the government to get involved in micro-managing the particular interest rate decision of particular individual banks is a mistake , " he said .
HSBC , Lloyds TSB / Cheltenham and Gloucester and Bristol & West have announced they will pass on the one percentage point cut in full to standard variable rate customers .
Lloyds TSB , RBS and HBOS have all pledged to pass on the rate cuts in full to small business customers .
Most existing tracker mortgage homeowners with the Yorkshire Building Society will not see the full cut because it has a floor , or collar , on its deals .
About 40,000
Abbey customers with " flexible " deals have a clause in their terms and conditions which means that if bank rate goes below 3 % , the Abbey can widen the tracking differential - in other words keep the customer 's mortgage rate up , to negate the effect of the Bank rate reduction .
However a spokeswoman said this clause would not be enforced .
Even before the Bank rate change , Lloyds TSB / Cheltenham and Gloucester announced that it would pass the cut on in full to standard variable rate ( SVR ) customers .
However , it is obliged to do so , as it pledged in 2002 that its variable rates would never be more than two percentage points above the Bank rate .
Many SVR customers across the industry have been put on the variable rate when their fixed - rate deals came to an end .

If I ever get three wishes , this is the way the world will end .

Internet Explorer 8 will feature a user - generated list of " compatible " web sites , after trials found many ordinary surfers and major web sites can't work with Microsoft 's next browser .
The browser 's planned list will be targeted at users that Microsoft considers not " web savvy " .
By opting to use the list with IE 8 , they 'll potentially be able to view their favorite sites and visit major destinations such as the BBC or Facebook without IE 8 scrambling them .
The list will be compiled by Microsoft 's own people , and will be based on results from customer feedback and " objective criteria applied to telemetry data as well as product support channels . "
Web sites making the list will be global " high - volume sites " , and sites " we determine high - volume on a market - by - market basis , " Microsoft program manager Scott Dickens blogged .
Furthermore , Microsoft said it will " reach out " to sites on the list and tell them what a horrible experience their users are getting when they use IE 8 to access them .
Microsoft will then , thoughtfully , explain how the sites can get off of its list .
If a site contacts Microsoft to say it 's opting out of the list , Microsoft will then remove it in the next scheduled update .
IE 8 , currently in beta , makes it hard to view millions of existing web pages because it's the first version of Microsoft 's browser that claims to be fully standards - compliant .
Most web - site and online applications are optimized to old versions of IE .
Version 8.0 , therefore , introduces a significant breaking change as sites wo n't display the same way .
Microsoft 's tried to negotiate this massive problem by giving IE 8 two ways of viewing sites : default mode , which uses standards such as CSS 2.1 and HTML 5.0 , and " compatibility view , " which lets users switch over to viewing the site using the old standards - contorted mode .
The IE 8 beta two , released in August , introduced a compatibility - view button that users could turn on and off to view sites .
The problem for Microsoft is this button was too complicated for the vast majority of ordinary users who — understandably — simply want log on and view the internet without any site - by - site button fiddling .
Dickens noted that " large groups " of users have therefore not been clicking into compatibility mode and are consequentially getting the screwed - up page views .
He claimed the button was working for " savvy end users " but not the great majority of web users who do n't meet Dickens 's savviness standards .
In a further blow , many sites have not responded to Microsoft 's coaxing that they update their sites to work with IE 8 .
Microsoft has asked " hundreds and hundreds " of sites to test whether they work with IE 8's default standards mode , or to add a tag or HTTP header to their site to instruct IE 8 to view the site in compatible - view mode .
Dickens specifically cited the BBC , CNN , Facebook , and MySpace as sites with pages that still do n't work with IE 8 .
Scientists from the University of Alcalá de Henares ( UAH ) have examined the patterns of total bone mineral content of the Spanish population in different areas of the body .
The analysis is the first one of its kind undertaken in Spain that studies subjects from birth until 80 years of age and confirms the differences in mineral content according to gender and changes due to age .
A team of Spanish researchers set out to establish the reference values for skeletal bone status in the course of a human being ’s lifetime .
This is a “ very important piece of work given the changes in bone metabolism of the Spanish population ” , Soledad Aguado , the main author of the work and researcher at the UAH explains to SINC .
The research , published in the latest number of the Skeletal Radiology Journal , is the first that has been undertaken in Spain in subjects whose ages ranged from 0 to 80 years of age .
The study was performed in 1,120 subjects from the Community of Madrid , all of whom had a sedentary lifestyle .
The sample was divided into 16 groups at 5 - year age intervals .
Each group had a bone densitometry scan using the technique known as “ Dual X - Ray phototonic absorptiometry [ DXA ] .
The aim was to quantify bone mineral content in the whole body and in different and separate areas of the body .
The results show that there are big differences in gender in the mean values of bone mineral content for the head and trunk of the body ( between 16 and 25 years ) and legs and arms ( between 16 and 70 years ) .
In all cases , women have less bone mineral content .
Previous studies confirmed that the bone mineral content increases from birth until 25 years of age and reduces from 26 until 40 years of age , the time at which it starts to stabilize .
From 56 years old the reduction in bone mineral content becomes more acute .
However , women reach their maximum bone mass at an earlier age than men : the increase of total bone mineral content occurs from birth until 20 years of age .
The researcher from Madrid explains that these values “ offer a useful piece of reference information when comparing them with sedentary populations from other geographical areas , or a population with osteoporosis or sportsmen or women ” .
Osteoporosis in Spain
According to the Spanish Society for Bone Research and Mineral Metabolism [ la Sociedad Española de Investigación Ósea y Metabolismo Mineral ] ( SEIOMM ) , osteoporosis is a disease that affects women more than men .
Today two million women already suffer from this disease and it causes about 25,000 bone fractures per year as a result of deterioration in the micro-architecture of bone tissue caused by osteoporosis .
The appearance of this disease is caused mainly by an ageing population and the prevalence of this disease is increasing on a daily basis .
Currently , osteoporosis affects 16 % of people older than 50 years of age .
Bank charges have been a contentious issue for years , as many people felt the banks were unfair in charging them significant amounts of money when things went wrong .
You are charged for things such as a direct debit not being paid because of insufficient funds , for going into your overdraft or over your overdraft limit without authorisation , or for cheques not being honoured .
Bank Charges :
What 's the latest
In 2009 , a test case on whether the charges made by the banks were fair was taken by the Office of Fair Trading against the following ;
Barclays
Abbey
Halifax
Bank of Scotland
Lloyds TSB
Clydesdale
HSBC
Royal Bank of Scotland
Nationwide Building Society
In round 1 the High Court and Court of Appeal ruled in favour of the OFT .
However , the Supreme Court later ruled in favour of the banks - saying that people had signed up to the contract knowing what the charges were , and they were part of the overall package offered by the banks , so the banks were entitled to charge them .
This left thousands of people not knowing what to do next .
In reality though , if you feel you have been charged unfairly by your bank , you still have every right to try to claim those charges back , it is just that now you will find it harder to prove your case .
Who can reclaim bank charges ?
Since the Supreme Court ruling it is much harder to reclaim bank charges than it once was .
However , that does not mean you should not try if you think you have been unfairly charged .
Although your chances of successfully reclaiming your charges are slim , it is always worth asking if you think you have been unfairly charged , especially if you 're in financial hardship , or the charges were disproportionate .
How do I claim ?
It is actually quite a simple process .
Here is what you need to do :
Consider the risks of reclaiming bank charges
Before you approach you bank , it 's worth thinking about the potential risks of reclaiming .
The bank can legally close your account at any time .
So if you are going to reclaim , it might be wise to set up a backup account just in case .
Challenging your charges will not impact your credit rating , but it could jeopardise your standing with the bank .
In extreme cases , the bank may close your account , so think carefully before you take any action .
The Ombudsman says you should be given ' reasonable notice ' before your account is closed , which in the Banking Code is 30 days .
But this would be in ' normal ' circumstances .
If there is a suspected fraud or you have threatened or abused bank staff , this would not apply .
Work out what you could reclaim
If possible , go through your old bank statements to spot the charges you may be able to reclaim .
You can request under the Data Protection
Act that your bank provides a list of account charges going back six years .
Normal account charges are not part of the issue , so look out for any ' penalty charges ' like unauthorised overdraft fees and fees for ' bounced cheques ' .
Write to your bank to ask for a list of all charges , detailing what the charge was for , the date and the amount , under the Data Protection Act .
Your bank is obliged to reply within 40 days and may not charge more than £ 10 for the information .
Do n't allow your bank to charge you more by insisting that you pay for a full bank statement - you are entitled to this information in law .
If you ask your bank to refund a one off charge for a missed payment , or going over your overdraft limit without authorisation , they will often do so - unless it happens on a regular basis .
So , it is first worth making a phone call to your bank , or banks , to beg forgiveness and ask them to take a lenient approach ?
Explain what went wrong to cause the slip - up , emphasise that the blunder was a one off and state what you 've done to prevent it happening again .
Then ask if they would consider waiving the charge , or charges , in your case .
This is by far the quickest and easiest way to try and reclaim your bank charges , and if your bank agrees then so much the better .
But it is unlikely .
If they refuse , then you will have to get more formal about the process , and write a letter to the bank to make your claim .
Remember to write down the time you called , the date and who you spoke to .
Getting names is always a good idea , just in case you need to follow up with something later .
Write to your bank , this time asking for your money back
Insurers , lenders and banks have to follow certain guidelines when they are dealing with complaints , and one of these is that they respond to all complaints within eight weeks of the initial approach .
If calling was unsuccessful then you should follow up it up with a formal letter .
It 's important that you set out the correct information in your letter , so use a template like the one found here .
You should include an element relating to financial hardship if you genuinely are struggling to make ends meet , as these are the only bank charges claims that are being considered now unless there is a clear mistake made by the bank .
See how your bank responds
If you do not get a response of any kind within two weeks , write again and follow up with a phone call .
Your bank may try to bluff by saying that the charges are not illegal .
Again , do not be put off , stand your ground and insist that your claim is dealt with .
Specify that you will take your case to the Financial Ombudsman if it is not dealt with in a satisfactory way .
You should ask them to respond within 14 days .
The best result here is for your bank to simply refund your charges , or in some cases , offer you a partial payment .
Put your complaint to the Financial Ombudsman
This is clear - the Ombudsman will not rule on cases that have no element of financial hardship involved , as the courts have a greater authority than the Ombudsman , and the Supreme Court ruling sets out that the banks have the right to make these charges .
However , the grey area is whether the bank has taken your case of financial hardship seriously , and been sympathetic in its response .
The Ombudsman will look at all the evidence and make a decision based on that .
Decide if you should take the matter to court
If the Ombudsman comes back and had found in favour of the bank your next option is to either give up or take the matter to court .
You should think long and hard before taking this step , as once the Financial Ombudsman has sided with the bank the courts are likely to do the same .=
Getting your money back
If you are successful in reclaiming your bank charges you may find the banks are often far slower to give money back than they were to take it in the first place .
If your bank does n't pay up , you have the right to send in the bailiffs .
What next ?
You could write a budget plan so that you can work out which areas of your spending could do with being cut back or managed a little better so that you avoid bank charges in the future .
The best way to avoid charges in future is to manage your money effectively .
Work out why the bank charged you in the first place .
Could you have avoided the charge by keeping a closer eye on how much money you had sitting in your account ?
Or are you generally spending more money than you have coming in ?

Benny The Pontificator Strikes Again
That buffoon Benedict is at it once again , lashing out at gays in yet another hate - filled speech and declaring that civilization must be saved from the evil , destructive influence of homosexuality ( read more here :
Pope attacks blurring of gender , and here : Gay groups angry at Pope remarks ) .
Now that 's a Christmas message we can all get behind , is n't it ?
A message of peace , love and joy .
Yet another classic in a long line of greats , such as the one about the corrosive influence of premarital sex on society ; the one concerning the evils of birth control , particularly condoms ( even in AIDS - ravaged places such as sub- Saharan Africa ) ; and let 's not forget that oldie - but - goodie : the need to conquer and convert all heathens and infidels .
Nailed It !
There 's always got to be an enemy of a righteous , godly society .
Witches , Jews , Protestants , Muslims and condoms have all had their turn , so why not gays today ?
Once again , you 've nailed it Benny .
Way to go !
I 've got lots more to say about these regular Papal pontifications of hate , but , the funny thing is , I 've already said it all .
In fact , I do n't need to change a single word from the piece I wrote exactly two years ago today , a piece written in response to an earlier instalment in Benny 's long - running series of homophobic diatribes .
Here it is .
And see if you do n't agree that it's as accurate and relevant today as it was back then ... and , sadly , as it will almost certainly be next year after he once again decides to spew some more hate :
Ok , look , it 's the holiday season and I really do n't have the time , nor the inclination , to rant right now ; however , I 've sadly been left with no other choice .
Believe me , I was just trying to get into the holiday spirit yesterday when , out of nowhere , I got blindsided by none other than the Holy Pontiff ; and he simply left me with no other option but to stand up to his bigotry , hatred and illogical ravings .
Hey , somebody 's got to do it , right ?
What I 'm talking about here is the Pope 's latest homophobic rant against gays , his disgust at the idea of them being treated as equal human beings , and his rejection of the " dismal theories " of gay marriage .
He actually had the nerve to go on and lecture about how gay marriage takes away from men and women 's innate sexual identity .
This from a guy leading a worldwide group of celibates .
He 's telling us about men and women 's innate sexual identity ?!
He 's got to be kidding , right ?
He wants us to believe that lifelong celibacy does n't strip men and women of their innate sexual identity ?!
What 's with this guy ?
Hey , Benedict , you want to fight for some real justice for humanity ?
How about going after all those pedophile priests your church shuffled from one town to another as a matter of policy , decade after decade - no , make that century after century - while untold numbers of children suffered in silence .
The issue was only confronted once the courts got involved in places like America and Ireland .
And , undoubtedly , the same sick protection of the most guilty is still going on in most corners of the world , in places where the media is more " respectful " of the Church and the people are much more frightened to speak up .
So , take a look at your own morally bankrupt institution before you spread your hate outwards , buddy , and forget about condemning those who just want to live together in a loving committed relationship .
There must be something more important for you to spend your energy on than this .
There 's just got to be .
Speaking of " dismal " , illogical theories , who exactly was it who deemed this Pope guy to be closer than anybody else to God anyway ?
Oh yeah , it was him and his own institution .
Which , logically speaking , is right up there with " Jesus loves me yes I know , for the Bible tells me so " .
I remember that even as a young kid that made absolutely no logical sense .
And , if you ask me , teaching kids illogical thinking from the very earliest ages really should be called child abuse , but that 's a whole other rant .
For those of you crying out " Please , no more rants so close to X'mas " , I can only say " Do n't blame me , blame that Pope guy " .
I mean , somebody 's got to speak up when such pathetically ridiculous and outright hypocritical idiocy is being spewed , right ?
And the fact that it 's actually quite comical ( having some old celibate guy lecturing the world on other people 's innate sexual identity ) in no way lessens the need to respond ... though it does make it somewhat more fun .
MERRY X'MAS !!

US Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama has attacked John McCain 's links to a 1980s financial scandal .
He also accused his Republican rival of being more focused on running a smear campaign than on fixing the US economy .
It comes after Mr McCain 's running mate Sarah Palin accused Mr Obama over the weekend of associating with terrorists .
Mr Obama once served on a charity board with an ex-member of US - based militant group Weather Underground , Bill Ayers , now a University of Illinois professor .
He has denounced Mr Ayers ' radical past .
Mr McCain spent the weekend in Arizona preparing for Tuesday 's presidential debate but Mrs Palin , governor of Alaska , held several rallies .
She told supporters in Colorado and California that the time had come to take " the gloves off " - suggesting that Mr Obama 's character may be the subject of further attacks .
Judgement claim
In a new internet video being e-mailed to supporters , the Obama campaign launched its own attack on Mr McCain over his connections to tycoon Charles Keating , who was convicted of securities fraud after his savings and loan scheme collapsed .
Senator McCain and his operatives are gambling that he can distract you with smears rather than talk to you about substance
Barack Obama
The shifting election battleground Mr McCain was one of five senators - known as the Keating Five - to be investigated by a Senate ethics panel over their intervention with banking regulators on behalf of Keating .
He was found to be less involved with Keating than the other senators but was criticised for " poor judgement " .
Mr McCain has himself described the affair as " the worst mistake of my life " , and one which led him to sponsor legislation on campaign finance reform .
In an email to supporters , Obama campaign manager David Plouffe said : " The McCain campaign has tried to avoid talking about the scandal , but with so many parallels to the current crisis , McCain 's Keating history is relevant and voters deserve to know the facts - and see for themselves the pattern of poor judgement by John McCain . ''
The Obama campaign has set up a special website where viewers can see the short internet video and a 13 - minute documentary on Mr McCain 's involvement in the Keating scandal .
Speaking at a rally in North Carolina on Sunday , Mr Obama also questioned Mr McCain 's campaign tactics , suggesting he was seeking to turn the focus away from the current economic crisis .
" Senator McCain and his operatives are gambling that he can distract you with smears rather than talk to you about substance , " he said .
" They 'd rather try to tear our campaign down than lift this country up .
It 's what you do when you 're out of touch , out of ideas and running out of time . "
That message is echoed in a new campaign advert , to be broadcast on cable TV from Monday , which seeks to portray Mr McCain 's response to the financial crisis as fumbling and unreliable .
The commentary says : " Erratic in a crisis .
Out of touch on the economy . "
Meanwhile , singers Bruce Springsteen and Jay - Z took part in concerts over the weekend , organised by the Obama campaign , aimed at encouraging new voters to register .
Monday is the deadline for voter registration in more than a dozen states , including Pennsylvania , Virginia , Michigan , Ohio , Indiana and Florida .
Voter turnout could be vital in deciding the outcome of the 4 November presidential election .

What are these ?

Please take a moment to look at the following screenshot from Obama 's transition website : www.change.gov
The screenshot was taken on 12/20/2008 and I 've preserved it because I will bet that he will bury this " skunky corpse " in a matter of days .
Why ?
Because it illustrates that Obama has absolutely no intention of bending to the will of the American people .
The screenshot shows that the most requested " change " that the American people want to see is the Re-Legalization of Marijuana .
Let 's think about this for a moment .
Nearly 20,000 Americans offered nearly 10,000 suggested changes and Marijuana Re-Legalization received the most support of any other suggested change .
So here was how the suggested change -- that received the most support of ANY other question -- was worded :
" Will you consider legalizing marijuana so that the government can regulate it , tax it , put age limits on it , and create millions of new jobs and create a billion dollar industry right here in the U.S. ? "
And here is the insulting response we got to the most supported suggestion for change , from President Elect Obama 's transition team :
President - elect Obama is not in favor of the legalization of marijuana .
Transition Team , Washington , D.C .
So Obama thinks he can just " blow us off " on the issue of Marijuana Re-Legalization despite the good that Marijuana Re-Legalization could bring :
(1) It would destroy the Mexican Drug Cartels and local drug gangs .
(2) It would provide some counterbalance to the liberties lost through the Patriot Act and other legislation that received bi-partisan support from Republicans and Democrats alike .
(3) It would erase the criminal records of millions of upstanding American 's whose only crime was to use a harmless non-alcoholic drug .
But of course that is exactly why Obama will not Re-Legalize Marijuana .
Most of his campaign money came from the very interests that are opposed to Marijuana Re-Legalization .
Consider the following :
* Attorneys will loose out on profiting from the near 840,000 Marijuana arrests each year .
* Drug testing labs will loose huge amounts of revenue .
* The Prison Industrial Complex will be gutted and the US will no longer have the largest per capita number of its citizens behind bars or in some other form of judicial control
* The Multi-National Banks that launder billions in drug money , each year , will loose significant revenue
* Drug gangs , and drug cartels alike , will collapse as Re-Legalized Marijuana has a " Gatekeeper " effect ( e.g. , since users will be able to " brew " their own Marijuana they will have less contact with those that sell harder drugs such as Heroin , Cocaine and Methamphetamine .

* Clemency for all non-violent drug use will reduce the absurd amounts of money spent on the Prison Industrial Complex and the number of felons will be reduced drastically .
Yep , the same scumbags that financed his campaign are those most opposed to Re-Legalizing Marijuana .
That is why Obama is " just saying no . "
Obama is the marionette and they are the ones pulling the strings .
It is up to us to ensure that his renouncement does not stand .
It is time to stand up and be counted .

China Starts Building Its Largest Ever Solar Power Project
December 10th , 2008 by Andrew Williams
[ social_buttons ]
Earlier this week , the China Huaneng Group started building China ’s largest ever solar power plant , a massive 166 Megawatt ( MW ) facility in the southern province of Yunnan .
The project , costing a total of 9.1 billion yuan ( $ 1.3 billion ) , is scheduled to commence operations in 2010 .
According to the China Electricity Council , the company intends to expand its capacity for solar , wind and other clean energy projects to an impressive 10,000 MW by the end of the same year .
China Huaneng , the nation ’s largest electricity producer , has already teamed up with Hongkong Electric on a 470 million yuan , 48 MW wind farm in the same province .
It seems that the need for such large scale projects is now more pressing than ever , since China has recently overtaken the US to become the world ’s largest producer of carbon emissions .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
Royal Dutch Shell PLC said Wednesday that it expects to cut between 7,000 and 9,000 jobs by the end of 2022 , as the company said it expects to book charges of between $ 1.0 billion and $ 1.5 billion in the third quarter .
As we end 2008 , the year ahead offers the biggest challenge ever in the history of blogging .
Although blogging dates back to the beginning of the first dot com boom , it truly came of age as the second bubble grew .
From the rise of the political bloggers in 2004 , blogging became mainstream , and with that came money and commercialism .
Blogging is more than its commercial endeavors , and as a non-commercial platform for networking , global communication and sharing blogging has many great days ahead of it , and may actually boom in 2009 after a dip in popularity over 2007 and 2008 as social networks became a first choice of communications and networking outlet for many .
But the commercial side of blogging is facing a difficult year .
The same issues that face the broader Tech and Web 2.0 spheres face blogging : a dearth of VC , declining ad revenues , and even tougher competition as many try to compensate for lower ad revenues by driving even more traffic .
The dangers for commercial blog owners come on a number of fronts , but there ’s one trend we ’ve already seen begin .
The rise of the Uber Blog
Some may moan at the use of the word uber , so feel free to substitute it with big or large , because the meaning remains the same .
An Uber Blog is a blog that combines different content streams into one large blog , with one primary top level url .
The Huffington Post is an example I ’ve used before .
The blending of content can be in related fields , or non related fields ; for example , you might blend specialties in tech into the one tech blog .
It has already begun
In a post asking whether the blog network model is dying , I made similar observations on a number of companies , some I ’ll repeat here
ReadWriteWeb
ReadWriteWeb has gone from a traditional blog network in to the uber blog model .
Owner Richard McManus gave away or sold the two blogs in the network , at the same time he was launching new blogs under the ReadWriteWeb brand .
The reason given by Richard : a focus on the core brand .
Silicon Alley Insider
Henry Blodget merged the two blogs outside of Silicon Alley Insider into sub-urls on alleyinsider.com .
While each blog maintains their own name and heading , they are now all parts of alleyinsider itself as opposed to standalone blogs .
Gawker Media
In between selling blogs , Nick Denton merged Valleywag into Gawker on a sub-url .
Valleywag keeps its header and name , but is now a column of Gawker .
b5media
b5 media has n’t yet started blending blogs into larger blogs , but has instead undertaken a variation of the theme : branded portals .
Content from b5 media ’s business and celebrity channels fall under the banner of a larger site , which also acts as a gateway to the content .
Why one large blog ?
The reasoning behind the move is remarkably simple : it ’s easy to sell ads on one blog vs many blogs , for a couple of reasons .
The biggest is simply traffic : having one big blog means increased traffic to the core blog making the sales pitch more appealing .
Second , advertisers will often want to target the one blog and not buy the subsidiary blogs ; maybe not always , but none the less common in my experience .
If you have one big blog with various streams you ’ve got better odds of getting high value advertising against all the content .
Expanding outside the niche
Having sub blogs within a large blog , or amalgamating smaller blogs gives commercial blog operators the ability to broaden their content range outside of a specific niche , often with the advantage of not necessarily polluting the core product .
The content for example on Silicon Alley Insider and ReadWriteWeb ’s sub -blogs is complimentary , and allows both sites to increase content outside the core sites focus , driving growth and new visitors to the product as whole .
Three companies that have n’t blended blogs but could or should
TechCrunch
Michael Arrington followed the typical blog network route with the TechCrunch blogs , launching new sites on new urls .
The problem with the network is that it has never produced a hit that has come close to TechCrunch itself .
Excluding the country specific sites that site on the techcrunch.com url ( except Japan ) , sites like CrunchGear have n’t delivered ( for reference , with a yearly budget that would n’t cover one months wages at CrunchGear , we have more traffic according to Quantcast ) .
CrunchGear though is n’t a bad site , it just lacks for eyeballs because it ’s not part of TechCrunch itself .
Perfect candidate for a sub-blog , like crunchgear.techcrunch.com .
The same goes for Mobile and Enterprise .
Despite his dislike of me , Arrington is a smart bloke , and I ’d bet we see at least one of these sites blended this year , if not all of them .
GigaOm
Om Malik has been buying blogs in a tight market , expanding his network at a time most others are n’t .
The unique thing about the network is that gigaom.com does n’t dominate it , accounting for 31.7 % of traffic vs second place TheAppleBlog with 26.9 % .
However , a number of small blogs would appear to be struggling alone , and would make prime candidates for folding into the leading site .
AOL Weblogs Inc
AOL has continued to go wide , aggressively expanding the network they acquired from Jason Calacanis 4 year ago .
AOL does have a couple of obvious strengths : the ability to sell ads across the network , and the leverage of AOL.com to pump new sites .
They have already though started to group sites around key brands such as Engadget , and I ’d suggest in a tightening market that grouping , being it masthead or subdomains / sub blogs could come into play in 2009 .
Conclusion
In 2009 big will be better .
Not big networks of many sites , but big blogs that break out of the narrow niche focus that has been typical of commercial blogging until now , and instead go wide in content but focused on one brand and one url .
The rise of the uber blog will also mark the beginning of the time new media starts to surpass old media .
The thing holding back new media to date has been its obsession with niche plays that did n’t naturally lead to scale that sets them up well to compete with old media titans that went wide online as they did offline in print .
The new media uber blogs of 2009 and beyond will offer real substitution of old media like we have n’t really seen before , and with lean structures that are best placed to last the recession , could ultimately emerge on top .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment insurance last week was higher than economists expected , and the number continuing to collect benefits shot to a 25 - year high .
The U.S. Department of Labor reported Thursday that initial filings for state jobless benefits reached 481,000 for the week ended Nov. 1 .
While that was down 4,000 from the revised 485,000 reported the week before , it was above the 476,000 claims expected by economists surveyed by Briefing.com .
The prior week was revised up by 1,000 to 479,000 .
The report shows the number of Americans continuing to collect unemployment benefits surged to 3,843,000 , the highest level since 1983 .
The number increased by 122,000 for the week ended Oct .18 , the most current data available .
A year ago , the number stood at 2.59 million .
The 25 - year high level of continuing claims outweighs the slight drop in initial jobless claims , according to Bob Brusca , economist at FAO Economics .
" It 's a problem , " he said .
" The labor market is not looking good at all .
The small back off , that 's not great ... initial claims have fulfilled any expectation you have of them for a normal or severe recession . "
The four - week moving average of unemployment claims , used to smooth fluctuations in the data , remained unchanged at 477,000 from the previous week .
A reading above 400,000 has been present during the past two recessions .
A year ago , the four - week moving average was 324,000 .
Last week , nearly 7,500 jobless claims were attributed to the effects of Hurricanes Ike and Gustav , but no such claims were reported this week .
The number of jobless claims spiked in late September to 499,000 , the highest level recorded since the 517,000 claims filed in wake of Sept. 11 terrorist attacks .
Job cuts
On Wednesday , a private outplacement firm reported that last month had the highest number of pink slips handed out since January 2004 .
The job cut announcements soared to 112,884 , up 19 % from September 's 95,094 cuts , according to Challenger , Gray & Christmas Inc .
Separately , payroll manager ADP said the private sector lost a seasonally adjusted 157,000 jobs last month - more than six times September 's decrease and the largest drop since December 2001 .
The Department of Labor 's monthly unemployment report due Friday is expected to show that 200,000 jobs were lost in October and that the unemployment rate grew to 6.3 % from 6.1 % a month earlier .
President - elect Barack Obama has put forth a few economic stimulus proposals , which may gain bipartisan support .
Some of his ideas include temporarily exempting the unemployed from having to pay income tax on their unemployment benefits , extending unemployment benefits , spending more on infrastructure to create jobs , and temporary tax credits for businesses that create jobs in the United States .

On Dec. 1 , 1958 , a fire consumed Our Lady of the Angels grade school on the West Side of Chicago , killing 92 children and three nuns .
A wire story from that day captured a fragment of the desperation :
" Max Stachura stood outside the burning building , begging his little boy , Mark , 9 , to jump into his arms .
Children were falling all about the father and he caught or stopped the fall of 12 of them .
But little Mark was too frightened or he did n't understand his father .
Mark did n't jump . "
Fifty years later , Mark 's mother has the day in crisp focus , and adds a missing detail .
As Mark stood at that second - floor window , fire to his back , he held a small statue in his hand and waved it proudly through the black smoke , hoping his father would notice .
Mark had won the statue that day — a figure of an infant Jesus — for being first to answer a quiz question .
" I guess he was just so proud of that prize , " said Mary Stachura , now in a retirement home in Bartlett .
" I do n't think he really understood what was happening . "
Few of the children trapped in the school could have grasped the enormity of the danger they faced , and few of the panicky adults on the ground — parents and neighbors and firefighters — had time to reflect .
They acted , grabbing ladders of all lengths from garages , reaching through broken windows to haul small , waterlogged bodies from the flames .
Max Stachura watched as other children pushed his son back , away from the window and into the flames .
The boy was later identified by a homework sheet crumpled in his pocket .
Max rarely spoke of that day .
He died suddenly of a heart attack at 52 .
" He was much too young , " said Mary , now 85 .
" That fire .
It changed everything . "
The fire at Our Lady of the Angels remains one of the worst tragedies in Chicago 's history , a ghastly few hours on a cold , sunny afternoon that shattered families and knocked a hopeful , growing community forever off its path .
The cause of the fire was never officially determined , and no one was held accountable .
Some parents who lost a child -- or children -- found ways to blame each other and wound up divorced .
Others sold their tidy two flats and moved away , hastening the flight of the middle class from the city 's West Side .
" It seems as though people just could n't get far enough away , " said Jill Grannan , a curator at the Chicago History Museum .
" That school and that parish is one that had a lot of people .
It had a growing population .
There was such a boom , and then people really just had to leave .
" I do n't think the community ever really came back . "
Few in the neighborhood now would recall the blaze .
But for parents and firefighters , journalists and now - grown schoolchildren , the memories remain etched in intricate detail .
Steve Lasker , then a photographer for The Chicago American newspaper , was driving along Grand Avenue , heading to his newsroom after an assignment in Elmwood Park .
He heard a call come over a radio tuned to the police frequency : " They 're jumping out the windows ! "
" But I did n't know where it was , " Lasker said .
A fire engine cut in front of him and he quickly turned to follow .
He parked on Iowa Street and headed toward the smoke , stopping abruptly when he saw the school on Avers Avenue in flames .
" I froze for a few seconds , or maybe it was minutes , I do n't know , I could n't tell , " said Lasker , now 78 .
" Oh my God , there 's still kids in there .
Mayhem was going on and they started pulling kids out of there left and right . "
From atop a fire truck , Lasker shot one of the most iconic photos of the day .
It showed a helmeted firefighter , his face drawn in sorrow , carrying the soaking wet , lifeless body of 10 - year - old John Jajkowski Jr. from the building .
Just 28 and the father of a 6 - month - old girl , Lasker felt his stomach churn as he watched the rescue through the lens of his camera .
The cold wind froze tracks of tears on his face .
Though many photos were published , 20 years would pass before he would voluntarily show them to anyone .
" I did n't want to re-live it , " he said .
" To this day I still have dreams about that horrible scene . "
He held close to his family through the years , and was , perhaps , over - protective of his kids : " Tragedy hits home .
Everybody 's home . "
Grace Riley never saw the fire , but she faced its aftermath in the worst of ways .
She was 23 at the time , an emergency room nurse and a newlywed .
The first ambulance arrived without warning at St. Anne 's Hospital that afternoon , carrying six boys from the 7th and 8th grades , and one 1st - grade girl .
The doctors and nurses did n't know what had happened but immediately set to work , Riley caring for the little girl .
" I was cutting her clothes off and I hear her say , ' Oh nurse , my face hurts so bad . '
And I looked up and her face was totally burned . "
As more children were carted in , the acrid smell of burnt flesh became overwhelming — it sticks with Riley to this day .
She helped place bodies of the dead on the floor so gurneys were available for the living .
" Ambulance by ambulance by ambulance , they just kept coming , " Riley said .
" It was just earth - shattering to look into a room and see all those little bodies , and to see the parents screaming , ' Where is my child ?
Where is my child ? ' "
Riley left emergency room nursing shortly after the fire .
She just could n't do it anymore .
Now 73 and a hospice nurse in Arizona , she recalled the day of the fire and how instead of assisting doctors with the injured she focused on cataloging the children who were dead on arrival .
She carries guilt over that decision .
" I just could n't bring myself to go up to pediatrics to help out .
I just could n't do it , " Riley said .
" As a nurse you 're supposed to put your own feelings aside .
But I could not handle the smell of burnt skin and the pain that these kids were going through . "
Long after any wounds from the fire healed , after the bodies of the dead were honored in mass funeral services and schools across Chicago and the nation embraced new standards for fire safety , the pain lingers .
Ken Leonard was only 9 at the time , a 4th grader in room 210 .
He wound up on the window ledge , too afraid to jump , too scared to realize flames were burning the backs of his legs .
A fireman made it up a ladder and hoisted him to safety .
He spent 10 days in the hospital with 2nd - degree burns -– his two brothers escaped the school unharmed .
The three Leonard boys would all go on to serve in Vietnam .
Again , they all made it out alive .
Ken wound up a firefighter in Oak Lawn , rising to become chief before he retired in 2001 .
Throughout his career , he kept memories of the Our Lady of the Angels fire to himself , and he still struggles to speak of that day .
" When I first got in the job , I was trying to tell my co-workers the story , but I just could n't do it , " Leonard said , voice cracking .
" I assumed as time went on , it would get easier .
But it never does . "
Some say they were able to put the tragedy behind them , though they speak in an uncertain tone of moving on .
Others lament the lack of counseling in the wake of the tragedy , saying the custom of the time — to bottle up emotions and go on living — never allowed them to come to terms with their feelings .
And some still search for answers .
Robert Chiappetta , who survived the fire but lost his sister , Joan Anne , has spent the past 15 years obsessively researching a book about what happened at Our Lady of the Angels .
Though no investigation ever found fault with the Catholic church , which ran the school , or with city fire inspectors , Chiappetta believes there was a widespread coverup .
" They had created a fire trap in there , " he said , surrounded by court documents at his kitchen table in Elmwood Park .
" People will see this was the crime of the century . "
Chiappetta 's parents , after searching several hospitals the night of the fire , found his sister 's body near midnight in the Cook County morgue .
She could only be identified by a gold chain around her neck , one her uncle had brought her from Italy .
In the weeks after the fire , after Mary and Max Stachura had buried their son , a nun from the school explained the statue Mark had been waving at his father .
She gave Mary a similar one as a keepsake .
Mary still has that statue .
It 's kept in a trunk in her apartment — like memories of that day , it 's always nearby , just not in plain sight .
Sitting recently with her younger son , John , who was in a building at the school that did n't burn that day , Mary showed a cherished , sepia - toned class picture of Mark .
She still has the shirt and tie he wore in the picture .
" I told John that when I die , bury that shirt and that tie with me , " she said .
" My little boy will always be with me . "

During his first address to the nation since the election , President - elect Barack Obama , after answering numerous inane questions about getting a dog , called Friday for an extension of unemployment benefits .
Awesome .
Seeing as how a good chuck of our friends and associates are SOL on the job front , this comes just in the nick of time .
In related news , further evidence of recession time came to light today after the government reported that the unemployment rate had skyrocketed from 6.1 percent in September to 6.5 percent in October .
Ouch . ( Sacto Bee )
Once the killer virus becomes lodged in the system , it leads to a self - reinforcing debt trap – the real burden of mortgages rises , year after year , house prices falling , year after year .
The noose tightens until you choke .
Subtly , it shifts wealth from workers to bondholders .
It is reactionary poison .
Ultimately , it leads to civic revolt .
Democracies do not tolerate such social upheaval for long .
They change the rules .
Stan Veit - the first editor of Computer Shopper - has a fascinating first - person account on the very early years of Apple , starting with what may be the very first Apple tech support call ever , answered by Steve Jobs himself .
Advertisement
According to Veit - editor - in - chief of Computer Shopper magazine from 1983 to 1988 - Steve Jobs contacted him when his computer shop in New York was taking off big time .
On the phone , Steve convinced him about having to check out this amazing new computer , which according to the Jobster was " insanely great " ( or something like that ) .
Jobs wanted him to distribute it and , after talking for a bit , Veit agreed to give it a try .
To his surprise , it arrived the next day FedEx delivered a package C.O.D. for five hundred dollars .
It was the first Apple computer ever , the Apple I .
He gave the computer to Dave , one his best tech guys , who was surprised at its minuscule size compared to the usual computers at the time .
After a while , Dave set up the computer but it did n't do anything , so Veit called " Apple . "
" See !
It works , " Dave told me .
" What does it do ? " I asked .
" Nothing !
It needs a keyboard .
I 'll get one , " Dave told me .
Dave came back with one of our SWTPC keyboards and wired it in after studying the schematic .
" Do n't work , " he told me .
" Better call 'em . "
So I called the number listed in the paperwork and asked for Steve .
" Which one ? " the young man at the other end asked .
" The fast talker , " I told him .
" Oh , Steve Jobs .
Wait a minute . "
Steve came on the line , and I told him the keyboard did n't work .
" What kind of keyboard did you use ?
Southwest ?
Nah , they wo n't work .
I 'll send a good one and some software tomorrow . "
" Wait . "
I told him I did n't need it FedExed next day , I could wait .
But too late , he was gone .

Veit 's feature is full of personal insight on those times and , while there 's always two sides to a story , I find it extremely amusing , specially his last remarks :
Lunch was served to the press and notables , and I was seated with Steve Wozniak 's parents .
Introducing myself , I struck up a conversation with them and in the course of discussion I mentioned that people were often shaking their heads when I mentioned that I had refused Steve Jobs ' offer of 10 percent of Apple for an investment of $ 10,000 .
Mrs. Wozniak said , " Do n't feel bad , you were not the first person Jobs offered stock in the company for a small investment .
When the boys needed printed circuit boards , Jobs offered an interest in the company to the man who did the boards .
However they managed to pay for the boards and the man never got any stock .
When Apple went public , Jobs would not give stock to several employees who made the Apple possible .
My son gave them stock out of his allotment , or they would have never benefited from the long hours and devotion they put in to start the company .
If you had given Jobs the money , he would have found a way to keep you from getting the stock . "

In cases where not even the exact year of the beginning or end of a ruler 's term is known , the asterisk ( * ) is used to indicate dates at which the person is known to have been in office , e.g. , * 1924 - 1925 * means the term began in 1924 or earlier and ended in 1925 or later .
All dates are New Style ( Gregorian ) .
( f ) indicates female rulers .
Birth and death years are also provided ( b. = born , d. = died , s.a. = see above ) , but note that the given birth years may be questionable , as different sources often give contradictory information .
In cases where it is particularly unclear , the birth year is followed by a question mark ( e.g. , 1923 ? ) but that does not mean that the year is guaranteed to be correct when there is no question mark .
Also , when no death year is given , it should not be taken for granted that the person is indeed still alive .
More detailed birth and death information , along with full and alternative names , other positions held , etc. , may be found in the Index , which , while not including every name occurring in the lists , contains over 30,000 entries , including a number of politically relevant persons not appearing in the lists .

Cuz i gotta tell you – it feels AWESOME !
and not because it ’s payday , which is nice , but you can actually see * how much * money you ’re earning in the purest form .
It ’s an incredible feeling !
I usually just deposit it right away , but w/ some of the weirdness going on here at work lately , I figured better to be safe than sorry this round .
It ’s not that i do n’t trust our company , cuz i really do , but it ’s just annoying having to worry about your check bouncing every now and then .
For once i wanted to know 100 % that i have the money and it ’s safe and sound .
Plus , i was up for the adventure ;)
So , i followed a fellow co-worker to the bank where the check was issued from ( that way it clears % 100 and you get cash right away ) , paid my $ 5 fee for doing so ( i hate banks ) , and out we walked full of greenbacks !
It was the first time i clearly saw my paycheck – and i was mesmerized .
I could n’t believe i brought in THAT much every 2 weeks !
We all know how much we make , but there ’s a HUGE difference seeing it electronically over piles of cash .
A slew of feelings took me over , and it went something like this ( in order ) :
WOW , $ 1802.00 in pure cash sitting right in front of me !
, $ 1802.00 in pure cash sitting right in front of me !
I ’m so proud of myself , that ’s a lot of money !
I wonder how many $ 50 ’s are actually in there ? ( 36 )
Man , imagine all of the stuff i can buy with this !
( i daydream for a bit … )
$ hit , every last bit has already been budgeted for …
, every last bit has already been budgeted for …
I ca n’t believe i go through ALL THIS every 2 weeks .
How the hell do other people survive on much less ?
I REALLY need to figure out a way to keep more of this .
need to figure out a way to keep more of this .
How cool would it be to go 100 % cash from now on and F the computer age ?
I really hate seeing this …it ’ll all be gone in no time .
Damn , i hope no one jacks me on the way home !
My emotions really were all over the place , it ’s just so CRAZY how the mind interprets the money this way .
I mean , it ’s still the SAME $ 1802.00 , right ?
How can seeing it in actual dollars be that much different than seing the # up there on the screen ?
I do n’t have the answers for you , but what i DO know is that it was quite majestic :)
A feeling that has since come and gone , but a beautiful one all the same .
I ’m not sure if i’ll try it again anytime soon – losing $ 5 each time and then carrying around all that money before re-depositing is pretty insane – but i’m willing to bet i’d find ways to keep more of that cash around !
Have any of you tried this ?
Or maybe get paid this way in your line of work ;) bow chicka , wha wha !

The diversity of bacteria is represented in this artist rendering .
Amateur biologists are goofing around with genetics in garage - based labs that some fear could unleash new and dangerous life forms .
The new effort , dubbed biohacking , harkens to revolutions in infotech hatched by individuals that founded Apple , Hewlett Packard and Google .
While , individual kitchen - counter chemists may become biohackers , the field has already become organized :
One of the more serious examples is a community lab set up by a Cambridge , Mass .
group called DIYbio ( do - it - yourself biology ) .
Co-founder Mackenzie Cowell said amateurs might do things as diverse as creating new vaccines to using squid genes to make tattoos that glow .
" We should try to make science more sexy and more fun and more like a game , " Cowell said in an Associated Press story .
Some worry things could get out of control , with dangerous organisms escaping a lab .
" Once you move to people working in their garage or other informal location , there 's no safety process in place , " said Jim Thomas of ETC Group , a biotechnology watchdog .
At the root of biohacking is the field of synthetic biology , which is not new .
For years , researchers have been trying to engineer and build or redesign living organisms , such as bacteria , to carry out specific functions .
The field is a scientific playground for the genetic code , where previously nonexistent DNA is formulated in test tubes .
The promise is that the novel organisms will fight disease , create alternative fuels or build living computers .
The field " is potentially controversial because it raises issues of ownership , misuse , unintended consequences and accidental release , " according to a report earlier this year commissioned by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council in England .

Meanwhile , research on the professional side has made great strides .
Scientists last year took a big step toward creating artificial life with the successful transplant of genetic material from one microbe species into the cellular body of another .
" It 's equivalent to converting a Macintosh computer to a PC by inserting a new piece of software , " said J. Craig Venter , who leads the J. Craig Venter Institute in Maryland where the research was conducted .
Venter 's life story will resonate with the new garage - based biotinkerers .
He is known for setting up his own company that raced a government effort to fully sequence the first human genome .
Venter 's team aims to create artificial life with lab - crafted genomes .
Also on the horizon : Cybrids .
A British group plans to " inject human DNA into empty eggs from cows , to create embryos known as cytoplasmic hybrids that are 99.9 per cent human in genetic terms , " according to an article earlier this year in The Times of London .
The approach at DIYbio sounds downright fun .
The group started by showing amateurs how to extract DNA and do genetic fingerprinting using the kitchen sink and stuff around the house .
Cowell and his colleagues see their effort as one to democratize science .
" It shows you how much science can be about duct tape and having a few screws in the right place , " Cowell said in a Boston Globe article in September .
" It shatters that clinical image . "
Americans Clueless About Plans to Create New Life Forms
The Freakiest Lab Animals
Robert Roy Britt is the Editorial Director of Imaginova .
In this column , The Water Cooler , he takes a daily look at what people are talking about in the world of science and beyond .
Leon is a famous daddy .
Or he is to his daughter .
He 's on television as often as she wants him to be , reading and re-reading her favourite stories and waving goodbye to her at the end of each tale .
In his DVD for the story Let 's Go Home , Little Bear , Leon wears his regulation - issue grey sweatshirt .
He reads to the camera .
Sometimes the shot cuts away to a scene in the book or the characters from the pages appear , as if by magic , moving on the wall behind him .
At the end of the tale , Leon asks his little girl to be good and to look after her mummy .
After watching the story , Leon 's partner writes to tell him how much his daughter — who was n't even born when her daddy went away — adores the bedtime stories he sends her .
Leon is telling this bedtime story in a converted wing of Dartmoor prison .
" He 's never met his daughter — she just knows him as the ' man in the telly ' , " says Sharon Berry , creator of Storybook Dads .
We are watching the film at the prison .
Suddenly , Leon stops in mid-sentence and his image freezes .
" We need to go back and check the sound there and re-do the animation a bit , " says Domonic , one of Leon 's fellow inmates and unofficially the most valued editor on a scheme designed to allow prisoners to record bedtime stories for their children .
A survey by alltopbooks.com in June , revealed that one in three parents never reads bedtime stories , many claiming it 's because they do n't have time .
In Dartmoor , where time is just what all the fathers do have , story - reading is a popular activity .
" On the outside , I read the odd story to my daughter , " Domonic says .
" But since I 've been in here I 've read her loads .
She 's five now and I 've lost count of how many I 've done .
" At first you feel a bit daft reading a baby 's story out loud into a recorder .
It 's even worse listening to them being played back , the mistakes you make , how dull a story sounds .
But her mum told me she loved hearing them and I worked hard to make them better . "
The scheme was developed by Berry — an adult literacy teacher — using audio CDs .
Then a visit by a TV producer inspired her to dabble in DVD stories and to introduce the puppets .
You would think going back on the wings known as the man who spends all day playing with kids ' toys would be a bad move in prison , but it 's quite the opposite .
" Just by making a story in here , or writing your own ones like a lot of dads do , you 're doing something positive , " says Domonic .
Then he dons his headphones and sits at a PC under a barred window to digitally refine Leon 's story .
His co-editor , Chris , chips in : " It 's because you 're doing something worthwhile and you 're learning new skills , " he explains .
" I worked in IT before I came in here so I 'm good with the technical stuff .
Domonic has learned loads .
He developed the DVDs and the animation from scratch .
He 'd never really used a computer before he came here . "
Terri Bailey , Berry 's assistant and one of six " civilians " working on the project , admits they will miss Domonic when he 's released .
" He 's great at getting the others to read comfortably .
It 's daunting when you first record a bedtime story , especially to camera , but he has a joke with them and it puts the nervous ones at ease , " she says .
" We keep joking that he should try to come back to Dartmoor ! "
Dominic is adamant he wo n't be returning .
" Doing the kids ' stories is a reminder of what you 're missing .
I 'd like to do a sound engineer or film editing job when I get out .
I wo n't because of my record — but if ever they set up something like this outside I 'd apply . "
Storybook Dads already exists outside the prison system .
Berry was asked to advise the army on setting up Storybook Soldiers after a chance meeting in 2004 .
Today , servicemen and women record bedtime stories and messages to their loved ones from Iraq and Afghanistan following the Dartmoor template .
On the day of our visit , an observer from the Royal Air Force Association is there too , taking notes on how the logistics of such a scheme might work for RAF personnel around the world .
" Back on the wings , it 's all the typical macho , hard man stuff you probably expect prison to be , " says Domonic .
" But in the editing suite , you see a more human side .
When they 're talking about their kids or flicking through the storybooks or choosing which puppet they 'll do a DVD with , you see some blokes soften up . "
Bailey shows me files of responses from prisoners who have submitted stories .
They contain lines about how their children have loved hearing daddy 's voice and seeing him smile ; some say the stories are better than the newspapers and magazines they get .
There are cards on the sills at the barred windows from families thanking Berry and the team and photographs of Princess Anne watching Domonic in action at his editing desk alongside Terry Waite .
All the equipment and the civilian staff are paid for by the charity .
Inmates do n't pay to record stories on to audio CD , but there is a charge — equivalent to the cost of a week 's tobacco — for those wanting to record a story on to DVD .
Not every Storybook Dad wants to record a DVD .
Bailey plays us an audio story sent by an illiterate prisoner from another jail .
He recorded Goldilocks and the Three Bears for his daughters , with the aid of a prison visitor .
She reads each line and he copies her .
Then the editors at Dartmoor edit out her prompts and add sound effects .
On hearing the finished version , the prisoner said it was the best thing he had ever given his children .
But the editors left his final message untouched , with the imprisoned father 's voice faltering and breaking up as he wishes his girls goodnight and sweet dreams and to tell them he 'll see them again one day soon …

Standby Kill Chip : The End of Vampire Power ?
December 4th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
We ’ve seen lots of tools recently to stop vampire power — the power used by electronics when they ’re off and still plugged in — but the Standby Kill Chip may be the best .
The chip is installed directly in electronics or power strips .
It uses an algorithm that senses when an electronic device is in standby mode and shuts it off .
Of course , computer users who actually want their laptop to stay in standby mode might not appreciate this , but the chip ’s inventors say their product works in any device featuring a standby mode — including cell phones , TVs , microwave ovens , and washing machines .
Best of all , appliances do n’t need to go through start - up mode when they ’re reactivated .
When the “ on ” button is pressed , they go directly to standby .
The Standby Kill Chip is still in prototype mode , and is currently being tested by NH Hotels SA of Spain in 50,000 hotel rooms .
If it works , you can bet I ’ll have a bunch of these in my house .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
onscientious objector Noam Gur sentenced to a second term in prison for her refusal to join the Israeli Army .
On Sunday the 29th of April , Noam Gur , was sentenced for additional 10 days in prison for her refusal to enlist .
This is her second consecutive prison term .
She is held in military prison no .
6 , and is due to be released from prison on May 7th .
However , she is likely to be imprisoned again soon afterwards .
Prisoners in isolation cells are not allowed books or other reading material .
They are subjected to eating their meals alone in their cells .
During the day their mattresses are removed from their beds .
Noam could only endure isolation for one day and agreed to wear a uniform for the duration of her prison term .
During her first prison sentence Noam refused to wear a uniform .
For disobeying orders she was put in isolation and would only be allowed to join the prison population if she agreed to wear a uniform .
Noam sends her thanks to all of you who have sent her support letters .
But there were other difficulties .
Noam is vegan and this proved to be very problematic .
The army was not prepared , or was not willing , to provide Noam with her full nutritional needs .
In the past the army allowed vegans to bring their own food supplies into the prisons .
However this procedure has been changed and we filed a complaint .
It was only after we intervened did the army provide her with her with food fit for vegans .
Her prison address is :
Noam Gur
Military ID 6084062
Military Prison No. 6
Israel
Fax : Military Postal Code 01860 , IDFIsraelFax : ++972-4-9540580
Since the prison authorities often block mail from reaching imprisoned objectors , we also recommend you to send them your letters of support and encouragement via e-mail to : messages2prison@newprofile.org ( hitting “ reply all ” to this message will send the message to the same address ) , and they will be printed out and delivered during visits .
Recommended Action
First of all , please circulate this message and the information contained in it as widely as possible , not only through e-mail , but also on websites , social networks , conventional media , by word of mouth , etc .
Other recommendations for action :
1. Sending Letters of Support
Please send Noam letters of support to the prison address above and to messages2prison@newprofile.org .
2. Letters to Authorities
It is recommended to send letters of protest on the objectors ’ behalf , preferably by fax , to :
Copies of your letters can also be sent to the commander of the military prison at :
Military Prison No. 6
Military Postal Code 01860 , IDF
Israel
Fax : Commander of Military Prison No. 6 , Military Prison No. 6 Military Postal Code 01860 , IDFIsraelFax : ++972-4-9540580
Another useful address for sending copies would be the Military Attorney General :
Chief Military Attorney
Military postal code 9605 , IDF
Israel
Fax : Denny Efroni , Chief Military AttorneyMilitary postal code 9605 , IDFIsraelFax : ++972-3-569-45-26
It would be especially useful to send your appeals to the Commander of the Induction Base in Tel - HaShomer .
It is this officer that ultimately decides whether an objector is to be exempted from military service or sent to another round in prison , and it is the same officer who is ultimately in charge of the military Conscience Committee :
Commander of Induction Base ,
Meitav , Tel - HaShomer
Military Postal Code 02718 , IDF
Israel .
Fax : Gil Ben Shaul , Commander of Induction Base , Meitav , Tel-HaShomerMilitary Postal Code 02718 , IDFIsrael .Fax : ++972-3-737-60-52
For those of you who live outside Israel , it would be very effective to send protests to your local Israeli embassy .
You can find the address of your local embassy on the web .
Here is a generic sample letter , which you can use in sending appeals to authorities on the prisoners ’ behalf .
Feel free to modify this letter or write your own :
Dear Sir / Madam ,
It has come to my attention that Noam Gur ( military ID 6084062 ) , a conscientious objector to military service , has been imprisoned for the second time for his refusal to become part of the Israeli army , and is held in Military Prison no .
6 near Atlit .
The imprisonment of conscientious objectors such as Noam Gur is a violation of international law , of basic human rights and of plain morals .
This is especially clear in cases , such as Gur ’s , in which conscientious objectors are being sentenced repeatedly for their self - same decision to refuse enlistment .
I therefore call for the immediate and unconditional release from prison of Noam Gur , without threat of further imprisonment in the future , and urge you and the system you are heading to respect the dignity and person of conscientious objectors , indeed of all persons , in the future .
Sincerely ,
American balladeer Woody Guthrie was fond of saying during the Great Depression that he did not know which was the bigger crime : to rob a bank , or to own one .
In that era thousands of banks failed , while the remainder foreclosed on mortgages with a vengeance which resonates in today 's difficult housing market .
While it makes little sense for banks to throw families out of their homes rather than to re-negotiate subprime and other mortgages , that is just what many banks are doing .
Meanwhile , some of those same banks , particularly the giant ones such as Bank of America , have received billions of dollars of Federal bailout funds under the TARP program , funds for which they refuse to provide a full accounting .
Indeed , when questioned about what they are doing with all of that taxpayer money ( even if much of those funds come from increases in the public debt , taxpayers will have to pay off the interest on that debt ) , most of the recipient banks turn a deaf ear and blind eye .
Those same banks , however , have far from a deaf ear and blind eye to the slightest infraction of their often - arcane and always - complex rules and regulations ; when it comes to such infractions , they are all - seeing , all - hearing , and all - knowing .
Take , for example , the monthly fees for accounts at the nation 's largest bank , Bank of America ( it 's sort of like Mall of America in Minnesota , but not as much fun . )
Thisbank typically charges monthly fees of $ 11 for the privilege of having an account .
When my wife and I moved to Georgia , we explored opening an account at Bank of America , along with several other banks which we checked , and their fees were considerably the highest in our area .
When I wrote to the corporate level to protest such excessive monthly fees , I finally received a phone call from a Bank of America honcho who told me their fees were only average – so I did a survey and found that to be untrue , which I conveyed to the honcho .
His response could be characterized as : " my mind is made up , do n't bother me with the facts . "
Bank of America refuses to provide a clear statement or explanation of what they did with the billions of dollars of TARP bailout funds they have received so far ; indeed , their utterances are worthy of the Greek Oracle at Delphi .
The Godfather , in the classic film series of that title , supposedly made you an offer could n't refuse .
When it comes to providing bailout information , Bank of America makes you an offer you can't understand , using roundabout and vague language to avoid tell you what they did with all of that ultimately - taxpayer money .
That is really shameful .
Take another example : Sun Trust Bank , based in Atlanta , which is neither sunny nor trustworthy .
Should you make a small accidental overdraft , perhaps from paying an item from the wrong account , Sun Trust will charge you a $ 35 fee which repeats every seven days until they close your account after thirty days .
Should this be an account from which periodic payments are made , those payments will start to bounce – even if additional funds are put into the account , as Sun Trust is in no rush to tell you that they closed your account and your payments are therefore not going through .
This can have serious financial and even legal consequences , as writing bad checks can be a crime .
Sun Trust refuses to change this user - harmful policy , or even to discuss it .
But Sun
Trust is apparently another recipient of TARP bailout funds ; one must say ' apparently ' , as the U.S. Treasury Department , which distributes those funds , makesit difficult to find out how to find out exactly what was done with those billions of dollars .
Nor will Sun Trust itself tell its customers or the general public what TARP money they have received ; inquiries go unanswered , even those to top executives .
When it comes to transparency , America 's banks and other financial institutions receiving some of the TARP largesse are as opaque as it is possible to be .
Yet , in our present economic malaise , every American has an absolute right to know what has been done with our money , and to judge the effectiveness and appropriateness of those actions .
When I gave up trying to get that information from several banks , I asked the U.S. Treasury for it – and found no more transparency from the officesof Hank Paulsen , Treasury Secretary , and Neel Kashkari , bailout administrator , thanfrom the bank recipients .
That reality is even more shameful .
Finally , several weeks ago , I wrote to the Office of the Inspector General at the U.S. Treasury Department , supposedly the watchdogs over Treasury conduct and misconduct .
The Inspector General 's office has also failed to provide any bailout information , or to tell me how to secure such information , or to provide a real email address for any Treasury official handling the TARP bailout .
Perhaps those failures are the most shameful of all .
The ' Godfather ' made you an offer you could n't refuse ; the banks seem to make offers you can't understand ; but the United States Treasury Department makes no offers of information at all .
Shame on them !

Apple is trying to use the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) to stop the iPodHash project , and thereby to restrict the freedom of iPod owners who'd prefer to use alternatives to iTunes , such as Songbird and WinAmp .
Since Apple does not make iTunes available for Linux , this is also an attack on open source users who own iPods .
It could even result in BluWiki -- which has received a " cease and desist " order from Apple -- being forced offline .
The background is that Apple has added a new hashing algorithm to its iTunesDB database file -- which stores user data , such as the details and location of each song on the iPod , as obfuscated by Apple -- to prevent anyone else 's software from writing to it .
The iPodHash project is an attempt to crack the latest hash .
The use of the hash suggests Apple is trying to exploit its monopoly market shares of the portable MP3 player market and iTunes online store to force iPod owners to use iTunes for Windows .
Apple uses iTunes to foist its QuickTime media player on Windows users .
It has also deceived some users into installing its Safari browser for Windows by offering it as an " update " .
Cracking the " iPod hash " would enable rival software to work with iPods .
Interoperbility is the aim of the iPodHash project , and interoperability is specifically allowed for by the DCMA .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation has offered to get involved , and has published Apple Confuses Speech with a DMCA Violation , a Legal Analysis by Fred von Lohmann .
He says : " Short answer : Apple does n't have a DMCA leg to stand on . "
There 's also a long answer .
One problem is that nobody knows who created the iPodHash pages on BluWiki .
The operator , Sam Odio , asked him or her to come forward :
Please contact Fred at the EFF .
Fred is looking to protect your right to free speech online .
But he can't do so if we do n't work with him .
Because Fred has expressed interest in representing both you and BluWiki , all communication is confidential and protected under the attorney - client privilege .
Communication with Fred can not be released in court .
If you do not contact Fred , and the EFF does not represent us , we will be forced to comply with all of Apple 's demands .
If Apple chooses to litigate against us , we will probably exhaust all funds in our defense .
Out of money , BluWiki could ultimately be forced offline .
This would be one more small step backwards in the fight for the right to free speech .
Later , Odio published an email from the author In defense of Ipodhash .

Republican John McCain says he has spoken to Democrat Barack Obama and congratulated him on winning the US election .
Speaking of his disappointment he added " we must work together to get this country moving again " .
Natalie Hickey left her small hometown in Ohio six years ago and aimed her beat - up Dodge Intrepid for the West Coast .
Four years later , she realized a long - held dream and graduated with a bachelor ’s degree in photography from Brooks Institute in Santa Barbara .
She also picked up $ 140,000 in student debt , some of it at interest rates as high as 18 % .
Her monthly payments are roughly $ 1,700 , more than her rent and car payment combined .
“ I do n’t have all this debt because I was buying stuff , ” said Hickey , who now lives in Texas .
“ I was just trying to pay tuition , living on ramen noodles and doing everything as cheaply as I could . ”
Hickey got caught in an increasingly common trap in the nation ’s $ 85 - billion student loan market .
She borrowed heavily , presuming that all her debt was part of the federal student loan program .
Advertisement
But most of the money she borrowed was actually in private loans , the fastest - growing segment of the student loan market .
Private loans have no relation to the federal loan program , with one exception :
In many cases , they are offered by the same for - profit companies that provide federally funded student loans .
As a result , some students who think they are getting a federal loan find out later that they hold a private loan .
The difference can be costly .
Whereas federally guaranteed loans have fixed interest rates , currently either 6 % or 6.8 % , private loans are more like credit card debt .
Interest rates are n’t fixed and often run 15 % or more , not counting fees .
Most students have little experience in taking out loans , yet the federal government does n’t require lenders to disclose the total cost of a student loan and other terms upfront -- before signing -- as it does for car loans and mortgages .
Advertisement
“ Students are in the cross hairs , being bombarded by very sophisticated and , to some extent , ethically marginal lenders , ” said Rep. George Miller ( D - Martinez ) , who sponsored legislation passed this year that will require lenders to provide more disclosures on fees .
“ My fear is that we are developing a predatory market , just like we have had in mortgages . ”
About $ 15 billion in private student loans are expected to be funded this year , a 900 % increase from a decade ago , according to the nonprofit College Board .
Private loans are growing faster than federally guaranteed loans , which rose 59 % over the same period , in part because of limits on how much students can borrow with the government ’s backing .
Four years at a public university , including room and board , costs an average of $ 57,332 , according to the College Board .
The average tab for a private university is $ 136,528 .
Yet the maximum that can be borrowed under the federal loan program is $ 31,000 .
High - cost private loans fill that gap .
One result is that students now average nearly $ 20,000 in debt by the time they graduate , twice as much as a decade ago .
Advertisement
“ There is an alignment of interests that lead students to take out larger and larger amounts of debt , ” said Luke Swarthout , a former higher education advocate at the U.S. Public Interest Research Group in Washington .
“ The students think it ’s an investment in their future , and the colleges are willing to let them borrow heavily because it helps them fill in their enrollment . ”

In the dark

Hickey knew she would need loans to complete her degree , so she went to the campus financial aid office as a freshman .
After she filled out paperwork , Brooks Institute set her up in a loan program administered by Sallie Mae , the nation ’s biggest student lender .
Sallie Mae was chartered by the federal government in 1972 , and most of its business is in issuing federally insured student loans .
But while it may appear to be a quasi - government agency , it is in fact a for - profit company whose stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange .
Hickey ended up with $ 20,000 in low - interest federally guaranteed loans issued by Sallie Mae , and $ 120,000 in higher - interest private loans issued by Sallie Mae .
Hickey said no one explained the difference to her .
Advertisement
“ The financial aid officer just said that my federal loans were n’t enough to pay the tuition , but that was OK because they had these great alternative loans , ” Hickey said .
“ They made it sound so good that I did n’t ask that many questions . ”
Tim Halsey , vice president of finance for Brooks Institute , declined to discuss Hickey ’s case directly , citing federal privacy laws .
But he said the school ’s financial aid officers take great pains to explain the differences between loans and to guide students to the best deals .
“ It is really to our advantage to get the loans and interest rates as low as possible , ” Halsey said .
“ My motivation is to get that person to come to the school , if that ’s what they want to do .
If I can get those costs as low as possible , it benefits us both . ”

Spotty disclosure
But some lenders market directly to students , and consumer advocates say they often fail to clearly detail loan costs and may even seek to present themselves as part of a school ’s financial aid office .
For a glimpse into how lenders operate , The Times filled out online loan applications with JPMorgan Chase & Co. , Sallie Mae and MyRichUncle .
An 18 - year - old student who began college this fall agreed to provide personal information , including her Social Security number , so that lenders would provide detailed loan terms .
Advertisement
JPMorgan Chase , the giant New York bank , did not disclose its interest rates or fees in the online application .
Sallie Mae , which is based in Reston , Va. , disclosed an interest rate and fee , but an attached disclaimer in capital letters said the numbers were preliminary “ and may change . ”
The third , MyRichUncle , a New York - based student loan firm formed in 2005 , disclosed a variable rate that starts at 9.6 % and said there would be an unspecified origination fee .
The loan companies provided a bit more information over the phone .
A MyRichUncle representative said its origination fee would be 2 % .
A Chase agent said the variable rate would start at 7.5 % with no origination fee , and Sallie Mae said its variable rate would be 8 % , also with no fee .
Advertisement
After initially resisting , agents for Sallie Mae and Chase both agreed to provide summaries of the loan costs in writing .
But the one - page letters they mailed did not include the total cost of the loan over time .
The Times then called all three lenders to discuss their practices .
MyRichUncle co-founder Raza Khan said that the failure to state the amount of the origination fee in the online application was a mistake and that the information was now included .
Sallie Mae spokeswoman Martha Holler maintained that the company ’s disclosures were adequate .
JPMorgan Chase spokeswoman Mary Kay Bean said the loan terms would be sent after the loan had been approved , pointing out that the company was not required to do so beforehand .

“ We send borrowers a letter with the rate , ” Bean said .
“ We comply with the law .
That ’s it . ”

Lenders in disguise
When Shianily Torres took out $ 38,000 in student loans at Florida ’s International Academy of Design and Technology , she thought she was dealing with the college financial aid office .
Advertisement
She now thinks it may actually have been a representative of Sallie Mae -- in part because that was the only company that offered her a loan .
“ My father asked if there was somewhere else we could get the loan and they said no .
The school did n’t accept money from just any bank , ” Torres said .
Torres said she did n’t learn the rate on her loan until after graduation , when she got the bill .
The variable rate rose as high as 18.5 % , which requires a monthly payment of $ 650 -- more than twice what she makes in her part - time job .
She said that she could n’t make the payments , and that Sallie Mae had not responded to her efforts to renegotiate terms .

An investigation last year by New York Atty .
Gen. Andrew Cuomo found an “ unholy alliance ” between lenders and hundreds of schools across the country .
Charging more than a dozen lenders with wrongdoing , Cuomo cited a pattern of bribes to financial aid officers making decisions about which lenders would appear on school - preferred lender lists and “ revenue - sharing ” kickbacks -- in cash or products -- to schools that led their students to specific companies .
Hundreds of colleges agreed to abide by new ethics rules and not to accept gifts , and half a dozen even refunded money to students .
The U.S. Department of Education tightened its guidelines to discourage quid pro quo arrangements .
More than a dozen student lenders , including Sallie Mae , Bank of America , Citibank and JPMorganChase , paid a combined $ 13.7 million to settle Cuomo ’s charges , without admitting or denying the allegations .
Advertisement
Private litigation continues , however .
Torres is one of dozens of students who are suing Sallie Mae , alleging deception and discriminatory practices that left low - income and minority students saddled with the highest - cost loans .
Andrew Meyer , the Tampa , Fla. , attorney handling the case , said his law firm gained insight into Sallie Mae ’s practices from people who formerly worked there as loan officers .
A key strategy was to make students believe the loan officers worked directly for the college , he said .
Meyer said Sallie
Mae purposely sent disclosure forms a month or more after classes had begun so that students would be less likely to protest onerous terms .
Sallie Mae ’s
Holler said she could not comment on litigation , but she defended the company ’s lending practices .
Advertisement
“ It ’s risk - based pricing , ” she said .
“ Students can take advantage of an interest rate decline , like we ’ve seen in the past several months , but the loan rates also have the potential to rise when there is a rising rate environment . ”

Direct marketing
In addition to working with schools , lenders try to reach students directly .
Although some companies have failed in the credit crunch , dozens remain in business , sending e-mails to students and advertising on sites such as YouTube .
Advertisement
Loan - shopping websites also lure young people into private loans , said Nancy Coolidge , a financial aid executive with the UC Board of Regents .
She noted that one site -- TuitionBids.com -- encouraged students to seek federal loans first but also had a “ let the bidding begin ” button that directed users to an application for a private loan .
“ The way the site is set up encourages misunderstanding , ” Coolidge said .
“ They do what we ask by saying that private loans should be a last resort , but then ask , ‘ Are you interested ? ’
When the kid clicks yes , they ’re catapulted to a private loan . ”
Keith Alliotts , chief executive of TuitionBids.com , counters that customers are able to choose either a private or a federally guaranteed loan .
Advertisement
“ We do n’t advocate just private loans , we tell borrowers to get federal money first , ” he said .
“ But a lot of people need private loans . ”
But Alliotts acknowledged that TuitionBids.com receives a loan fee when a customer secures a private loan .
The website makes nothing when consumers get a federally guaranteed loan .

Federal loan limits

Marja Lopees of Burbank is a few years out of school and makes about $ 70,000 a year as a lawyer .
But she racked up $ 196,253 in debt and says her student loan payments swallow 40 % of her earnings .
Lopees turned to private loans when she hit borrowing limits imposed by the federal student loan program .
Now she has $ 88,303 in private loans that charge an interest rate of 8.84 % .
The payment on that loan is her second - largest monthly expense , after rent .
“ I ’m making interest - only payments on one of the loans , and still the payments keep going up , ” she said .
“ It ’s just overwhelming . ”
When she just makes minimum payments , her debt and rent consume 60 % of her after - tax income .
That ’s before she pays for food , clothing , utilities , and gasoline or saves for long - term goals .

“ No one tells you to be careful of taking on too much debt when you ’re in school , ” she said .
“ It ’s just the opposite .
They just keep giving you loans and saying , ‘ Do n’t worry about it .
You ’re going to be a lawyer .
It ’s no big deal . ’ ”

How can C Programs be so Reliable ?
C is , today , a unique programming language .
Surprisingly few people can really program in C and yet many of us have quite strong opinions about it .
Buffer overflows , stack smashing , integer overflows - C has many well publicised flaws , and these terms are often bandied about confidently , even by those unfamiliar with C. Personally I shied away from C for a decade , for one reason or another : originally , compilers were expensive ( this being the days before free UNIX clones were readily available ) and slow ; the culture was intimidatory ; and , of course , all the C scare stories made me think that a mere mortal programmer such as myself would never be able to write a reliable C program .
Discounting a couple of tiny C modules that I created largely by blindly cutting and pasting from other places , the first C program I wrote was the Converge VM .
Two things from this experience surprised me .
First , writing C programs turned out not to be that difficult .
With hindsight , I should have realised that a youth misspent writing programs in assembler gave me nearly all the mental tools I needed - after all , C is little more than a high - level assembly language .
Once one has understood a concept such as pointers ( arguably the trickiest concept in low - level languages , having no simple real - world analogy ) in one language , one has understood it in every language .
Second , the Converge VM has n't been riddled with bugs as I expected .
In fact , ignoring logic errors that would have happened in any language , only two C - specific errors have thus far caused any real problem in the Converge VM ( please note , I 'm sure there are lots of bugs lurking - but I 'm happy not to have hit too many of them yet ) .
One was a list which was n't correctly NULL terminated ( a classic C error ) ; that took a while to track down .
The other was much more subtle , and took several days , spread over a couple of months , to solve .
The Converge garbage collector can conservatively garbage collect arbitrary malloc 'd chunks of memory , looking for pointers .
In all modern architectures , pointers have to live on word - aligned boundaries .
However , malloc 'd chunks of memory are often not word - aligned in length .
Thus sometimes the garbage collector would try and read the 4 bytes of memory starting at position 4 in a chunk - even if that chunk that was only 5 bytes long .
In other words , the garbage collector tried to read in 1 byte of proper data and 3 bytes of possibly random stuff in an area of memory it did n't theoretically have access to .
The rare , and subtle , errors this led to were almost impossible to reason about .
But let 's be honest - in how many languages can one retrospectively add a garbage collector ?
My experience with the Converge VM did n't really fit my previous prejudices .
I had implicitly bought into the idea that C programs segfault at random , eat data , and generally act like Vikings on a day trip to Lindisfarne ; in contrast , programs written in higher level languages supposedly fail in nice , predictable patterns .
Gradually it occurred to me that virtually all of the software that I use on a daily basis - that to which I entrust my most important data - is written in C .
And I can't remember the last time there was a major problem with any of this software - it 's reliable in the sense that it does n't crash , and also reliable in the sense that it handles minor failures gracefully .
Granted , I am extremely fussy about the software I use ( I 've been an OpenBSD user for 9 years or so , and software does n't get much better than that ) , and there are some obvious reasons as to why it might be so reliable : it 's used by ( relatively ) large numbers of people , who help shake out bugs ; the software has been developed over a long period of time , so previous generations bore the brunt of the bugs ; and , if we 're being brutally honest , only fairly competent programmers tend to use C in the first place .
But still , the fundamental question remained : why is so much of the software I use in C so reliable ?
After a dark period of paper writing , I 've recently been doing a little bit of C programming .
As someone who , at some points , spends far too much time away from home , reliably sending e-mail has always been an issue .
For several years I have sent e-mail by piping messages to a sendmail process on a remote machine via ssh .
While this solves several problems ( e.g. blacklisting ) , it has the problem that on many networks ( particularly wireless networks ) a surprising number of network connections get dropped .
Checking that each e-mail has been sent is a frustrating process .
So , having mulled on its design for a little while , I decided to create a simple utility to robustly send e-mail via ssh .
The resulting program - extsmail - has more features than I 'd originally expected , but the basic idea is simply to retry sending messages via an external command such as ssh , until the message has been successfully sent .
I also wanted the utility to be as frugal with resources as practical , and to be as portable as possible .
This inevitably led to extsmail being written in C .
I then decided , as an experiment , to try and write this , as far as possible , in the traditional UNIX way : only to rely on features found in all sensible UNIX clones and to be robust against failure .
In so doing , I made two observations , new to me , about writing software in C .
The first observation is semi-obvious .
Because software written in C can fail in so many ways , I was much more careful than normal when writing it .
In particular , anything involved in manipulating chunks of memory raises the prospect of off - by - one type errors - which are particularly dangerous in C .
Whereas in a higher - level language I might be lazy and think hmm , do I need to subtract 1 from this value when I index into the array ?
Let 's run it and find out , in C I thought OK , let 's sit down and reason about this .
Ironically , the time taken to run-and - discover often seems not to be much different to sit - down - and - think - except the latter is a lot more mentally draining .
The second observation is something I had not previously considered .
In C there is no exception handling .
If , as in the case of extsmail , one wants to be robust against errors , one has to handle all possible error paths oneself .
This is extremely painful in one way - a huge proportion ( I would guess at least 40 % ) of extsmail is dedicated to detecting and recovering from errors - although made easier by the fact that UNIX functions always carefully detail how and when they will fail .
In other words , when one calls a function like stat in C , the documentation lists all the failure conditions ; the user can then easily choose which errors conditions he wishes his program to recover from , and which are fatal to further execution ( in extsmail , out of memory errors are about the only fatal errors ) .
This is a huge difference in mind - set from exception based languages , where the typical philosophy is to write code as normal , only rarely inserting try ... catch blocks to recover from specific errors ( which are only sporadically documented ) .
Java , with its checked exceptions , takes a different approach telling the user you must try and catch these specific exceptions when you call this function .
What I realised is that neither exception - based approach is appropriate when one wishes to make software as robust as possible .
What one needs is to know exactly which errors / exceptions a function can return / raise , and then deal with each on a case - by - case basis .
While it is possible that modern IDEs could ( indeed , they may well do , for all I know ) automatically show you some of the exceptions that a given function can raise , this can only go so far .
Theoretically speaking , sub- classing and polymorphism in OO languages means that pre-compiled libraries can not be sure what exceptions a given function call may raise ( since subclasses may overload functions , which can then raise different exceptions ) .
From a practical point of view , I suspect that many functions would claim to raise so many different exceptions that the user would be overwhelmed : in contrast , the UNIX functions are very aware that they need to minimise the amount of errors that they return to the user , either by recovering from internal failure , or by grouping errors .
I further suspect that many libraries that rely on exception handling would need to be substantially rewritten to reduce the number of exceptions they raise to a reasonable number .
Furthermore , it is the caller of a function who needs to determine which errors are minor and can be recovered from , and which cause more fundamental problems , possibly resulting in the program exiting ; checked exceptions , by forcing the caller to deal with certain exceptions , miss the point here .
Henry Spencer said ,
Those who do n't understand UNIX are doomed to reinvent it , poorly .
And that 's probably why so many of the programs written in C are more reliable than our prejudices might suggest - the UNIX culture , the oldest and wisest in mainstream computing , has found ways of turning some of C's limitations and flaws into advantages .
As my experience shows , I am yet another person to slowly realise this .
All that said , I do n't recommend using C unless much thought has been given to the decision - the resulting software might be reliable , but it will have taken a significant human effort to produce it .

The USB Implementers Forum has completed its development of USB 3.0 , aka “ SuperSpeed USB . ”
The new specification , offering a maximum data transfer rate ten times that of USB 2.0 , is now available for download .
Despite its 10 x speed hike — to 5 gigabits per second — SuperSpeed USB provides backward compatibility with USB 2.0 , the USB Implementers Forum ( USB - IF ) claims .
In contrast , USB 2.0 offered up to 480 Mbps and the original USB crawled along at 1.5 Mbps .
In addition to the speed increase , other differences between SuperSpeed USB and USB 2.0 are summarized in the following table , which appears in the USB 3.0 specification :
Characteristic SuperSpeed USB USB 2.0 Data Rate SuperSpeed ( 5.0 Gbps ) Low - speed ( 1.5 Mbps ) , full - speed ( 12 Mbps ) ; high - speed ( 480 Mbps ) Data Interface Dual - simplex , four - wire differential signaling separate from USB 2.0 signaling ; simultaneous bi-directional data flows
Half - duplex two - wire differential signaling ; unidirectional data flow with negotiated directional bus transitions Cable signal count Six : four for SuperSpeed data path ; two for non-SuperSpeed data path Two : for low - speed / full - speed / high - speed data path Bus transaction protocol Host directed , asynchronous traffic flow ; packet traffic is explicitly routed Host directed , polled traffic flow ; packet traffic is broadcast to all devices Power management Multi - level link power management supporting idle , sleep , and suspend states ; Link- , Device - , and Function - level power management Port - level suspend with two levels of entry / exit latency ; device - level power management Bus power Same as for USB 2.0 , with a 50 % increase for unconfigured power and an 80 % increase for configured power Support for low / high bus -powered devices , with lower power limits for unconfigured and suspended devices Port State Port hardware detects connect events and brings the port into operational state ready for SuperSpeed data communication
Port hardware detects connect events ; system software uses port commands to transition the port into an enabled state ( i.e. , can do USB data communication flows )
Data transfer types USB 2.0 types with SuperSpeed constraints ; bulk has streams capability Four data transfer types : control , bulk , interrupt , isochronous

An Afghan doctor who runs a clinic in a nearby village said he counted 50 to 60 bodies of civilians , most of them women and children and some of them his own patients , laid out in the village mosque on the day of the strike .
The doctor , who works for a reputable nongovernmental organization here , at first gave his name but then asked that it be withheld because he feared retribution from Afghans feeding intelligence to the Americans .
The United States military , in a series of statements about the operation , has accused the villagers of spreading Taliban propaganda .
Speaking on condition that their names not be used , some military officials have suggested that the villagers fabricated such evidence as grave sites  and , by implication , that other investigators had been duped .
But many villagers have connections to the Afghan police , NATO or the Americans through reconstruction projects , and they say they oppose the Taliban .
The district chief of Shindand , Lal Muhammad Umarzai , 45 , said he personally counted 76 bodies that day , and he believed that more bodies were unearthed over the next two days , bringing the total to more than 90 .
Mr. Umarzai has been praised for bringing security to the district in the three months since his appointment and is on good terms with American and NATO forces in the region .
American military investigators said that they had interviewed him and that he had told them that he had no access to the village .
But Mr. Umarzai said Taliban supporters came into the village in midmorning after the airstrikes , forcing him and the police to leave the village , but that later he was able to return and attend the burials .
The United Nations issued a statement pointing to evidence it considered conclusive that about 90 civilians were killed , some 75 of them women and children .
Villagers and relatives said that the bodies were scattered in different locations ; many of the victims were visiting Azizabad for a family memorial ceremony , and their relatives took their bodies back to their home villages for burial .
This reporter did not visit the other villages but was given a detailed list of names and places where the remaining victims were buried .
Accounts from survivors , including three people wounded in the bombing , described repeated strikes on houses where dozens of children were sleeping , grandparents and uncles and aunts huddled inside with them .
Most of the village families were asleep when the shooting broke out , some sleeping out under mosquito nets in the yards of their houses , some inside the small domed rooms of their houses , lying close together on the floor , with up to 10 or 20 people in a room .
Texas A&M University chemist , Dr. Frank Raushel , is contributing to America ’s war against terror by developing an enzyme that might neutralize a deadly chemical agent , the organophosphates .
The organophosphates started their journey as insecticides in the 1930s but soon made their way into the dangerous alleys of chemical warfare during World War II as the basis for deadly nerve agents such as Sarin , Tabun , and Soman .

Despite being outlawed by several international treaties , some countries have used chemical agents during times of war .
In 1988 , the Iraqi Kurdish village of Halabja was exposed to multiple chemical agents , killing about 5,000 of the town ’s 50,000 residents .
After the incident , traces of mustard gas and several nerve agents were discovered .
The mass murder was perpetrated by orders of Saddam Hussein as retribution for the Kurdish uprising and in order to test his chemical weapons .
Organophosphates fall under the category of neurotoxins , which attack the nervous system by blocking the function of an important enzyme , which carries nerve signals throughout the body .
When vital organs , such as the lungs , do not receive the appropriate nerve signals , control is lost over respiratory muscles , which usually results in death by asphyxiation .
Today , some classes of organophosphates are used as insecticides while others have been categorized as chemical weapons .
The structure of Phosphotriesterase
( Credit : Dave Flanagan / University of
Massachusetts Amherst ) Dr. Raushel and his team have discovered a bacterial enzyme , phosphotriesterase , which can recognize and destroy the toxicity of a broad spectrum of organophosphate nerve agents .
What Raushel aims to do now is to design and characterize bacterial phosphotriesterases that are better at detecting , destroying and detoxifying those organophosphates that pose the most serious threats to human health .

Universities are being asked to set up surveillance units to monitor the movements of international students in a government - led crackdown on bogus student immigration scams , academics say .
New rules to force universities to report overseas students who miss too many lectures to immigration officers will harm the academic - student relationship because lecturers are being asked to act in a " police - like " manner , according to a group of 200 academics and activists opposing the moves .
A letter to the Guardian , organised by Ian Grigg - Spall , academic chair of the National Critical Lawyers Group and signed by leading academic lawyers , the head of the lecturers ' union and Tony Benn , claims that the rules could breach the European convention on human rights , which guarantees the individual 's right to privacy .
" This police - like surveillance is not the function of universities and alters the educational relationship between students and their teachers in a very harmful manner , " it says .
" University staff are there to help the students develop intellectually and not to be a means of sanctioning these students . "
The rules will require all universities to obtain a licence to admit students from outside the EU .
They will then have to sponsor students , who will be required to have their fingerprints taken and be issued with ID cards .
Lecturers will have to report any student who misses 10 or more lectures or seminars .
Students will also have to prove they have funds to cover fees plus £ 800 a month for the duration of their courses .
Universities have separately raised concerns that the system of registering overseas students , which is planned to take place at six centres around the country , will struggle to cope .
About 350,000 overseas students attend British universities every year .
Universities are heavily dependent on the £ 2.5 bn a year they pay in fees .
Almost 300 bogus colleges have been uncovered in the past three years , many involved in immigration scams .
Sally Hunt , general secretary of the University and College Union , said : " We have grave concerns that new rules on monitoring foreign students have been pulled together without any consultation with the people who would implement them .
We do not believe it is appropriate or effective to task colleges and universities with the policing of immigration . "
A Home Office spokesman said : " Those who come to Britain must play by the rules and benefit the country .
This new route for students will ensure we know exactly who is coming here to study and stamp out bogus colleges who facilitate the lawbreakers .
" International students contribute £ 2.5 bn to the UK economy in tuition fees alone .
The student tier of the points system means Britain can continue to recruit good students from outside Europe . "

Public schools across the country , hurt by state - and local - government cutbacks , are tapping an alternative source of cash : Mom and Dad .
Parent groups and local nonprofit organizations have long raised money for activities like class trips , school dances and after - school clubs .
But many parents say they now are shelling out for core curricular items that were once publicly funded -- from classroom supplies to teachers ' salaries .
This fall , a parent group in Columbia , S.C. , bought 100 dictionaries for a middle - school teacher who had requested them .
In Kentucky , the Middletown Elementary School parent - teacher association has been discussing helping to pay the salary of a teacher aide whose job might get cut .
And in Sunrise , Fla. , the Sawgrass Elementary School PTA is kicking in $ 3,000 for news magazines that the district used to buy for classroom use .
The group also is considering eliminating funding for specialized after - school clubs to free up money for classroom study programs .
Teachers ' Helpers
As schools lose out to government cutbacks , parents are being asked to help more .
PTAs can fight " fund - raising fatigue " by planning one big drive rather than many small ones .
Parents can offer time instead of money .
Hours helping teachers or students go a long way .
" There 's no question that PTAs are having to reprioritize , " says Michael Ryan , president of the Sawgrass Elementary PTA .
" It could n't come at a worse time for us in many respects since fund raising is so difficult because of the broad economic issues . "
Sawgrass Elementary is part of the Broward County Public School District , the sixth - largest in the country , which is expecting a $ 100 million reduction in state funding for the 2009 - 2010 academic year , according to district superintendent James Notter .
That amount would be twice the size of the budget cut of just two years ago , he says .
Many school districts are facing similar cuts as governments run up deficits .
Some 41 states are projecting midyear budget shortfalls this fiscal year , compared with just seven states a year ago , according to a survey by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , a nonprofit research group .
If current trends continue , combined state deficits for next fiscal year will be around $ 145 billion , compared with the $ 89 billion shortfall estimated for the current fiscal year , the center calculates .
The Iowa City Community School District , which serves 11,000 students , wo n't be receiving $ 783,000 from the state it had already budgeted for this school year , says superintendent Lane Plugge .
School officials expect to tap reserves from local property - tax revenues to continue providing programs and services in coming months .
Also digging deeper is the Iowa City Community School District Foundation , a nonprofit that traditionally supports non-core student enrichment programs .
Now , the group is seeing a big uptick in requests from teachers for books to supplement library collections and computer gear that the district typically used to fund , says Jacki Brennan , the foundation 's executive director .
Last year , the foundation was able to come through with half of the funds for $ 130,000 in requests from teachers for supplies and core programs .
This year , " I anticipate lots more requests , way more than we can fund , " Ms. Brennan says .
Strapped Parents
As schools lean more on parent groups , those groups , too , are affected by leaner times .
In Oregon , the nonprofit Lake Oswego School District Foundation is lowering its fund - raising goal this year to $ 1.5 million from $ 2.2 million last year as local residents seek to save more and spend less .
Middletown Elementary 's PTA in Kentucky says donations are about one - third lower than at this time last year , even after an extra fund - raiser .
And in Colorado , the Poudre School District Foundation says it is hearing from donors that they 'll likely be giving less this year .
A survey by California PTA , a statewide group , of about 500 PTA presidents in the state showed that nearly two - thirds of the groups have been asked by schools this year to pitch in more money for basic supplies and programs , from pencils and books to arts programs .
" One of the things we 've always said to our members is , ' Your purpose is not to be a cash cow ' " to cover regular school expenses , says Jan Harp Domene , president of the National Parent Teacher Association , an umbrella organization .
" But we know they are playing a critical part in making sure children still have services that were once part of the budget , from music programs to adequate custodial supplies .
These are not frills . "
As local PTAs play a bigger role in funding school activities , the National PTA is reminding members in organization publications to adhere to fund - raising guidelines that aim to avert potential conflicts of interest and liabilities .
Among the guidelines : PTAs should obtain a broad consensus in deciding what activities to sponsor .
Local groups also should keep projects at arm 's length -- providing schools with earmarked donations , for instance , rather than dealing directly with contractors .
Some groups are concerned that increased reliance on parents for funding can create inequities " because not all parent and community groups can pitch in to backfill services in the same way , " says Pam Brady , president of California PTA .
To minimize this , National PTA encourages local groups to avoid making donations to programs such as science clubs or band boosters that would n't be shared by everyone at the school .
" Donations should provide for all children , " Ms. Domene says .
Still , she says , some inequity is inevitable since parent participation in low - income communities is generally lower than in wealthier ones .
Other parents worry that increased PTA funding of core school items will in the long run encourage further cuts by school boards " if we 're here making up the difference , " says Mr. Ryan of the Sawgrass PTA .
" Pragmatically , though , none of us are willing to take a stand and say ' We wo n't provide it this year . ' "
Onus on School Boards
But other PTA 's are doing just that .
The Eldorado Community School PTA in Santa Fe , N.M. , this year has put the brakes on funding teacher salaries after it raised $ 61,000 last year to save a physical - education instructor 's job .
" After that we decided we 're not going to pay district responsibilities like salaries " because of concern that it was setting a precedent that could not be maintained , says PTA president Kathy Ritschel .
To the district , " we said , ' You guys figure it out . ' "

Updated at 2:06 p.m .
WASHINGTON -- Citing danger to the national economy , President Bush approved an emergency bailout of the U.S. auto industry Friday , offering $ 17.4 billion in rescue loans in exchange for tough concessions from the deeply troubled carmakers and their workers .
Allowing the massive auto industry to collapse in the middle of what is already a severe recession was not a " responsible course of action . "
" It would worsen a weak job market and exacerbate the financial crisis , " he said .
" It could send our suffering economy into a deeper and longer recession .
And it would leave the next president to confront the demise of a major American industry in his first days of office . "
Stock prices rallied on Wall Street as investors cheered the government 's action .
Republicans on Capitol Hill , though , expressed disdain for the bailout .
And while the United Auto Workers said the plan would keep factories running , the union said it was upset by loan conditions " singling out workers . "
" We will work with the Obama administration and the new Congress to ensure that these unfair conditions are removed , " said Ron Gettelfinger , president of the UAW .
President - elect Barack Obama , who takes office a month from Saturday , said the White House action was needed to help avoid a collapse of Detroit 's Big Three .
" With the short - term assistance provided by this package , the auto companies must bring all their stakeholders together -- including labor , dealers , creditors and suppliers -- to make the hard choices necessary to achieve long - term viability , " he said .
Obama will be free to reopen the arrangement from the government 's side if he chooses , an administration official said .
Bush said , " The time to make hard decisions to become viable is now , or the only option will be bankruptcy .
The automakers and unions must understand what is at stake and make hard decisions necessary to reform . "
Some $ 13.4 billion of the money would be available this month and next -- $ 9.4 billion of it for General Motors and $ 4 billion for Chrysler LLC .
GM is slated to receive the remaining $ 4 billion in loans after more money is released from the financial rescue account .
Under terms of the loans , the government will have the option of becoming a stockholder in the companies , much as it has with major banks , in effect partially nationalizing the industry .
Bush said the companies ' workers should agree to wage and work rules that are competitive with foreign automakers by the end of next year .
And he called for elimination of a " jobs bank " program -- negotiated by the United Auto Workers and the companies -- under which laid - off workers can receive about 95 percent of their pay and benefits for years .
Early this month , the UAW agreed to suspend the program .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said Congress should release the second $ 350 billion from the financial rescue fund that it approved in October to bail out huge financial institutions .
Tapping the fund for the auto industry basically exhausts the first half of the $ 700 billion total , he said .
If the carmakers fail to prove viability by March 31 , they will be required to repay the loans , which they would find all but impossible .
A firm will be deemed viable only if it can show positive cash flow and can fully repay the government loans .
General Motors Corp. CEO
Rick Wagoner said in Detroit that GM had much work ahead but he was confident it could reinvent itself with the government help and even lead an economic recovery in America .
House Republican leader John Boehner called the administration 's plan " regrettable . "
He said that granting loans for automakers was never the intention when Congress passed the $ 700 billion plan to rescue financial institutions and that the new plan " has failed both autoworkers and taxpayers . "
Rep. Jeb Hensarling , R - Texas , chairman of the congressional oversight panel for the Wall Street rescue program , decried the decision , saying a Chapter 11 reorganization , not loans rewarding decades of mismanagement , would have been a better decision .
" Unless union contracts are renegotiated , and unless demand picks up for domestic autos , $ 14 billion , $ 34 billion , $ 74 billion -- even $ 104 billion -- will not solve the problem , " Hensarling said .
" I fear that a devastating precedent has been set that the federal government will now be pressured to bail out every failing company in America -- something that taxpayers and future generations cannot afford . "
Under terms of the loan , GM and Chrysler must provide the government with stock warrants giving it the option to buy GM and Chrysler stock at a specific price .
In addition , the automakers would be required to agree to limits on executive pay and eliminate some perks such as corporate jets .
Paulson , who plans to discuss the deal with congressional leaders and Obama 's transition team in the near future , said he was confident that the Treasury Department , Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp .
have the resources to address a significant market crisis if one should occur before Congress approves the use of the second half of the rescue fund .
Friday 's rescue plan retains the idea of a " car czar " to make sure the auto companies are keeping their promises and moving toward long - term viability .
The short - term overseer will be Paulson .
But the White House deputy chief of staff , Joel Kaplan , said that if the Obama team wants someone else installed to bridge the administrations , Bush is open to that .
Kaplan said there have been discussions with Obama 's aides throughout the process and the White House believes Obama 's view of the problem and the solution tracks with theirs .
The White House package is the lifeline desperately sought by U.S. automakers , who warned they were running out of money as the economy fell deeper into recession , car loans became scarce and consumers stopped shopping for cars .
The carmakers have announced extended holiday shutdowns .
Chrysler is closing all 30 of its North American manufacturing plants for four weeks because of slumping sales ;
Ford will shut 10 North American assembly plants for an extra week in January , and General Motors will temporarily close 20 factories -- many for the entire month of January -- to cut vehicle production .
Chrysler CEO Bob Nardelli thanked the administration for its help .
In a statement Friday morning , Nardelli said the initial injection of capital will help the company get through its cash crisis and help eventually return to profitability .
He said Chrysler was committed to meeting the conditions set by Bush in exchange for the money .
Ford President and CEO Alan Mulally said his company would not seek the short - term financial assistance but predicted the aid would stabilize the industry .
" The U.S. auto industry is highly interdependent , and a failure of one of our competitors would have a ripple effect that could jeopardize millions of jobs and further damage the already weakened U.S. economy , " Mulally said .
One word : trolls
I speak from only a little experience here .
I have been blogging for years .
First on Fictionpress , then on Myspace , later on Blogger , and recently on WordPress .
The fact is that when you submit a blog to any open source site ( like Reddit , for example ) you start out with +1 .
This means that if the first person who comes along to read your submission , does n’t like it , and they down - vote it , you may as well resubmit some time later and hope that a few people will actually read the blog and either upvote , or leave it alone .
Correct me if I ’m wrong here , but my understanding of the up - vote / down - vote system is that if you like something , you up - vote , and if you do not , you leave it alone .
As far as I have understood , the down - vote is specifically there for unrelated content ( links in the wrong subreddit ) or inappropriate content ( rickrolls , or something that is clearly an advertisement ) .
Maybe I ’m wrong about that .
Anyone who has ever submitted content to a open - source type site , knows that its entirely hit - or - miss .
You may see a spike in your views , which you are greatful for , but , mostly , you just hope that you get upvoted more than you get downvoted .
Unfortunately , unless you ’ve established yourself as an official blogger , and have a large following , you are n’t likely to get far .
So this blog is to all the other bloggers out there .
Keep trying , the more we submit , the more we are likely to get people to enjoy our work .
And the following is to the trolls :
Please stop downvoting things you just do n’t like .
Case and point : I submitted a link to the Philosophy Sub - Reddit and it had 11 Up - votes very quickly .
I was elated .
Suddenly , the Troll - Patrol must have finally made their way to the Philosophy Reddit , because one terrific individual posted “ wow , this is shit . ” and clearly downvoted me .
At first i read that as “ wow , this is the shit . ” only to continue reading his incomprehensible rant and realize that was n’t the case .
I replied to his comment as nicely as I could , asking him to explain his reasoning further , but it was too late , the Troll Patrol had already struck and I was downvoted to the bottom of the page .
And one terrific individual even commented simply “ Lack of analytic rigor : downvote . ”
The life - expectancy of a submitted link to a personal blog is probably anywhere from 5 minutes to 1 hour .
Thankfully my submission lasted almost 2 before it was overrun .
In conclusion of this blog ( I fully expect this to be instantly downvoted and nobody will see it ) I would like to place myself in the shoes of a troll for a moment … .
UPVOTE IF YOU HAVE A PERSONAL BLOG AND HATE DOWN - VOTER TROLLS !!!
… thanks for your time .
The Legend of Zelda : Twilight Princess launched in 2006 , so naturally , Zelda fans are clamoring to hear word on the next title in the series .
Shigeru Miyamoto has confirmed multiple times that the next Zelda is underway , but now he has also stated that it might be awhile before it is actually revealed .
“ I ’m really not sure when we ’ll be able to make a public announcement on that .
I ca n’t even say if the next E3 will be the right opportunity to do so .
But rest assured , our teams are working on new projects right now . ”
It ’s possible that if the next Zelda title is not discussed at E3 2009 , Nintendo might show it off at their annual Fall conference .
Even if it takes a fairly long time to see images and video , we know that the Zelda team will work hard to deliver expectations .

Anyone who has ever read Milton Friedman 's Free To Choose ( a book everyone interested in Economics should read at some point in their life ) knows that Friedman is a staunch supporter of the legalization of marijuana .
Friedman is n't alone in that regard , and he joined over 500 economists in signing An Open Letter to the President , Congress , Governors , and State Legislatures on the benefits of legalizing marijuana .
Friedman is n't the only well known economist to sign the letter , it was also signed by Nobel Laureate George Akerlof and other notable economists including Daron Acemoglu of MIT , Howard Margolis of the University of Chicago , and Walter Williams of George Mason University .
The Economics of Marijuana
In general , economists believe in the power of free markets and individual liberty , and , as such , are opposed to outlawing goods and services unless such a policy is justified based on costs to outside parties ( i.e. negative externalities ) .
Generally speaking , the use of marijuana does n't appear to generate side effects large enough to justify making it entirely illegal , so it 's not surprising that economists would be in favor of legalization .
In addition , economists know that only legal markets can be taxed , and therefore many see the market for marijuana as a way to increase tax revenue while also making marijuana consumers better off ( compared to a situation where only black markets exist ) .
Text of Letter Signed By 500 + Economists :
We , the undersigned , call your attention to the attached report by Professor Jeffrey A. Miron , The Budgetary Implications of Marijuana Prohibition .
The report shows that marijuana legalization -- replacing prohibition with a system of taxation and regulation -- would save $ 7.7 billion per year in state and federal expenditures on prohibition enforcement and produce tax revenues of at least $ 2.4 billion annually if marijuana were taxed like most consumer goods .
If , however , marijuana were taxed similarly to alcohol or tobacco , it might generate as much as $ 6.2 billion annually .
The fact that marijuana prohibition has these budgetary impacts does not by itself mean prohibition is bad policy .
Existing evidence , however , suggests prohibition has minimal benefits and may itself cause substantial harm .
We therefore urge the country to commence an open and honest debate about marijuana prohibition .
We believe such a debate will favor a regime in which marijuana is legal but taxed and regulated like other goods .
At a minimum , this debate will force advocates of current policy to show that prohibition has benefits sufficient to justify the cost to taxpayers , foregone tax revenues , and numerous ancillary consequences that result from marijuana prohibition .
Do You Agree ?
I highly recommend anyone interested in the topic to read Miron 's report on marijuana legalization , or at the very least see the executive summary .
Given the high number of people who are incarcerated each year for marijuana offences and the high cost of housing prisoners , the $ 7.7 billion in expected savings seems like a reasonable figure , though I would like to see estimates produced by other groups .

December 14 , 2008
Branson Hunter , writing for the Big Bear Observation Post blog , reports that the Marine Corps Air and Ground Combat Center ( MCAGCC ) and the local California Highway Patrol will be working together over the holiday “ in a joint effort to reduce accidents and drinking and driving ” in San Bernardino County .
A clip from Alex Jones ’ 9/11 : The Road to Tyranny .
Military invades the town of Swansboro , North Carolina
Hunter contacted Corporal Knuesn of the MCAGCC Provost Marshal office and MCAGCC Public Affairs Chief , Gunny Sgt. Chris Cox .
Both confirmed the USMC will be present on public roads in order to setup a military presence during routine DUI check stops .
“ They will be working closely over the month to cut down of traffic accidents , ” said Cox , “ the Military Police will observe DUI check points and watch for their own guys .
The intent is to have military presence out there . ”
Infowars attempted to contact the MCAGCC Provost Marshal office and MCAGCC Public Affairs to confirm the story but we were unable to reach them .
Dispatching Marines on California highways is an obvious violation of the Posse Comitatus Act ( 18 U.S.C. § 1385 ) passed on June 16 , 1878 .
The Act prohibits members of the federal uniformed services , including military police , from working with state and local police and law enforcement .
However , since September 11 , 2001 , the federal government has increasingly ignored Posse Comitatus .
On October 1 , 2008 , the U.S. Army announced its 3rd Infantry Division ’s 1st Brigade Combat Team will be under the day - to - day control of the Northern Command , ostensibly “ on call ” to respond to emergencies and disasters .
“ They may be called upon to help with civil unrest and crowd control or to deal with potentially horrific scenarios such as massive poisoning and chaos in response to a chemical , biological , radiological , nuclear or high - yield explosive , or CBRNE , attack , ” the Army Times reported on September 30 .
“ Training for homeland scenarios has already begun at Fort Stewart and includes specialty tasks such as knowing how to use the ‘ jaws of life ’ to extract a person from a mangled vehicle ; extra medical training for a CBRNE incident ; and working with U.S. Forestry Service experts on how to go in with chainsaws and cut and clear trees to clear a road or area . ”
It is not explained how assisting in traffic accidents falls within the purview of Homeland Security and the military .
It appears that the Marines are using this very pretense in San Bernardino County to “ cut down of traffic accidents , ” a task normally reserved for local law enforcement .
Alex Jones ’ 9/11 : The Road to Tyranny .
Marines work with cops serving search warrants .
Last month , Defense Secretary Robert Gates added yet another dimension to this incremental domestic militarization when he ordered the Pentagon “ to conduct a broad review to determine whether the military , National Guard and Reserve can adequately deal with domestic disasters and whether they have the training and equipment to defend the homeland , ” according to CBS News .
According to a report issued by the Commission on the National Guard and Reserves , the Pentagon “ must use the nation ’s citizen soldiers to create an operational force that would be fully trained , equipped and ready to defend the nation , respond to crises and supplement the active duty troops in combat . ”
On December 1 , the Washington Post reported that the “ U.S. military expects to have 20,000 uniformed [ rapid reaction ] troops inside the United States by 2011 trained to help state and local officials respond to a nuclear terrorist attack or other domestic catastrophe , according to Pentagon officials . ”
The Pentagon admitted that this move represented a “ long - planned shift in the Defense Department ’s role in homeland security , ” never mind the obvious violation of the Posse Comitatus Act .
“ But the Bush administration and some in Congress have pushed for a heightened homeland military role since the middle of this decade , saying the greatest domestic threat is terrorists exploiting the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . ”
Alex Jones ’ 9/11 : The Road to Tyranny .
Military stages " Operation Urban Warrior " in California .
Gunny Sgt. Chris
Cox explained more than he probably intended when he told Branson Hunter that the “ intent is to have military presence ” on California ’s roads .
As Alex Jones documented in his film The Road to Tyranny , the military has trained for more than a decade in domestic military operations and specifically “ training for urban warfare against the American people , ” as Marty Proctor , owner of the Main Street Deli in Swansboro , North Carolina told WorldNetDaily in April , 2000 , when the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit from Camp Lejeune invaded her town .
“ Members of the elite unit have been in Swansboro all week training with the local police at checkpoints and neighborhood patrols , ” David M. Bresnahan wrote at the time .
In addition to the incremental dispatching of soldiers to assist local law enforcement in operating checkpoints and other duties , the federal government has largely taken over the financing , training , and direction of local police .
“ Under the 1981 ‘ Military Cooperation with Law - Enforcement Officials Act , ’ the US Department of Defense is supplying the local police with paramilitary training and equipment , especially for SWAT teams , for use against civilians .
According to Peter Kraska in his article ‘ Militarizing the Police ’ in Social Problems ( issue # 1 , 1997 ) , many SWAT teams are being trained by former military special operations officers , ” Fred E. Foldvary wrote for the Progress Report in 1999 .
It should be noted that this was well before the events of September 11 , 2001 , and the creation of the Department of Homeland Security .
Militarized police at the Boston DNC , 2004 .
The purpose of this “ heightened homeland military role ” and the militarization of local law enforcement has little to do with a potential terrorist attack or natural disasters .
It is part of a long - standing plan to implement martial law in America and control the populace through a military dictatorship .
The National Security and Homeland Security Presidential Directive , ” otherwise known as PDD 51 , was signed into law through executive order by George Bush on May 9 , 2007 .
It allows Bush — and soon enough , Barack Obama — to “ take total control over the government and the country , bypassing all other levels of government at the state , federal , local , territorial and tribal levels , and thus ensuring total unprecedented dictatorial power , ” as Paul Joseph Watson has noted .
In order to effectively establish a dictatorship and martial law , the government will need troops stationed in the country and that is precisely what the 3rd Infantry Division ’s 1st Brigade Combat Team and the Pentagon ’s 20,000 rapid reaction troops are all about .
It has nothing to do with al - Qaeda , the CIA contrivance , or Fox News hyped homegrown terrorism .
In addition , numerous TOPOFF ( Top Officials ) national - level domestic and international exercises staged around the country are desgined to get the populace ready for the possiblity of a false flag terrorist attack and the presence of troops on the streets .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Marines supposedly assisting the California Highway Patrol is part of this effort as well and is designed by the Pentagon and Homeland Security to get citizens accustomed to a “ military presence out there . ”
It dovetails with FEMA ’s so - called Clergy Response Teams trained by the federal government to “ quell dissent ” and pacify citizens to obey the government after a declaration of martial law ( see Feds Train Clergy To “ Quell Dissent ” During Martial Law ) .
Hurricane Katrina played a part in this emerging long - standing plan when police and National Guard patrols forced home owners to hand over their legally owned firearms at gunpoint .
As Branson Hunter notes , the citizens of California and San Bernardino County should immediately voice their concern over the violation of Posse Comitatus and the Constitution .
“ The bottom line : I urge anyone and everyone who believes in the Constitution , United States Codes , and Posse Comitatus — to do something !
What can you do ?
To begin with , I suggest you contact the local Joshua Tree CHP Public Affairs Officer , Officer McLoud , at : 760 . 366.3707 and voice your concern .
Further , you can contact the MCAGCC Public Affairs Chief on the base at : 760.830.5476 or 760. 830.6213 .
Moreover , contact the Provost Marshal office at : 760.830.4215 . ”

I ’ve been in contact with an attendee at tonight ’s Federalist Society meeting where Attorney General Mukasey spoke for roughly twenty minutes before collapsing
According to this trusted eyewitness , events transpired roughly as follows .
Attorney General Mukasey was roughly twenty minutes into a speech defending the administration ’s torture policies and particularly arguing against prosecutions of people who made decisions in the aftermath of 9/11 ( essentially arguing against what he believed amounted to the criminalization of policy differences ) .
Some seven or eight minutes prior to the incident a heckler start shouting , calling Mukasey a “ tyrant . ”
But the AG seemed unfazed by this ; and members of the audience shouted the heckler down .
The eyewitness tells me that Mukasey seemed particularly in earnest about the argument he was making .
And when he first began to falter it appeared he was merely choking up .
Soon , what at first appeared to be choking up blended into slurred words .
Twenty to thirty seconds later he collapsed , his fall broken by a nearby FBI agent .
The room fell silent .
After a moment there were shouts from the table where Mukasey ’s wife was sitting , calling to turn down the stage lights .
A woman in an evening gown , presumably a doctor , ran up to the stage and the FBI agents hovering over Mukasey allowed her to attend to him .
The eyewitness told me that Mukasey collapsed at approximinately 10:06 and was taken off on a stretcher at approximately 10:33 .
The one additional detail is that this eyewitness says that the medical personnel attending to Mukasey were talking to him for at least part of that period , at one point asking him “ can you wiggle your toes . ”
In other words , it appears that Mukasey did regain consciousness to at least some degree before being taken to the hospital .
As emergency personnel were attending to Mukasey , a group of Republican luminaries , including former Attorney General Ashcroft and his wife , created a cordon between Mukasey and the audience to create some degree of privacy .
After Mukasey was taken away the audience was led in a prayer for Mukasey by former Congressman David McIntosh ( R - IN ) .

BBC News , Sherzad district , eastern Afghanistan
They destroyed my fields because I was poor
Farmer Sheen Goal Raza Kar
UN reports Afghan opium decline A two - hour drive from the city of Jalalabad , on a brain - bruising dirt road , lies Gandomak .
Farmers in this remote village in Sherzad district in eastern Afghanistan say they stopped growing poppies last year , and are now growing wheat , vegetables and maize instead .
More than a year ago , the Afghan government backed by international forces eradicated their poppy fields .
But locals say they are still waiting for the help they were promised .
When I was last in Nangarhar province a couple of years ago I was surrounded by poppies - pungent and many coloured - but this year I could see only golden wheat , green maize and fruit .
Farmers in Sherzad agreed to eradicate the poppies after they were promised a road , an irrigation channel and a clinic for their village .
Sheen Goal Raza Kar was one of 1,000 farmers whose fields were wiped out - but a year on he is still asking for what was promised to him .
" Once they dropped some medicine from their planes , it destroyed everything .
Then they eradicated our fields and promised us projects , but look nothing has been given to us , " he told the BBC recently .
' Powerful people '
The tall , bearded Sheen Goal is holding a meeting among the villagers on this windy afternoon .
Local farmers say the area is desperately short of water
From the roof of his house overlooking his fields he lists his complaints .
" They destroyed my fields because I was poor and they could n't destroy those fields belonging to the powerful people at the time .
Now I have grown tomatoes and other vegetables , but by the time I transport them to Jalalabad , they are all rotten . "
I interview the villagers over a tasty lunch of eggs , potatoes and yoghurt ; as we eat we can hear American drones patrolling the nearby White Mountains which border the Tora Bora cave complex on the Afghan side and Parachinar in Pakistan .
That 's when Sheen Goal points to his fields and says : " See for yourself what has happened to this fertile valley - there is a drought and when we collect the harvest , we can't take it to the city in good shape . "
And everyone agrees with Sheen Goal , all trying to put forward their views .
Qari Osman Sherzad , the eloquent 39 - year - old village chief , says : " The Afghan government told them a year ago to stop growing poppies and the villagers were promised alternative crops and reconstruction projects .
" As we say in Sherzad , it 's give and take , not just take .
Our women die before they get to hospital , we do n't have water for our fields and the road is in bad shape . "
Another villager is clearly frustrated , and wants the Afghan government to asphalt the Sherzad - Jalalabad road , so farmers like him can sell their products in Jalalabad and even transport them to Kabul .
" I have n't been able to sell anything I grow this year , so we have sent our kids to brick factories in Kabul , Jalalabad and Pakistan to earn money .
Is this justice ? " the villager asks angrily as he strokes his beard .
One Afghan official in Nangarhar who requests anonymity admits the government could not deliver on its promises .
" We promised farmers roads , irrigation channels and alternative crops , but sadly those were empty promises .
Farmers feel they have been deceived . "
' Where is my road ? '
Sherzad district is just 55 km ( 34 miles ) east of the city of Jalalabad .
Since my crop was destroyed , I have been borrowing money
Ajmal
It was one of the biggest poppy - growing districts in the remote White Mountains .
Like many other districts , it 's an agricultural area and thousands of families rely on their fields for their income .
It 's thought the Afghan government has made a dramatic improvement in cutting the poppy crop in Nangarhar - only a few years ago it was one of the country 's biggest poppy - producing provinces .
Another farmer accuses senior Afghan officials and some tribal elders of stealing the reconstruction money .
" The world gave millions of dollars , but our government and elders stole that money .
Where is my road and the irrigation channel ? " says the farmer from the village of Toto .
Poor farmers and long - suffering villagers are paying the price , says another man , Ajmal .
" I have three sons , and I have sent them all to work in brick factories .
" Since my crop was destroyed , I have been borrowing money so my family can have the money to buy food , but people want their money back and I do n't have any money . "

Embryos can be lost through the freezing process
More evidence has emerged that babies born from frozen embryos are healthier than those that develop from fresh embryos , researchers say .
Three studies presented to a US fertility conference found frozen embryo babies were less likely to be premature and under weight .
Previous research has suggested this is down to only the strongest embryos surviving the freezing process .
Fertility experts said more work was needed on the issue .
It is intriguing research that goes against what we would normally assume .
It now needs to be looked at again
Dr Allan Pacey , fertility expert A Finnish study , to be presented to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine meeting in San Francisco , found that babies born from fresh embryos were 35 % more likely to be premature and 64 % more likely to have low birthweight than those born from frozen .
A second study , from the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia , found that babies born from fresh embryos were 51 % more likely to have low birthweight and were 15 % more likely to die around the time of birth than those born from frozen embryos .
And research by the Royal Women 's Hospital in Melbourne , Australia , found 11 % of babies born from fresh embryos had low birthweight compared with 6.5 % of babies born from frozen .
A total of 12.3 % of babies born from fresh embryos were premature , compared with 9.4 % of those born from frozen , while 1.9 % also suffered death compared with 1.2 % from frozen .
Success
It is thought the results were related to the quality of the placenta , the digestive and respiratory system for the foetus .
The Australian researchers said the findings suggested women may prefer to use frozen embryos in the future .
But Dr Allan Pacey , a fertility expert from the University of Sheffield and secretary of the British Fertility Society , warned it was not so clear cut .
" Frozen embryo transfers are not as successful as fresh ones in terms of getting a pregnancy .
" So it may be that we have to balance the health of children against chances of success . "
But he added : " It is intriguing research that goes against what we would normally assume .
It now needs to be looked at again . "

Biggs killed himself after announcing his intentions in a blog
The family of a US teenager who killed himself live online via a webcam have spoken of their regret at how no - one stopped the unfolding suicide .
Abraham Biggs , 19 , from Pembroke Pines , near Miami , killed himself hours after announcing his plan on his blog .
His father said it was " unimaginable " that neither the website 's operators nor any viewers alerted the police .
Biggs took an overdose of anti-depressive drugs , but remained comatose online for hours before he died .
His father , Abraham Biggs
Sr , said he had no idea his son was contemplating suicide .
'' We were very good friends , '' Mr Biggs said of his son , adding : " It 's wrong that it was allowed to happen . ''
Biggs
Jr , who was studying to be a paramedic at the college where his father is a maths professor , suffered from mental illness which his mother said had finally claimed his life .
'' My son , Abraham Biggs Jr , was well - loved and cared for .
However , the mental illness of bipolarity and depression got the better part of him , '' she wrote on MySpace .
' Nothing happened '
The sense of disbelief at the teenager 's death was heightened by the realisation that his end was drawn out and , most likely , preventable .
He began the process by posting messages telling people he was going to kill himself , and then started streaming live pictures from his home .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Reports say that some of viewers who logged in to watch began to encourage the teenager to kill himself , while others tried to dissuade him .
After several hours , when he had not moved some viewers finally notified the site 's moderator , who then called the police .
The boy 's sister , Rosalind Biggs , denounced the website , Justin.tv , which allows people to broadcast themselves online : " They got hits , they got viewers , nothing happened for hours . "
It is unclear how many people watched Wednesday 's suicide unfold , although reports suggest that some viewers thought it was a hoax .
The last transmission from the webcam was of a police officer bursting into Abraham Biggs 's room , where he discovers his body and then places his hand over the camera .
Michael Seifert , chief executive of Justin.tv , said the company and its staff would " take a moment to recognise and reflect upon the tragedy that occurred within our community " and offered condolences to the Biggs family .
The footage has since been taken down and his father is now calling for more regulation of chatrooms .

Please be careful that the above situation does not apply to you .
Moral of the story : Come to office on time and leave your office on time …….
While beer and wine seldom lasts long in my household , from time to time there is the odd can or bottle left over after a party .
When this rare event occurs , the leftovers can be put to use in a huge variety of ways – many of which most people would never think of .
This list should help you use up your leftover beer .
If you have any other tips for leftover beer , be sure to tell us in the comments .
10 Soak in it
Beer is an excellent skin conditioner .
Next time you want to have a long soak in the bath , tip in a good can of dark beer before you hop in and just soak in it !
This is a nice alternative to adding salt crystals ( which soften water ) , but I see no reason that you could n’t combine both for a super luxurious bath .
Just do n’t be tempted to drink the bathwater !
Oh – and be careful if you go outside afterwards on a hot day ( see item 4 ) .
9 Soothe an Upset Tummy
This is my favorite item on the list .
If you have a stomach upset , slowly sipping a can of beer can help to settle it down – and the alcohol has an anesthetic effect which helps to alleviate the pain .
As most of us will know , this is also a very effective hangover cure !
Just be sure not to use this trick if you have an ulcer or gastritis .
8 Polish Your Furniture
Beer is a surprisingly good wood furniture polish .
Let a can of beer go completely stale and flat and pour a little onto a polishing cloth .
Buff your timber furniture and follow up with a final dry buff .
You will be amazed at how brilliant and shiny your furniture will end up looking .
7 Marinate Meat
Beer makes an excellent marinade .
It really does n’t matter what meat you are preparing – it will benefit almost all types from a few hours ( the longer the better ) in a marinade of beer .
You can get really adventurous too – add any flavors you like to the beer – even things like marmalade or jam .
A more common addition would be soy sauce or other Asian sauces .
If you are marinating pork , you might want to add some chunks of pineapple and pineapple juice with some ginger for a sweet and sour result .
6 Naturally Remove Slugs
Slugs are a terrible pest in a garden – particularly if you are growing for eating .
Instead of using chemicals like DDT on your veges , bury a small saucer up to its lip in the garden and put fresh beer in it each day .
The slugs will be attracted to the smell , get drunk and drown .
Be sure to refresh the beer daily .
With a little luck you should have a saucer full of slugs and healthy looking cabbages !
5 Fertilize Your Garden
The yeast and other extracts in a can of beer are very good for plants .
If you end up with a pile of left - over half - drunk cans or bottles of beer , tip them out onto the garden .
Just watch out for cigarette butts if your guests use them for ashtrays – while some plants do like nicotine extract , not all do and you could kill your prize plants .
4 Deter Bees
Bees and wasps are attracted to beer – so instead of spending a fortune on citronella oils or candles , try putting a few open beer cans around the yard at your next BBQ .
Obviously you should put the cans away from where people will be sitting or standing .
Oh – and make sure no one decides to have a swig from one of the cans when they are drunk – it will result in a very unpleasant ( and potentially lethal ) situation !
3 Wash Your Hair
Beer “ shampoo ” can add luster and body to dull limp hair .
It is also a much more natural alternative to store - bought shampoos which contain a lot of chemicals .
Just mix one can of beer with a raw egg and use it as you would use a normal shampoo .
It was quite common in days gone by to use raw eggs for shampoo – it even lathers up like the chemical stuff .
Try it – I am sure you will be pleasantly surprised .
Just keep in mind that the shampoo will go off if you do n’t use it within a couple of days .
This is probably best as a once - a - month special treatment .
You can also use beer on its own as a conditioner – rinse your hair with it , let it dry off , then rinse it off .
2 Make a Batter
When making a batter , you often add a little raising agent – usually baking powder .
In this recipe , you use beer – the bubbles in the drink and the yeast provide the raising .
So , here is the recipe : put 1.5 cups of flour and 1/2 a teaspoon of salt in to a bowl .
Pour in 1 12 oz can of beer while mixing .
That is it !
If the batter is too thick , add more beer .
If it is too thin , add a little more flour .
If you are planning to use this batter with fish , dredge the fish in flour first – remembering to shake off the excess .
This is a great tasting batter that I use all the time .
1 BBQ a Chicken
This has to be one of the easiest recipes around .
You simply take a full opened can of beer , stand a chicken on it , and throw it on the barbeque ( well – do n’t literally throw it – that could be very messy ! )
The beer can is inserted in the neck area ( where you would normally stuff the chicken ) and stood upright .
While the chicken cooks , the beer heats up and subtly flavors the meat .
You end up with a tasty and surprisingly moist chicken .
You should also rub a little olive oil over the chicken and salt and pepper it before starting .
If you have a favorite “ rub ” you can add that too .
Oh – make sure you drink half of the can first – it should be half full when starting out .
I am sure you will have no trouble finding someone to help you with that part of the recipe .
Cook the chicken with the BBQ lid on for approximately 1 1/4 hours or until the internal temperature registers 165 degrees F in the breast area and 180 degrees F in the thigh ( or the juices run clear if you pierce it with a knife ) .
Well you know the example of how homosexuality is a " behavior and lifestyle " , much like stealing .
You know the saying that homosexuals have an agenda pushing our " alternative lifestyle ? "
So contend our adversaries .
We are quick to denounce them and assert that sexual identity is n't a choice like choosing to be a thief .
Maybe we were wrong all along .
" A couple of gay penguins are attempting to steal eggs from straight birds in an effort to become " fathers " , it has been reported .
The two penguins have started placing stones at the feet of parents before waddling away with their eggs , in a bid to hide their theft .
But the deception has been noticed by other penguins at the zoo , who have ostracised the gay couple from their group .
Now keepers have decided to segregate the pair of three - year - old male birds to avoid disrupting the rest of the community during the hatching season .
A keeper at Polar Land in Harbin , north east China explained that the gay couple had the natural urge to become fathers , despite their sexuality .
" One of the responsibilities of being a male adult is looking after the eggs .
Despite this being a biological impossibility for this couple , the natural desire is still there , " a keeper told the Austrian Times newspaper .
" It 's not discrimination .
We have to fence them separately , otherwise the whole group will be disturbed during hatching time , " he added . " ( Telegraph )
This is evidence of the " homosexual agenda " .
The desire to be with the one you love , raise a family , and have what everyone else has .
I am working on updating the [ ActionScript RIA Reference Guide ] [ 1 ] .
As part of that , I have to figure add all of the new APIs added to Flash Player 10 .
Below is a list of such APIs generated and parsed from the APIs docs .
I figured I would post it here as a reference , and also a sanity check ( if you see anything wrong or missing , please post in the comments ) .
Update : I just updated the list and added a bunch of missing APIs .
Thanks for all of the input .
The Swiss Army may have mandatory military service , but if you ’re underweight or vegan , do n’t expect to receive your marching orders any time soon .
In a recent decision , the Swiss announced that people cannot serve in the military if they eat no animal products or if they are of average height and weigh less than 8st .
[ social_buttons ]
On the other hand , users of marijuana and ecstasy , as well as those who drink regularly are n’t being turned away - as long as they can prove they ’re not addicted .
“ Half the male population will now become vegans , ” quipped Politician Josef Lang .
If avoiding conscription were n’t reason enough , going vegan also helps combat global warming , reduces your chance of disease , and saves hundreds of lives every year .
Do n’t worry , you ’ll still get plenty of protein , but do n’t tell the Swiss Army !

An Italian court of appeal upheld on Friday a 30 - year prison sentence for a Pakistani father who murdered his daughter in a so - called honour killing in 2006 .
The young woman ’s two brothers - in - law , who were also jailed for 30 years for their part in her death , saw their sentence reduced to 17 years , Sky TG24 news channel reported .
The stabbed body of Hina Saleem , 21 , was found buried in the garden of the family home in Sarezzo , near the northern city of Brescia , on August 11 , 2006 .
Ms Saleem , who reportedly refused an arranged marriage with a cousin , had been estranged from her family and lived with her Italian boyfriend Giuseppe Tempini .
via ‘ Honour killing ’ sentence against Pakistani upheld - DAWN – Top Stories ; December 06 , 2008 .
Meanwhile this is at least surprising :
Eight United Nations agencies have co-sponsored the first Palestinian festival to combat violence against women , driving home the message that so - called honour killings  have nothing to do with honour and seeking to break the conspiracy of silence surrounding domestic abuse .
 It is time for action , not words ,  UN Development Fund for Women ( UNIFEM ) Program Manager in the Occupied Palestinian Territory Alia ’
Al - Yassir said in the inaugural speech of the festival held , Thursday , in Ramallah .
UN agencies are working as one on this issue and supporting civil societies in their efforts to end violence against women
Well , I do n’t think that a “ festival ” is going to change anything , least if organised by UN .
But it ’s something refreshing to see some people in those places really worried about this .
Then there is also this other statement :
“ Islam does not permit illicit relationship , but killing a girl for this reason is a cold - blooded murder and is a serious offence under the Islamic law , ” chairman of Shariyat Court Maulana Irfan Mufti Zulfikar said .
There are so many people going against Islam , then …
Of course , this man is from India and was ruling in a case where a girl was killed out of honor .
Israeli Company Testing Piezoelectric Road
December 17th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
More news from the piezoelectrics front : engineers from Innowattech are planning to test a network of Piezo Electric Generators ( IPEG ) on a 100 meter stretch of road .
As with other piezoelectric devices , the IPEGs embedded in the road will turn mechanical strain into an electrical current or voltage .
The IPEGs can generate energy from weight , motion , vibration , and temperature changes .
Energy harvested from the IPEGs can either be transferred back to the electrical grid or used for public infrastructure ( i.e. lighting ) .
Innowattech estimates that its system will scale up to 400 kilowatts from a one kilometer stretch of dual carriageway .
While the initial IPEG test will be on a roadway , the company says that its technology can also be used on airport runways and rail systems .
Best of all , IPEGs can be attached during the paving of new roads or during maintenance work .
Innowattech ’s system may not end up being cheap , but it ’s unquestionably useful .

They came out of the forest .
Men with guns appearing barely human to the frail , ageing woman who months later recounted her ordeal , bent double after surgery to save her womb .
" They did n't look like men .
Their skin was covered in cuts .
Their clothes were completely torn .
They became someone else , not humans , " she said at a hospital in the often fought - over town of Rutshuru in eastern Congo .
But the woman still recognised the men who descended on her village as members of the Mai Mai ethnic militia .
Their preference for wearing animal skins and amulets , popular for their supposed magical powers of protection , distinguished them from the government soldiers , foreign rebels and other armed gangs who have also contributed to the wholesale rape of hundreds of thousands of women and girls over more than a decade of conflict .
It took months for the 58 - year - old woman from Kindu to reach Rutshuru hospital for treatment and to tell her story .
The Mai Mai shot her husband when he did n't have any money to hand over .
When her children screamed they shot them too .
Then the woman was raped by five men .
One of her attackers nearly destroyed her womb by thrusting his gun into it .
She fled her village .
As she travelled to Rutshuru she was raped again , this time by Rwandan Hutu extremists who fled to Congo after leading the genocide in their own country .
" It is impossible to live in safety .
They have murdered my children , they have murdered my husband .
They have raped me so many times .
I do not know who is alive and who is dead in my village , " she said .
Hers is not an unusual account from survivors of villages in eastern Congo subjected to repeated attacks in which women and girls were serially raped and the men killed .
Health clinics in the region treat tens of thousands of women for sexual assault every year , and doctors say that is a fraction of those who were attacked .
Last year , Médecins Sans Frontières estimated that 75 % of all the rape cases it dealt with worldwide were in eastern Congo .
Many young women have been abducted into sexual slavery .
In some villages , armed groups kill the men and rape all the women .
Many are left HIV positive and pregnant .
In some larger towns , such as Shabunda , Congolese human rights groups estimate seven out of 10 women have been raped .
Mutilation
Doctors say the onslaught against women is notable not only for its scale but for its brutality .
Gang rapes are commonplace and frequently accompanied by torture in which women are mutilated by having guns or stakes thrust into their vaginas , or their genitals slashed with knives .
One in four who make it to hospitals in Goma and Rutshuru require major surgery .
More than a third are teenagers .
Human rights groups say that while rape is a product of many conflicts , its systematic nature in Congo makes it a " weapon of war " used to terrorise and punish communities or as a tool of ethnic cleansing .
Immaculee Birhaheka , the head of Paif , a women 's rights group in Goma , said almost no woman outside of a few major towns is safe .
She describes what happened in a string of villages along the rudimentary road south from Goma toward Bukavu , 75 miles away .
" The women who come from there tell us that every woman in every village has been raped over the years .
There is not one who was not attacked , they told us .
Some of them were captured and taken into the forest for months , even two years .
When they are released some are in such bad condition that they die .
" The women do n't talk about it as a weapon of war but they say they are seriously targeted , that it is very organised .
It 's clear from the behaviour of the soldiers that they have permission to attack women .
Their commanders do not stop it and may even order it . "
One of those commanders is Colonel Edmond Ngarambe who serves in the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Rwanda ( FDLR ) , an armed group of Hutu exiles born out of the Interahamwe militia that led the genocide in Rwanda .
The FDLR controls about 40 % of the territory in the two Congolese provinces worst hit by conflict , North and South Kivu .
Last year , in a village south of Bukavu , he admitted his men were responsible for systematic sexual assaults on women .
" This thing of rape , I can't deny that happens .
We are human beings .
But it 's not just us .
The Mai Mai , the government soldiers who are not paid , the Rastas do the same thing .
And some people sent by our enemies do it to cause anger against us , " he said .
That many other groups - from the Mai Mai to Tutsi rebels and the Rastas , a group of defectors from the likes of the FDLR - are also responsible for mass rape is not in doubt .
But around Bukavu the victims tend to point the fingers at Ngarambe 's men .
It may be no coincidence that rape was an integral part of the mass killings in Rwanda 14 years ago .
The international tribunal trying those responsible for organising the genocide made a landmark ruling that for the first time defined rape as an act of genocide under international law if it is part of a systematic move to wipe out an ethnic group .
But others too are responsible .
Forces under the command of the rebel Congolese Tutsi general , Laurent Nkunda , who recently seized swaths of territory in North Kivu , have a long history of assaults on women .
Three years ago they attacked Bukavu .
A Human Rights
Watch report said Nkunda 's forces " went house to house raping and looting " .
Among the victims were teenagers and three girls of three years old .
Retribution
MSF says that " while rape is etched into the general framework of violence " , it 's also seen as legitimate " additional retribution " by the armed groups against civilians who fail to hand over food or are perceived as supporting their enemies .
Many women have to make the appalling choice between risking rape by venturing out of their villages to tend their crops in order to feed their children , and seeking a modicum of protection in numbers but risking starvation .
Among them is a 23 - year - old woman from Walikali .
She is small , thin - faced and her eyes dart about constantly .
" There were four of us .
I was looking for food .
There were seven Interahamwe and they took us .
Two of us tried to run away .
They shot at them .
One was shot through the chest and died .
The other got a bullet in the leg .
They raped her , " she said .
" I fainted because there were seven of them and it was too hard for me .
When they left it was raining .
Our families came looking .
We were all bleeding .
We were almost dead . "

Gestohlener Christstollen löste Datenskandal aus
Es ist der skurrilste Datenskandal des Jahres : Eine Frankfurter Zeitung sollte einen Christstollen geschickt bekommen - doch zwei Kuriere hatten Hunger und tauschten das Päckchen kurzerhand aus .
So bekamen die überraschten Journalisten Tausende Kundendatensätze der Landesbank Berlin geschickt .
Sakure is on the front line of a war that is not supposed to exist .
Perched on the rim of the Congo basin , it looks out from South Sudan and into the vastness of the rainforest beyond .
The victims of this war are strewn over the floor of that forest , their bodies left to rot , while others have been left as ashes in the charred remains of their villages .
Those that have survived are huddled among Sakure 's grass huts nervously eyeing the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo across which they fled .
It is a war that is waged by heavily armed soldiers against unarmed villagers and its casualties both living and dead mark the rebirth of Africa 's most feared guerrilla group – the Lord 's Resistance Army .
It was supposed to be a moribund force , a Ugandan rebellion which lost its support and its way after two decades of increasingly sickening violence , with seemingly little point .
A campaign launched in the 1980s claiming to defend the rights of the Acholi people in northern Uganda had become a byword for sadism .
Years of abductions where children were forced to kill their own parents in a brutal initiation had left them feared but hated .
Their leader and self - styled messiah Joseph Kony was supposed to be on the point of surrender , with his diminishing band of fighters contained in a transit camp awaiting the signing of a peace plan .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Instead the terror has been transplanted , this time to the remote north of Congo .
The bewildered victims of this campaign know nothing of the cause espoused by those that are hunting them – they have never been to neighbouring Uganda .
The rebel fighters moved into camps in Congo 's Garamba National Park in what was hoped would be the final staging post before peace .
But those talks have collapsed after the International Criminal Court issued a warrant for Kony 's arrest .
A deadline for the end of this month has been given to the guerrillas .
They sign the deal or face the consequences , but in their hundreds they have already slipped the net .
All along the border with South Sudan scores of refugees are streaming out of the bush and across the border every day with horrifying accounts of the return of the LRA .
Father Paul was on his way for an afternoon nap on 17 September in the Komboni mission in the Congolese village of Duru when he heard shouting .
Looking outside he saw dozens of soldiers marching towards the mission .
" They were dressed like soldiers but they were dirty .
Some wore witch doctors ' hats and dreads in their hair . "
Marching with them were the girls and boys of the village , women with babies , all carrying their meagre possessions : mattresses , radios , sugar , mobile phones and soap .
Pushing past Father Paul into the courtyard of the mission everyone was ordered to sit on the floor , while the building was ransacked .
A frail man in his late 70s , Father Paul was taken to his room and tortured by soldiers who insisted the priests must have money in the mission .
" I thought I was going to die so I got on my knees and prayed to the Lord .
When they heard me say his name they screamed at me , ' Do n't say that word ! '
And then hit me with their guns . "
Such attacks have been replayed across an entire region in recent weeks driving tens of thousands of the Zande people to flee into South Sudan or deeper into the forests of Congo .
The scene , says Father Paul , was straight out of the days of slavery .
The children were divided , then bound together and made to march , he remembers .
Left by his attackers in the bush , the priest returned to Duru to see its thousands of shelters ablaze , with the village 's only permanent structure , the mission , black and charred .
Not a shot had been fired .
The group prefer to use machetes .
Father Galdino Sakondo , a Catholic priest who has been working with victims of the terror on both sides of the border says the silent tactic is deliberate .
" They do n't shoot , they are just chopping .
You do n't know they are there until they reach your house . "

That was the fate of 15 - year - old Neima Kumbari in the village of Napopo .
" They came in the morning but I did n't see them at first . "
When she did realise the soldiers had arrived it was already too late .
Her parents were beaten with rifle butts , then , along with her uncle and a brother , burned alive in their own hut .
The soldiers had " no mercy " , she says .
Neima escaped by running into the bush while her village was torched , stepping over the fallen bodies of her dead neighbours as she ran .
After two days she reached Sakure having lost everything , her whole family .
In a flat , calm voice , Neima says she is still haunted by the bodies she stepped on .
Philip Charles did n't get the chance to run .
A shy , quiet 16 - year - old , he was at home near the Congo border when the area was overrun by a raiding party from the LRA .
The children were abducted , their families ' looted possessions strapped to them and then they were tied together in pairs and made to sit in silence .
" If we made a sound they would beat us to death , " he was told .
Later after the LRA fighters had been repelled in an attempted attack on Sakure they frog - marched " many " children into the forest .
Philip remembers telling the girl he was tied to that they had to find a way to escape .
" I was thinking I would n't survive .
They wanted to turn us into soldiers . "
After a night in captivity he was able to untie himself , throw down his heavy load and run into the bush .
She was not so lucky .
The fate of the lost girl is as predictable as it is nightmarish .
Amony Evelyn was 12 when she was taken under similar circumstances .
Her life in the bush was a mixture of drudgery and torture .
Part cook , part porter , part sex slave to Joseph Kony himself .
A man many believe to be clinically insane , he is said to see his mission as " purifying " the Acholi people and to encourage a quasi- religious cult involving black magic .
She bore him two children , the first when she was still 13 and was pregnant with a third when she fled last year after 10 years in captivity .
Today she is piecing her life back together with the help of a counsellor , Paul Rubangakena from the Catholic charity Caritas , in Gulu , across the border in Uganda .
He says the girls and boys in his care " wake up screaming from their nightmares " – even the staff are traumatised by the litany of horrors they have had to hear .
The UK - based arm of Caritas , Cafod , is also among the groups assisting the refugees in South Sudan .
Raphael Wamae , the group 's humanitarian officer , has been part of an early assessment team who arrived on the scene to gauge the scale of the refugee crisis .
" We can not ignore what is happening here because of events in Goma .
This is part of the same crisis .
Armed factions are roaming Congo preying on defenceless people , " he says .
Already more than 5,000 refugees have been counted , all in desperate need of food and shelter .
Countless more are roaming the bush and some 60 more are arriving every day .
Catholic church groups are calling for urgent assistance and warning that the area risks being ignored .
" The same factors driving the humanitarian disaster in Eastern Congo are at play here : weak states , lack of law and order and the scale of mineral wealth in DRC leave ordinary people at the mercy of men with guns , " says Mr Wamae .
Just as in the crisis in the east of Congo , the national army does nothing to protect its people and the UN peacekeepers , Monuc , are powerless to help .
At stake are a mesh of competing interests that stretch from Khartoum , through Darfur to the threatened Eastern Congolese city of Goma and the capital of Rwanda , Kigali .
Rebel groups can be used to control the money generated by Congo 's fabulous mineral wealth but they also serve the dual purpose of helping to destabilise regional rivals .
A recipe for proxy wars without end .
Lexon Bashir , the director of the South Sudan Relief and Rehabilitation Committee , rails against the " so - called LRA " .
" Why are they abducting children ?
Sudanese boys and girls as well .
We have seen children burnt beyond recognition their bodies thrown into fires . "
He sees an outside hand in the violent re-emergence of Mr Kony 's cult but refuses to say whose .
In private others are less reticent , pointing to helicopter drops of arms and ammunition to the LRA .
They believe that the government of Khartoum led by President Omar al - Bashir – a fellow indictee the ICC – is helping Kony 's army with a view to destabilising southern Sudan ahead of a possible resumption of that civil war .
In the clearing of Sakure , thousands of miles from Khartoum , girls like Neima suffer the reality of these machinations .
Despite nearly 400 soldiers from South Sudan stationed here to protect them and UN food aid finally reaching the refugees , she feels that she is still being hunted .
" There is a war , " she says .
" I do n't know what they want but I have heard they are called the LRA .
I 'm scared .
They are coming to Sakure . "
The altar boy who became a rebel leader who turned into a psychopath .
The self - styled prophet Joseph Kony has remained an elusive and terrifying figure casting a spell over first Uganda , then Sudan and the Central African Republic , and now the Democratic Republic of Congo .
Born in 1961 , he inherited his mantle as leader of the Acholi people from his aunt , Alice Lakwena , a mystic who started the Holy Spirit Movement against the government in Kampala .
While initially enjoying strong public support , Kony 's group , the Lord 's Resistance Army , turned on its own supporters in an increasingly brutal and incoherent campaign , supposedly bent on " purifying " the Acholi people and turning Uganda into a theocracy ruled by the Ten Commandments .
His army has been forcibly recruited from the Acholi , with as many as 20,000 children abducted and forced to commit atrocities that prevented them from returning home .
He has nurtured a cult of personality , claiming he is visited by a multinational host of 13 spirits , including a Chinese phantom .
Former abductees speak in awed terms of his " magical powers " and abrupt mood changes .
He is said to have taken up to 60 wives and fathered countless children .
A school dropout described as a " gentle boy " by classmates , he has become one of the most sadistic leaders in Africa .
In 2005 , the International Criminal Court issued a warrant for his arrest for crimes against humanity .
I 'm sure you 've heard about this BULLSHIT , where the SUPREME COURT of all people have turned their backs on the TRUTH and decided to let some guy with a name that DOESN'T SOUND VERY AMERICAN TO ME be President .
Well I 'd like to see this so called " Supreme Court " stop me and my caps lock key from exposing the truth .
Using the pages on the Internet thatI 've uncovered the shocking truth about Obama 's secret life !
Read on , but be warned that the revelations are so outrageous , that your head 's ass might just crap its pants !
__ April 4th , 1960 : Barack Hussein Obama is born in a secret Masonic chapel beneath the streets of Paris .
With genetic material scraped from the shroud of Turin and eggs stolen from an unconscious Marilyn Monroe , Obama is carried to term in the womb of a mysterious three headed dog , ancient beyond man 's ken .
For the first few months of his life he is raised by a shadowy cabal of ancient knights and professional baccart players , who program him with the knowledge he will need to one day destroy America .

Like a Kubrickian psychodrama retold at the microbial scale , zero - gravity physics seems to trigger salmonella 's dark side , making the food - poisoning bug more virulent when cultured in space .
But there may be a happy ending : Depending on what salmonella itself is fed , it can become less virulent — a trait that hints at new ways of weakening Earthly disease .
" There 's more to this than worrying about food poisoning in space , " said Arizona State University microbiologist Cheryl Nickerson .
" We 're opening new doors to understanding how pathogens in general are causing disease . "
Nickerson showed last year that salmonella became more contagious when cultured during a space shuttle voyage .
Upon returning from a ride on the STS - 115 space shuttle , unusually low doses were needed to infect mice : zero -gravity fluid dynamics seemed to trigger the same microbial attack mechanisms typically stimulated by the movement of fluid in our guts .
The salmonella used in that research were grown in a nutrient - rich medium .
Well - fed salmonella shot into space for Nickerson 's latest study , published recently in PLoS One also became extra-virulent .
This time , however , she also included a low - nutrient salmonella culture — and those bacteria proved to be far less virulent than their well - fed counterparts .
In both cultures , many of the same gene families were triggered , suggesting some sort of common master regulator that determines the response of salmonella to its environment .
If that function exists in other bacteria and can be manipulated by scientists , it could be tweaked to make them less able to cause disease .
" By identifying specific molecular mechanisms by which these organisms respond to stimuli in the space environment , " said Michael Roberts , a NASA microbiologist who was not involved in the study , " the group has identified potential therapeutic targets for limiting the bacteria ’s virulence inside our bodies . "
Also included in the latest experiment , carried on the March 2008 space shuttle mission STS - 123 , was a hybrid solution rich in five nutrients suspected by Nickerson of altering virulence : phosphate , magnesium , sulfate , chloride and potassium .
Salmonella grown in this broth proved weak , and further testing in lab - simulated zero - gravity environments suggests that phosphate may be especially important for reducing virulence .
That finding dovetails with another observation of Nickerson 's : the master Hfq protein that controls dozens of other genes activated during the experiment is linked to phosphate uptake and may be a common response regulator to this environment .
" We do n't have a complete mechanistic understanding of this process , but we have some exciting clues , " she said .
" There are lots of bits and pieces that allow us to start putting together the puzzle . "
Roberts called the research " interesting and highly important . "
He noted that it could also be useful for protecting astronauts and future space explorers .
" As we leave Earth to explore space and establish a sustained human presence beyond low - earth orbit , our constant companions will not only be along for the ride but will be evolving during the journey , " Roberts said .

Achievements are among the great prides of the Xbox gamer , and of all the virtual accomplishments one can strive for , zero - point Achievements are among the most peculiar .
They seem to be reserved for either the highest highs or lowest lows imaginable in the Xbox 360 and Xbox One libraries .
Maybe it's an ultimate signifier that you 've completed every other Achievement in the game and have fully conquered everything it has to offer ... or maybe it 's just the game thumbing its nonexistent nose at you by highlighting one of your more embarrassing moments .
We 'll be focusing on the latter today , so you know which games to avoid playing if you 've got low self - esteem .
On the flipside , for those of you who have a thing for being ridiculed or talked down to ( hey , no judgments here ) , these zero - point Achievements are sure to get you all riled up .
Their 0g value offers nothing to your total gamerscore , only serving as a blemish on the permanent record that is your Xbox account 's Achievement collection .
If you 're ever unfortunate enough to score these anti-Achievements , take solace in the fact that you can't be the only one .
Secret Service - The Exact Opposite of Your Job
If you 're constantly dismayed by the fact that the 2013 Gerard Butler vehicle Olympus Has Fallen never got a game tie - in , you might be able to get your President - protecting jollies by digging up the Xbox 360 shovelware game known as Secret Service .
That 's about the only reason to play this FPS , because its shoddy graphics , routine gunplay , and preposterous plot are all about as forgettable as the game 's title .
But credit where credit 's due : this zero - point Achievement is pretty funny .
In the final mission , it 's possible to shoot the President - the man you 've been protecting for the entire game - and effectively tender your resignation from the Secret Service by killing your tippy - top - level boss .
The exact opposite of your job , indeed .
NBA Ballers : Chosen One - Loser
Boy , NBA
Ballers sure does n't pull any punches with that Achievement name .
Everyone just loves when an Achievement calls them names after a bitter losing streak - in this case , five Ranked match losses in a row .
That 's the kind of downward spiral that can send anyone into a frenzy , nevermind being triggered by this Achievement into an all - out tirade .
Who the hell does this Chosen One think they are ?
Not like anyone remembers the NBA Ballers series - it wishes it had even an inkling of the fanbase that reveres NBA Jam or NBA Street .
I 'm a Loser , huh ?!
How about I snap this 360 disc in half ?
WHO'S THE LOSER NOW , MIDWAY ?!
Still , this is far less maddening than Dead of Alive 4's zero - point Achievement for losing a whopping 20 consecutive matches .
One can only imagine the kind of blinding rage that follows .
Dirt Rally - Mondays Be Like ...
This Achievement really has nothing to do with any particular day of the week , but there 's just something about Monday that makes everybody pile it on .
Garfield aficionados and those who loathe the start of the standard work week should appreciate this commemoration of a total failure during your rally - racing career .
To add this zero - pointer to your collection , you need to crash your car so badly that it instantly ends your rally .
The best method is to simply careen off a cliff at the earliest opportunity , dooming you and your co-driver to at least some severe injuries and at most a fiery death .
Anything for an Achievement .
50 Cent : Blood on the Sand - Not Bulletproof
It 's fairly obvious that Curtis ' 50 Cent ' Jackson is n't bulletproof - he is but a man , and his entire rap career was launched off of songs that repeatedly remind you of the time he got shot and persevered .
But apparently , surviving a shooting is equatable to immortality , because the rapper 's first game is titled 50 Cent : Bulletproof .
This anti-Achievement in Bulletproof 's sequel , Blood on the Sand , is a callback to its predecessor , and a celebration of your ability to be so bad at this third - person shooter .
To earn it , all you need to do is die on Easy mode - essentially making 50 look as soft as a down pillow covered in cashmere .
Oddworld : New ' n ' Tasty - Oops ...
If you 're a self - centered jerk , you might play this classic puzzle platformer as a game of pure self - preservation , guiding the lovable , fart - happy janitor Abe to safety while ignoring everyone else .
But the real purpose of Oddworld is to fulfill Abe 's true calling as the savior of his Mudokon people , seeking out and freeing his fellow slave laborers from abysmal working conditions ( and the threat of being turned into meat products ) within RuptureFarms .
That 's much easier said than done , as the other Mudokons completely rely on you to facilitate their deliverance .
And inevitably , you 're going to accidentally axe one of them by flubbing a level - pull that crushes them or sends them falling to their death .
As you 're stricken by a sense of shock , guilt , and mourning , this zero - point Achievement pops up to really rub it in .
Now you can never forget the horrible thing you 've done .
Blitz : The League - Weak Sauce
The Arizona Cardinals have a pretty spotty history .
Sure , they had a decent run a few years ago , and even made it to the Super Bowl against the Pittsburgh Steelers .
But when Blitz : The League was made , the Cardinals were known for closing a season with five wins or less .
This edgy representation of the NFL wanted to commemorate this team 's long record of mediocrity with a special zero - point Achievement , just for you .
In order to " earn " yourself nil points , simply lose against Arizona in game one of the career , and you 'll be greeted with the " Weak Sauce " Achievement .
When you 're celebrating over your recent acquisition , you can use that weak sauce for your weekend fantasy football parties .
That tang ?
That 's the taste of sorrow and defeat .
FIFA 08 - Beat Yourself
When soccer players are n't flopping around on the pitch like a fish out of water , they 're busy running around not scoring goals .
In a sport where 1 - 1 ties are not uncommon , the act of scoring a goal is a rare one .
Two points is considered a rousing game .
Scoring two on your own goal , though , is just bad luck .
But that 's exactly what will earn you the " Beat Yourself " Achievement .
Take that ftbol and kick it right past your own goaltender while everyone screams " YOU'RE GOING THE WRONG WAY !!! "
First time , it 's an accident .
Second time ?
Maybe you should read a rulebook .
The Simpsons Game - Pwnd
The Simpsons Game revels in breaking the fourth wall .
Heck , this is a game that not only gives you an Achievement simply for pressing start , but also features SimCity creator Will Wright as the final boss of the game .
It 's not afraid of mocking video game tropes left and right which also includes a few jabs at the player for their own suckitude .
If you d'oh ten times in a row , you 'll get the lovely zero - point Achievement " Pwnd . "
So , basically , you get a permanent badge that tells people you were terrible at a mediocre - ish licensed game .
Worst .
Achievement .
Ever .
Frontlines : Fuel of War - Noob
Welp , here 's some more l33tspeak for you .
Calling someone a " noob " is a way of insulting their playing skills ; a " dis , " if you will .
It 's short for " newbie , " and if you 're rewarded with this Achievement in Frontlines : Fuel of War , it 's likely because you 're not very good at this game ; or really , any other .
You receive this Achievement for killing yourself off ten times in any multiplayer match .
There are lots of ways to do it , really .
Grenades , rockets , or even falling from a great height a few times in a row will get you some sweet , non-existent points to add ( or not ) to your Gamerscore .
Guitar Hero 3 - Tail Between Your Legs
Boss Battles were a strange addition to the Guitar Hero series , but they actually provided a unique challenge to your plastic fretwork skills .
At three points during the campaign , you 'd do musical skirmish against a different rock god .
Before you start , though , you 're asked if you 're ready to commit .
But what if you 're not ?
What if you 've got food at the door , or your kid is screaming , or the apocalypse is literally happening around you ?
Careful if you click that " NO " button , because * BLOOP * there 's a special zero - point Achievement for that , too .
It 's called " Tail Between Your Legs , " and it assumes that you ran screaming in fear from Tom Morello , and not because you did n't want your Hot Pocket to get cold .
Tiger Woods PGA Tour 09 - Lost the Plot
Golf is already hard enough without having someone mocking you for your own personal failures .
You 've gotta smack a tiny ball toward an equally tiny hole , all while avoiding sand , water , and wind .
And you have to do it in three to five swings .
The only way it would be more difficult is if rabid wolves were hunting you down , which is why this " Achievement " stings more than most .
Sometimes every force of nature is conspiring against your attempt to land that putt , and Tiger Woods PGA
Tour 09 will grace you with a lovely " Lost the Plot " Achievement if you 're unable to complete a hole in under ten strokes .
It 's enough to make you go into a Happy Gilmore - like rage .
But quietly , of course ; this is a gentleman 's ( and gentlewoman 's ) game .
Superman Returns - Not That Super
Even the world 's greatest superhero needs some help now and then but that does n't mean he has to show it off to the world like the giant " S " emblazoned on his chest .
But that 's just what happens when you try to cheat in Superman Returns .
If you put in one of the invulnerability or power - up codes , you 'll also receive the " Not That Super " Achievement for your less than scrupulous actions .
The codes might make the crappy game more palatable , but the Achievement still feels like a metaphorical punch in the crotch with a kryptonite fist .
NHL 2K7/2K8 - Quitter !
There 's a special circle in hell for people who quit online matches for no good reason , and it 's unfortunate that there 's no real way to know if the person you 're playing against is going to duck out right when they 're about to lose .
Luckily , NHL 2K7 and 2K8 have a way of letting the whole world know if you 're a big poopy sore - loser - head .
If you wimp out of ten ranked online matches in a row , you are granted the rather telling " Quitter ! " Achievement .
Now the whole world will know what a terrible sport you are .
For the record , this is the only Achievement here that feels completely deserved .
Just take your lumps and move on .

� 2 Professional Minds Can Produce What 1,001 Unprofessional Minds Can't�
The ONLY proven $ NO WORK moneymaker for 2011 .
By Julian Siddle
Science Reporter , BBC News
Scientists used an eclipse method to make the detection Scientists say they have found evidence for water vapour in the atmosphere of a planet 63 light - years from Earth .
The " hot Jupiter " planet 's surface temperatures exceed 900C .
Writing in the journal Nature , the researchers say their discovery may help find planets that can support life .
In a separate study , another group of scientists said that it had detected carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) in the atmosphere of the same planet .
The planet known as HD 189733b is classed as a hot Jupiter because it is a gas giant orbiting close to its parent star .
The gases present in the planet 's atmosphere can be determined by looking at the spread of infrared radiation reaching the telescope , each gas producing a different wavelength .
Unique fingerprint Dr Drake Deming from Nasa 's Goddard Space Flight Center , Maryland , US , has looked for signs of water on similar gas giants in the past .
He says water vapour in the atmosphere leaves an unmistakeable signal .
" It produces a unique fingerprint , water vapour modulates the shape of the radiation in a very characteristic way , " he said .
As the planet is so far away it is hard to determine how much of the radiation detected by the telescope comes from this gas giant and how much from the star it orbits .
The scientists solved this problem using an eclipse technique , looking for differences in infrared light detected when the planet passed behind and in front of its parent star .
The observations were made with the Spitzer space telescope .
" There is a time when we know the planet is not visible , so we know the light comes only from the star , " says Dr Carl Grillmair from the Spitzer Science Center at the California Institute of Technology , who led the research .
They found HD 1897733b goes round its star every 2.2 days .
By measuring the dip in infrared light that occurs when the planet disappears , Spitzer can learn how much light is coming solely from the planet .
" The key to these measurements is the eclipse geometry , we have a unique moment in which to observe the star in isolation , " said Dr Deming .
Carbon Dioxide
The scientists were puzzled by earlier observations of HD 189733 b and similar gas giants .
They expected to see water vapour , but the telescopes did not detect any .
" We concluded there was no water a couple of years ago , the theoreticians were upset , they 'd predicted it would be there .
We did n't understand it .
We looked much harder we watched it for over 120 hours , and sure enough there was the signature matching brilliantly with the models , " said Dr Grillmair .
He suggests the planet 's proximity to the star means its atmosphere is constantly changing .
" With planets this close to their star ... you 're going to get enormous heat loads that create storms , perhaps clouds one year and none the next - this thing is changing right before our eyes " said Dr Grillmair .
The scientists suggest high clouds created by the storms may have hidden the water vapour in the earlier observations .
They are confident that the latest findings are correct .
" What 's new about this is it 's unequivocal , " says Dr Deming .
In a separate development , researchers used the Hubble space telescope to detect carbon dioxide in HD189733 's atmosphere .
Although the agency is keen to stress the planet is far too hot to support life , it says the finding represents an important proof of concept , showing that it is possible to detect CO2 in the atmospheres of distant planets orbiting other stars , and that the same method could be used to look at planets which might support life .
" The very fact we are able to detect it and estimate its abundance is significant for the long - term effort of characterising planets to find out what they are made of and if they could be a possible host for life , " said Mark Swain , a research scientist at Nasa 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , California , who analysed the Hubble images .

During his July trip to Iraq , Sen. Barack Obama met with a man who represents both an opportunity and an obstacle to his presidency : Army Gen. David H. Petraeus .
Petraeus , a hero to many Americans for his management of the war in Iraq , argued in a private briefing that military commanders should be given wide latitude in handing the future course of the war — though Obama was running for president on a platform calling for a withdrawal of combat troops in 16 months .
The meeting offered a test for a relationship that might help define Obama ’s term in office .
Though he ’s talked about governing in a bipartisan fashion , Obama ran for office as a progressive opposed to the Iraq war .
The uniformed military , typically wary of liberals in general , is unsure what to think about Obama — and the last Democratic president , Bill Clinton , stumbled early in his relationship with the military .
Yet Obama struck a balance in the Petraeus meeting .
“ If I were in his shoes , I ’d probably feel the same way ” about preserving flexibility for military operations , Obama said of Petraeus after the meeting ended .
“ But my job as a candidate for president and a potential commander in chief extends beyond Iraq . ”
To Peter Feaver , one of the leading scholars of civil - military relations , that comment was auspicious .
“ Obama had it pitch - perfect , ” said Feaver , a professor of political science at Duke University and a national - security staffer for both Clinton and President George W. Bush .
“ Obama was right to signal to the military , ‘ I want your military advice , and I will factor it into my strategic decisions , where military advice is one of my concerns . ’ ”
Whether a Commander - in - Chief Obama can continue the tone that Candidate Obama sounded in July remains to be seen .
According to interviews with active and retired military officers , Obama and the military can have a productive relationship , provided that Obama operates along some simple principles .
Consult , do n’t steamroll — and do n’t capitulate .
Be honest about disagreements , and emphasize areas of agreement .
Make Petraeus a partner , not an adversary .
Similarly , the uniformed military will have to keep certain principles in mind as well .
There ’s only one commander in chief , and you ’re not him .
Do n’t substitute military judgment for strategic judgment .
Obama enters office without some of the impediments to healthy civil - military relations that hindered Clinton .
Clinton , a baby boomer , had to deal with the legacy of not serving in Vietnam , while Obama , born in 1961 , does n’t have the baggage of the Vietnam era weighing him down .
“ He did n’t serve , but he did n’t serve with distinction , ” said Feaver , laughing .
Similarly damaging to Clinton was his early misstep with gays in the military .
During Clinton ’s transition from candidate to president , he seemed to suggest lifting the ban on gays serving openly , an implication seized on by conservatives and met with furor from the armed services .
His response was to back down — which set a tone to the military that an uncertain Clinton could be rolled .
Defense Department officials today still believe Clinton ’s early capitulation set a troublesome precedent .
“ If Clinton had simply ordered the military to lift the ban on gays in the military — as Truman did with racial integration against near universal opposition , ” said one Pentagon official who requested anonymity , “ he would have been much better off in dealing with the military for the rest of his administration .
There would have been a big fuss , but they would have respected him more . ”
The lesson for Obama , this official continued , is “ not to get rolled or railroaded by the top brass , as Clinton and his civilian team were by Colin Powell , ” who was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the time .
“ Obama and his team need to be respectful and solicitous of senior military advice , but leave no doubt about who is in charge . ”
Yet Obama does n’t wish merely not to be railroaded .
Much as with the Petraeus meeting in July , Obama ’s team has signaled an openness to the military since coming to Washington .
One of Obama ’s first foreign - policy aides in the Senate , Mark Lippert , deployed to Iraq in 2007 as a Naval reservist .
Several of his principal advisers today command widespread Pentagon respect .
Former Sen. Sam Nunn , who served as a longtime chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and is now an influential military reformer , is advising Obama ’s Pentagon transition .
Michele Flournoy , a former deputy assistant secretary of defense in the second Clinton term and prominent authority on counterinsurgency , is helping run Obama ’s Pentagon headhunting process .
Most important , Obama ’s aides have flirted in the past week with asking Bob Gates , the current defense secretary , to stay on for an extra year .
In addition to benefiting from succeeding a widely - disliked defense secretary , Donald Rumsfeld , Gates ’ brief tenure at Defense has earned plaudits from around the military , especially as he worked closely with Petraeus in implementing the troop surge in Iraq last year .
“ Keeping Gates is a huge gesture to the military , ” said Ian Moss , a Marine corporal who recently left active duty .
“ Simply put , from my conversations with military personnel , there is much respect for Gates .
By retaining Gates , Obama instantly communicates to military personnel that he values their assessment of Gates . ”
Feaver said the Gates trial balloon indicated that Obama does n’t intend to govern in an “ Anything But Bush ” manner — rigidly rejecting every aspect of the Bush legacy as a matter of principle .
“ The very fact that they want to send that signal is a positive from the point of view of civil - military relations , ” he said .
“ If it ’s not a trial balloon , and they actually do it , it would further cement an emerging view of Obama as a pragmatist . ”
One early decision that many in the military likely look to is whether Obama holds to his position on withdrawing from Iraq according to a fixed timetable .
As with the country as a whole , there is no unanimity of opinion on Iraq within the military .
But at the very least , the war is more personal to the military than it is to the civilian population .
Many view this withdrawal with anxiety .
Feaver said it would be useful for Obama to blur the difference between his withdrawal proposals and Petraeus ’ plan to shift the U.S. footprint to “ strategic overwatch ” functions , like training Iraqi troops — though Petraeus ’ plan has no timetable associated with it .
“ If what he ’s describing is a target , a goal that ’s desirable , that he ’ll shoot for , and work to make conditions on the ground consistent with … then that ’s not really much of a problem , ” Feaver said .
But if , on the other hand , Obama really does intend to withdraw two combat brigades every month — as he indicated during the Democratic presidential primaries , “ then that would spark a civil - military — I wo n’t say crisis , but a challenge to manage , ” Feaver pointed out .
Some members of the military community are more sanguine .
Several say that if they disagree with the decision , they respect Obama ’s authority to make it .
“ In the end , we are not self - employed .
And after the military leadership provides its best military advice , it is up to the policy - makers to make the decision and for the military to execute those decisions , ” said a senior Army officer recently back from Iraq , who requested anonymity because he is still on active duty .
“ Now , if those in the military do not like the decision , they have two choices .
One , salute smartly and execute the missions given them to the best of their ability .
Or , the other , leave the military if they do not feel they can faithfully execute their missions .
That is one way the military does get to vote in an all - volunteer force . ”
Moss agreed .
“ The military will just follow the order , ” he said .
“ The great majority of Americans want U.S. forces out of Iraq .
This is part of the reason Obama was sent to the White House . ”
Much as with Obama ’s pick for secretary of defense , many in the military will watch how Obama and Petraeus interact as a barometer for civil - military harmony .
To some degree , there could be an invisibility to the relationship — as the senior Army officer said , “ most will not know about or see ” what the president says to his Central Command chief — but it could still be closely scrutinized .
Not everyone is convinced that there will be tension between Obama and Petraeus .
“ I am certain Gen . Petraeus will fulfill the mission as tasked by the [ secretary of defense ] and the [ chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff ] without question , ” said Malcolm Nance , a former instructor of Navy special forces who has spent extensive periods in Iraq and Afghanistan .
“ I am certain as a combat officer of great intellect , a superlative battle staff and open mindedness , his real mission is singular : break Al Qaeda and kill the Al Qaeda senior leadership .
He did it in Iraq and he intends to do it in Afghanistan if given the chance .
“ There will be no MacArthurs here , ” Nance continued , referring to the legendary Army general whom President Harry S Truman fired for insubordination during the Korean War .
And for their part , Nance predicted , “ the phrase ‘ pleasantly surprised ’ should come to the lips of all military personnel who meet with Obama , ” judging from the inclusiveness Obama showed in his campaign .
Robert Mackey , a retired Army officer , said that both Petraeus and the new Iraq commander , Gen. Ray Odierno , can work with Obama despite disagreements on Iraq .
“ I think that both are pretty good thinkers , more than able to understand that change is going to occur and that their job is to complete whatever mission [ Obama ] orders them to do , ” Mackey said .
“ They do n’t have to be Obama ’s buddies to do the job .
In fact , that would most likely reflect poorly on the administration within the military . ”
Indeed , the differences between Obama and Petraeus or Odierno on Iraq might turn out to be healthy for civilian - military relations .
Judging from how the July meeting with Petraeus in Baghdad went , “ Obama should be in good shape , ” said the Pentagon official .
“ It will be a refreshing change from recent years , when civilian political leaders have shirked off tough questions about — and responsibility for — their war policies by claiming , in effect , that they ’re just taking directions from the commanders on the ground , in effect , hiding behind the skirts of the military . ”
Moss agreed .
Institutional pushback is “ not a bad thing ” necessarily , he said .
“ If anything , the major lesson from the past decade should be that the solutions to the challenges we face must be approached from multiple angles , and that is what Obama has signaled as his intention . ”
Like Feaver , the anonymous senior Army officer expected Obama to make Petraeus a partner on Iraq and other issues .
“ Once President - elect Obama is in office , ” the officer said , “ he can very easily shift his view based on advice he has received , as well as the situation on the ground at the time , since he has left himself an out or two over time .
It would be surprising to see him go completely against Gen .
Petraeus , since I would think [ Obama ] would rather have him in uniform than out — where he would then be free to provide commentary on the decisions that have been made . ”
Another challenge for Obama , beyond Petraeus and Iraq , would be senior officers ’ desire “ to get back to preparing — and procuring — for the big , conventional Russia - China scenario the U.S. military institutionally prefers , ” the anonymous Pentagon official said .
But the current financial crisis and massive budget deficits create their own pressures on defense spending .
All interviewed said there was no shortage of potential pitfalls in the new Obama - military relationship .
Two wars , a persistent threat from Al Qaeda , an overstretched ground force and a likely Pentagon budget crunch guarantee difficult decisions in the next four years .
“ The single biggest mistake Obama could make would be to “ completely discount the advice of the military senior leadership and those of his combat commanders who have the most experience dealing with the issues , ” said the anonymous senior Army officer .
“ Even if he does not discount it , but is perceived to discount it , the relationship will be largely going back to the Clinton era , and will take years to repair .
That ’s not something you want to do in a time of war , which most of the nation has forgotten . ”
Oh golly , what the fuck is there to say , besides how surprised we are that Donald Trump did n't find a way to chicken out of this shit .
Our headline is of course a reference to Joe Biden 's HI - LARIOUS clapback at one of Trump 's many comments about Biden 's upcoming debate win , the one where Trump challenges Biden to a drug test , probably knowing that if Biden acceded , Russia 's already got some clean pee to switch out with the real Trump sample , ALLEGEDLY .
( The other Trump campaign / GOP dumbass comments about Biden 's upcoming debate win are that Biden is TOO GOOD at debates , and also that he has dementia , and also that he has been fed the questions , and also some bullshit about Biden agreeing to have them check for earpieces , then pulling back from that request at the last minute , which totally did not happen .
It is a real consistent message at the Trump campaign . )
Anyway , whoever on the Biden campaign wrote that " urine " line , just know that Daddy is proud of you , and by " Daddy " we mean Wonkette .

First question :</ strong >< br></p><p>< strong>Hey ,
Trump , you picked some idiot Amy Comet PIng - Pong or something to be on the Supreme Court .

Words .</p><p>BIDEN : People are literally voting right now , Americans are < em > expressing their views < / em > .
This asshole over here wants to delete your Obamacare , and there are arguments on that November 10 .
He wants Amy Comet Ping - Pong there by then to kill your healthcare .
</p><p>TRUMP :
The people expressed their views when I lost the vote of the people in 2016 !
Also there are n't even 100 million people with pre-existing conditions , blah blah blah blah .
Socialist medicine !</p>< p>Also says Democrats are going to " dominate " Biden and make him do socialist medicine .
</p><p>BIDEN : Dude literally killed 200,000 people with COVID .
He is talking about healthcare .
All of this is great .

Now Trump is saying weird random words about how Biden did n't beat Bernie Sanders by very much , how if " Pocahontas " had stayed in , Biden would have lost every primary .
< br></p>< p>Trump's " strategy " here appears to be just to yell words and try to piss Biden off .

Trump says Obama did the SLOWEST RECOVERY since 1929 .
You know , the Great Depression .
Anyway , point is , he is taking credit for the Obama recovery , like he always does .
< br></p>< p>Biden is like " we handed him a booming economy , and he blew it . "

I am mixing up and getting confused about who said " super- predators " !
I am better than Abraham Lincoln !
All the cops support me !

</a> </p><p><strong>10:12:</strong>
Trump just bragging some lies about his own record now , including saying he got all these judges because Obama / Biden " left them " for him .
As opposed to how Mitch McConnell blocked them .< br ></p><p>He also mentioned Space Force .
</p>< p>Biden just called Trump " Putin's puppy " and mentioned the Russian bounties that Trump does n't care about < a href = " https://www.wonkette.com/its-56-days-until-the-election-and-trump-still-hates-the-troops " target = " _blank " > because he hates the troops < / a> and loves Putin .
</p><p><strong>10:15:</strong>
Oooooooooooh , Biden finally got mad .
Yelled at Trump for hating the troops , for attacking his son BEAU BIDEN , who fought in iraq .
Trump responded by saying " HUNTER BIDEN ? HUNTER BIDEN ? " and said he does n't " know Beau Biden . " < br></p><p>That was insane , but actually a good moment for Biden .
</p><p><strong>10:17:</strong>
LOLOL the question was " what will you do about climate change " and Trump is talking about < a href = " https://www.wonkette.com/trump-knows-what-forests-need-and-it-is-yard-work " target = " _blank " > raking the forest </a>
Jesus what a dumbfuck .
Then Trump literally just said that if the forests were " clean " they would not burn .
Says in Europe they do n't even understand why America does n't rake the forest .
< br ></p><p><strong>10:21:</strong>
Hahaha , the Biden store is already selling < a href = " https://store.joebiden.com/will-you-shut-up-man-black-t-shirt/ " target = " _blank " >" Will You Shut Up , Man ? " </a> t- shirts .
< br></p><p><strong>10:23:</strong>

</a>< br></p><p>Then Trump made up some shit about Biden calling the military " stupid bastards " but it did n't really land because nobody on earth thinks Biden said that .
</p><p>FINAL SEGMENT FINALLY .
About mail - in ballots .
</p><p>BIDEN : Everybody should vote .
They should count all the votes .
Vote early .
Vote in person .
Vote by mail .
( But preferably early / in person . )
Says he will accept the results as long as ALL THE FUCKING VOTES ARE COUNTED .
Because if everybody votes , fuck this guy , goodbye .
</p><p>You want four more years of this shit ?
</p><p><strong>10:30:</strong>
TRUMP : No peaceful transition !
No peaceful transition !
You are the peaceful transition !
You did the Logan Act to Michael Flynn !< br ></p><p>Anyway ,
Trump also says that if you did n't ask for your ballot , then you have been frauded , because you did n't even ask for a ballot .
And is making up shit about mail - in ballots .
And says they are losing 30 or 40 percent ( ???? ) of mail - in ballots .
</p><p>Biden is just staring at the camera like " what in the actual fuck is he talking about . "
</ p><p>Trump concludes : RIGGED !</p><p>< strong>10:32:</strong>
Joe Biden , can you instead of saying " there is no evidence " just say " WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS MORON EVEN TALKING ABOUT " ?
< br></p><p>< strong>10:34:</strong>
Also Trump just literally said he wants Amy Comet Ping Pong on the court to " look at the ballots , " by which he means throw out the ones without his name on them .
< br></p><p>< strong>10:36:</strong>
Final question :
Will both candidates commit to NOT declare victory before the election is called , and encourage their voters to cool their fucking jets ?< br ></p>< p>Trump is encouraging his supporters to " watch the polls , " like a fucking paramilitary .
And lying about those ballots in Pennsylvania , mission accompllshed , < a href = " https://www.wonkette.com/how-many-pennsylvania-ballots-can-you-fit-in-a-trash-can-none-really-but-that-wont-stop-bill-barrs-doj " target = " _blank " > Bill Barr the low - rent Roy Cohn shitbaby !</a></p>< p>Biden will commit to accepting the results once the votes are all counted ( at which point he will be the winner , if all the votes are counted ) .

Intel on Friday said it is researching technology to harvest free energy from the environment , which could lead to devices such as mobile phones running for indefinite periods without recharging .
The company is working on tiny sensors that can capture energy from sources such as sunlight and body heat .
In the future , such energy could be used to power personal electronic devices such as cell phones .
There are already watches available that are powered by body heat , as well as prototype smartphones with display screens that double as solar cells , said Justin Rattner , chief technology officer at Intel , during a press event .
Intel is also looking at powering a mobile phone by harvesting the energy the user generates by moving the phone 's trackball .
The radiation of cell phone or TV signals might also be used to power devices .
" Would n't it be nice if , in fact , you were able to go almost indefinitely without charging the battery , if you were able to scavenge enough free energy from the environment ? "
Rattner said .
Intel 's initial efforts revolve around the sensors , which could power themselves using free energy .
Recharging themselves by scavenging free energy allows the sensors to continuously record and transmit readings over wireless networks , without any human involvement .
For example , an accelerometer buried in the wall of a building could automatically recharge itself by harvesting the energy of radiation from a cell phone tower , allowing it to continuously take and transmit readings of the building 's movement .
" It would n't have any batteries , you would n't have to come out and service them , and you do n't have to run any power .
They are completely self - contained , and most importantly , self - powered as a result of scavenging energy from the environment , " Rattner said .
Intel has also designed a self - charging neural implant that can monitor bodily functions and transmit its readings wirelessly , Rattner said .
" I never have to ... come along with some sort of external fixture and have to recharge this .
These become ... install - and - forget systems , because they can scavenge energy from the environment and power themselves up , " Rattner said .
Intel has not marketed such a sensor yet , as its research is still ongoing , Rattner said .
Sensors use just a fraction of the power demanded by typical mobile devices , and it may take a while before the energy - harvesting technology can power larger items .
For now , the research is intended to provide a broader view of energy harvesting , and many Intel product groups are showing interest in it .
" We have n't been driving it as an Intel product ; it 's not on anyone 's road map at this point .
It 's part of our broader effort in both sensors and energy harvesting , " Rattner said .
December 1 , 2008
The crimes of the British and U.S. governments against the Chagossians in the 1960s and 1970s continue to be covered up today .
I WENT to the Houses of Parliament on October 22 to join a disconsolate group of shivering people who had arrived from a faraway tropical place and were being prevented from entering the Public Gallery to hear their fate .
This was not headline news ; the BBC reporter seemed almost embarrassed .
Crimes of such magnitude are not news when they are ours , and neither is injustice or corruption at the apex of British power .
Lizette Talatte was there , her tiny frail self swallowed by the cavernous stone grey of Westminster Hall .
I first saw her in a Colonial Office film from the 1950s which described her homeland , the island of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean , as a paradise long settled by people " born and brought up in conditions most tranquil and benign . "
Lizette was then 14 years old .
She remembers the producer saying to her and her friends , " Keep smiling , girls ! "
When we met in Mauritius , four years ago , she said : " We did n't need to be told to smile .
I was a happy child , because my roots were deep in Diego Garcia .
My great - grandmother was born there , and I made six children there .
Maybe only the English can make a film that showed we were an established community , then deny their own evidence and invent the lie that we were transient workers . "
Columnist : John Pilger John Pilger is a renowned investigative reporter and documentary filmmaker who was called " the most outstanding journalist in the world today " by the Guardian .
He is the author of numerous books , including most recently Freedom Next Time : Resisting the Empire , a collection of investigations into the effects of war crimes and globalization .
His books and films are featured at JohnPilger.com .
During the 1960s and 1970s British governments , Labour and Tory , tricked and expelled the entire population of the Chagos Archipelago , more than 2,000 British citizens , so that Diego Garcia could be given to the United States as the site for a military base .
It was an act of mass kidnapping carried out in high secrecy .
As unclassified official files now show , Foreign Office officials conspired to lie , coaching each other to " maintain " and " argue " the " fiction " that the Chagossians existed only as a " floating population . "
On July 28 , 1965 , a senior Foreign Office official , T.C.D. Jerrom , wrote to the British representative at the United Nations , instructing him to lie to the General Assembly that the Chagos Archipelago was " uninhabited when the United Kingdom government first acquired it . "
Nine years later , the Ministry of Defence went further , lying that " there is nothing in our files about inhabitants [ of the Chagos ] or about an evacuation . "
" To get us out of our homes , " Lizette told me , " they spread rumors we would be bombed , then they turned on our dogs .
The American soldiers who had arrived to build the base backed several of their big vehicles against a brick shed , and hundreds of dogs were rounded up and imprisoned there , and they gassed them through a tube from the trucks ' exhaust .
You could hear them crying .
Then they burned them on a pyre , many still alive . "
Lizette and her family were finally forced on to a rusting freighter and made to lie on a cargo of bird fertilizer during a voyage , through stormy seas , to the slums of Port Louis , Mauritius .
Within months , she had lost Jollice , aged eight , and Regis , aged ten months .
" They died of sadness , " she said .
" The 8 - year - old had seen the horror of what had happened to the dogs .
The doctor said he could not treat sadness . "
SINCE 2000 , no fewer than nine high court judgments have described these British government actions as " illegal , " " outrageous " and " repugnant . "
One ruling cited the Magna Carta , which says no free man can be sent into exile .
In desperation , the Blair government used the royal prerogative -- the divine right of kings -- to circumvent the courts and parliament and to ban the islanders from even visiting the Chagos .
When this , too , was overturned by the high court , the government was rescued by the law lords , of whom a majority of one ( three to two ) found for the government in a scandalously inept , political manner .
In the weasel , almost flippant , words of Lord Hoffmann , " the right of abode is a creature of the law .
The law gives it and the law takes it away . "
Forget Magna Carta .
Human rights are in the gift of three stooges doing the dirty work of a government , itself lawless .
As the official files show , the Chagos conspiracy and cover - up involved three prime ministers and 13 cabinet ministers , including those who approved " the plan . "
But elite corruption is unspeakable in Britain .
I know of no work of serious scholarship on this crime against humanity .
The honorable exception is the work of the historian Mark Curtis , who describes the Chagossians as " unpeople . "
The reason for this silence is ideological .
Courtier commentators and media historians obstruct our view of the recent past , ensuring , as Harold Pinter pointed out in his Nobel Prize acceptance speech , that while the " systematic brutality , the widespread atrocities , the ruthless suppression of independent thought " in Stalinist Russia were well known in the West , the great state crimes of western governments " have only been superficially recorded , let alone documented . "
Typically , the pop historian Tristram Hunt writes in the Observer : " Nestling in the slipstream of American hegemony served us well in the 20th century .
The bonds of culture , religion , language and ideology ensured Britain a postwar economic bailout , a nuclear deterrent and the continuing ability to ' punch above our weight ' on the world stage .
Thanks to U.S. patronage , our story of decolonization was for us a relatively painless affair . "
Not a word of this drivel hints at the transatlantic elite 's Cold War paranoia , which put us all in mortal danger , or the rapacious Anglo - American wars that continue to claim untold lives .
As part of the " bonds " that allow us to " punch above our weight , " the U.S. gave Britain a derisory $ 14 million discount off the price of Polaris nuclear missiles in exchange for the Chagos Islands , whose " painless decolonization " was etched on Lizette Talatte 's face the other day .
Never forget , Lord Hoffmann , that she , too , will die of sadness .

Keanu Reeves has signed to star in Universal Pictures period film “ 47 Ronin , ” which is based on the true tale of a band of samurai swordsmen who avenged the death of their master in 18th century Japan .
Reeves will play one of the swordsmen ; the group and their master are revered in Japan for their revenge attack on December 14 , 1702 .
Chris Morgan , who co-wrote “ Wanted ” and penned the upcoming “ Fast and Furious ” for Universal , is writing the script .
The film will tell a stylized version of the story , mixing fantasy elements of the sort seen in “ The Lord of the Rings ” films , with gritty battle scenes akin to those in films such as Gladiator .
Keanu Reeves ’s new movie , a remake of “ The Day The Earth Stood Still , ” is released on December 12 .
DALLAS , Dec. 5 ( UPI ) --
The U.S. federal government owes up to $ 52 trillion to citizens who have already earned benefits , officials of a non -profit group said .
The study by the National Center for Policy Analysis estimated $ 9.5 trillion is owed to current retirees -- an amount equal to almost $ 250,000 per person 65 years of age and older in 2008 .

" The numbers are staggering , " study co-author Andrew Rettenmaier , an NCPA senior fellow , said in a statement .
" No one thinks we are going to end these programs , but if we account for federal obligations the way private pensions and state and local governments are required to , the federal government owes up to $ 52 trillion as of today . "
Rettenmaier said that to put the numbers in perspective , the size of the entire U.S. economy is $ 14 trillion .
The study also said that :
-- Adding the liability owed to those nearing retirement , 55 and older , more than doubles the accrued debt to $ 20.6 trillion .
-- Adding the benefits accrued by younger workers brings the total to as much as $ 52 trillion .
The beneficiaries include all retirees , as well as anyone in the workforce above 22 years of age .
-- By 2012 , one out of every 10 income tax dollars will be needed to close the funding gap for Social Security and Medicare .

UXBRIDGE , Canada , Nov 24 ( IPS )
An apparent rapid upswing in ocean acidity in recent years is wiping out coastal species like mussels , a new study has found .
“ We ’re seeing dramatic changes , ” said Timothy Wootton of the Department of Ecology and Evolution at the University of Chicago , lead author of the study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The study shows increases in ocean acidity that are more than 10 times faster than any prediction .
“ It appears that we ’ve crossed a threshold where the ocean can no longer buffer the effects of CO2 in the atmosphere , ” Wootton told IPS .
For millions of years , the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and the ocean were in balance , but the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation has put more CO2 into the atmosphere over the last 150 years .
The oceans have absorbed one - third — about 130 billion tonnes — of those human emissions and have become 30 percent more acidic as the extra CO2 combines with carbonate ions in seawater , forming carbonic acid .
Each day , the oceans absorb 30 million tonnes of CO2 , gradually and inevitably increasing their acidity .
There is no controversy about this basic chemistry ; however , there is disagreement about the rate at which the oceans are becoming acidic and the potential impact .
The ocean ’s pH — the measure of acidity or alkalinity — has been declining , or becoming more acidic , at a rate of about 0.02 per decade since 1980 , said Ulf Riebesell , a biological oceanographer at the Leibniz Institute of Marine Sciences in Kiel , Germany .
“ We ’re just starting to realise the far - reaching impacts of ocean acidification , ” Riebesell told IPS , noting that the term ocean acidification was coined just four years ago .
Wootton and colleagues measured a massive pH decline of 0.4 units in just eight years off the northwest tip of Washington State in the U.S.
And that abrupt increase has had a major impact on marine species in the tide pool on Tatoosh Island where the study was conducted .
“ Large shell species like mussels and goose barnacles were dying at a faster rate and being replaced by other species , ” he said .

Femi Kuti by Nicolas Hidiroglou
The mythology of Fela Anikulapo Kuti is unrivaled in music .
As the story goes , the Nigerian Afrobeat pioneer stood tall in the face of vicious , politically - charged harassment from the government for nearly three decades .
His Kalakuta Republic compound was raided relentlessly , including a 1977 incident in which soldiers fatally tossed his elderly mother out a window and burned and destroyed nearly every piece of Fela ’s livelihood .
Despite the raids and countless dubious arrests , Fela endured , smoking massive spliffs while sporting tighty whiteys , delivering a big F - U to his foes in the form of long , sinewy , nasty funk tracks over which he taunted the government and its military .
He was the Black President long before Obama .
It ’s the stuff of legend .
But , as with any legend , there ’s some wiggle room between mythology and reality .
The fable makes little space for Fela ’s frustration and fatigue in his incessant but ultimately unsuccessful battle with a brutal regime .
The myth largely overlooks the 1990s , when Fela grew increasingly frail and his defiant message more muddled .
When he succumbed to an AIDS - induced illness in August 1997 , he was immortalized .
Few have felt that gap between myth and truth more than Femi Kuti , Fela ’s son and the heir to the Afrobeat throne .
Since long before his father ’s death , the 46 - year - old multi- instrumentalist has been the dominant face of Afrobeat , taking his Positive Force band across the globe and releasing five studio albums , a live DVD , a best - of collection and a remix album .
His seventh studio album , Day by Day ( Downtown Records ) , hit stores on November 18 .
He has had a remarkable career by any standard .
Femi has also faced a bitter dose of reality .
Shortly after Fela died in August 1997 , Femi ’s younger sister , Sola , died of cancer .
Five years later , on the heels of his two most successful records , Shoki Shoki and Fight to Win , Femi was sacked by his French record label , his band split up and his wife , Funke , a dancer and singer in his band and the mother of his 12 - year - old son , Omrinmade ( “ Made ” ) , left him .
To cap it all off , Femi ’s mother , Remi , with whom he was very close , died at the age of 60 .
As Femi spent time in France recording parts of Fight to Win , rumors swirled back home that he was in an asylum .
“ It was a very traumatic period for me , ” he says .
“ I was in a lot of emotional pain .
I had to be a father and mother to my son .
It was difficult leaving him at home to work .
It was a very hard time . ”
Femi Kuti by Mary Grace Dunn
Meanwhile , a revolt of sorts was beginning in his extended family . , a precocious and talented singer and saxophonist and Femi ’s half - brother , had aligned with Martin Meissonier , an acclaimed French producer and manager who had worked with Fela in the 1980s .
Seun brought in many of his father ’s instrumentalists and kept the Egypt 80 moniker Fela had given them .
Meanwhile , widespread reports in Nigeria told of tension between the half - brothers over the Kuti legacy .
Seun ’s scorching 2008 debut album , is full of blistering Afrobeat and drew broad acclaim .
Femi was widely credited with introducing his father ’s music to a new generation and ushering in an explosion in global interest in Afrobeat in the late 1990s , but now someone else was demanding a seat at the table .
“ People just wanted to start a fight and cause friction , ” Femi says .
“ People tried to play with my emotions and tried to make me look bad .
I never understood the competition .
I never had a problem with him .
People have said that I did n’t want him to succeed and that I did n’t want him to play music .
How can I stop him from playing music ?
Who am I to do that ? ”
Personal strife was compounded by national chaos .
Corruption reigned under Olusegun Obasanjo , Nigeria ’s president from 1999 - 2007 and the man who helmed the military when it harassed Fela in the 1970s .
Despite being home to one of the largest oil reserves on the planet , nearly 70 - percent of Nigeria ’s 140 million people live below the poverty line , and one in 20 are infected with HIV / AIDS .
The 2007 election of Obasanjo ’s handpicked successor , Umaru Yar ’Adua , was widely regarded as fraudulent .
Yar ’Adua ’s election had frightening consequences for Femi and his sister Yeni , who in 2000 had opened the New Africa Shrine , a performance and community space in the vein of their father ’s Shrine , which was destroyed along with his commune in 1977 .
In December 2007 , after years of peaceful relations with police , law enforcement raided the Shrine and hundreds of patrons were beaten and arrested .
As a result of the incident , the 2,000 - strong attendance at Femi ’s thrice - weekly performances at the Shrine dwindled to just a few hundred until recently starting to rebound .
“ They succeeded in scaring people for a while , ” Femi says .

People are so poor and desperate .
They have nothing , and the churches get people to donate their money for prayers .
Would n’t it be better if that money went towards a better medical system for people and a better education system for their children ?
The pastors live like gods .
People need to understand the effect of religion on our lives .

Enter the trumpet .
Of all the things to get Femi through his darkest hours , he turned to an instrument that he had only dabbled with in his nearly 30 - year career .
Femi says that more than any other instrument , the trumpet demands commitment .
That devotion has made him serene in a country largely devoid of serenity .
Femi & Made Kuti
“ The trumpet has really helped me become a calmer person and I really do n’t get that angry anymore , ” he says .
“ With the saxophone , you can leave it for a few weeks and come back , but you ca n’t really do that with the trumpet .
You must do it every day , and it has made me more disciplined in many ways .
It has changed my life . ”
He ’s also mended fences with Seun .
Femi says his half - brother has apologized for his role in the tiff , and has since performed at the Shrine .
“ The trumpet has helped me focus on what is important in my life , and I have found it easier to move forward from little things like that , ” he says .
The most important thing to Femi now is his children .
He has three of his own , and has also adopted four others , all friends of Made whose parents were reportedly too poor to look after them .
Much as his father Fela took him under his wing and made him a part of his band as a teenager , Femi has brought Made on tour for several years , and has made a place for him in his band .
Made plays saxophone on all of Day by Day and sings on the song “ One Two . ”
To Femi , passing on his father ’s legacy to his own son is his life ’s goal .
“ My ultimate objective before I leave this world is to give to him everything I know and arm him with all of the musical knowledge I have , ” he says .
“ That is now the purpose of my life . ”
Femi ’s tranquility is reflected in the music of Day by Day .
While you could hear his anger on the tracks he unveiled on his 2004 Live at the Shrine DVD , Day by Day is jazzier , more melodic and less forceful .
The title track features a lilting , gospel - infused chorus .
Femi Kuti by Nicolas Hidiroglou
However , the emerging personal calm in his life and music has n’t made Femi less angry about the state of his country and the African continent .
On , he rails against the negative impact of religion in Africa , and questions the value of democracy in a continent that is so riddled with corruption and whose fate is so intertwined with financial assistance from global institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund .
“ I have no faith in religion , and we face a battle to educate people that they are wasting their time , ” he says .
“ People need to understand how religion came to Africa .
It came to Africa brutally .
Christians came here and took our people , they took our gold and they gave us Jesus Christ .
Islam came and took our gold and gave us Muhammad .
People go to church every day , they spend the night in church at night vigils , waiting for the savior to come . ”
On one seven - kilometer road near his home in Lagos , Femi counts 58 churches , many with pastors who travel in private jets and some of the nicest cars in Nigeria .
“ How many churches do you need ? ” he asks .
“ People are so poor and desperate .
They have nothing , and the churches get people to donate their money for prayers .
Would n’t it be better if that money went towards a better medical system for people and a better education system for their children ?
The pastors live like gods .
People need to understand the effect of religion on our lives . ”
Femi has little faith that democracy alone will allow African countries to get out from under the weight of corruption , poverty , and disease .
He says with the U.S. , China and European nations so reliant on Africa for mineral resources like oil and diamonds , Western governments fuel the fires that turn into war and genocide .
“ If America , China and Europe did not buy these things from these people , what would they have to sell to fund their wars ? ” he asks .
“ This has been going on for hundreds of years . ”
Although poverty and corruption have vexed his country all his life , Femi knows that change is inevitable .
Fela ’s formation of his own political party in the 1970s and his indomitable anti-establishment crusade earned him the nickname “ Black President . ”
Now , the U.S. has its own .
“ Nobody believed that a black man would ever become President of the United States – NEVER , ” he says , with joy in his voice .
“ I do n’t even know if Obama ever believed it himself . ”
Despite years of personal and national strife that would break most men , Femi sounds rejuvenated .
At 46 , he ’s brimming with energy to write and record new music and do what he does best : deliver one of the best live shows on the planet .
“ I now know how to tackle family and political problems better , ” he says .
“ I will handle it all much better now .
I ’ve been writing more , and I ’m ready to go back into the studio .
The people have been waiting too long for this album .
I hope they forgive me . ”

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - John McCain received nearly $ 7 million in 6,652 donations that exceeded contribution limits while seeking the Republican presidential nomination , the Democratic National Committee said on Saturday .
The DNC listed the figure in a complaint it said it will file on Monday with the Federal Election Commission .
The Republican National Committee filed a similar complaint on October 5 , alleging Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama had not done enough to weed out illegal contributions .
In a copy of the DNC posted on the Internet , the DNC said on Saturday it compiled its information by examining donations recorded on McCain ’s campaign Web site .
“ Analysis of the information ... shows that the McCain Campaign has received 6,653 contributions each of which was at least $ 1,000 in excess of the applicable $ 2,300 limit to the primary campaign , ” the DNC complaint said .
“ Nineteen individuals contributed more then $ 10,000 each to the McCain Campaign -- more than four times the limit , ” said the document .
It said the donations included one person who gave $ 56,047 and overall totaled “ nearly $ 7 million . ”
The complaint asked the election commission to investigate the matter .
It also accuses the McCain campaign of accepting donations without getting the donors ’ names and addresses .
A spokesman for the McCain campaign was not immediately available for comment .
On its Web site , the New York Times political blog quoted McCain spokesman Brain Rogers as saying the DNC complaint was a publicity stunt to distract attention from Obama ’s “ shady fund - raising practices . ”
It has remained one of World War II ’s most enduring mysteries , one that resonated decades later after Sept. 11 : Who in Washington knew what and when before the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7 , 1941 ?
Specifically , who heard or saw a transcript of a Tokyo shortwave radio news broadcast that was interrupted by a prearranged coded weather report ?
The weather bulletin signaled Japanese diplomats around the world to destroy confidential documents and codes because war with the United States , the Soviet Union or Britain was beginning .
In testimony for government inquiries , witnesses said that the “ winds execute ” message was intercepted as early as Dec. 4 , three days before the attack .
But after analyzing American and foreign intelligence sources and decrypted cables , historians for the National Security Agency concluded in a documentary history released last week that whatever other warnings reached Washington about the attack , the “ winds execute ” message was not one of them .
According to some rumors , finally , Tom Brady has proposed to Gisele Bündchen !
He surely took his time to get ready for this move ; the rumors about their coming wedding had started last autumn after Tom was spotted at Cartier store eying a ring with a beautiful yellow diamond valued at $ 145,000 .
Guess , who ’s wearing it now .
So , he finally had the courage to get Gisele , his and her parents into a private jet , while making sure that it ’s filled with tons of white roses and champagne , and proposed to her right there in the sky somewhere between New Jersey and Boston .
However , Brady ’s father , Tom Brady Sr. claims , he knows nothing about the engagement .
At the same time , the couple was seen walking down Bean Town ’s Beacon Street , and Gisele was without the engagement ring .
Gisele Bündchen ’s representative does n’t comment on the gossip , according to People .
Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen met about two years ago .
His previous relationship , which lasted quite a while , was with the actress Bridget Moynahan .
Moreover , right after Tom left Bridget for Gisele it was discovered that Moynahan was in her third month of pregnancy .
However , that news did not make the New England Patriots quarterback change his mind .
Bridget gave birth to their son , John Edward Thomas Moynahan , in August , 2007 .
Brady ’s new girlfriend eagerly spends time with John Edward .
Well , after one got to know Tom and Gisele ’s story , one may think , is n’t it logical to marry ?
At least , we can expect this .
Gisele Bündchen is considered the most highly paid and influential model in the world .
She is beautiful , smart , kind – a dream wife .

Believe it or not , these babies were not made out of sperm and egg cell but through cake frosting !
These are made with marzipan , an almond paste consisting primarily of sugar and ground almonds .
Often with egg whites or yolks , used as a layer in cakes or molded into ornamental shapes .
Marzipan is often made into sweets : common uses are marzipan - filled chocolate and small marzipan imitations of fruits and vegetables .
It is also rolled into thin sheets and glazed for icing cakes and is traditionally used in wedding cakes , Christmas cakes , and stollen .
In some countries marzipan is shaped into small figures of animals , such as pigs , as a traditional treat for New Year ’s Day .
Marzipan is also used in Tortell , and in some versions of king cake eaten during the Carnival season .
In Italy , particularly in Palermo , marzipan ( marzapane ) is often shaped and painted with food colorings to resemble fruit — Frutta martorana — especially during the Christmas season .
In Portugal , traditional marzipan ( maçapao ) fruit shaped sweets made in the Algarve region are called morgadinhos .
There are other regions , as Toledo in Spain in which marzipan is shaped into simple animal shapes , and usually filled in with egg yolk and sugar ( yema ) .
In Latin American cuisine , marzipan is known as mazapán and is also traditionally eaten at Christmas .
In the Middle - East , marzipan ( known as lozina , which is derived from the word “ lows ” , the arabic word for almonds ) is flavored with orange - flower water and shaped into roses and other delicate flowers before they are baked .
But these ones are unique .
Every detail is amazing and really look real enough not to make you want to take a bite . 🙂
Changes :
However , they are not made of marzipan , but polymer clay .

Tuesday ’s elections are a thing of the past , but the battle over California ’s Proposition 8 is still going on .
On Thursday , a large group of demonstrators marched in Los Angeles in protest of the ban on gay marriage , with the Westwood area ’s Mormon temple as their eventual destination .
Los Angeles Times :
It was the latest in an escalating campaign directed against the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints for its role in marshaling millions of dollars in contributions from its members for the successful campaign to take away same - sex marriage rights .
Members of the Mormon church , who were strongly urged by church leaders to contribute to the Proposition 8 campaign , had an undeniable role in the measure ’s victory .
Opponents of Proposition 8 have accused the church of discriminating against homosexuals , but the backlash against the denomination has also sparked accusations of discrimination .

LAWRENCE -
Up the faded wooden stairway from the barred windows and empty storefronts of Essex Street , two men and a woman in white smocks labored in an aged workshop to forge the brittle fruit of their time - honored trade .
John Costanzo pulled and tugged , his wiry frame tense .
Norman Cooper kneaded , the muscles in his broad back straining .
Rhonda Freitas fashioned the finished product into the proper shape .
" You got to be strong , " Costanzo said , wiping his forehead with thick work gloves .
And then the job was complete : a batch of red-and - white striped candy canes , each of them 2 or 3 feet long .
This is Priscilla Candies , a mom-and - pop shop that is a bastion of the all - but - forgotten skill of handcrafting candy canes , the quintessentially sweet symbols of Yuletide that play three roles in Christmas celebrations : tree ornament , Christian symbol , and sticky - swirly peppermint treat .
The candy shop on the first floor does a bang - up business selling homemade hard candy and chocolates .
In a city particularly hard hit by foreclosures and unemployment , Priscilla has proved to be the rare small business thriving in the tumultuous Christmas season of 2008 .
At a time of mass production and commercial homogeneity , Priscilla makes good by staying simple and small .
Nothing epitomizes Priscilla 's tenacious grasp on tradition quite like Cooper 's annual batch of super - size candy canes .
" This is a dying art , " Cooper said as he watched Costanzo pull the taffy - like mixture of sugar and boiled corn syrup into the raw candy that would become his next harvest of cane .
" Not too many people know how to do it anymore . "
It 's hard work , but these folks are not complaining .
" I do n't really consider it work .
I enjoy doing it , " said Cooper , 63 , who has been wrestling sugar and corn syrup into candy cane for 40 years .
" A lot of people hate getting up and going to work each morning .
I do n't . "
To say that candy runs in the Cooper family is like saying the Kennedys like politics ; it 's a marked understatement .
Cooper 's wife , Harriet , 62 , who runs the shop on the first floor , has been working at Priscilla since she was 13 .
She inherited the store from her father , Achilles " Archie " Diamond , who purchased the store and candy factory in 1952 after working as chief candy maker for the previous owners .
Freitas , 39 , the Coopers ' daughter , has been at the shop since she was a 16 - year - old kid in the candy store of life .
" You either love this job or you hate it , " said Costanzo , 59 , who has worked there for 40 years , the only one of the four full - timers not in the family .
The shop , founded in 1928 and named by the original owners after Priscilla Alden , the first lady of the Mayflower , makes few concessions to modernity .
Under white - and yellow - checked wallpaper , display cases dazzle with homemade chocolate - dipped cherries , truffles , almond bark , penuche , cashew patties , white chocolate , and other delights .
One departure from tradition : orange and cherry - flavored candy cane , " for the kids , " Harriet Cooper says .
So decked out is the store in Christmas trinkets and colorful candies , it would thrive on Main Street in the North Pole .
BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) --
A man identified as an Iraqi journalist threw shoes at -- but missed -- President Bush during a news conference Sunday evening in Baghdad , where Bush was making a farewell visit .
President Bush , left , ducks a thrown shoe as Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki tries to protect him Sunday .
Bush ducked , and the shoes , flung one at a time , sailed past his head during the news conference with Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki in his palace in the heavily fortified Green Zone .
The shoe - thrower -- identified as Muntadhar al - Zaidi , an Iraqi journalist with Egypt - based al - Baghdadia television network -- could be heard yelling in Arabic : " This is a farewell ... you dog ! "
While pinned on the ground by security personnel , he screamed : " You killed the Iraqis ! "
Al - Zaidi was dragged away .
While al - Zaidi was still screaming in another room , Bush said : " That was a size 10 shoe he threw at me , you may want to know . "
Watch Bush duck the shoes »
Hurling shoes at someone , or sitting so that the bottom of a shoe faces another person , is considered an insult among Muslims .
Al - Baghdadia issued a statement Sunday demanding al - Zaidi's release .
Al - Zaidi remained in custody Monday while the Iraqi judiciary decides whether he will face charges of assaulting al - Maliki , a government official said .
The official said al - Zaidi is being tested for alcohol and drugs to determine if he was fully conscious during the incident .
Al - Zaidi drew international attention in November 2007 when he was kidnapped while on his way to work in central Baghdad .
He was released three days later .
Bush had been lauding the conclusion of a security pact with Iraq as journalists looked on .
" So what if the guy threw his shoe at me ? "
Bush told a reporter in response to a question about the incident .
" Let me talk about the guy throwing his shoe .
It 's one way to gain attention .
It 's like going to a political rally and having people yell at you .
It 's like driving down the street and having people not gesturing with all five fingers .
...
" These journalists here were very apologetic .
They ... said this does n't represent the Iraqi people , but that 's what happens in free societies where people try to draw attention to themselves . "
Bush then directed his comments to the security pact , which he and al - Maliki were preparing to sign , hailing it as " a major achievement " but cautioning that " there is more work to be done . "
" All this basically says is we made good progress , and we will continue to work together to achieve peace , " Bush said .
Bush 's trip was to celebrate the conclusion of the security pact , called the Strategic Framework Agreement and the Status of Forces Agreement , the White House said .
The pact will replace a U.N. mandate for the U.S. presence in Iraq that expires at the end of this year .
The agreement , reached after months of negotiations , sets June 30 , 2009 , as the deadline for U.S. combat troops to withdraw from all Iraqi cities and towns .
The date for all U.S. troops to leave Iraq is December 31 , 2011 .
Bush called the passage of the pact " a way forward to help the Iraqi people realize the blessings of a free society . "
Bush said the work " has n't been easy , but it has been necessary for American security , Iraqi hope and world peace . "
Bush landed at Baghdad International Airport on Sunday and traveled by helicopter to meet with President Jalal Talabani and his two vice presidents at Talabani 's palace outside the Green Zone .
It marked the first time he has been outside the heavily fortified Green Zone in Baghdad without being on a military base .
The visit was Bush 's fourth since the U.S. - led invasion of Iraq in March 2003 .
Afterward , Talabani praised his U.S. counterpart as a " great friend for the Iraqi people " and the man " who helped us to liberate our country and to reach this day , which we have democracy , human rights , and prosperity gradually in our country . "
Talabani said he and Bush , who is slated to leave office next month , had spoken " very frankly and friendly " and expressed the hope that the two would remain friends even " back in Texas . "
For his part , Bush said he had come to admire Talabani and his vice presidents " for their courage and for their determination to succeed . "
As the U.S. and Iraqi national anthems played and Iraqi troops looked on , he and the Iraqi president walked along a red carpet .

Bush left Iraq on Sunday night and arrived Monday morning in Afghanistan , where he will met with President Hamid Karzai and speak with U.S. troops .
In remarks to reporters , National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley , who traveled with Bush , described the situation in Iraq as " in a transition . "
" For the first time in Iraq 's history and really the first time in the region , you have Sunni , Shia and Kurds working together in a democratic framework to chart a way forward for their country , " he said .
On Monday , new violence in Iraq showed that work remains to be done .
A suicide car bomb attack killed at least three people and wounded 31 others west of Baghdad on Monday , an Iraqi Interior Ministry official said .
The noontime bombing targeted civilians on a road between Khan Dhari and Abu Ghraib , according to the official .
Also , the U.S. military said three militants were killed and 13 others were detained in operations targeting al Qaeda in Iraq on Sunday and Monday .
The incidents took place in Baiji , Tall Sumayyir , Tikrit , near the towns of Abu Ghraib , Mahmoudiya and Kirkuk .
CNN 's Jomana Karadsheh and Octavia Nasr contributed to this report .

“ If I can get in there to help take it apart , I do n’t mind , ” Mr. Black said .
“ That ’s where I spent the last 19 years .
That ’s what I know . ”
The closing of an auto plant draws a crowd , with some people somber and nostalgic and others defiant and energized .
Outside the Janesville plant on Tuesday , a few workers posed for pictures in front of the building while others said their goodbyes as they loaded gear in their snow - covered S.U.V.’s
One man had two small children with him on the last day .
Another man wearing an orange ski mask waved a large American flag as departing workers drove by .
Many of the workers trudged over to a one - story , cinder - block building on the grounds of the factory , a bar called the Zoxx 411 Club .
A sign said “ customers only ” and forbade reporters and media from entering .
Outside , a cluster of reporters , including a documentary film crew from Japan , tried to interview workers about the last days of the S.U.V. plant .
“ It ’s been a good ride , man , ” said Frank Hereford , a body shop worker , as he left the plant with a microwave oven that heated up countless lunches during many of his 38 years with G.M.
“ Good people worked down here . ”
Everyone loves talking about Twitter ’s business model — because there is n’t one yet , and they ’ll keep talking about it until there is one .
But it ’s becoming more clear that while a business model is of course important , Twitter is perhaps the perfect example of a company that can afford to take its time in finding the one that is perfect for it .
That ’s because other businesses are building so much on top of the micro-messaging service and using it for their own services .
If worst came to worst , and Twitter had to sell , there would probably be a bidding war of a magnitude that would make it seem like this country was n’t in the midst of a recession .
InternetNews has a good rundown of the Twitter / business phenomenon .
Buried in it is this gem :
Less altruistically , some businesses have discovered that Twitter is an effective way of communicating with consumers .
Dell ( NASDAQ : DELL ) says Twitter has produced $ 1 million in revenue over the past year and a half through sale alerts .
People who sign up to follow Dell on Twitter receive messages when discounted products are available the company ’s Home Outlet Store .
They can click over to purchase the product or forward the information to others .
If Twitter has made Dell $ 1 million in revenue , imagine how much it ’s making for all of the companies it helps promote .
While a million dollars may not be much to a company like Dell , for some smaller companies that are also using Twitter as a sales / promotional tool , it is no doubt invaluable .
Twitter is expected to lay out its plan for how to monetize the service in 2009 .
It may involve creating premium , corporate accounts , which seems like a good idea given the numbers Dell is stating .
But while everyone is busy getting in a tizzy over its business model , Twitter continues to gain popularity , including the all - important mainstream variety .
One way or another , Twitter will be fine — even if that still does n’t make sense to some people .

The National Mining Association , a trade group , welcomed the rule , saying it could end years of uncertainty that had put jobs and coal production in jeopardy .
The coal industry could be the largest beneficiary of last - minute environmental rules .
“ This is unmistakably a fire sale of epic size for coal and the entire fossil fuel industry , with flagrant disregard for human health , the environment or the rule of law , ” said Vickie Patton , deputy general counsel of the Environmental Defense Fund .
The Environmental Protection Agency is trying to finish work on a rule that would make it easier for utilities to put coal - fired generating stations near national parks .
It is working on another rule that would allow utility companies to modify coal - fired power plants and increase their emissions without installing new pollution - control equipment .
Joan M. Mulhern , a lawyer at Earthjustice , an environmental group , denounced the mining regulation .
“ With less than two months left in power , ” Ms. Mulhern said , “ the Bush administration is determined to cement its legacy as having the worst environmental record in history . ”
At issue , she said , is a type of mining in which “ coal companies blast the tops off mountains to reach the seams of coal and then push the rubble into the adjacent valleys , burying miles of streams . ”
Administration officials rejected the criticism .
“ This rule strengthens protections for streams , ” said Peter L. Mali , a spokesman for the Interior Department office that wrote the regulation .
“ Federal law allows coal mine waste to be placed in streams , and the rule tightens restrictions as to when , where and how those discharges can occur . ”
The rule gives coal companies a legal right to do what , in the past , they could do only in exceptional circumstances , with special permission from the government .
Amid the iPhone 3G launch hysteria , we made a pronouncement that , looking back now long after the dust has settled , pretty well nailed it : forget hardware , it 's code that counts .
Code via the juggernaut that is the App Store , which allowed the iPhone to truly came into its own as a mobile platform .
Now , our first official look at T - Mobile 's G1 , the first Android - capable phone built by HTC , is less than 24 hours away , and the same adage holds true now more than ever .
Android 's openness puts the emphasis even more squarely on the code this platform will run , making the hardware almost an afterthought .
And while it 's still quite early in the game and things wo n't really kick up until the G1 becomes available sometime in October , the Android Market is already looking like an equally if not more vibrant place for great apps for your phone .
One of the main positive points in our Android preview guide was that Android will likely be home to the best direct tie-ins to Google 's web apps like Maps , Docs , and Gmail , of any device around .
And not only will they shine individually ( remember 's Apple 's proud claims of the iPhone 's custom Google Maps integration ? ) , each Google service is set up as an open API within Android , meaning they 're all available for mashing up with any other type of data imaginable in third party applications , effectively allowing developers to easily convert awesome Google service hybrids ( like Beer Mapping , one of my favorites ) into mobile apps .
Unsurprisingly , Maps integrations are the main focus being taken by the early wave of Android Apps , many of which were written in response to the Android Developer 's challenge .
Throw in location awareness via GPS or cell towers ( another Android core service ) , and we 've got ourselves the ingredients for some truly next - level stuff .

Enkin :
When many people envisioned a location - aware future for mobile tech , they were probably dreaming up something like Enkin .
If you can last through the somewhat brutal video here , you 'll see some amazing potential : Enkin is basically a visualization framework for location information which can place locations on a two - dimensional map , a quasi - three - dimensional Google Earth type view , and coolest of all , overlay them onto the view streaming live out of your phone 's camera .
It uses GPS and accelerometers to sense exactly which direction the camera pointing , giving you an annotated view of the real world .
You can add your own placemarkers or draw them in from the internet .

Locale : Borne from an MIT class specifically for writing Android apps ( and winner of a $ 275,000 first prize from the Android dev challenge ) , Locale lets you define your most frequented places on a map and set your phone to respond to those places in a number of different ways .
While the prototype is mostly focused on phone settings ( like switching to silent when you 're in the office or at a movie theater ) , these kinds of frameworks can be expanded infinitely .
Home automation software could be programmed to turn on the lights ( or start cooking your breakfast , Pee - Wee Herrman style ) once you 're a few blocks away from your home , for instance .
It takes Bluetooth proximity to a whole new level , one that 's not dependent on the limited proximity to another device but only your actual real - world location independent of any other variables .

In a similar vein is GeoLife , a location - aware to - do list .
You can pair actions on your list to locations ( or types of locations ) to get a reminder to buy milk when you 're near a grocery store .

BioWallet :
Not all of the innovative apps are map based .
BioWallet uses your phone 's camera as an iris scanner to lock down sensitive information like account numbers and passwords on your phone , or even the phone itself .
Handwriting - based IDs can also be implemented , all processed for an additional pass / fail reading - all processed on the phone itself which keeps biometric data secure .

Teradesk e-Storage :
We love Air Share on the iPhone , and e-Storage looks to provide many similar services , with file versioning and Google Docs integration ( one of the first of many G - Docs tie-ins , surely ) .
True , some of these apps could seemingly be just as at home in the iTunes App Store and on other platforms ( many mobile OS 's have some iteration of a barcode reader , for instance ) .
But what has the potential to set Android apart though is its open source foundation ; with the support of the open - source development community - one of the largest and most important driving forces of innovation in computers and software throughout history - Android could blast open mobile platforms even further than the iPhone has or could .
Especially when you consider the core open - source projects that have shaped the internet since the beginning - Apache , MySQL , PHP , ssh , and countless others - making it onto phones in a core and unified way .
Despite early SDK kinks , we could be seeing some exciting stuff in the next few months .

The revelation that Bernard Madoff  brilliant investor ( or so almost everyone thought ) , philanthropist , pillar of the community  was a phony has shocked the world , and understandably so .
The scale of his alleged $ 50 billion Ponzi scheme is hard to comprehend .
Yet surely I ’m not the only person to ask the obvious question :
How different , really , is Mr. Madoff ’s tale from the story of the investment industry as a whole ?
The financial services industry has claimed an ever - growing share of the nation ’s income over the past generation , making the people who run the industry incredibly rich .
Yet , at this point , it looks as if much of the industry has been destroying value , not creating it .
And it ’s not just a matter of money : the vast riches achieved by those who managed other people ’s money have had a corrupting effect on our society as a whole .
Let ’s start with those paychecks .
Last year , the average salary of employees in “ securities , commodity contracts , and investments ” was more than four times the average salary in the rest of the economy .
Earning a million dollars was nothing special , and even incomes of $ 20 million or more were fairly common .
The incomes of the richest Americans have exploded over the past generation , even as wages of ordinary workers have stagnated ; high pay on Wall Street was a major cause of that divergence .

The news from Iraq on Wednesday shows that the Iraqi government ’s hold on power is fragile , and that it faces shadowy coup plotters from within and a continued guerrilla insurgency from without .
Parliament is so divided that it had to go home after vehement wrangling in which the shoe - throwing journalist , Muntazar al - Zaidi , figured prominently .
Al - Zaidi continued to be lionized by many Iraqis , including in Fallujah , where a student rally in his defense drew the fire of the US military .
The British prime minister , Gordon Brown , showed up unexpectedly in Baghdad , to announce that British troops would be out of the country by June .
Turkey bombed positions of the Kurdish Workers Party ( PKK ) in northern Iraq for a second straight day .
The NYT reports that an elite counter - terrorism unit that reports directly to Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki has arrested 38 officials in the Interior Ministry ( similar to US Homeland Security ) .
They are accused of belonging to the neo -Baath “ al - `Awdah ” party and of plotting a coup against the Iraqi government .
This cover story makes no sense , and it seems more likely that al - Maliki is continuing to clean house and is purging Interior of people placed there by previous governments or by the US CIA and Department of Defense .
The Interior Ministry was set up by Naqib al - Falah , an ex-Baathist Sunni whose father had been a Baathist general who defected in the 1970s .
Ayad Allawi was the CIA ’s point man in organizing the defecting officers in London .
Naqib Falah was brought onto the cabinet by CIA Allawi when the latter was appointed interim prime minister by the US in 2004 .
Falah seeded Interior with fellow Sunni ex-Baathists and set up a special police commando unit that initially targeted Shiites .
Likewise , Iraqi Intelligence appears to have been a mainly CIA operation in 2003 - 2006 .
When the Shiite United Iraqi Alliance won the 2005 elections , PM Ibrahim Jaafari gave interior to Bayan Jabr , a Turkmen member of the pro-Iran Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in iraq .
Jabr reconfigured the special police commandos as a hard line Shiite unit .
But neither Jaafari nor al - Maliki has had complete control of the bureaucracy , and many of Falah ’s ex-Baathists , whether Sunni or Shiite , managed to hold on to their jobs .
Until now .
Anyway , that is my guess .
Otherwise , it is not plausible at this late date that 28 people in Interior could make a neo -Baath coup .
Three car bombs killed 18 persons and just one of them wounded 52 in Baghdad on Wednesday .
The largest of the bombs targeted a police station in Nahdha shopping district in northeastern Baghdad .
Two bombings also killed 4 persons in the northern city of Mosul on Wednesday .
British PM Gordon Brown showed up in Baghdad to announce the withdrawal of British troops from Iraq by June .
Brown has been getting severe pressure from his conservative and Liberal - Democratic opposition over the need to set a timetable .
Iraqi parliamentarians got into a shouting match on Wednesday over Muntazar al - Zaidi , with MPs of the Sadr Movement demanding that the session , originally called to discuss the withdrawal of US troops from Iraqi cities by June 30 , instead be devoted to al - Zaidi and allegations that he was beaten and injured in custody .
The wrangling got so bad that Speaker of the House Mahmoud Mashhadani threw up his hands and left , declaring that he intended to resign his post because presiding over parliament was an impossible task .
McClatchy reports that university students in the Sunni Arab city of Fallujah west of Baghdad held a demonstration on Wednesday in which they waved their shoes and threw stones at US troops .
McClatchy writes :
‘ Students raised their shoes and threw rocks at American soldiers , who reportedly opened fire above the crowd .
Protesters said that indirect fire wounded one student , Zaid Salih .
U.S. forces have n’t confirmed the account .
“ We demonstrated to express our support for Muntathar al Zaidi , but we were surprised with the entrance of the U.S. military , ” said Ahmed Ismail , one of the protesters .
“ Unconsciously , we raised our shoes expressing our support for al Zaidi , but they attacked us . ” ‘
1500 demonstrators also came out for al - Zaidi on Wednesday in the Sunni Arab enclave of Adhamiya , on the east bank of the Tigris .
Al - Zaidi , a Shiite , had once been kidnapped in that district , before ultimately being released .
McClatchy says that Muntazar al - Zaidi ’s brother reports that the journalist did not appear in court on Wednesday , but rather was interviewed in his holding cell out at the airport by the judge .
Despite Iraqi government denials , this procedure lends credibility to the allegations that al - Zaidi suffered a broken wrist and broken ribs when he was arrested and so would have found it painful to attend court– moreover , his condition would have drawn press comment .
Al - Hayat reports in Arabic that the harsher law under which al - Zaidi might be sentenced to as much as 7 years is para .
3 , article 223 , issued by the Iraqi Baath Party in 1969 .
So those arguing that the book should be thrown at al - Zaidi are essentially delivering him into the hands of Baathist law .
McClatchy reports a general mood in Iraq in the wake of the shoe - throwing , of “ we ’re mad as hell and we ’re not going to take it anymore .
The mood was manifested when drivers refused to let Iraqi soldiers close the road in front of the green zone on Wednesday , and ignored their warning shots .
There were pro-Muntazar demonstrations on Wednesday in Beirut , where students beat effigies of Bush with shoes , and in Lahore , Pakistan , where journalists came out in support of their colleague .
Two parliamentarians representing Mosul called on PM Nuri al - Maliki to remove the Kurdish paramilitary from the city in the run-up to the provincial elections on Jan. 31 .
They fear that the Peshmerga will interfere in the elections .
Kurdish leaders deny the charge .

Deep inside the Frasassi cave system in Italy and more than 1,600 feet below the Earth 's surface , divers found filamentous ropes of microbes growing in the cold water , according to a team of Penn State researchers .
The Frasassi cave system is located north of Rome and south of Venice in the Marche region .
These limestone caves are like New Mexico's Carlsbad Caverns and Lechuguilla Cave , but in those caves , sulfur entered the caves from oil and gas reserves , while in Italy , the sulfur source is a thick gypsum layer below .
Having sulfur in the environment allows sulfur - using organisms to grow .
" Sulfur caves are a microbiology paradise .
Many different types of organisms live in the caves and use the sulfur , " says Jennifer L. Macalady , assistant professor of geosciences .
" We are trying to map which organisms live where in the caves and how they correspond to the geochemical environment .
"
In this process , Macalady and her team discovered a previously unknown form of biofilm growing in the oxygen - deficient portion of the lake .
A micrograph of rope shows DNA , bacteria and archaea .
Blue filaments are DNA strands .
Green fluorescent dyed bactera , red to pink archaea .
fluorescent probes label ribosomes , which are only visible when the cells are metabolizing .

" The cave explorers had seen these strange biofilms , " says Macalady .
" So we asked them if they could get us a sample .
" The researchers received about the weight of two paper clips of the strange rope to analyze .
They reported the results of their DNA sequencing today ( Dec. 19 ) at the American Geophysical Union Conference in San Francisco .
"
We did not retrieve any sequences for known methane - producing organisms or known methane oxidizers , " says Macalady .
The researchers did find that about half the organisms were bacteria and the other half belonged to another single - celled group of organisms called archaea .
The researchers identified half the bacteria as sulfate reducers , bacteria that convert sulfates into sulfide to obtain energy .
Of the archaea , more than half were associated with organisms usually found in deep sea sediments and referred to as marine benthic group D ( MBG - D ) .
Researchers do not know how MBG - D organisms obtain energy , although they are always found in oxygen - less locations .
The 2 inches of ropey biofilm under study was two - tenth of an inch in diameter .
Microscopic images of the rope show that some of the single - celled organisms have shapes that intertwine with each other and some have tendrils .
This image shows a microbial rope in the bottom half of the cave lake .

" We do not know why the have the shape they do , " says Macalady .
" Microorganisms in them likely secrete some sticky goo , an extra - cellular polymeric substance -- slime that holds them together .
" What the researchers do know is that the location where these ropes grow is very low in available energy -- considered an energy - limiting environment .
The location can support only very slow growth .
The ropes range in length from one to two meters , and radiocarbon dating places them at 1,000 to 2,000 years old .
" Previous researchers have estimated the rate of cell growth in some deep sea sediments to a cell division every thousand years , " says Macalady .
Microscopic images of the rope using three dyes , one for DNA , one for bacteria and one for archaea , show very little activity in the bacteria or archaea , probably because the dyes highlight ribosomes and they only exist in a cell when it is actively metabolizing .
The researchers , who include Macalady ; Daniel S. Jones and Rebecca R. McCauley , graduate students , geosciences ; Irene Schaperdoth , research associate ; and Dan Bloom , undergraduate honors student in astrobiology , are hoping to obtain more microbial rope samples this summer .
They will work with divers to get samples from the deepest and shallowest ends of the ropes in order to find clues about how they grow .

Big Sugar Wo n't Like This Princeton Study On Addiction
Almost anything can be considered colloquially ' addictive ' if you like it enough - computer games , Reese 's Peant Butter Cups , reading Scientific Blogging articles and the best science blogs on the planet .
Clinical addiction is another issue , though , and Princeton University Professor Bart Hoebel and his team in the Department of Psychology and the Princeton Neuroscience Institute say they have evidence that sugar can be an addictive substance , wielding its power over the brains of lab animals in a manner similar to many drugs of abuse .
So now sugar addiction can overtake " I have a thyroid condition " as the number one excuse obese people use in America .
Hoebel has been studying signs of sugar addiction in rats for years .
Until now , the rats under study have met two of the three elements of addiction .
They have demonstrated a behavioral pattern of increased intake and then showed signs of withdrawal .
His current experiments captured craving and relapse to complete the picture .
" If bingeing on sugar is really a form of addiction , there should be long - lasting effects in the brains of sugar addicts , " Hoebel said .
" Craving and relapse are critical components of addiction , and we have been able to demonstrate these behaviors in sugar - bingeing rats in a number of ways . "
At the annual meeting of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology in Scottsdale , Ariz. , Hoebel will report on profound behavioral changes in rats that , through experimental conditions , have been trained to become dependent on high doses of sugar .
" We have the first set of comprehensive studies showing the strong suggestion of sugar addiction in rats and a mechanism that might underlie it , " Hoebel said .
The findings eventually could have implications for the treatment of humans with eating disorders , he said .
Lab animals , in Hoebel 's experiments , that were denied sugar for a prolonged period after learning to binge worked harder to get it when it was reintroduced to them .
They consumed more sugar than they ever had before , suggesting craving and relapse behavior .
Their motivation for sugar had grown .
" In this case , abstinence makes the heart grow fonder , " Hoebel said .
The rats drank more alcohol than normal after their sugar supply was cut off , showing that the bingeing behavior had forged changes in brain function .
These functions served as " gateways " to other paths of destructive behavior , such as increased alcohol intake .
And , after receiving a dose of amphetamine normally so minimal it has no effect , they became significantly hyperactive .
The increased sensitivity to the psychostimulant is a long - lasting brain effect that can be a component of addiction , Hoebel said .
Hoebel has been interested in the brain mechanisms that control appetite and body weight since he was an undergraduate at Harvard University studying with the renowned behaviorist B.F. Skinner .
On the Princeton faculty since 1963 , he has pioneered studies into the mental rewards of eating .
Over the past decade , Hoebel has led work that has now completed an animal model of sugar addiction .
Hoebel has shown that rats eating large amounts of sugar when hungry , a phenomenon he describes as sugar - bingeing , undergo neurochemical changes in the brain that appear to mimic those produced by substances of abuse , including cocaine , morphine and nicotine .
Sugar induces behavioral changes , too .
" In certain models , sugar - bingeing causes long - lasting effects in the brain and increases the inclination to take other drugs of abuse , such as alcohol , " Hoebel said .
Hoebel and his team also have found that a chemical known as dopamine is released in a region of the brain known as the nucleus accumbens when hungry rats drink a sugar solution .
This chemical signal is thought to trigger motivation and , eventually with repetition , addiction .
The researchers conducted the studies by restricting rats of their food while the rats slept and for four hours after waking .
" It 's a little bit like missing breakfast , " Hoebel said .
" As a result , they quickly eat some chow and drink a lot of sugar water . "
And , he added , " That 's what is called binge eating -- when you eat a lot all at once -- in this case they are bingeing on a 10 percent sucrose solution , which is like a soft drink . "
Hungry rats that binge on sugar provoke a surge of dopamine in their brains .
After a month , the structure of the brains of these rats adapts to increased dopamine levels , showing fewer of a certain type of dopamine receptor than they used to have and more opioid receptors .
These dopamine and opioid systems are involved in motivation and reward , systems that control wanting and liking something .
Similar changes also are seen in the brains of rats on cocaine and heroin .
In experiments , the researchers have been able to induce signs of withdrawal in the lab animals by taking away their sugar supply .
The rats ' brain levels of dopamine dropped and , as a result , they exhibited anxiety as a sign of withdrawal .
The rats ' teeth chattered , and the creatures were unwilling to venture forth into the open arm of their maze , preferring to stay in a tunnel area .
Normally rats like to explore their environment , but the rats in sugar withdrawal were too anxious to explore .
The findings are exciting , Hoebel said , but more research is needed to understand the implications for people .
The most obvious application for humans would be in the field of eating disorders .
" It seems possible that the brain adaptations and behavioral signs seen in rats may occur in some individuals with binge - eating disorder or bulimia , " Hoebel said .
" Our work provides links between the traditionally defined substance - use disorders , such as drug addiction , and the development of abnormal desires for natural substances .
This knowledge might help us to devise new ways of diagnosing and treating addictions in people . "
Visiting researchers Nicole Avena , who earned her Ph.D. from Princeton in 2006 , and Pedro Rada from the University of Los Andes in Venezuela wrote the paper with Hoebel .
Hilarious : FOX News Starts A Green Website
Like us on Facebook :
The current article you are reading does not reflect the views of the current editors and contributors of the new Ecorazzi
Someone should tell FOX News that their latest online venture is playing directly into the hands of the far - left liberal agenda !
One of our tipsters ( Thanks , Linton ! ) pushed us towards a new website started by the “ fair and balanced ” network called “ How Green ? ” .
Less than questioning environmental movement , the site is more a aggregtor of green news from around the web — with some original pieces on green tech and products thrown in .
It looks to be in the early stages of launch — but just seeing that FOX News logo with the recycling icons around it is making me want to throw up and laugh at the same time .
Seeing this website is particularly ironic after watching Fox and Friends earlier this week belittle kids for trying to get their families to go green .
Good one .
But truly , we should look no further as to why FOX News is jumping onto the green scene than from their own Greg Gutfeld :
“ Being green is just an excuse for self - absorbed saps to prove their superiority without doing anything superior . ”
And that , folks , is what FOX News does better than anyone else .
Now we know .
SEATTLE -- Don Wakamatsu is proud to be the first Asian - American manager in major league history .
He 's also keenly aware of what his grandparents endured , generations before he took over the Seattle Mariners .
During World War II , the United States government moved his Japanese ancestors across the country from one internment camp to another .
Wakamatsu's father , an iron worker , was born in one .
" I 'm proud to represent some of what they went through in their lifetime , " Wakamatsu said .
" If I can set a future stepping stone for Japanese - Americans and just the equality in baseball , I 'm glad to bear that torch . "
A fourth - generation Japanese - American , the former Oakland bench coach was introduced Wednesday as the new manager of the Mariners .
The team has close ties to Japan , from Hiroshi Yamauchi , its titular head and Japanese billionaire , through All - Star outfielder Ichiro Suzuki , the franchise cornerstone .
James Wakamatsu , 93 , and 91 - year - old wife Ruth were hardworking , modest - living fruit growers in Oregon 's Willamette Valley before the U.S. rounded up Japanese living in this country during the war .
The elder Wakamatsus were first sent to live in an internment camp set up in the infield of a horse racing track in Portland .
Then they were moved to Tule Lake , Calif. , to Jerome , Ark. , and to the Chicago area .
When the war ended , they resettled in Hood River , Ore. Wakamatsu 's parents were there , too -- his mother is Irish - American -- and he was born there .
" When they got out , they were offered the barracks to buy .
They ended up shipping it to Hood River , Ore. , " he said of his grandparents .
" As a child , I had no idea I was living in the barracks they were interned in .
It blew me away . "
James and Ruth still live in that former part of an internment barracks in Hood River .
They were thrilled when their grandson beat out six other candidates to become a major league manager for the first time .
" They are proud of me , " Wakamatsu said , smiling .
Wakamatsu's wife , Laura , sat a few feet to his left during a news conference .
She and their three children are proud of him , too .
Just after being introduced , Wakamatsu held up a sign 10 - year - old daughter Jadyn made to celebrate Dad 's big day .
" KNOCK 'EM DEAD !
From : Sis , " the sign read in blue and red crayon .
" This might be our theme for the year , " Wakamatsu said .
" I told him , ' It better be , ' " Mariners general manager Jack Zduriencik said , chuckling .
This 45 - year - old relative unknown spent five years as a bench coach and third - base coach in Texas , then one year as bench coach for the A's before Seattle called .
He has never managed above Double - A .
His task : Reverse the culture and performance of a team that last season became the first to lose 100 games with a $ 100 million payroll .
" This is the crown jewel of what we 've tried to do , " Zduriencik said , pointing to Wakamatsu and referring to his overall remake of the Mariners ' scouting and player - evaluation departments in the last month .

Wakamatsu will be Seattle 's fifth manager since the departure of Lou Piniella following the 2002 season .
The Mariners have tried Bob Melvin , Mike Hargrove , John McLaren and Jim Riggleman since then .
Wakamatsu and the six other candidates all interviewed last week and all had zero experience as a manager in the major leagues .
The overwhelming fan favorite was former Seattle second baseman and current Chicago White Sox bench coach Joey Cora .
Zduriencik said Wakamatsu got the job because he was a former catcher at Arizona State -- where he played with Barry Bonds -- and in the minors from 1985 - 96 .
That last season was as a player - coach for Double - A Port City in the Mariners ' system .
He was a teammate for 19 games there with Raul Ibanez , Seattle 's top RBI producer who is now a free agent deciding whether to stay or leave .
The GM likes the catcher 's perspective of constantly considering the totality of games .
He noted the Angels ' Mike Scioscia as one example of a successful manager who was a catcher .
Zduriencik also liked Wakamatsu 's ties to the Northwest .
Wakamatsu also lived for two years in suburban Bremerton , Wash . , as a grade schooler while his father built one of Seattle 's tallest buildings .
And the GM loved that Wakamatsu has spent his major league coaching life in the AL West , which Seattle has n't won since its last playoff appearance in 2001 .
Wakamatsu was a minor league catching coordinator for the Anaheim Angels in 2001 - 02 before going to Texas .
Wakamatsu was raised in Hayward , Calif. , after moving out of that house which had been an internment barracks .
He knows only a little Japanese , though it has improved lately with his daughter helping him with Berlitz courses .
He hopes to learn the language better to relate closely with Suzuki and to improve Mariners catcher Kenji Johjima , who struggled so much last season he was benched months after signing a $ 24 million , three - year contract extension .
Asked what expectations should be in Seattle after last season ended as the Mariners ' worst since 1983 , Wakamatsu said : " I 'm not going to sit up here [ and ] promise the moon .
Obviously , someone promised the moon last year and it did n't work out .
" I think there 's talent .
I think there 's youth ...
I think there 's starting pitching that 's pretty deep , a pretty good closer .
" Just with osmosis , we ought to be better than we were last year . "
I wonder if this guy talks like that ALL the time .
I know if I were him , I definitely would .
It 'd be a pretty crazy mindfuck to play him on Live .
I really wanna be this guys friend .
and so on ...

Chapter Four -- Primitive Accumulation and the Rise of Capitalism Introduction .
In the Introduction to Part Two , we referred to the " nursery school tale " of primitive accumulation , which has long served the capitalists as a legitimizing myth .
In fact , capitalist apologists seldom even address the issue , if they can avoid it .
More often , they take the existing distribution of property and economic power as a given .
Their most dumbed - down line of argument , typically , simply starts with the unquestioned fact that some people just happen to own the means of production , and that others need access to these means and advances to live on while they work .
From this it follows that , if the owners of capital are kind enough to " provide " this " factor of production " for the use of labor , they are entitled to a fair recompense for their " service " or " abstinence . "
The inadequacy of this approach should be clear from even the most cursory consideration .
An apologist for state socialism might just as easily say , to a free market advocate in a state - owned economy , that he would n't have a job if the state did n't " provide " it .
An apologist for the manorial economy could likewise admonish the ungrateful peasant that all his labor would avail him nothing without the access to the land that the feudal landlord graciously " provided . "
The question remains : how did those who control access to the means of production come to be in this position ?
As Oppenheimer pointed out in his criticism of Marshall , no discussion of the laws governing the distribution of product can be meaningful without first considering the " primal distribution of the agents ( factors ) of production .... " 1
To the extent that they are forced to address this question at all , capitalist apologists fall back on the above - mentioned nursery tale , by which existing class divisions arose naturally from an " original state of equality , ... from no other cause than the exercise of the economic virtues of industry , frugality and providence . "
There is , in this process , " no implication ... of any extra-economic power . " 2
As Marx summarized it , the legend of primitive accumulation was a sort of variation on the fable of the ant and the grasshopper :
In times long gone by there were two sorts of people : one , the diligent , intelligent , and , above all , frugal élite ; the other , lazy rascals , spending their substance , and more , in riotous living ....
Thus it came to pass that the former sort accumulated wealth , and the latter sort had at last nothing to sell except their own skins .
And from this original sin dates the poverty of the great majority that , despite all its labour , has up to now nothing to sell but itself , and the wealth of the few that increases constantly although they have long ceased to work .
Such insipid childishness is every day preached to us in the defence of property ....
In actual history it is notorious that conquest , enslavement , robbery , murder , briefly , force , play the great part .
3 Perhaps Engels should have titled his work Anti-Marx , instead of Anti-Dühring .
Oppenheimer also recounted this edifying fable , in language quite similar to that of Marx .
Since , however , Oppenheimer was a free market socialist like Hodgskin and Tucker , he was ( unlike Marx and Engels ) in no danger of subsequent embarrassment over the implications of rejecting the bourgeois fairy tale .
Somewhere , in some far - stretching , fertile country , a number of free men , of equal status , form a union for mutual protection .
Gradually they differentiate into property classes .
Those best endowed with strength , wisdom , capacity for saving , industry and caution , slowly acquire a basic amount of real or movable property ; while the stupid and less efficient , and those given to carelessness and waste , remain without possessions .
The well - to - do lend their productive property to the less well - off in return for tribute , either ground - rent or profit , and become thereby continually richer , while the others always remain poor ....
The primitive state of free and equal fellows becomes a class State , by an inherent law of development , because in every conceivable mass of men there are , as may readily be seen , strong and weak , clever and foolish , cautious and wasteful ones .

This ahistorical myth survived the twentieth century , and is still alive and well -- at least so long as it is not challenged by the historically literate .
It was stated by Mises in Human Action : " The factory owners did not have the power to compel anybody to take a factory job .
They could only hire people who were ready to work for the wages offered to them .
Low as these wage rates were , they were nonetheless much more than these paupers could earn in any other field open to them . "
5
It can be illustrated by any number of boilerplate articles in The Freeman : Ideas on Liberty , debunking the " myth " of dark satanic mills or Third World sweatshops , on the ground that laborers found them preferable to " available alternatives " :
But are the “ low - wage , non-union ” Ecuadorian laborers better off working now for some foreign corporation ?
Apparently they think so , or else they would have stayed with what they were doing previously .
( Would you leave your job for one with less pay and worse conditions ? )
[ Barry Loberfeld .
" A Race to the Bottom " ( July 2001 ) . ]
People line up in China and Indonesia and Malaysia when American multinationals open a factory .
And that is because even though the wages are low by American standards , the jobs created by those American firms are often some of the best jobs in those economies .
[ Russell Roberts .
" The Pursuit of Happiness : Does Trade Exploit the Poorest of the Poor ? " ( September 2001 ) ]
What the Industrial Revolution made possible , then , was for these people , who had nothing else to offer to the market , to be able to sell their labor to capitalists in exchange for wages .
That is why they were able to survive at all ....
As Mises argues , the very fact that people took factory jobs in the first place indicates that these jobs , however distasteful to us , represented the best opportunity they had .
[ Thomas E. Woods , Jr. " A Myth Shattered : Mises , Hayek , and the Industrial Revolution " ( November 2001 ) ]
In nineteenth - century America , anti-sweatshop activism was focused on domestic manufacturing facilities that employed poor immigrant men , women , and children .
Although conditions were horrendous , they provided a means for many of the country 's least - skilled people to earn livings .
Typically , those who worked there did so because it was their best opportunity , given the choices available ....
It is true that the wages earned by workers in developing nations are outrageously low compared to American wages , and their working conditions go counter to sensibilities in the rich , industrialized West .
However , I have seen how the foreign - based opportunities are normally better than the local alternatives in case after case , from Central America to Southeast Asia .
[ Stephan Spath , " The Virtues of Sweatshops " ( March 2002 ) ]
The fairy tale was retold recently by Radley Balko , who referred to Third World sweatshops as " the best of a series of bad employment options available " to laborers there .
6
Within a couple of days , this piece was recirculated over the " free market " [ sic ] blogosphere , along with numerous comments to the effect that " sweatshops are far superior to third - world workers ' next best options ... , " or to similar effect .
7
This school of libertarianism has inscribed on its banner the reactionary watchword : " Them pore ole bosses need all the help they can get . "
For every imaginable policy issue , the good guys and bad guys can be predicted with ease , by simply inverting the slogan of Animal Farm : " Two legs good , four legs baaaad . "
In every case , the good guys , the sacrificial victims of the Progressive State , are the rich and powerful .
The bad guys are the consumer and the worker , acting to enrich themselves from the public treasury .
As one of the most egregious examples of this tendency , consider Ayn Rand 's characterization of big business as an " oppressed minority , " and of the Military - Industrial Complex as a " myth or worse . "
The ideal " free market " society of such people , it seems , is simply actually existing capitalism , minus the regulatory and welfare state : a hyper - thyroidal version of nineteenth century robber baron capitalism , perhaps ; or better yet , a society " reformed " by the likes of Pinochet , the Dionysius to whom Milton Friedman and the Chicago Boys played Aristotle .
Vulgar libertarian apologists for capitalism use the term " free market " in an equivocal sense : they seem to have trouble remembering , from one moment to the next , whether they ’re defending actually existing capitalism or free market principles .
So we get the standard boilerplate article in The Freeman arguing that the rich ca n’t get rich at the expense of the poor , because " that ’s not how the free market works " -- implicitly assuming that this is a free market .
When prodded , they ’ll grudgingly admit that the present system is not a free market , and that it includes a lot of state intervention on behalf of the rich .
But as soon as they think they can get away with it , they go right back to defending the wealth of existing corporations on the basis of " free market principles . "
The capitalist myth of primitive accumulation cannot stand up either to logic or to the evidence of history ; by the two together , it has been smashed beyond recovery .
Oppenheimer demonstrated the impossibility of such primitive accumulation by peaceful means .
Exploitation could not have arisen in a free society , by the working of the marketplace alone .
The proof is as follows :
All teachers of natural law , etc. , have unanimously declared that the differentiation into income - receiving classes and propertyless classes can only take place when all fertile lands have been occupied .
For so long as man has ample opportunity to take up unoccupied land , " no one , " says Turgot , " would think of entering the service of another " ; we may add , " at least for wages , which are not apt to be higher than the earnings of an independent peasant working an unmortgaged and sufficiently large property " ; while mortgaging is not possible so long as land is yet free for the working or taking , as free as air and water ....
The philosophers of natural law , then , assumed that complete occupancy of the ground must have occurred quite early , because of the natural increase of an originally small population .
They were under the impression that at their time , in the eighteenth century , it had taken place many centuries previous , and they naively deduced the existent class aggroupment from the assumed conditions of that long - past point of time .
8
But on examination , Oppenheimer pointed out , the land could not have been occupied by natural and economic means .
Even in the twentieth century , and even in the Old World , the population was not sufficient to bring all arable land into cultivation .9
If , therefore , purely economic causes are ever to bring about a differentiation into classes by the growth of a propertyless laboring class , the time has not yet arrived ; and the critical point at which ownership of land will cause a natural scarcity is thrust into the dim future -- if indeed it can ever arrive .
10
The land had , indeed , been " occupied " -- but not through the economic means of individual appropriation by cultivation .
It had been politically occupied by a ruling class , acting through the state .
As a matter of fact , ... for centuries past , in all parts of the world , we have had a class State , with possessing classes on top and a propertyless laboring class at the bottom , even when population was much less dense than it is to - day .
Now it is true that the class State can arise only where all fertile acreage has been occupied completely ; and since I have shown that even at the present time , all the ground is not occupied economically , this must mean that it has been occupied politically .
Since land could not have acquired " natural scarcity , " the scarcity must have been " legal . "
This means that the land has been preempted by a ruling class against its subject class , and settlement prevented .
11 Establishing this does not , by any means , depend simply on such deductive arguments .
The political preemption of the land is a fact of history .
The basic facts , largely beyond serious controversy , are accessible in a large body of secondary works by such radical historians as J.L. and Barbara Hammond , E. G. Hobsbawm , and E. P. Thompson .
Capitalism , arising as a new class society directly from the old class society of the Middle Ages , was founded on an act of robbery as massive as the earlier feudal conquest of the land .
It has been sustained to the present by continual state intervention to protect its system of privilege , without which its survival is unimaginable .
The current structure of capital ownership and organization of production in our so - called " market " economy , reflects coercive state intervention prior to and extraneous to the market .
From the outset of the industrial revolution , what is nostalgically called " laissez - faire " was in fact a system of continuing state intervention to subsidize accumulation , guarantee privilege , and maintain work discipline .
Accordingly , the single biggest subsidy to modern corporate capitalism is the subsidy of history , by which capital was originally accumulated in a few hands , and labor was deprived of access to the means of production and forced to sell itself on the buyer 's terms .
The current system of concentrated capital ownership and large - scale corporate organization is the direct beneficiary of that original structure of power and property ownership , which has perpetuated itself over the centuries .
A. The Expropriation of Land in the Old World The term " capitalism " is commonly used , especially on the libertarian right , simply to refer to an economic system based primarily on markets and private property .
There is no harm in this ; many intellectually honest libertarians ( e.g. the Nockians and the Rothbardian Left ) distinguish clearly between their " free market capitalism " ( much of which is amenable to the free market socialism of Benjamin Tucker ) , and the " actually existing capitalism " of today 's corporate economy .
But that is not the meaning of capitalism as the classical socialists used the word .
As we have already seen , Thomas Hodgskin used the term " capitalism " to refer , not to a free market , but to a statist system of class rule in which owners of capital were privileged in a manner analogous to the status of landlords under feudalism .
For Marx , free markets and private property were not sufficient conditions of capitalism .
For example , an economic system in which artisans and peasants owned their means of production and exchanged their labor - products in a free market would not be " capitalism . "
Capitalism was a system in which markets and private property not only existed , but in which workers did not own the means of production and were forced instead to sell their labor for wages .
For capitalism as we know it to come about , it was essential first of all for labor to be separated from property .
Marxians and other radical economists commonly refer to the process as " primitive accumulation " 12 :
In themselves money and commodities are no more capital than are the means of production and of subsistence .
They want transforming into capital .
But this transformation itself can only take place under certain circumstances that centre in this , viz. , that two very different kinds of commodity possessors must come face to face and into contact ; on the one hand , the owners of money , means of production , means of subsistence ... ; on the other hand , free labourers , the sellers of their own labour power , and therefore the sellers of labour ....
The capitalist system presupposes the complete separation of the labourers from all property in the means by which they can realise their labour ....
The process , therefore , that clears the way for the capitalist system , can be none other than the process which takes away from the labourer the possession of his own means of production ....
The so - called primitive accumulation , therefore , is nothing else than the historical process of divorcing the producer from the means of production .... 13 This process did not come about naturally .
" ... Nature does not produce on the one side owners of money or commodities , and on the other men possessing nothing but their own labour power ....
It is clearly the result of a past historical development , the product of many economic revolutions , of the extinction of a whole series of older forms of social production .
"
14 The means by which it did come about was described by Marx , in perhaps the most eloquent passage in his entire body of work : ....[ T] hese new freedmen became sellers of themselves only after they had been robbed of all their own means of production , and of all the guarantees of existence afforded by the old feudal arrangements .
And the history of this , their expropriation , is written in the annals of mankind in letters of blood and fire .
15 That was brought about by expropriating the land , " to which the [ peasantry ] has the same feudal rights as the lord himself , and by the usurpation of the common lands .
" 16 Although some form of forcible robbery took place in every country in Europe , we focus on Britain as the case most relevant to the origins of industrial capitalism .
To grasp the enormity and wickedness of the process , one must understand that the nobility 's rights in land under the manorial economy were entirely a feudal legal fiction deriving from conquest .
The peasants who cultivated the land of England in 1650 were descendants of those who had occupied it since time immemorial .
By any normally accepted standard of morality , it was their property in every sense of the word .
The armies of William the Conqueror , by no right other than force , had compelled these peasant proprietors to pay rent on their own land .
J. L. and Barbara Hammond treated the sixteenth century village and open field system as a survival of the free peasant society of Anglo - Saxon times , with landlordism superimposed on it .
The landlord class saw surviving peasant rights as a hindrance to progress and efficient farming ; a revolution in their own power was a way of breaking peasant resistance .
Hence the agricultural community was " taken to pieces ... and reconstructed in the manner in which a dictator reconstructs a free government .
" 17 The first mass expropriation , amounting to about a fifth of the arable land of England , was the Tudor seizure of monastic land and subsequent distribution of it among noble favorites .
This was a blow against the laboring classes in two ways : first , because many of the Church 's tenants were evicted during the subsequent enclosure process ; and second , because income from that land had been the major source of poor relief .
The suppression of the monasteries , etc. , hurled their inmates into the proletariat .
The estates of the church were to a large extent given away to rapacious royal favourites , or sold at a nominal price to speculating farmers and citizens , who drove out , en masse , the hereditary subtenants and threw their holdings into one .
18 The king 's men who gobbled up the former property of the monasteries had few qualms about how they treated their new tenants .
According to R. H. Tawney , Rack - renting , evictions , and the conversions of arable to pasture were the natural result , for surveyors wrote up values at each transfer , and , unless the last purchaser squeezed his tenants , the transaction would not pay .
Why , after all , should a landlord be more squeamish than the Crown ?
" Do ye not know , " said the grantee of one of the Sussex manors of the monastery of Sion , in answer to some peasants who protested at the seizure of their commons , " that the King 's grace hath put down all the houses of monks , friars and nuns ?
Therefore now is the time come that we gentlemen will pull down the houses of such poor knaves as ye be . "
Among the victims , as illustrative cases , were the inhabitants of the village enclosed by the Herbert family to make the park at Washerne ; and the tenants of Whitby , whose annual rents were raised from £ 29 to £ 64.19
The expropriation of the Church destroyed the funding system for the main source of charitable support for the poor and incapacitated .
The Tudor state filled the void with its Poor Laws .
The effect was as if , in the modern world , the state had expropriated the major property and securities of the charitable foundations , and given them to Fortune 500 corporation ; and then created a welfare system at taxpayer expense with incomparably more draconian controls on the poor .
20 Still another form of expropriation was the enclosure of commons -- in which , again , the peasants communally had as absolute a right of property as any defended by today 's " property rights " advocates .
Enclosures occurred in two large waves : the first , becoming a mighty surge under the Tudors and slowing to a trickle under the Stuarts , was enclosure of land for sheep pasturage .
The second , which we will consider below , was the enclosure of open fields for large - scale capitalist farming .
The overall scale of the expropriations was quite massive .
The number of tenants dispossessed after the dissolution of the monasteries was 50,000 .
The area enclosed from 1455 - 1605 was " some half - million acres . "
The number dispossessed from enclosed lands between 1455 and 1637 was 30 - 40,000 .
" This may well have represented a figure of over 10 per cent . of all middling and small landholders and between 10 and 20 per cent .
of those employed at wages ... ; in which case the labour reserves thereby created would have been of comparable dimensions to that which existed in all but the worst months of the economic crisis of the 1930's . "
Although " the absolute number of persons affected in each case may seem small by modern standards , the result was large in proportion to the demand for hired labour at the time . " 21 And those peasants not subject to enclosure were victimized by rack - renting and arbitrary fines , which often resulted in their being driven off the land by inability to pay .
22
The expropriation of Royalist land during the Interregnum followed a similar pattern to that of the monasteries under Henry VIII .
Purchasers of confiscated lands , Christopher Hill wrote , " were anxious to secure quick returns .
Those of their tenants who could not produce written evidence of their titles were liable to eviction .
" 23 Tenants of sequestered estates complained that the new purchasers " wrest from the poor Tenants all former Immunities and Freedoms they formerly enjoyed .... " 24 Another major theft of peasant land was the " reform " of land law by the seventeenth century Restoration Parliament .
( The legislation can be assigned more than one date , since like all legislation passed during the Interregnum , it had to be confirmed under Charles II ) .
The landlords ' rights in feudal legal theory were transformed into absolute rights of private property ; the tenants were deprived of all their customary rights in the land they tilled , and transformed into tenants at - will in the modern sense .
After the restoration of the Stuarts , the landed proprietors carried , by legal means , an act of usurpation , effected everywhere on the Continent without any legal formality .
They abolished the feudal tenure of land , i.e. , they got rid of all its obligations to the State , " indemnified " the State by taxes on the peasantry and the rest of the people , vindicated for themselves the rights of modern private property in estates to which they had only a feudal title , and , finally , passed those laws of settlement which , mutatis mutandis , had the same effects on the English agricultural labourer , as the edict of the Tartar Boris Godunof on the Russian peasantry .
25 ( The effects of the laws of settlement , as a form of social control , will be dealt with below . )
As Christopher Hill put it , " feudal tenures were abolished upwards only , not downwards . "
At the same time that landlords were guaranteed against all uncertainty and caprice from above , the peasants were placed at the absolute mercy of the landlords .
The Act of 1660 insisted that it should not be understood to alter or change any tenure by copyhold .
Copyholders obtained no absolute property rights in their holdings , remaining in abject dependence on their landlords , liable to arbitrary death duties which could be used as a means of evicting the recalcitrant .
The effect was completed by an act of 1677 which ensured that the property of small freeholders should be no less insecure than that of copyholders , unless supported by written legal title .
So most obstacles to enclosures were removed : the agricultural boom of the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries redounded to the benefit of big landowners and capitalist farmers , not of peasant proprietors ....
The century after the failure of the radicals to win legal security of tenure for the small men is the century in which many small landowners were forced to sell out in consequence of rack - renting , heavy fines , taxation and lack of resources to compete with capitalist farmers .
26
At the same time , all the feudal dues previously paid by the aristocracy as a condition of their ownership , were replaced with taxes on the population at large .
And so the abolition of the military tenures in England by the Long Parliament , ratified after the accession of Charles II , though simply an appropriation of public revenues by the feudal land holders , who thus got rid of the consideration on which they held the common property of the nation , and saddled it on the people at large , in the taxation of all consumers , has long been characterized , and is still held up in the law books , as a triumph of the spirit of freedom .
Yet here is the source of the immense debt and heavy taxation of England .
27
After the " Glorious Revolution , " by which the people of England had been freed from the papist tyranny of James II into the tender ministrations of the Whig Oligarchy , yet another reform was introduced .
In a foreshadowing of the misnamed " privatization " of our own day , most of the crown land , rightfully the property of the laboring people of England , was parceled out to the great landlords .
They inaugurated the new era by practicing on a colossal scale thefts of state lands , thefts that had been hitherto managed more modestly .
These estates were given away , sold at a ridiculous figure , or even annexed to private estates by direct seizure ....
The Crown lands thus fraudulently appropriated , together with the robbery of the Church estates ... form the basis of the today princely domains of the English oligarchy .
28 In addition to its land " reforms , " the Whig parliament under William and Mary introduced the Game Laws as a means of restricting independent subsistence by the laboring classes .
Hunting , for the rural population , had traditionally been a supplementary source of food .
The 1692 law , in its preamble , specifically referred to the " great mischief " by which " inferior tradesmen , apprentices , and other dissolute persons [!] neglect their trades and employments " in favor of hunting and fishing .
29 Even after the expropriations of the Tudor and Stuart periods , the dispossession of the peasantry was still incomplete .
A significant amount of land still remained in peasant hands under customary forms of ownership , and continued to provide a margin of independence for some .
After the Tudor expropriations , many vagabonds migrated into " such open - field villages as would allow them to squat precariously on the edge of common or waste . "
One seventeenth century pamphleteer noted that " in all or most towns where the fields lie open and are used in common there is a new brood of upstart intruders as inmates , and the inhabitants of lawful cottages erected contrary to law .... "
He referred to the common complaint of employers , that they were " loyterers who will not usually be got to work unless they may have such excessive wages as they themselves desire .
" 30 Hence , the final expropriation of even these last remaining peasant lands was vital to the full development of capitalism .
The second wave of enclosures , in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries , was therefore closely connected with the process of industrialization .
Not counting enclosures before 1700 , the Hammonds estimated total enclosures in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries at between a sixth and a fifth of the arable land in England .31 E. J. Hobsbawm and George Rudé , less conservatively , estimated enclosures between 1750 and 1850 alone as transforming " something like one quarter of the cultivated acreage from open field , common land , meadow or waste into private fields .... " 32 Dobb estimated it as high as a quarter or half of land in the fourteen counties most affected .
33
Of 4000 Private Acts of Enclosure from the early eighteenth century through 1845 , two - thirds involved " open fields belonging to cottagers , " and the other third involved common woodland and heath .
34 The Tudor and Stuart enclosures had been carried out by private landlords , on their own initiative , often by stealth .
From the eighteenth century on , however , they were carried out by law , through parliamentary " acts of enclosure " : " in other words , decrees by which the landlords grant themselves the people 's land as private property ... "
Marx cited these acts as evidence that the commons , far from being the " private property of the great landlords who have taken the place of the feudal lords , " had actually required " a parliamentary coup d’etat ... for its transformation into private property .
" 35 The ruling classes saw the peasants ' customary right to the land as a source of economic independence from capitalist and landlord , and thus a threat to be destroyed .
Mandeville , in Fable of the Bees , wrote of the need to keep laborers both poor and stupid , in order to force them to work :
It would be easier , where property is well secured , to live without money than without poor ; for who would do the work ?
.... As they ought to be kept from starving , so they should receive nothing worth saving .
If here and there one of the lowest class by uncommon industry , and pinching his belly , lifts himself above the condition he was brought up in , nobody ought to hinder him ; ... but it is the interest of all rich nations , that the greatest part of the poor should almost never be idle , and yet continually spend what they get ....
Those that get their living by their daily labour ... have nothing to stir them up to be serviceable but their wants which it is prudence to relieve , but folly to cure ....
To make the society happy and people easier under the meanest circumstances , it is requisite that great numbers of them should be ignorant as well as poor .... 36 A 1739 pamphlet , quoted by Christopher Hill , warned that the only way to enforce industry and temperance was " to lay them under the necessity of labouring all the time they can spare from rest and sleep , in order to procure the common necessities of life . "
37 These prescriptions for keeping the working classes productive were echoed in a 1770 tract , " Essay on Trade and Commerce " :
That mankind in general , are naturally inclined to ease and indolence , we fatally experience to be true , from the conduct of our manufacturing populace , who do not labour , upon an average , above four days in a week , unless provisions happen to be very dear ....
I hope I have said enough to make it appear that the moderate labour of six days in a week is no slavery ....
But our populace have adopted a notion , that as Englishmen they enjoy a birthright privilege of being more free and independent than in any country in Europe .
Now this idea , as far as it may affect the bravery of our troops , may be of some use ; but the less the manufacturing poor have of it , certainly the better for themselves and for the State .
The labouring people should never think themselves independent of their superiors ....
It is extremely dangerous to encourage mobs in a commercial state like ours , where , perhaps , seven parts out of eight of the whole , are people with little or no property .
The cure will not be perfect , till our manufacturing poor are contented to labour six days for the same sum which they now earn in four days .
38 Enclosure eliminated " a dangerous centre of indiscipline " and compelled workers to sell their labor on the masters ' terms .
Arthur Young , a Lincolnshire gentleman , described the commons as " a breeding - ground for ' barbarians , ' ' nursing up a mischievous race of people ' . " " [ E ] very one but an idiot knows , " he wrote , " that the lower classes must be kept poor , or they will never be industrious . "
The Board of Agriculture report of Shropshire , in 1794 , echoed this complaint : " the use of common land by labourers operates upon the mind as a sort of independence .
" 39 The Commercial and Agricultural Magazine warned in 1800 that leaving the laborer " possessed of more land than his family can cultivate in the evenings " meant that " the farmer can no longer depend on him for constant work .
" 40 Sir Richard Price commented on the conversion of self - sufficient proprietors into " a body of men who earn their subsistence by working for others . "
As a result there would , " perhaps , be more labour , because there will be more compulsion to it .
" 41 The Rev. J. Townsend , worthy man of God , likewise wrote ( in " A Dissertation on the Poor Laws , By a Well - Wisher to Mankind " ) of the benefit of poverty in compelling the poor to labor .
Legal constraint to labour is attended with too much trouble , violence , and noise , creates ill will etc. , whereas hunger is not only a peaceable , silent , unremitted pressure , but , as the most natural motive to industry and labour , it calls forth the most powerful exertions ....
It seems to be a law of nature that the poor should be to a certain degree improvident , that there may be always some to fulfill the most servile , the most sordid , and the most ignoble offices in the community .
The stock of human happiness is thereby much increased .
The more delicate ones are thereby freed from drudgery , and can pursue higher callings etc. undisturbed .
42
The only humans whose drudgery matters , obviously , are the " more delicate ones " whose " human happiness " is increased by the opportunity to pursue their " higher callings , " without the disturbance of having to support themselves by their own labor .
The good Reverend was , indeed , a well - wisher of mankind -- except , perhaps , for the 95 % of it toiling below his threshold of visibility .
The Gloucestershire Survey ( 1807 ) remarked that among " the greatest of evils to agriculture would be to place the labourer in a state of independence . "
For as another observer from the same period observed , " Farmers , like manufacturers , require constant labourers -- men who have no other means of support than their daily labour , men whom they can depend on .
" 43 The Board of Agriculture reports , cited by Christopher Hill , contained enthusiastic praise for the disciplinary effect of enclosures .
Enclosure of commons forced laborers " to work every day in the year . "
Children " [ would ] be put out to labour early . "
Most importantly , thanks to the suppression of economic independence , the " subordination of the lower ranks of society ... would be thereby considerably secured .
" 44 Of course , suppression of the means of independent subsistence did not take only the form of land - theft .
At times , spinning and weaving in individual cottages was actually prohibited by law , as an interference with the supply of agricultural labor .
45 As Kirkpatrick
Sale elaborated on the same theme :
By the late eighteenth century there were two kinds of machines capable of sophisticated textile production in England .
One was a cottage - based , one - person machine built around the spinning jenny , perfected as early as the 1760s ; the other was a factory - based , steam - driven machine based on the Watts engine and the Arkwright frame , introduced in the 1770s .
The choice of which was to survive and proliferate was made not upon the merits of the machines themselves nor upon any technological grounds at all but upon the wishes of the dominant political and economic sectors of English society at the time .
The cottage - centered machines , ingenious though they were , did not permit textile merchants the same kind of control over the workforce nor the same regularity of production as did the factory - based machines .
Gradually , therefore , they were eliminated , their manufacturers squeezed by being denied raw materials and financing , their operators suppressed by laws that , on various pretexts , made home - production illegal .46
Apparently , the recipe for a " free market , " as the average vulgar libertarian uses the term , is as follows : 1 ) first steal the land of the producing classes , by state fiat , and turn them into wage - laborers ; 2 ) then , by state terror , prevent them from moving about in search of higher wages or organizing to increase their bargaining strength ; 3 ) finally , convince them that their subsistence wages reflect the marginal productivity of labor in a " free market . "
Marx mocked the bourgeois apologists ( in the person of F. M. Eden ) , usually such zealots for the rights of property , for their blithe acceptance of the past robbery of the working population :
The stoical peace of mind with which the political economist regards the most shameless violation of the " sacred rights of property " and the grossest acts of violence to persons , as soon as they are necessary to lay the foundations of the capitalist mode of production , is shown by Sir F. M. Eden ....
The whole series of thefts , outrages , and popular misery , that accompanied the forcible expropriation of the people , from the last third of the fifteenth to the end of the eighteenth century , lead him merely to the comfortable conclusion , " The due proportion between arable land and pasture had to be established .... " 47 As always , the passive voice is the last refuge of weasels .
Marx was not the only mocker of the bourgeois nursery tale of primitive accumulation .
Albert Jay Nock , that patron saint of the Old Right , also had some sharp words on the subject -- not only for the purported apologists of pseudo - " laissez - faire , " but for the advocates of state action :
The horrors of England 's industrial life in the last century furnished a standing brief for addicts of positive intervention .
Child - labour and woman - labour in the mills and mines ; Coketown and Mr. Bounderby ; starvation wages ; killing hours ; vile and hazardous conditions of labour ; coffin ships officered by ruffians -- all these are glibly charged off by reformers and publicists to a regime of rugged individualism , unrestrained competition , and laissez - faire .
This is an absurdity on its face , for no such regime ever existed in England .
They were due to the State 's primary intervention whereby the population of England was expropriated from the land ; due to the State 's removal of the land from competition with industry for labour .
Nor did the factory system and the " industrial revolution " have the least thing to do with creating these hordes of miserable beings .
When the factory system came in , those hordes were already there , expropriated , and they went into the mills for whatever Mr. Gradgrind and Mr. Plugson of Undershot would give them because they had no choice but to beg , steal or starve .
Their misery and degradation did not lie at the door of individualism ; they lay nowhere but at the door of the State ....
Our zealots of positive intervention would do well to read the history of the Enclosures Acts and the work of the Hammonds , and see what they can make of them .
" 48 Before we close this section , we should consider the claim of some apologists that these acts of expropriation somehow increased " efficiency . "
Like that of Edens above , such apologies these days often issue from the same figures who are the most scandalized at any threat to the absolute right of private property .
Leaving aside the moral illegitimacy of such consequentialist justifications of robbery , it 's hard to avoid being amused at the parallelism with Marx and Engels , who , in a distorted version of the Whig theory of history , saw class exploitation and robbery as the necessary means of creating the " productive forces , " on the way to the final state of abundance .
As Thomas Fuller scornfully pointed out , an increase in the overall wealth of that mythical being " society " resulting from such robbery did not necessarily translate into an increased quality of life for those robbed .
Tell the fenmen , he said , of the great benefit to the public , because where a pike or duck fed formerly , now a bullock or sheep fatted ; they will be ready to return that if they be taken in taking that bullock or sheep , the rich owner indicteth them for felons ; whereas that pike or duck were their own goods , only for their pains of catching them .49
And even the increased efficiency of production is by no means self - evident .
According to Michael Perelman , in cereal farming the spade industry of eighteenth century peasants in Western Europe produced a twenty - to thirty - fold increase on seed - corn , compared to only six - fold by plow cultivation .
As for vegetable horticulture , the market gardens of that time compare favorably in output even to the mechanized agriculture of the contemporary United States .
One Paris gardener produced 44 tons of vegetables per acre ; by way of comparison , in 1979 America , the average output per acre was 15 tons of onions or 8.6 tons of tomatoes ( the two most productive crops in terms of weight per unit of area ) .
50 Such intensive forms of cultivation were indeed less efficient , if considered in terms of output per man - hour rather than of output per acre .
But labor was a commodity in abundant supply ; this " superfluous " labor was " freed , " by expropriation , from a life of adequate subsistence , in order that it might be allowed to starve without hindrance .
As Perelman said , the small - scale cultivation suppressed by the state was " a viable alternative to wage labor .
" 51 But that was precisely the point .
The real " efficiency " aimed at was efficiency in fleecing the producing classes .
As we will see later in this chapter , the ruling classes have consistently been willing to adopt less efficient forms of production , in material terms , for the sake of rendering the control of the production process more feasible .
B. Political Preemption of Land in Settler Societies
In the New World as well as the Old , too much comfort or independence on the part of the laboring classes could be a great inconvenience to " the nation " or " the people " ( which entities , presumably , did not include the helots who actually produced the things consumed by " the nation " or " the people " ) .
The response of the capitalist ( with the power of the state " at his back " ) , in the colonies as in the Old World , was ( as Marx put it ) " to clear out of his way by force , the modes of production and appropriation , based on the independent labour of the producer .
"
52 Settler societies have always had one disadvantage , from the point of view of the ruling classes : the widespread availability of cheap land .
Adam Smith observed that in the North American colonies , where affordable land was readily available , the price of labor was very high because the average laborer preferred independence to employment : " neither the large wages nor the easy subsistence which that country affords to artificers can bribe him rather to work for other people than for himself .
" 53 E. G. Wakefield , in View of the Art of Colonization , wrote of the unacceptably weak position of the employing class in the colonies where self - employment with one 's own property was readily available .
Labor was scarce even at high wages .
54 In colonies , labourers for hire are scarce .
The scarcity of labourers for hire is the universal complaint of colonies .
It is the one cause , both of the high wages which put the colonial labourer at his ease , and of the exorbitant wages which sometimes harass the capitalist .
55
Where land is cheap and all men are free , where every one who so pleases can obtain a piece of land for himself , not only is labour very dear , as respects the labourers ' share of the product , but the difficulty is to obtain combined labour at any price .
This environment also prevented the concentration of wealth , as Wakefield commented : " Few , even of those whose lives are unusually long , can accumulate great masses of wealth .
" 56 As a result , colonial elites petitioned the mother country for imported labor and for restrictions on land for settlement .
According to Wakefield 's disciple Herman Merivale , there was an " urgent desire for cheaper and more subservient labourers -- for a class to whom the capitalist might dictate terms , instead of being dictated to by them .
" 57 Faced with this situation , the capitalist could resort to one of two expedients .
One of them was the use of slave and convict labor , which we will examine in greater detail in a section below .
The other was preemption of ownership of the land by the colonial regime .
Political preemption of the land was accompanied by a denial of access to ordinary homesteaders -- either by pricing land out of their range , or by excluding them altogether .
Wakefield suggested that , since " [ i ] n the very beginning of a colony , all the land necessarily belongs to the government or is under its jurisdiction , " the government could remedy the shortage of cheap wage labor by controlling access to the land .
58
At the same time that it excluded the laboring classes from virgin land , the state in settler societies granted large tracts of land to the privileged classes : to land speculators , logging and mining companies , planters , railroads , etc .
Land grants in colonial America were on a scale comparable those of William after the Conquest .
Cadwallader Colden , classifying the population in his State of the Province of New York ( 1765 ) , put " the Proprietors of the Large Tracts of Land " of 100,000 to above one million acres , at the apex of the social pyramid .
According to James Truslow Adams , in Provincial Society , 1690 - 1763 ( 1927 ) , Capt .
John Evans , a favorite of Governor Fletcher of New York , was granted " an area of indeterminate extent of between three hundred and fifty and six hundred thousand acres ... "
Although he was later offered £ 10,000 for this land , his annual quitrent was only twenty shillings ( i.e. , £ 1 ) .
Governor Bellmont later claimed that almost three - quarters of available land had been granted to thirty persons during Fletcher 's term .
Lord Courtney , governor from 1702 - 08 , likewise issued large grants often running into the hundreds of thousands of acres , but preferred giving them to companies of land speculators .
In New England , in contrast , Adams wrote that the early pattern of land grants to settlers for setting up townships led to more egalitarian patterns of land ownership .
Unfortunately , this pattern was later supplanted by large - scale grants of land to speculators , for later sale to settlers , either as individuals or companies .
59 Such land - grabbing was central to American history from the very beginning , as Albert Jay Nock pointed out : " .... from the time of the first colonial settlement to the present day , America has been regarded as a practically limitless field for speculation in rental values .
” 60 If our geographical development had been determined in a natural way , by the demands of use instead of the demands of speculation [ that is , appropriated individually by labor , as Lockeans , Georgists and mutualists agree is just ] , our western frontier would not yet be anywhere near the Mississippi River .
Rhode Island is the most highly - populated member of the Union , yet one may drive from one end of it to the other on one of its " through " highways , and see hardly a sign of human occupancy .
61
One cause of the American Revolution was Britain 's " attempt ... to limit the exercise of the political means in respect of rental - values " ( namely , the 1763 prohibition of settlements west of the Atlantic watershed ) .
This prevented preemption of the land by land speculators in league with the state .
62
The mainstream history books , of course , have portrayed this as an offense mainly against the individual homesteader , rather than the big land companies .
Many leading figures in the late colonial and early republican period were prominent investors in these land companies : e.g. , Washington in the Ohio , Mississippi , and Potomac Companies ; Patrick Henry in the Yazoo Company ; Benjamin Franklin in the Vandalia Company , etc.63
Lest anyone draw the conclusion that the practice of limiting the working population 's access to land was a practice only in the periwigged British Empire of Warren Hastings or Lord North , we should bear in mind that it has been followed in the " new " Empire as well :
The apprehension of the same truth [ stated by Wakefield ] has in more recent times led colonial administrators in certain parts of Africa to reduce native tribal reserves and to impose taxation on natives who remain in the reserves , with the object of maintaining a labour supply for the white employer .
64 C. Political Repression and Social Control in the Industrial Revolution .
Even after the expropriation of their land , the working class was not sufficiently powerless .
The state still had to regulate the movement of labor , serve as a labor exchange on behalf of capitalists , and maintain order .
And historically , this function was most vital when the bargaining power of labor threatened to increase : " one might expect that the efforts of the State in a capitalist society to control wages and to restrict the freedom of movement of the labourer would be greater when the labour reserve was depleted than when it was swollen .
"
65 Thorold Rogers described the law from the Tudor period until the repeal of the Combination Acts in 1824 , as a conspiracy ... to cheat the English workman of his wages , to tie him to the soil , to deprive him of hope , and to degrade him into irremediable poverty ....
For more than two centuries and a half the English law , and those who administered the law , were engaged in grinding the English workman down to the lowest pittance , in stamping out every expression or act which indicated any organized discontent , and in multiplying penalties upon him when he thought of his natural rights .
66
As we have seen above , the liquidation of the Church 's system of poor relief left a void to be filled by the Tudor state 's harsh regulation of the working class .
The act of Henry VIII in 1530 licensed beggars who were old or infirm , while providing for the whipping and imprisonment of " sturdy vagabonds . "
The 27 Henry VIII strengthened the statute with ear - cropping for second offenders , and execution for third .
I Edward VI ( 1547 ) condemned anyone who refused work as a slave to whoever denounced him .
The 1572 act of Elizabeth I prescribed execution of unlicensed beggars on the second offense , unless someone would " take them into service . "
The statutes were only repealed at the end of the sixteenth century , by 12 Ann , cap. 23 , when they had done their work .
" Thus were the agricultural people , first forcibly expropriated from the soil , driven from their homes , turned into vagabonds , and then whipped , branded , tortured by laws grotesquely terrible , into the discipline necessary for the wage system .
" 67 Queen Anne 's repeal of the Tudor legislation did not , by any means , put an end to state - imposed regulation of the working class ' movement .
The laws of settlement had been created , in the meantime , and were later supplemented by the Combination Laws and the police state of Pitt .
The government continued to set maximum wages , as well .
The Act of Settlement dates back to 1662 .
There had been a great deal of lower class movement during the Interregnum , characterized by the tendency of " poor people ... to settle themselves in those parishes where there is the best stock , the largest commons or wastes to build cottages and the most woods for them to burn or destroy . "
As that quote from the preamble might suggest , the Act was intended to remedy such excess mobility .
Under its terms , two justices of the peace in each county were empowered to eject any newcomer to a parish without independent means , and return him to his parish of origin .
The legislation was explicitly directed against cottagers and squatters in commons , and was evidently followed " by a destruction of cottages erected in the free times of the interregnum .
"
68 In a quotation earlier in this chapter , Marx referred to the " laws of settlements " as analogous to " the edict of the Tartar Boris Godunov " in their effect on the English working population .
Had he been more familiar with events in America at the time he wrote , he might have referred to the Black Codes as a better analogy .
Had he lived into the twentieth century , he might have cited the internal passport systems of South Africa or the Soviet Union .
The British state 's controls on the movement of population , during the Industrial Revolution , were a system of totalitarian control comparable to all these .
Under the Poor Laws and the Laws of Settlement , a member of the English working class was restricted to the parish of his birth , unless an official of another parish granted him a permit to reside there .
The state maintained work discipline by keeping laborers from voting with their feet .
It was hard to persuade parish authorities to grant a man a certificate entitling him to move to another parish to seek work .
Even on the rare occasion when such a certificate was granted , it amounted to a system of peonage in which the worker 's continued residence in the new parish was conditioned on maintaining the good will of his employer .
Workers were forced to stay put and sell their labor in a buyer 's market .
Adam Smith ventured that there was " scarce a poor man in England of forty years of age ... who has not in some part of his life felt himself most cruelly oppressed by this ill - contrived law of settlements .
" 69 At first glance this would seem also to be inconvenient for employers in parishes with a labor shortage .70 Factories were built at sources of water power , generally removed from centers of population .
Thousands of workers were needed to be imported from far away .
But the state solved the problem by setting itself up as a middleman , and providing labor - poor parishes with cheap surplus labor from elsewhere , depriving workers of the ability to bargain for better terms on their own .
This practice amounted , in nearly every sense of the term , to a slave market :
No doubt , in certain epochs of feverish activity , the labour market shows significant gaps .
In 1834 , e.g..
But then the manufacturers proposed to the Poor Law Commissioners that they should send the " surplus population " of the agricultural districts to the north , with the explanation " that the manufacturers would absorb and use it up . "
" Agents were appointed with the consent of the Poor Law Commissioners ....
An office was set up in Manchester , to which lists were sent of those workpeople in the agricultural districts wanting employment , and their names were registered in books .
The manufacturers attended at these offices , and selected such persons as they chose ; ... they gave instructions to have them forwarded to Manchester , and they were sent , ticketed like bales of goods , by canals , or with carriers , others tramping on the road , and many of them were found on the way lost and half - starved .
This system had grown up into a regular trade .
This House will hardly believe it , but I tell them that this traffic in human flesh was as well kept up , they were in effect as regularly sold to these ... manufacturers as slaves are sold to the cotton grown in the United States . " 71
There you have it : the Tudor state without the whippings , ear - croppings and executions ; the Black Codes without the lynchings .
Child laborers , who were in no position to bargain in any case , were a popular commodity in these poor - house slave markets .
According to John Fielden ( " The Curse of the Factory System , 1836 ) , In the counties of Derbyshire , Nottinghamshire , and more particularly in Lancashire , the newly invented machinery was used in large factories built on the sides of streams capable of turning the water - wheel .
Thousands of hands were suddenly required in these places , remote from towns ....
The small and nimble fingers of little children being by very far , the most in request , the custom instantly sprang up of procuring apprentices from the different parish workhouses of London , Birmingham , and elsewhere .
72 Relief " was seldom bestowed without the parish claiming the exclusive right of disposing , at their pleasure , of all the children of the person receiving relief , " according to the Committee on Parish Apprentices , 1815.73 Frances Trollope estimated that 200,000 children , altogether , were pressed into factory labor .
74 Even when Poor Law commissioners encouraged migration to labor - poor parishes , they discouraged adult men and " [ p ] reference was given to ' widows with large families of children or handicraftsmen ... with large families . ' "
In addition , the availability of cheap labor from the poor - law commissioners was deliberately used to drive down wages ; farmers would discharge their own day - laborers and instead apply to the overseer for help .
75 Although the Combination Laws theoretically applied to masters as well as workmen , in practice they were only enforced against the latter .
76 " A Journeyman Cotton Spinner " - - a pamphleteer quoted by E. P. Thompson77 -- described " an abominable combination existing amongst the masters , " in which workers who had left their masters because of disagreement over wages were effectively blacklisted .
The Combination Laws required suspects to answer interrogations on oath , empowered magistrates to give summary judgment , and allowed summary forfeiture of funds accumulated to aid the families of strikers .
78
In other words , workers subject to the Combination Law magistrates were deprived of all the common law 's due process protections .
Workers , far from possessing the much - heralded " rights of Englishmen , " were thrown into prerogative courts as arbitrary as Star Chamber .
At the same time , the laws setting maximum rates of pay amounted to a state enforced system of combination for the masters .
In Adam Smith 's immortal words , " [ w ] henever the legislature attempts to regulate the differences between the masters and their workmen , its counselors are always the masters .
" 79
In the mid-19th century , a superficial examiner might conclude , the state 's " progressive " reforms finally began to remedy all these evils .
But as the historians of corporate liberalism have shown us in regard to the " progressive " reforms of the twentieth century , these " reforms " were in fact undertaken in the interests of the ruling class .
Their ameliorating effect on working conditions , to the real but limited extent they occurred , were a side effect of their main purpose of increasing political stability and bringing the working class under more effective social control .80 Regarding legislation for the ten - hour day , for example , Marx described it as an attempt by capitalists to regulate the " greed for surplus labour " ; they served to regulate the economy in the interest of the capitalist class as a whole , in a way that could only be accomplished by acting through the state .
With competition unlimited by the state , the issue of working conditions presents a prisoner 's dilemma for the individual capitalist ; it is in the interest of the capitalist class as a whole that the exploitation of labor be kept to sustainable levels , but in the interest of the individual capitalist to gain an immediate advantage over the competition by working his own labor force to the breaking point .
As we shall see in Chapter 6 below on the rise of monopoly capitalism , the real effect of such regulations is to coordinate labor practices through a state - enforced cartel , so that those practices are no longer an issue of competition between firms .
These acts curb the passion of capital for a limitless draining of labour power , by forcibly limiting the working day by state regulations , made by a state that is ruled by capitalist and landlord .
Apart from the working - class movement that daily grew more threatening , the limiting of factory labour was dictated by the same necessity which spread guano over the English fields .
81 Marx referred , later in the same chapter , to a group of 26 Staffordshire pottery firms , including Josiah Wedgwood , petitioning Parliament in 1863 for " some legislative enactment " ; the reason was that competition prevented individual capitalists from voluntarily limiting the work time of children , etc. , as beneficial as it would be to them collectively : " Much as we deplore the evils before mentioned , it would not be possible to prevent them by any scheme of agreement between the manufacturers ....
Taking all these points into consideration , we have come to the conviction that some legislative enactment is wanted . "
Attempts by employers to limit the workday voluntarily to nine or ten hours , in their collective interest , always came to nought because the individual employer found it in his interest to violate the agreement .
82
As for trade unions : even after the Combination Laws were repealed in 1825 , the position of workers was different from that of masters in regard to contract .
" The provisions of the labour statutes as to contracts between master and workman , as to giving notice and the like , which only allow of a civil action against the contract breaking master , but on the contrary permit a criminal action against the contract - breaking workman , are to this hour ( 1873 ) in full force .
" 83 In 1871 , trade unions were officially recognized by Act of Parliament .
But another act of the same date ( the Act to amend the Criminal Law relating to Violence , Threats , and Molestation ) , had the effect that " the means which the labourers could use in a strike or lockout were withdrawn from the laws common to all citizens , and placed under exceptional penal legislation , the interpretation of which fell to the masters themselves in their capacity as justices of the peace . "
84 Thus , the state at the same time permitted collective bargaining , and prohibited collective bargaining outside the avenues prescribed and regulated by the state .
In much the same way , the great " labor victory " of the Wagner Act was followed , in short order , by Taft - Hartley , which criminalized most of the tactics by which the CIO victories of the early Thirties had been won independently of the state .
And in the process , as Hilaire Belloc so brilliantly explained , for the laborer contract was replaced by status -- one step in the retrograde long march toward industrial enserfment of the wage - earning population .
85 A comment of Adam Smith a century earlier is worth quoting again : " Whenever the legislature attempts to regulate the differences between masters and their workmen , its counselors are always the masters .
"
86 The working class lifestyle under the factory system , with its new forms of social control , was a radical break with the past .
It involved drastic loss of control over their own work .
The seventeenth century work calendar had still been heavily influenced by medieval custom .
Although there were spurts of hard labor between planting and harvest , intermittent periods of light work and the proliferation of saints days combined to reduce average work - time well below that of our own day .
And the pace of work was generally determined by the sun or the biological rhythms of the laborer , who got up after a decent night 's sleep , and sat down to rest when he felt like it .
The cottager who had access to common land , even when he wanted extra income from wage labor , could take work on a casual basis and then return to working for himself .
This was an unacceptable degree of independence from a capitalist standpoint .
In the modern world most people have to adapt themselves to some kind of discipline , and to observe other ' people 's timetables , ... or work under other people 's orders , but we have to remember that the population that was flung into the brutal rhythm of the factory had earned its living in relative freedom , and that the discipline of the early factory was particularly savage ....
No economist of the day , in estimating the gains or losses of factory employment , ever allowed for the strain and violence that a man suffered in his feelings when he passed from a life in which he could smoke or eat , or dig or sleep as he pleased , to one in which somebody turned the key on him , and for fourteen hours he had not even the right to whistle .
It was like entering the airless and laughterless life of a prison .
87 As Oppenheimer suggested in the quote earlier in this chapter , the factory system could not have been imposed on workers without first depriving them of alternatives , and forcibly denying access to any source of economic independence .
No unbroken human being , with a sense of freedom or dignity , would have submitted to factory discipline .
Steven Marglin compared the nineteenth century textile factory , staffed by pauper children bought at the workhouse slave market , to Roman brick and pottery factories which were manned by slaves .
In Rome , factory production was exceptional in manufactures dominated by freemen .
The factory system , throughout history , has been possible only with a work force deprived of any viable alternative .
The surviving facts ... strongly suggest that whether work was organized along factory lines was in Roman times determined , not by technological considerations , but by the relative power of the two producing classes .
Freedmen and citizens had sufficient power to maintain a guild organization .
Slaves had no power -- and ended up in factories .
88
The problem with the old " putting out " system , in which cottage workers produced textiles on a contractual basis , was that it only eliminated worker control of the product .
The factory system , by also eliminating worker control of the production process , introduced the added advantages of discipline and supervision , with workers organized under an overseer .
... the origin and success of the factory lay not in technological superiority , but in the substitution of the capitalist 's for the worker 's control of the work process and the quantity of output , in the change in the workman 's choice from one of how much to work and produce , based on his preferences for leisure and goods , to one of whether or not to work at all , which of course is hardly much of a choice .
89 Marglin took Adam Smith 's classic example of the division of labor in pin-making , and stood it on its head .
The increased efficiency resulted , not from the division of labor as such , but from dividing and sequencing the process into separate tasks in order to reduce set - up time .
This could have been accomplished by a single cottage workman separating the various tasks and then performing them sequentially ( i.e. , drawing out the wire for an entire run of production , then straightening it , then cutting it , etc. ) .
without specialization , the capitalist had no essential role to play in the production process .
If each producer could himself integrate the component tasks of pin manufacture into a marketable product , he would soon discover that he had no need to deal with the market for pins through the intermediation of the putter - outer .
He could sell directly and appropriate to himself the profit that the capitalist derived from mediating between the producer and the market .90
This principle is at the center of the history of industrial technology for the last two hundred years .
Even given the necessity of factories for some forms of large - scale , capital - intensive manufacturing , there is usually a choice between alternate productive technologies within the factory .
Industry has consistently chosen technologies which de-skill workers and shift decision - making upward into the managerial hierarchy .
As long ago as 1835 , Dr. Andrew Ure ( the ideological grandfather of Taylorism ) , argued that the more skilled the workman , " the more self - willed and ... the less fit a component of a mechanical system " he became .
The solution was to eliminate processes which required " peculiar dexterity and steadiness of hand ... from the cunning workman " and replace them by a " mechanism , so self - regulating , that a child may superintend it .
" 91
And the principle has been followed throughout the twentieth century .
William Lazonick , David Montgomery , David Noble , and Katherine Stone have produced an excellent body of work on this theme .
Even though corporate experiments in worker self - management increase morale and productivity , and reduce injuries and absenteeism beyond the wildest hopes of management , they are usually abandoned out of fear of loss of control .
Christopher Lasch , in his foreword to Noble 's America by Design , characterized the process of de-skilling in this way :
The capitalist , having expropriated the worker 's property , gradually expropriated his technical knowledge as well , asserting his own mastery over production ....
The expropriation of the worker 's technical knowledge had as a logical consequence the growth of modern management , in which technical knowledge came to be concentrated .
As the scientific management movement split up production into its component procedures , reducing the worker to an appendage of the machine , a great expansion of technical and supervisory personnel took place in order to oversee the productive process as a whole .
92
The expropriation of the peasantry and imposition of the factory labor system was not accomplished without resistance ; the workers knew exactly what was being done to them and what they had lost .
During the 1790s , when rhetoric from the Jacobins and Tom Paine was widespread among the radicalized working class , the rulers of " the cradle of liberty " lived in terror that the country would be swept by revolution .
The system of police state controls over the population resembled an occupation regime .
The Hammonds referred to correspondence between north - country magistrates and the Home Office , in which the law was frankly treated " as an instrument not of justice but of repression , " and the working classes " appear[ed ] ... conspicuously as a helot population .
” 93 ... in the light of the Home Office papers , ... none of the personal rights attaching to Englishmen possessed any reality for the working classes .
The magistrates and their clerks recognized no limit to their powers over the freedom and the movements of working men .
The Vagrancy Laws seemed to supercede the entire charter of an Englishman 's liberties .
They were used to put into prison any man or woman of the working class who seemed to the magistrate an inconvenient or disturbing character .
They offered the easiest and most expeditious way of proceeding against any one who tried to collect money for the families of locked - out workmen , or to disseminate literature that the magistrates thought undesirable .
94 Peel 's " bobbies " -- professional law enforcement -- replaced the posse comitatus system because the latter was inadequate to control a population of increasingly disgruntled workmen .
In the time of the Luddite and other disturbances , crown officials warned that " to apply the Watch and Ward Act would be to put arms into the hands of the most powerfully disaffected . "
At the outset of the wars with France , Pitt ended the practice of quartering the army in alehouses , mixed with the general population .
Instead , the manufacturing districts were covered with barracks , as " purely a matter of police . "
The manufacturing areas " came to resemble a country under military occupation .
" 95
Pitt 's police state was supplemented by quasi- private vigilantism , in the time - honored tradition of blackshirts and death squads ever since .
For example the " Association for the Protection of Property against Republicans and Levellers " -- an anti-Jacobin association of gentry and mill - owners -- conducted house - to - house searches and organized Guy Fawkes - style effigy burnings against Paine ; " Church and King " mobs terrorised suspected radicals .96
Thompson characterized this system of control as " political and social apartheid , " and argued that " the revolution which did not happen in England was fully as devastating " as the one that did happen in France .
97 D. Mercantilism , Colonialism , and the Creation of the " World Market "
The discovery of gold and silver in America , the extirpation , enslavement and entombment in mines of the aboriginal population , the beginning of the conquest and looting of the East Indies , the turning of Africa into a warren for the commercial hunting of blackskins , signalised the rosy dawn of the era of capitalist production .
These idyllic proceedings are the chief momenta of primitive accumulation .
On their heels treads the commercial war of the European nations , with the globe for a theatre .... .... The treasures captured outside Europe by undisguised looting , enslavement , and murder , floated back to the mother country and were there turned into capital .98
We must find new lands from which we can easily obtain raw materials and at the same time exploit the cheap slave labour that is available from the natives of the colonies .
The colonies would also provide a dumping ground for the surplus goods produced in our own factories .
99
In addition to its transformation of society at home , the state aided the accumulation of capital through mercantilism .
The modern " world market " was not created by free market forces .
Like capitalist production in Western Europe , it was an artificial creation of the state , imposed by a revolution from above .
The world market was established by the European conquest of most of the world , and by the naval supremacy of the Western European powers .
Manufacturing to serve a global market was encouraged by state intervention to shut out foreign goods , give European shipping a monopoly of foreign commerce , and stamp out foreign competition by force .
Since the process of creating a single world market has been so closely identified , since the mid-seventeenth century , with the hegemony of Great Britain over the other Western European powers , we will focus on British mercantilism and colonial policy in this section .
Our survey here is not intended even as a systematic overview of the various subsidiary themes in the evolution of colonialism ; as Marx 's panoramic quote above suggests , the subject is too broad for us even to touch briefly on all its major sub -topics .
The following is only a very uneven look at some of the more interesting aspects of the subject that have especially caught our attention .
The Dutch wars during the Interregnum and the reign of Charles II established England as the dominant mercantile power in the world .
The Dutch carrying trade was largely eclipsed , and " the nucleus of all later settlements in India " were won from the Dutch .
In the process , the value of stock in the East India Company increased nine - fold .
The East India Company , established by charter from Cromwell , not only enjoyed close ties to the English state , but acted as proxy for it ; it had the financial and military backing of the state behind its rule .
100
In addition to the naval supremacy arising from those wars , and the Dutch colonies added to English dominions , the British position was further cemented by the Navigation Acts .
The imperial monopoly created by the Navigation Acts allowed merchants to buy English and colonial exports cheap and sell them dear abroad , to buy foreign goods cheap and sell them dear in England .
This increased merchants ' profits , and forced national income from consumption into capital , especially into the artificially stimulated ship - building industry , which boomed .
Thanks to new building and prizes captured in war , English shipping tonnage is believed to have more than doubled between 1640 and 1686.101
Trade carried out under such monopoly conditions was a much more lucrative source of accumulation than industry , providing massive sums of capital for investment in the industrial revolution of the late eighteenth century .
102 Modern exponents of the " free market " generally treat mercantilism as a " misguided " attempt to promote some unified national interest , adopted out of sincere ignorance of economic principles .
In fact , the architects of mercantilism knew exactly what they were doing .
Mercantilism was extremely efficient for its real purpose : making wealthy manufacturing interests rich at the expense of everyone else .
Adam Smith consistently attacked mercantilism , not as a product of economic error , but as a quite intelligent attempt by powerful interests to enrich themselves through the coercive power of the state .
Despite mercantilism 's theoretical preoccupation with the balance of trade , its practical concern was with favorable terms of trade -- buying cheap and selling dear .
103
And this was quite rational , given the existence of captive foreign markets .
Modern free trade advocates assume a mythical world of consumer sovereignty , in which domestic capital has no compulsive power over foreign markets .
But this is untrue even in today 's world , let alone the world of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries .
The reason why an inelastic foreign demand should have been so easily assumed is not at first class clear .
A principal reason why they imagined that exports could be forced on other countries at an enhanced price without diminution of quantity was probably because they were thinking , not in terms of nineteenth - century conditions where alternative markets were generally available to a country , but of a situation where considerable pressure , if not actual coercion , could be applied to the countries with whom one did the bulk of one 's trade .
104 Although opportunities for domestic plunder had been largely exhausted ( at least for the time being ) , the possibilities for naked force in foreign dominions were breathtaking :
As regards the internal market , experience had presumably taught [ policy makers ] that such measures [ regulatory rent - seeking and unequal exchange at expense of other capitalists ] could quickly reach a limit , especially when the field was already congested with established privileges and monopolistic regulations .
Here there was little chance of a merchant expanding his stint save at the expense of another ; and internal trade was consequently regarded as yielding little chance of gain from further regulation .
But in virgin lands across the seas , with native populations to be despoiled and enslaved and colonial settlers to be economically regimented , the situation looked altogether different and the prospects of forced trading and plunder must have seemed abundantly rich .
105
In their reliance on the state to enforce unequal exchange , the merchant capitalists were acting in the tradition of their ancestors , the oligarchs who had taken over the artisan guilds and towns in the late Middle Ages , and set themselves up as middlemen between the urban craftsmen and the rural peasants .
As one writer has said of it , this was the former ' policy of the town writ large in the affairs of State ' .
It was a similar policy of monopoly to that which at an earlier stage the towns had pursued in their relations with the surrounding countryside , and which the merchants and merchant - manufacturers of the privileged companies had pursued in relation to the working craftsmen .
106 Ireland was an early dress rehearsal for a number of atrocious themes that were to recur throughout the history of colonialism .
Ireland , during and after Cromwell 's conquest , experienced a death - rate comparable to the killing fields of Pol Pot , or of East Timor after Suharto 's invasion .
The settler societies of Australia and the New World relied heavily on slave labor of one kind or another .
According to Wakefield , when cheap land was available in the colonies , the only way for the capitalist to obtain labor at a profit was to employ convict or slave labor .
Although , as we have seen above , Wakefield preferred a government policy of artificially pricing laborers out of the land market , he recognized slavery as a necessary makeshift when labor was scarce relative to land .
107
As was the case with the use of full - scale terror war to secure control of Ireland and expropriate land from the natives , the large - scale use of slave labor in foreign colonies was pioneered ( in British realms at least ) by Cromwell .
One of the earliest sources of slaves was the defeated Irish people , along with the Protectorate 's internal enemies .
To be " Barbadoesed " appeared as a new verb , referring to the massive traffic in transported political criminals to that island .
America was built on slave labor .
Most people are more or less aware of the importance of African slavery in the New World ( as Joshua Gee wrote in 1729 , " [ a ]ll this great increase in our treasure proceeds chiefly from the labour of negroes in the plantations .
" 108 For that reason , and not to downplay its significance or sheer brutality , we focus here on the coerced labor of convicts and indentured servants , about which much less is generally known .
Given the scale of black slavery and of convict and indentured white labor , it is likely that the vast majority of Americans in 1776 were descended from those brought here in chains .
Abbot Smith , a specialist in the history of indentured and convict labor , estimates that one - half to two - thirds of white immigrants to the North American colonies belonged to one of those categories .
109 Although estimates of the extent of such immigration vary , all are quite high .
According to Edward Channing 's History of the United States , 10,000 members of the British underclass were kidnapped for transportation in 1670 .
A 1680 pamphlet gives the same figure .
110 In Virginia alone , Thomas Wertenbaker estimated anywhere from 1500 to 2000 entered the colony annually from 1635 - 1705 .
Indentured labor was the foundation of production in the tobacco colonies throughout the seventeenth century .
111 From the late seventeenth century on , the tobacco economy shifted to a reliance mainly on black slaves , as a means of social control .
The poorly developed legal distinctions between black and white labor , combined with the brutal treatment of both and their close association on the plantations , threatened the planter aristocracy with biracial class solidarity .
This threat became concrete from time to time in the form of revolts -- especially Bacon 's Rebellion , in which white and black laborers together nearly overthrew the colonial government .
As a result , the legal status of black slaves was legally formalized in slave codes in the 1670s , and " white skin privilege " and racist ideology were used as a means to divide and rule .
The shift to black plantation labor reduced the threat of social war .
Even so , indentures and convicts continued to be a major part of the white labor force , and the beginning of large - scale transportation of criminals after 1718 threatened the shaky social peace once more .
112
As for the eighteenth century , leaving aside voluntary indentures , Arthur Ekirch estimated that " some 50,000 " convicts were transported from the British Isles .
113 Convict laborers alone represented " as much as a quarter of all British emigrants to colonial America .... " 114 Lest anyone object that such servitude was involuntary only for those guilty of crimes , we should keep in mind the nature of their offenses .
The typical transportee was a petty criminal , " a young male labourer driven to crime by economic necessity .... "
The majority of crimes were theft of property , by members of the classes " most vulnerable to economic dislocation " -- descendants of the same " sturdy vagabonds " thrown onto the highways by the first large - scale expropriation of the peasantry two centuries before .
During economic downturns , an estimated 20 - 45 % of the English populace " may have lacked the means to buy sufficient bread or otherwise feed themselves . "
Even in comparatively good times , the proportion did not fall below 10 % . 115 Gregory King , " the pioneer statistician , " estimated that over half of the population earned less than they consumed and were supported by poor rates .
116
It is also worth bearing in mind that the legal system of that time was in the hands of justices of the peace , who represented the interests of the gentry against the overwhelming majority of the people .
And once a pauper entered that legal system , guilt was by no means a necessary condition for transportation .
J.P.s assumed the right to sentence to transportation even acquitted persons , if they could not find " sureties for good behaviour .
" 117 Another large group who were liable to involuntary transportation without having committed any offense were children .
Sir Thomas Smythe and Sir Edwin Sandys , of the Virginia Company , petitioned the Council of London in 1618 to remedy the labor shortage in their American plantation by allowing the transportation of " vagrant " children .
According to the terms of the consequent bill , chlidren eight or over were subject to capture and transportation .
Boys were liable to sixteen years servitude , and girls to fourteen .
The city aldermen were empowered to direct constables to seize children " loitering " on the streets and to commit them to Bridewell prison - hospital pending shipment to America .
Besides these " vagrants , " children of the indigent were also pressed into service , on pain of cutting off poor relief to recalcitrant parents .
Although the bill ostensibly provided land to those who had completed their term of service , a muster of the Virginia colony in 1625 found almost of the 1619 and 1620 transportees still alive .
118
The rates of death were high for indentured and convict laborers in general , adults as well as children .
Beginning with the transatlantic voyage itself , a death rate of 20 % was regarded as acceptable , although it was often much higher .
The overhead cost of white laborers was much lower than that for African slaves , since the cost of capture was so much lower .
119
The numbers of indentured servants successfully completing their terms of service and collecting the land guaranteed by law , if any , were likewise small .
As was the case with the children in the previous paragraph , only a minority of indentured servants actually collected the land that was guaranteed to them under their contract .
In Maryland , for example , of 5000 indentured servants entering that colony from 1670 - 1680 , fewer than 1300 collected their 50 acres .
Over 1400 had died in service , and the rest were defrauded .
120 Masters often deliberately worsened conditions of work for indentured laborers toward the end of their terms , in order to induce them to run away and forfeit their land or money .
In addition , masters were able to add years to the term of service for relatively minor offenses .
Once such offense was marrying without the master 's permission , or having children out of wedlock -- even when the master was the father .
It goes without saying that such children were born into servitude , and stayed there until they reached adulthood .
Half of indentured servants , in the colonies taken together , did not survive their term of service .
121 One of the most lucrative services the state provided for British manufacturing was the suppression of competing production in the colonies .
Measures , not only of coercion applied to colonial trade in order that it should primarily serve the needs of the parent country , but also to control colonial production , became a special preoccupation of policy at the end of the seventeenth century and the first half of the eighteenth ....
Steps were taken to prohibit the colonial manufacture of commodities which competed with the exportable products of English industry , and to forbid the export of enumerated colonial products to other markets than England .
122 Although he was wrong in describing them as " [ a ] n essential prerequisite " for the industrial revolution , Christopher Hill was correct in his assertion that " large and stable colonial monopoly markets " were an important means of promoting manufacturing interests .
123
The conquest of India , where the authorities in India , followed by the destruction of the Bengalese textile industry ( makers of the highest quality fabric in the world ) , was motivated to a large extent by such concerns .
124 Although Bengalese manufacturers had not yet adopted steam - driven methods of production , they likely would have done so , had India remained politically and economically independent .
At the time of conquest , as Chomsky describes it , India was comparable to England in industrial development .
The conqueror industrialized while Indian industry was destroyed by British regulations and interference ....
Had [ such measures ] not been undertaken , Horace Wilson wrote in his History of British India in 1826 , " the mills of Paisley and Manchester would have been stopped in their outset , and could scarcely have been again set in motion , even by the power of steam .
They were created by the sacrifice of Indian manufactures . "
Under British rule , the textile center of Dacca was depopulated from 150,000 to 30,000.125 Jawaharlal Nehru , in his 1944 work The Discovery of India , correlated the level of poverty in the various parts of India with the length of time the British had been there .
The once prosperous territory of Bengal , the first to be colonized , is today occupied by Bangladesh and the Calcutta area .
126
The old mercantilist system having accomplished its mission , by the mid-19th century the official British ideology shifted to " free trade . "
Free trade ideology has been adopted by the capitalist class , historically , when they were securely in possession of the fruits of past mercantilism , and wished to competing commercial powers from arising in the periphery by the same methods .
Of course , the " free trade " actually adopted by Great Britain , as we shall see in Chapter Seven , was much closer to the neo-mercantilist " free trade " of Palmerston than the genuinely liberal free trade of the Cobdenites .
Although the U.S. , as a latter - day conterpart of Great Britain , is quite vocal in its support of " free trade , " the American , German and Japanese industrial systems were created by the same mercantilist policies , with massive tariffs on industrial goods .
" Free trade " was adopted by safely established industrial powers , who used " laissez - faire " as an ideological weapon to prevent potential rivals from following the same path of industrialization .
Although we have concentrated in this section on the earlier waves of colonialism and their effects on the formative period of industrial capitalism , the record of enslavement , robbery , and devastation was at least as great under the " New Colonialism " of the late 19th century .
Exploitation of the Third World under the latter form of colonialism involved large - scale transfers of wealth to the developed world , and resulted as a consequence in vast super - profits .
In the New as well as the Old Colonialism , a central object of policy was " to clear out of his way by force , the modes of production and appropriation , based on the independent labour of the producer . "
According to David Korten ,
One of the major challenges faced by colonial administrators was to force those who obtained their livelihoods from their own lands and common areas to give up their lands and labor to plantation development , that is , to make them dependent on a money economy so that their resources , labor , and consumption might yield profits to the colonizers .
127 This was accomplished first of all by " dispossessing indigenous communities of the greater part of their traditional territories " : claiming uncultivated or common lands , forests , and grazing lands as property of the colonial administration , and abrogating traditional rights of access ; and second , by head taxes to compel subsistence farmers to enter the money economy .
Throughout the colonies , it became standard practice to declare all " uncultivated " land to be the property of the colonial administration .
At a stroke , local communities were denied legal title to lands they had traditionally set aside as fallow and to the forests , grazing lands and streams they relied upon for hunting , gathering , fishing and herding .
Where , as was frequently the case , the colonial authorities found that the lands they sought to exploit were already " cultivated " , the problem was remedied by restricting the indigenous population to tracts of low quality land deemed unsuitable for European settlement .
In Kenya , such " reserves " were " structured to allow the Europeans , who accounted for less than one per cent of the population , to have full access to the agriculturally rich uplands that constituted 20 per cent of the country .
In Southern Rhodesia , white colonists , who constituted just five per cent of the population , became the new owners of two - thirds of the land ....
Once secured , the commons appropriated by the colonial administration were typically leased out to commercial concerns for plantations , mining and logging , or sold to white settlers .
128 The latter theme continued even in post - colonial times , when corporate agribusiness relied on authoritarian Third World regimes to evict peasants from land needed for large - scale cash crop production .
129
At the same time , to relieve the labor shortage , colonial authorities ( especially in British and French West Africa ) resorted to forced labor to solve the labor shortage .
Taxation was found , however , to be a much more efficient way of accomplishing the same end .
In colonial Africa and Asia , poll taxes or excise taxes on staple commodities were used to force subsistence farmers to sell their labor in the cash economy in order to pay them .
130 Conclusion : “ The World We Have Lost ” -- And Will Regain Capitalism was not , by any means , a " free market " evolving naturally or peacefully from the civilization of the high Middle Ages .
As Oppenheimer argued , capitalism as a system of class exploitation was a direct successor to feudalism , and still displays the birth scars of its origins in late feudalism .
Romantic medievalists like Chesterton and Belloc recounted a process in the high Middle Ages by which serfdom had gradually withered away , and the peasants had transformed themselves into de facto freeholders who paid a nominal quit - rent .
The feudal class system was disintegrating and being replaced by a much more libertarian and less exploitative one .
Immanuel Wallerstein argued that the likely outcome would have been " a system of relatively equal small - scale producers , further flattening out the aristocracies and decentralizing the political structures .
" 131 Although such medievalists no doubt idealized that world considerably , it was still far superior to the world of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries .
Kropotkin described , in terms evocative of William Morris , the rich life of the High Middle Ages , " with its virile affirmation of the individual , and which succeeded in creating a society through the free federation of men , of villages and of towns .
132 " In those cities , sheltered by their conquered liberties , inspired by the spirit of free agreement and of free initiative , a whole new civilization grew up and flourished in a way unparalleled to this day .
" 133
The free cities were virtually independent ; although the crown " granted " them a charter in theory , in reality the charter was typically presented to the king and to the bishop of the surrounding diocese as a fait accompli , when " the inhabitants of a particular borough felt themselves to be sufficiently protected by their walls ....
" 134 The technical prerequisites of the industrial revolution had been anticipated by skilled craftsmen in the urban communes , scholars in the universities , and researchers in the monasteries ; 135 but the atmosphere of barbarism following the triumph of the centralized state set technical progress back by centuries .
The nineteenth century was , in a sense , a technical and industrial " renaissance , " built atop the achievements of the High Middle Ages after a prolonged hiatus ; but because of the intervening centuries of warfare on society , industrial technology was introduced into a society based on brutal exploitation and privilege , instead of flowering in a society where it might have benefited all .
The Renaissance as it happened , G.K. Chesterton argued , was only an anemic ghost of what it might have been had it taken place under a democracy of guilds and peasant proprietors .
Had Wat Tyler and John Ball been successful , Chesterton speculated , our country would probably have had as happy a history as is possible to human nature .
The Renascence , when it came , would have come as popular education and not the culture of a club of aesthetics .
The New Learning might have been as democratic as the old learning in the old days of mediaeval Paris and Oxford .
The exquisite artistry of Cellini might have been but the highest grade of the craft of a guild .
The Shakespearean drama might have been acted by workmen on wooden stages set up in the street like Punch and Judy , the finer fulfillment of the miracle play as it was acted by a guild .
136 The real advancement , the real humanism and progress of the High Middle Ages , has been neglected , and the barbarism and regression of the age of the absolute state disguised as a rebirth of civilization .
In short , history has been not only rewritten , but stood on its head by the victors .
How many lies have been accumulated by Statist historians , in the pay of the State , in that period !
Indeed have we not all learned at school for instance that the State had performed the great service of creating , out of the ruins of feudal society , national unions which had previously been made impossible by the rivalries between cities ?....
And yet , now we learn that in spite of all the rivalries , medieval cities had already worked for four centuries toward building those unions , through federation , freely consented , and that they had succeeded .
137 By 1650 the earlier egalitarian trend Wallerstein remarked on had been reversed .
In the meantime , what he calls the " capitalist world - system " had been established in response to the crisis of feudalism and rising wages .
The socio-economic crisis weakened the nobility such that the peasants steadily increased their share of the surplus from 1250 to 1450 or 1500 ....
It was the increase in the standard of living of the lower strata moving in the direction of relative equalization of incomes ... that for the upper strata represented the real crisis ....
There was no way out of it without drastic social change .
This way ... was the creation of a capitalist world - system , a new form of surplus appropriation .
The replacement of the feudal mode by the capitalist mode was what constituted the seigniorial reaction ; it was a great sociopolitical effort by the ruling strata to retain their collective privileges , even if they had to accept a fundamental reorganization of the economy ....
There would be some families , it was clear , who would lose out by such a shift ; but many would not .
Additionally , and most importantly , the principle of stratification was not merely preserved ; it was to be reinforced as well .
Does not the discovery that the standard of living of the European lower strata went down from 1500 to at least 1800 ... demonstrate how successful was the strategy , if such it could be called , of economic transformation ?
138
On this latter point , according to Maurice Dobb , the strategy was successful indeed .
In the two centuries before the Tudor dynasty , wages had doubled in terms of wheat .
After 1500 , they fell more than enough to reverse that gain .
Part of this fall in real wages was the result of the price revolution o
Every professional performer always does the same thing at exactly the same moment in every show they do .
What I like are things that are different every time .
That 's why I like amateurs .
— Andy Warhol
What Andy Warhol said about professionals vs. amateurs is true not just in theatre , but in lots of DIY pursuits such as brewing your own beer .
Homebrew is better because each time it 's different .
The beer that you buy is made by pros with the goal of replicating the same recipe each time ; the same ingredients , the same process , the same consistent result .
If you make your own beer , you can forget the same - old , same - old .
In fact , it 's rather hard to brew the same exact thing each time following home - made processes .
As an amateur , you get to enjoy these small but noticeable differences .
Homebrew has its own design goals , mainly exploring lots of variations that allow you to see how different beers can be .
For instance , we 've used fresh hops that I 've grown when they 're in season ; we can dry the hops for use later in the year .
We 'll also buy hops from the brewing supply store .
I 've got a setup for all - grain brewing at home and it takes about six hours to get a batch ready for fermentation .
In the photo below , you can see the underlying IPA recipe and my notes outlining the steps .
The notes help me structure the process and remember to do everything I need to do .
I also use the notes to record times and other measurements .
The photo at right is next - to - last step , siphoning the cooled - down brew into a 7 - gallon glass carboy .
We 'll add yeast and the fermentation will start .
It takes several days for the sugars to be converted into alcohol .
I like to check on the batch and see this vigorous activity up - close .
Brewing is fun to do with a group of people .
The brew room , like a workshop , becomes a hangout and you get to talking while you 're doing something .
My daughter 's fiance , Ryan , is learning to brew along with me .
Ryan understands much more of the science behind brewing .
We made a tasty Pumpkin Ale for Thanksgiving .
Yesterday , we started a batch of light - colored German - style beer , which we 'll eventually bottle for holiday presents .
More serious home - brewers try to perfect a recipe and repeat it each time , especially those who enter competitions .
But not everyone needs to have that goal .
To cite a phrase made popular by Perl programmers , there 's more than one way to do it .
That 's what makes homebrew so interesting .
Federal Cabinet had been considering the funding for some time but signed off on it — at levels slightly reduced — earlier this week .
It is understood FFA sought more than $ 50 million but the economic crisis tempered the original expectations .
Still , the total amount approved is a massive commitment .
The FIFA executive will meet in Tokyo on December 19 to ratify the 2018 and 2022 selection process , which is in some disarray .
It had been thought that Australia 's bid would benefit from FIFA 's original plan to announce the hosts for the two World Cups at the same time , but that joint vote plan has been temporarily deferred after some of the executive objected to an 11 - year lead - in time for the 2022 event .
FFA will use the funding to set up the official bid team with a small , but influential executive led by FFA chairman Frank Lowy , and push Australia 's case to host the month - long tournament , which promises to boost tourism and attract a broadcast viewing audience in excess of 26 billion .
The last World Cup in Germany attracted two million international visitors , 3.3 million spectators at games and was broadcast to 214 countries .
It is anticipated that FFA will send representatives to Tokyo to gain clarification about the voting process and formally introduce its candidature .
Government ministers have strongly supported the bid as a way to promote Australia and they said the money was a clear signal that the Government was fully behind Australia 's bid .
" This sends a clear message to the football world that Australia is serious about hosting the 2018 FIFA World Cup , " Sport Minister Kate Ellis said .
" The Australian Government will work in partnership with the Football Federation Australia and state and territory governments in a united approach to building the strongest bid possible for the 2018 event . "
It is expected that the bid will be lodged at the end of 2010 with a FIFA decision expected in March 2011 .
Ellis said the bid faced huge challenges but the country 's record in hosting large - scale sporting events would hold it in good stead .
" Australia has an exemplary record in hosting international sporting events , having held the Olympic Games twice and Commonwealth Games four times , " she said .
" Our sporting infrastructure is also world class , with venues such as Melbourne 's iconic MCG and Telstra Dome ; Sydney 's ANZ Stadium and Football Stadium , and Brisbane 's Suncorp Stadium matching the world 's best . "
Officials from Australia 's other football codes have swung behind the bid , with the AFL preparing to release the MCG for World Cup matches and transfer AFL matches to Docklands , while the new rugby league stadium at Olympic Park would be expanded to around 40,000 capacity .

The latest Quinnipiac University / Wall Street Journal / Washington
Post swing state poll was released today , and it finds Barack Obama surging ahead of John McCain in the critical swing states of Colorado , Michigan , Minnesota , and Wisconsin .
The big news is that Obama now leads McCain with men in each state , and Sarah Palin has completely fallen apart .
In Colorado , Obama has managed to keep his nine point lead , 52 % - 43 % , which is the exact same margin as three weeks ago .
Obama leads McCain with Independents , 51% - 40 % , and still dominates in the state with women , 54% - 38 % .
Obama leads with white voters , 48 % - 47 % , and he leads with men , 49 % - 47 % .
The Obama engine is being fueled by the economy , as 54 % of Colorado voters said that this was there most important issue , and by a margin of 51%- 39 % voters said Obama understands the economy better than McCain .
In Michigan , Obama leads McCain 54% - 38 % .
Obama leads across the board here too .
With men he leads , 48 % - 44 % , with women , 60 % - 32 % , white voters , 48%- 43 % , and Independents , 52%- 35 % .
Sixty four percent of those asked said that the economy was their most important issue , and by a margin of 52%- 35 % said Obama understood it better .
The story is the same in Minnesota , where Obama has added three points to his lead , and is now up 51 % - 40 % .
Obama leads with women , 54%-37 % , whites , 49 %- 43 % , Independents , 51%- 38 % .
McCain and Obama are tied among white men at 46 % .
The economy is the top issue to 58 % of respondents , and they trust Obama over McCain to handle the economy , 49 % - 34 % .
Advertisements
The most drastic jump for Obama has come in Wisconsin , where he has gained nine points , and now leads , 54% - 37 % .
Obama leads with women 59 % - 33 % , men , 49 % - 41 % , whites , 52%-39 % , and Independents , 52% - 36 % .
The economy is the top issue to 55 % of respondents , and Obama is favored over McCain on the issue , 53 % - 32 % .
There are three elements carrying Obama in these polls .
First , the economy is the critical issue in the minds of these voters , and McCain has shown no competency in this area at all .
Second , McCain ’s running mate Sarah Palin is in total free fall .
Palin has negative approval rating in every state , and her approval rating ranges from 37% - 39 % .
None of the people surveyed in these polls believe that she is qualified to be vice president .
Only , 41 % - 44 % of respondents believe that she is qualified to be VP .
In contrast , Joe Biden ’s unfavorable rating ranges from 22% - 27 % , and 76 % - 81 % of those asked believe that he is qualified to be vice president .
Palin was added to the ticket to attract the white suburban soccer moms that voted for Bush in 2004 , but her selection has backfired in a big way .
Women do n’t think that she is qualified for the job .
By a margin of 52 % - 42 % women voter said that she is n’t qualified .
In Michigan , by a margin of 50 % - 34 % women said that she is n’t qualified .
In Minnesota and Wisconsin , the margin was 49 % - 40 % .
My theory is that Sarah Palin sunk McCain ’s chances , especially in Michigan , because she is completely unable to discuss the economy .
While those asked stressed that the debates did n’t change their support , what the debates did seem to do is make voters more comfortable with Obama .
This is a Democratic year , and I think many voters wanted to support a Democrat , but they had some concerns about whether or not Obama could handle the job .
I believe that the biggest thing the debates have done for Obama is that they have eased worries about him , because he has looked more presidential than McCain .
In each poll that is released , Obama is shoring up his lead , and if this trend continues for another week or two , McCain will need a miracle to win this election .
Full Poll Results
Britain 's economy may be deeper in recession than previously thought after official data showed that industrial output plummeted at the fastest rate in nearly six years in October , with previous months also weaker than estimated .
The figures , described as a " horror story " by one economist , raised expectations in the City that interest rates will have to be cut aggressively again and that they could fall close to zero next year .
The Bank of England has already slashed borrowing costs by three percentage points since October to 2 % , a 57 - year low , in a desperate - and some say belated - attempt to kickstart the economy .
The pound fell against the euro and the dollar following the news , dropping by over 1 % to $ 1.4742 .
The euro rose to 87.25 p , closer to its recent record high of 87.38 p .
Industrial production , which comprises manufacturing , mining and utilities , fell by 1.7 % in October from the month before , the Office for National Statistics reported this morning .
The fall was more than three times the size predicted by City economists and the biggest drop since January 2003 .
It took output down 5.2 % from a year ago , the steepest annual decline since April 1991 .
The ONS also revised down output in previous months and said , other things being equal , that would mean GDP contracted by 0.6 % in the third quarter of 2008 instead of the 0.5 % fall initially reported .
Britain will officially be in recession once the fourth - quarter GDP figures , which are expected to show a sharp contraction , are published in late January .
Industrial production was down 1.4 % in the third quarter from July to September , worsening to a decline of 1.8 % in the three months to October .
Philip Shaw , chief economist at Investec , said the latest data was a " horror story " .
" We 've seen a number of sharp declines in recent months and if anything the pace of contraction appears to be worsening .
The implication is that fourth - quarter GDP is going to look very poor indeed , which certainly cements our view that interest rates will be close to zero during the second quarter of next year . "
James Knightley at ING said he expects GDP to contract by close to 1 % in the fourth quarter , followed by a similar outcome in the first quarter of next year .
" Consequently , the Bank of England has more work to do with a growing likelihood that UK rates will eventually get down to zero . "
Andrew Sentance , who sits on the Bank 's monetary policy committee , warned today that the recession was likely to be as long and deep as the previous three major downturns in the mid-1970s , early 1980s and early 1990s .
Speaking at a conference in London , he said monetary policy has been relaxed " dramatically " but this will take several quarters to have an effect .
" Interest rates started to be cut at an earlier stage of this downturn than was the case in previous UK recessions , " Sentance said .
Manufacturing production fell by 1.4 % in October , much faster than expected and the eighth monthly slump .
That was the biggest drop since March 2005 and marked the longest run of declines since 1980 .
The slump was widespread across manufacturing , with printing and publishing particularly weak , followed by the metals and transport equipment sectors , including cars .
Matthew Sharratt at Bank of America said the figures were " really horrible " .
He said : " The real worry is that potentially we have not seen the worst of it .
The recession in manufacturing is tightening its grip .
The prospect for manufacturing and the economy as a whole is dismal .
The Bank of England will have to cut interest rates . "
Separate figures from the ONS showed that Britain 's trade in goods gap with the rest of the world widened slightly to £ 7.75 bn in October .
Japan is also deeper in recession than previously thought .
Official figures released earlier today showed that the Japanese economy shrank by 1.8 % in the third quarter of the year , on an annualised basis , compared with an earlier estimate of 0.4 % .
With equipment just six years old , the company has now pledged to upgrade .
And in a statement commenting on the incident they said : " When we said ' you can get face - to - face with the ultimate predator ' this is not what we had in mind " .

Is it me , or are fast food burger patties shrinking even more ?
Is it the economy ?
Ca n’t figure out a way to cut costs , so we ’ll just cut a fourth of beef off of every hamburger ?
Is this what ’s happening ?
In an effort to not throw one of my favorite fast food joints under the bus , I ’ll be referring to it as Burger Heaven for purposes of this blog .
That ’s actually a fitting name because my typical experience is nothing short of divine .
There truly is something extraordinary about a warm , charbroiled hamburger patty covered with melted cheese , smothered in ketchup , with lettuce and tomato inside a fresh bun .
It ’s magic .
Unfortunately for me , no sparks were flying last night .
No angels singing at Burger Heaven because for the first time ever , my cheeseburger SUCKED .
I had to lift the bun to see if there was even a burger in there , giving me flashbacks of those Wendy ’s commercials where the old lady squinted through her glasses , searching for any sign of a patty and then said straight into the camera , “ Where ’s the beef ? ” Remember that ?
And it seemed like only a few hours after that first spot ran , every mullet in America was covered with a “ where ’s the beef ” trucker hat and every girl with big bangs was wearing an oversized T - shirt with the stupid slogan printed on it .
Aaaawwww , the eighties .
So many fashion fabs and SO MANY trendy trainwrecks .
The “ where ’s the beef ” clothing line , hands - down , the most tragic of them all .
Back to Burger Heaven , last night , where I was seriously disturbed that the beef in my burger was noticeably different in size … how can a restaurant change something like that without giving us a heads - up ?
I am devastated .
This is my favorite burger — you could blind fold me , give me bites of a hundred different cheeseburgers and I would know which one was mine in an instant .
You ca n’t mess with my burger , Burger Heaven !
PLEASE DON’T MESS WITH MY BURGER !
Like a dork , I went home and got online to do some burger research .
I was praying that Burger Heaven did the right thing and posted some of its new changes on its website .
Wishful thinking .
Why would a restaurant print , “ We are excited to announce a transformation in our best selling cheeseburger , it will be half the size from now on , giving us the opportunity to stay afloat in this sh—y economy . ”
Come on Nicole .
Of course BH is not going to publicly announce a burger downsize .
I am very upset about this .
I bust my butt at work all week and sinking my teeth into a big , fat , juicy burger is a treat that I look forward to .
Even though it happens about twice a week , it always tastes like a reward ( especially when I wash it down with a cold beer ) .
What if I get a wicked bad burger craving late night , over the weekend ?
I ’ve always been so loyal to Burger Heaven , will I cave and cheat ?
I had an affair with White Castle when I lived in New York .
I justified my indulgence of those tiny , individually - wrapped bundles of joy by telling myself that it was okay because I was across state lines .
What was I gonna do , fly to Cali everytime I wanted Burger Heaven ?
I ’m hoping this sheisty modification is purely temporary and my favorite burger will return to the menu in its normal stature soon .
Meantime , I ’m in the market for a new place to call burger home , any suggestions ?

APT HOWTO ( Obsolete Documentation )
Chapter 3 - Managing packages
3.1 Updating the list of available packages
The packaging system uses a private database to keep track of which packages are installed , which are not installed and which are available for installation .
The apt - get program uses this database to find out how to install packages requested by the user and to find out which additional packages are needed in order for a selected package to work properly .
To update this list , you would use the command apt - get update .
This command looks for the package lists in the archives found in /etc/apt/ sources.list ; see The /etc/apt/sources.list file , Section 2.1 for more information about this file .
It 's a good idea to run this command regularly to keep yourself and your system informed about possible package updates , particularly security updates .
3.2 Installing packages
Finally , the process you 've all been waiting for !
With your sources .
list ready and your list of available packages up to date , all you have to do is run apt - get to get your desired package installed .
For example , you can run :
# apt - get install xchat
APT will search it 's database for the most recent version of this package and will retrieve it from the corresponding archive as specified in sources .
list .
In the event that this package depends on another -- as is the case here -- APT will check the dependencies and install the needed packages .
See this example :
# apt - get install nautilus Reading Package Lists ... Done Building Dependency Tree ... Done
The following extra packages will be installed : bonobo libmedusa0 libnautilus0
The following NEW packages will be installed : bonobo libmedusa0 libnautilus0 nautilus 0 packages upgraded , 4 newly installed , 0 to remove and 1 not upgraded .
Need to get 8329 kB of archives .
After unpacking 17.2 MB will be used .
Do you want to continue ? [ Y / n ]
The package nautilus depends on the shared libraries cited , therefore APT will get them from the archive .
If you had specified the names of these libraries on the apt - get command line , APT would not have asked if you wanted to continue ; it would automatically accept that you wanted to install all of those packages .
This means that APT only asks for confirmation when it needs to install packages which were n't specified on the command line .
The following options to apt - get may be useful :
-h This help text .
-d Download only - do NOT install or unpack archives -f Attempt to continue if the integrity check fails -s No-act .
Perform ordering simulation -y Assume Yes to all queries and do not prompt -u
Show a list of upgraded packages as well
Multiple packages may be selected for installation in one line .
Files downloaded from the network are placed in the directory / var / cache / apt / archives for later installation .
You can specify packages to be removed on the same command line , as well .
Just put a ' -' immediately after the name of the package to be removed , like this :
# apt - get install nautilus gnome - panel - Reading Package Lists ... Done Building Dependency Tree ... Done
The following extra packages will be installed : bonobo libmedusa0 libnautilus0
The following packages will be REMOVED : gnome - applets gnome - panel gnome - panel - data gnome - session
The following NEW packages will be installed : bonobo libmedusa0 libnautilus0 nautilus 0 packages upgraded , 4 newly installed , 4 to remove and 1 not upgraded .
Need to get 8329 kB of archives .
After unpacking 2594 kB will be used .
Do you want to continue ? [ Y / n ]
See section Removing packages , Section 3.3 for more details on package removal .
If you somehow damage an installed package , or simply want the files of a package to be reinstalled with the newest version that is available , you can use the -- reinstall option like so :
# apt - get -- reinstall install gdm Reading Package Lists ... Done Building Dependency Tree ...
Done 0 packages upgraded , 0 newly installed , 1 reinstalled , 0 to remove and 1 not upgraded .
Need to get 0B / 182 kB of archives .
After unpacking 0B will be used .
Do you want to continue ? [ Y / n ]
3.3 Removing packages
If you no longer want to use a package , you can remove it from your system using APT .
To do this just type : apt - get remove package .
For example :
# apt - get remove gnome - panel Reading Package Lists ... Done Building Dependency Tree ... Done
The following packages will be REMOVED : gnome - applets gnome - panel gnome - panel - data gnome - session 0 packages upgraded , 0 newly installed , 4 to remove and 1 not upgraded .
Need to get 0B of archives .
After unpacking 14.6MB will be freed .
Do you want to continue ? [ Y / n ]
As you can see in the above example , APT also takes care of removing packages which depend on the package you have asked to remove .
There is no way to remove a package using APT without also removing those packages that depend on it .
Running apt - get as above will cause the packages to be removed but their configuration files , if any , will remain intact on the system .
For a complete removal of the package , run :
# apt - get -- purge remove gnome - panel Reading Package Lists ... Done Building Dependency Tree ... Done
The following packages will be REMOVED : gnome - applets * gnome - panel* gnome - panel - data * gnome - session * 0 packages upgraded , 0 newly installed , 4 to remove and 1 not upgraded .
Need to get 0B of archives .
After unpacking 14.6MB will be freed .
Do you want to continue ? [ Y / n ]
Note the ' *' after the names .
This indicates that the configuration files for each of these packages will also be removed .
Just as in the case of the install method , you can use a symbol with remove to invert the meaning for a particular package .
In the case of removing , if you add a '+' right after the package name , the package will be installed instead of being removed .
# apt - get -- purge remove gnome - panel nautilus +
Reading Package Lists ... Done Building Dependency Tree ... Done
The following extra packages will be installed : bonobo libmedusa0 libnautilus0 nautilus
The following packages will be REMOVED : gnome - applets * gnome - panel* gnome - panel - data * gnome - session *
The following NEW packages will be installed : bonobo libmedusa0 libnautilus0 nautilus 0 packages upgraded , 4 newly installed , 4 to remove and 1 not upgraded .
Need to get 8329 kB of archives .
After unpacking 2594 kB will be used .
Do you want to continue ? [ Y / n ]
Note that apt - get lists the extra packages which will be installed ( that is , the packages whose installation is needed for the proper functioning of the package whose installation has been requested ) , those which will be removed , and those which will be installed ( including the extra packages again ) .
3.4 Upgrading packages
Package upgrades are a great success of the APT system .
They can be achieved with a single command : apt - get upgrade .
You can use this command to upgrade packages within the same distribution , as well as to upgrade to a new distribution , although for the latter the command apt - get dist - upgrade is preferred ; see section Upgrading to a new release , Section 3.5 for more details .
It 's useful to run this command with the -u option .
This option causes APT to show the complete list of packages which will be upgraded .
Without it , you 'll be upgrading blindly .
APT will download the latest versions of each package and will install them in the proper order .
It 's important to always run apt - get update before you try this .
See section Updating the list of available packages , Section 3.1 .
Look at this example :
# apt - get -u upgrade Reading Package Lists ... Done Building Dependency Tree ... Done
The following packages have been kept back cpp gcc lilo
The following packages will be upgraded adduser ae apt autoconf debhelper dpkg - dev esound esound - common ftp indent ipchains isapnptools libaudiofile - dev libaudiofile0 libesd0 libesd0 - dev libgtk1.2 libgtk1.2-dev liblockfile1 libnewt0 liborbit - dev liborbit0 libstdc ++2.10 - glibc2.2 libtiff3g libtiff3g - dev modconf orbit procps psmisc 29 packages upgraded , 0 newly installed , 0 to remove and 3 not upgraded .
Need to get 5055B / 5055 kB of archives .
After unpacking 1161 kB will be used .
Do you want to continue ? [ Y / n ]
The process is very simple .
Note that in the first few lines , apt - get says that some packages were kept back .
This means that there are new versions of these packages which will not be installed for some reason .
Possible reasons are broken dependencies ( a package on which it depends does n't have a version available for download ) or new dependencies ( the package has come to depend on new packages since the last version ) .
There 's no clean solution for this first case .
For the second case , it 's sufficient to run apt - get install for the specific package in question , as this will download the dependencies .
An even cleaner solution is to use dist - upgrade .
See section Upgrading to a new release , Section 3.5 .
3.5 Upgrading to a new release
This feature of APT allows you to upgrade an entire Debian system at once , either through the Internet or from a new CD ( purchased or downloaded as an ISO image ) .
It is also used when changes are made to the relationships between installed packages .
With apt - get upgrade , these packages would be kept untouched ( kept back ) .
For example , suppose that you 're using revision 0 of the stable version of Debian and you buy a CD with revision 3 .
You can use APT to upgrade your system from this new CD .
To do this , use apt - cdrom ( see section Adding a CD - ROM to the sources .
list file , Section 2.4 ) to add the CD to your /etc/apt/sources.list and run apt - get dist - upgrade .
It 's important to note that APT always looks for the most recent versions of packages .
Therefore , if your /etc/ apt / sources .list were to list an archive that had a more recent version of a package than the version on the CD , APT would download the package from there .
In the example shown in section Upgrading packages , Section 3.4 , we saw that some packages were kept back .
We 'll solve this problem now with the dist - upgrade method :
# apt - get -u dist - upgrade Reading Package Lists ... Done Building Dependency Tree ... Done Calculating Upgrade ...
Done
The following NEW packages will be installed : cpp-2.95 cron exim gcc-2.95 libident libopenldap - runtime libopenldap1 libpcre2 logrotate mailx
The following packages have been kept back lilo
The following packages will be upgraded adduser ae apt autoconf cpp debhelper dpkg - dev esound esound - common ftp gcc indent ipchains isapnptools libaudiofile - dev libaudiofile0 libesd0 libesd0 - dev libgtk1.2 libgtk1.2-dev liblockfile1 libnewt0 liborbit - dev liborbit0 libstdc ++2.10 - glibc2.2 libtiff3g libtiff3g - dev modconf orbit procps psmisc 31 packages upgraded , 10 newly installed , 0 to remove and 1 not upgraded .
Need to get 0B/7098 kB of archives .
After unpacking 3118 kB will be used .
Do you want to continue ? [ Y / n ]
Note now that the packages will be upgraded , and new packages will also be installed ( the new dependencies of the packages ) .
Note too that lilo is still being kept back .
It probably has a more serious problem than a new dependency .
We can find out by running :
# apt - get -u install lilo Reading Package Lists ... Done Building Dependency Tree ... Done
The following extra packages will be installed : cron debconf exim libident libopenldap - runtime libopenldap1 libpcre2 logrotate mailx
The following packages will be REMOVED : debconf - tiny
The following NEW packages will be installed : cron debconf exim libident libopenldap - runtime libopenldap1 libpcre2 logrotate mailx
The following packages will be upgraded lilo 1 packages upgraded , 9 newly installed , 1 to remove and 31 not upgraded .
Need to get 225 kB / 1179 kB of archives .
After unpacking 2659 kB will be used .
Do you want to continue ? [ Y / n ]
As noted in the above , lilo has a new conflict with the package debconf - tiny , which means it could n't be installed ( or upgraded ) without removing debconf - tiny .
To know what 's keeping or removing a package you may use :
# apt - get -o Debug:: pkgProblemResolver=yes dist- upgrade Reading Package Lists ... Done Building Dependency Tree ... Done Calculating Upgrade ... Starting Starting 2 Investigating python1.5 Package python1.5 has broken dep on python1.5 - base Considering python1.5 - base 0 as a solution to python1.5 0 Holding Back python1.5 rather than change python1.5 - base Investigating python1.5 - dev Package python1.5 - dev has broken dep on python1.5 Considering python1.5 0 as a solution to python1.5 - dev 0 Holding Back python1.5 - dev rather than change python1.5 Try to Re-Instate python1.5 - dev Done Done
The following packages have been kept back gs python1.5 - dev 0 packages upgraded , 0 newly installed , 0 to remove and 2 not upgraded .
This way , it 's easy to notice that the python1.5 - dev package cannot be installed because of an unsatisfied dependency : python1.5 .
3.6 Removing unused package files : apt - get clean and autoclean
When you install a package APT retrieves the needed files from the hosts listed in /etc/ apt/ sources.list , stores them in a local repository ( / var / cache / apt/archives / ) , and then proceeds with installation , see Installing packages , Section 3.2 .
In time the local repository can grow and occupy a lot of disk space .
Fortunately , APT provides tools for managing its local repository : apt - get 's clean and autoclean methods .
apt - get clean removes everything except lock files from / var / cache / apt / archives / and / var / cache / apt/archives / partial / .
Thus , if you need to reinstall a package APT should retrieve it again .
apt - get autoclean removes only package files that can no longer be downloaded .
The following example show how apt - get autoclean works :
# ls /var / cache/apt/archives/logrotate*
/var/cache/apt/archives/gpm* logrotate_3.5.9-7_i386.deb logrotate_3.5.9-8_i386.deb gpm_1.19.6-11_i386.deb
In /var / cache / apt / archives there are two files for the package logrotate and one for the package gpm .
# apt - show - versions -p logrotate logrotate / stable uptodate 3.5.9 - 8 # apt - show - versions -p gpm gpm/stable upgradeable from 1.19.6-11 to 1.19.6-12
apt - show - versions shows that logrotate_3.5.9-8_i386.deb provides the up to date version of logrotate , so logrotate_3.5.9-7_i386.deb is useless .
Also gpm_1.19.6-11_i386.deb is useless because a more recent version of the package can be retrieved .
# apt - get autoclean Reading Package Lists ... Done Building Dependency Tree ... Done Del gpm 1.19.6-11 [ 145 kB ] Del logrotate 3.5.9 -7 [ 26.5 kB ]
Finally , apt - get autoclean removes only the old files .
See
How to upgrade packages from specific versions of Debian , Section 3.9 for more information on apt - show - versions .
3.7 Using APT with dselect
dselect is a program that helps users select Debian packages for installation .
It 's considered somewhat complicated and rather boring , but with practice you can get the hang of its console - based ncurses interface .
One feature of dselect is that it knows how to make use of the capacity Debian packages have for " recommending " and " suggesting " other packages for installation .
To use the program , run `dselect ' as root .
Choose ' apt ' as your access method .
This is n't truly necessary , but if you 're not using a CD ROM and you want to download packages from the Internet , it 's the best way to use dselect .
To gain a better understanding of dselect 's usage , read the dselect documentation found on the Debian page http://www.debian.org/doc/ddp .
After making your selections with dselect , use :
# apt - get -u dselect - upgrade
as in the example below :
# apt - get -u dselect - upgrade Reading Package Lists ... Done Building Dependency Tree ... Done
The following packages will be REMOVED : lbxproxy
The following NEW packages will be installed : bonobo console - tools - libs cpp -3.0 enscript expat fingerd gcc -3.0 gcc-3.0 - base icepref klogd libdigest - md5 - perl libfnlib0 libft - perl libgc5 - dev libgcc300 libhtml - clean - perl libltdl0 - dev libsasl - modules libstdc + +3.0 metamail nethack proftpd - doc psfontmgr python - newt talk tidy util - linux - locales vacation xbill xplanet - images
The following packages will be upgraded debian - policy 1 packages upgraded , 30 newly installed , 1 to remove and 0 not upgraded .
Need to get 7140 kB of archives .
After unpacking 16.3 MB will be used .
Do you want to continue ? [ Y / n ]
Compare with what we see when running apt - get dist - upgrade on the same system :
# apt - get -u dist - upgrade Reading Package Lists ... Done Building Dependency Tree ... Done Calculating Upgrade ...
Done
The following packages will be upgraded debian - policy 1 packages upgraded , 0 newly installed , 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded .
Need to get 421 kB of archives .
After unpacking 25.6 kB will be freed .
Do you want to continue ? [ Y / n ]
Note that many of the packages from above are being installed because other packages " suggested " or " recommended " them .
Others are being installed or removed ( in the case of lbxproxy , for example ) per the choices we made while navigating through dselect 's package listing .
Dselect can be a powerful tool when used in conjunction with APT .
3.8
How to keep a mixed system
People are sometimes interested in using one of the Debian versions as its main system distribution and one or more packages from another branch .
To set up what is your main version of Debian you should edit the /etc / apt / apt.conf ( it does not usually exist , create it if you do n't have one ) to contain the following line :
APT :: Default - Release " version " ;
Where version is the version of Debian you want to use as the main distribution .
The versions you can use are stable , testing and unstable .
To install packages from another version , then , you must use APT in the following way :
# apt - get -t distribution install package
For that to work , though , you need at least one APT source line in your /etc/ apt / sources .
list for the distribution you want the package from , and the package must exist on that source .
You can also request a specific version of a package using the following sintax :
# apt - get install package = version
For example , the line below will install version 2.2.4 - 1 of the nautilus package . :
# apt - get install nautilus=2.2.4-1
IMPORTANT : the `unstable ' version of Debian is the version to which the newest versions of Debian packages are uploaded first .
This distribution sees all of the changes that packages go through , both small ones and more drastic ones which affect many packages or the whole system .
For this reason , this version of the distribution should not be used by inexperienced users or by those who need proven stability .
The `testing ' distribution is not necessarily better than `unstable ' , because it does not receive security updates quickly .
For servers and other production systems stable should always be used .
3.9
How to upgrade packages from specific versions of Debian
apt - show - versions provides a safe way for users of mixed distributions to upgrade their systems without getting more of the less - stable distribution than they had in mind .
For instance , it is possible to upgrade just your unstable packages by running after having installed the apt - show - versions package :
# apt - get install `apt - show - versions -u - b | grep unstable | cut -d ' ' -f 1`
3.10 How to keep specific versions of packages installed ( complex )
You may have occasion to modify something in a package and do n't have time or do n't want to port those changes to a new version of the program .
Or , for instance , you may have just upgraded your Debian distribution to 3.0 , but want to continue with the version of a certain package from Debian 2.2 .
You can " pin " the version you have installed so that it will not be upgraded .
Using this resource is simple .
You just need to edit the file / etc / apt / preferences .
The format is simple :
Package : < package > Pin : < pin definition >
Pin-Priority : < pin 's priority >
Each entry must be separated from any other entries by a blank line .
For example , to keep package sylpheed that I have modified to use " reply - to - list " at version 0.4.99 , I add :
Package : sylpheed Pin : version 0.4.99 *
Note that I used an * ( asterisk ) .
This is a " wildcard " ; it say that I want that this " pin " to be valid for all versions beginning with 0.4.99 .
This is because Debian versions its packages with a " Debian revision " and I do n't want to avoid the installation of these revisions .
So , for instance , versions 0.4.99 - 1 and 0.4.99 - 10 will be installed as soon as they are made available .
Note that if you modified the package you wo n't want to do things this way .
The pin priority helps determine whether a package matching the " Packages : " and " Pin : " lines will be installed , with higher priorities making it more likely that a matching package will be installed .
You can read apt_preferences ( 7 ) for a thorough discussion of priorities , but a few examples should give the basic idea .
The following describes the effect of setting the priority field to different values in the sylpheed example above .
1001 Sylpheed version 0.4.99 will never be replaced by apt .
If available , apt will install version 0.4.99 even if it would replace an installed package with a higher version .
Only packages of priority greater than 1000 will ever downgrade an existing package .
1000
The effect is the same as priority 1001 , except that apt will refuse to downgrade an installed version to 0.4.99
990 Version 0.4.99 will be replaced only by a higher version available from a release designated as preferred using the " APT : : Default - Release " variable ( see How to keep a mixed system , Section 3.8 , above ) .
500 Any version higher than 0.4.99 of sylpheed which is available from any release will take preference over version 0.4.99 , but 0.4.99 will still be preferred to a lower version .
100 Higher versions of sylpheed available from any release will take preference over version 0.4.99 , as will any installed higher version of slypheed ; so 0.4.99 will be installed only if no version is installed already .
This is the priority of installed packages .
- 1 Negative priorities are allowed as well , and prevent 0.4.99 from ever being installed .
A pin can be specified on a package 's version , release or origin .
Pinning on a version , as we have seen , supports literal version numbers as well as wildcards to specify several versions at one time .
Option release depends on the Release file from an APT repository or from a CD .
This option may be of no use at all if you 're using package repositories that do n't provide this file .
You may see the contents of the Release files that you have on / var / lib / apt / lists / .
The parameters for a release are : a ( archive ) , c ( components ) , v ( version ) , o ( origin ) and l ( label ) .
An example :
Package : * Pin : release v=2.2*,a=stable , c=main, o=Debian,l=Debian Pin-Priority : 1001
In this example , we chose version 2.2 * of Debian ( which can be 2.2r2 , 2.2r3 -- this accommodates " point releases " that typically include security fixes and other very important updates ) , the stable repository , section main ( as opposed to contrib or non-free ) and origin and label Debian .
Origin ( o= ) defines who produced that Release file , the label ( l= ) defines the name of the distribution : Debian for Debian itself and Progeny for Progeny , for example .
A sample Release file :
$ cat / var / lib/ apt/lists/ftp.debian.org.br_debian_dists_potato_main_binary-i386_Release Archive : stable Version : 2.2r3 Component : main Origin : Debian Label : Debian Architecture : i386

Science & Exploration ESA presents European participants in Mars500 isolation study
05/12/2008 461 views 0 likes
ESA PR 48-2008 .
March 2009 will see two European participants entering a set of modules at the Institute of Biomedical Problems ( IBMP ) in Moscow .
Together with four Russian participants , they will be sealed inside these isolation chambers for 105 days .
This joint ESA IBMP campaign is a preparatory study leading up to the 520 - day isolation study in the form of a full - fledged simulation of a mission to Mars that is due to start end -2009 .
As with a real space mission , the two European participants will have European backups .
The backups ( three in this case ) will go through the same training and preparation and will be able to step in at the last moment if need be .
In addition , they will have tasks to carry out in the mission control centre over the 105 days .
A bedroom inside the Mars500 facility ESA ’s Directorate of Human Spaceflight has a longstanding tradition of conducting research on the physiological and psychological aspects of spaceflight .
ESA ’s bedrest studies , in particular , are at the forefront of scientific research to understand how the human body reacts under microgravity conditions , the aim being to devise effective countermeasures and enable humans to undertake long - term missions in space .
Mars500 is part of these scientific efforts to prepare for human exploration missions .
These five Europeans were selected following a thorough process that started in May at the European Astronauts Centre in Cologne once the initial 5600 applications had been reduced to a shortlist of 32 .
The selection procedure for these candidates was similar to that applicable to real astronauts .
Three are of French nationality , one is Swedish and one German .
On the occasion of the finalisation of the selection process , media are invited to attend a press conference at ESA Headquarters on 11 December starting at 15:30 , during which the European participants will be presented .
Media representatives wishing to attend the event are kindly requested to fill in the accreditation form ( linked on the right ) and return it by fax to the ESA Headquarters Media Relations Office .

Police said all sorts of " troublemakers " had got involved
Dozens of youths have rioted in the southern Swedish city of Malmo for a second consecutive night , setting cars on fire and clashing with police .
" We 've had a very difficult evening , " a police spokeswoman told the AFP news agency late on Thursday .
" There have been fires burning since this afternoon ... extensive damage to public property , and ... stone - throwing and bomb threats against police . "
She said the trouble was linked to the closure of an Islamic centre .
The owner of the building , in an immigrant neighbourhood , had decided not to renew the centre 's lease .
The centre , which included a mosque , had to move out .
But some youths squatted in the premises , until they were evicted by police earlier this week .
Once police left the premises , the youths returned , setting fires in the area .
They then clashed with police .
" The origin of the riots is the occupation of the building .
But that 's not really the reason now , now other troublemakers have just joined in , taking advantage of the situation , " police spokeswoman Ewa - Gun Westford told AFP .
Michael Caines did not take the petition in person
One of Devon 's best - known chefs has been given a 600 - signature petition to take a controversial dish off his Exeter restaurant 's menu .
Protesters want double Michelin star - winning chef Michael Caines to stop serving foie gras at the Abode Exeter .
Production of the pate made from force - fed geese and ducks ' livers is banned in the UK , but it can be imported .
Mr Caines did not take the petition in person .
Neither he nor anyone from his restaurant was available for comment .
' Cruel product '
Protesters showed a human being force fed with spaghetti to compare the conditions , they said , birds were subjected to to produce it .
Sharon Howe of the organisation Exeter Friends for Animals , which held the protest outside the restaurant while the petition was handed in , said : " It 's quite ironic .
" Michael Caines promotes local produce , which we think is a very praiseworthy .
But at the same time he is importing a product , which , were it produced in this country , would be banned because it contravenes animal welfare legislation .
" It 's a very cruel product . "
Mr Caines was born in Exeter in 1969 .
He appeared in the BBC's Great British Menu programme and was awarded an MBE for services to the hospitality industry in 2006 .
The Rwandan president today threatened to arrest French nationals if France proceeds with the indictment of one of his aides .
President Paul Kagame 's chief of protocol was arrested on Sunday in Germany on a warrant from France , where she is wanted in connection with the attack on the plane of a former Rwandan president that touched off Rwanda 's 1994 genocide .
Kagame told reporters in Geneva : " [ If ] you indict our people , we indict your people . "
Rwanda has already ordered the German ambassador to leave the country and recalled its envoy in Berlin after the arrest of Rose Kabuye at Frankfurt airport .
Kabuye , Rwanda 's director of state protocol , was arrested by German police acting on a 2006 international warrant issued for her and eight other Rwandans for alleged complicity in the 1994 aircraft attack .
The Rwandan government said it was not severing diplomatic ties with Germany and that full relations would be restored once the controversy over Kabuye 's arrest is resolved .
Kagame visited Kabuye yesterday in Germany to reassure her of his support ahead of her possible trial in France .
France wants to question Kabuye over the plane crash that killed then - president Juvenal Habyarimana .
His plane was hit by a missile and his death was the prelude to a rampage in which Hutu extremists slaughtered 800,000 Tutsis and some moderate Hutus .
Kagame was the leader of the Rwandan Patriotic Front that defeated the government 's Hutu militias to end the genocide .
Kabuye was in Frankfurt to prepare for a visit by Kagame who is currently on a tour of Europe .
The president said the arrest was unacceptable and would have implications for his country 's relationship with France and Germany .
Germany took a leading role in helping Rwanda rebuild after the genocide .
Ties between France and Rwanda have been strained since the warrants were issued and hundreds of people , including Kabuye 's husband , protested outside the German embassy in Kigali yesterday .
A spokesman for the foreign ministry in Berlin said German officials had been obliged to arrest Kabuye .
Her lawyer said she was willing to go before a French judge .
" Rwanda or Rose should be able to fight for their right , and we challenge the case as whether in Germany or in France or anywhere else , " Kagame told reporters after visiting Kabuye in prison .
Rwanda broke off diplomatic ties with Paris in November 2006 because of the warrants .
Kigali , for its part , has accused French officials of involvement in the genocide , a charge France denies .
Although Rwanda was a Belgian colony until independence in 1962 , France kept close links with the government there from 1975 to 1994 , giving financial and military support .
The Rwandan government said Kabuye was travelling on official government business when she was arrested .
Rwanda 's information ministry said Berlin had warned Kabuye against travelling to Germany because of the arrest warrant but that she had travelled there and to other European countries earlier in the year without incident .
The timing may also have been influenced by the upheaval in neighbouring Congo .
Rwanda is under pressure over its ties to the Tutsi rebel leader , Laurent Nkunda , who has been accused of war crimes as he seized swaths of eastern Congo in recent weeks .
France has been particularly vocal in its criticism and in proposing European military intervention .
Sid Agrawal SiPORT CEO
Murdered , Jing Hua Wu at Large ( Photos )
SiPORT Inc CEO and Directorwas gunned down on Friday afternoon at the company 's Santa Clara , California office complex .
Also confirmed dead is V.P. of Operations .
A woman , whose identify is being withheld pending notification of next of kin , was also reported to have been killed .
A manhunt is underway for 47 year old Jing Hua Wu , a former lead product test engineer at the fabless digital radio semiconductor company who was recently given his layoff notice .
The disgruntled man entered the Silicon Valley office building at just shortly before 4:00 p.m. and opened fire according to Santa Clara Police Lt. Mike Sellers .
Officers scoured the complex and searched the suspects home in Mountain View , CA .
He is still at large and is armed and dangerous .
The shootings have sparked a massive dragnet across the area .
His photo is shown at the top of this story .
He is described as 5 ' 7 " , 170 pounds , black hair and black eyes .
He is reportedly driving a silver four - door Mercury Mariner sport utility with California license number 6CJU602 .
Santa Clara Police can be reached at 408-615-4700 if anyone encounters the suspect .
Linh Nguyen , a mechanical engineer who works next door at Excel Precision reported : " I was on the computer and a co-worker was going home , and we heard a commotion .
People were running into our building , strangers .
I do n't know who they were but they were very upset , they looked disturbed and then we heard that three people had been shot .
We locked the doors and waited . "
The company has removed their management page from their company website but Google cache has it here .

Finance and Tech News from around the globe .
So other than being addled from an unspeakable habit , a little smelly and a touch on the amazingly obese scale , I was good to go .
Ready to star in one of those car commercials where the kids crack wise in the backseat while the dad says something sage and knowing into the rearview .
Except I did n’t have a car .
And the kids did not legally belong to me .
I had never married their mother or established my paternity .
I had no insurance , and I had not paid taxes in several years .
Although Anna has always given me abundant credit for doing a good job with our twins , she is quick to remind me that I stole them in the first place .
A part of me was convinced she was right .
Revisiting the issue with Barbara , I talked about how we managed to persuade Anna to take a drug test when she moved back from Texas , where she had been staying with her mom .
We made visitation conditional on a clean result , and she came up positive for cocaine and pot .
I remembered this as a clever linchpin in our legal strategy , but Barbara reminded me that Anna had failed that test over and over and that she moved in with a dope dealer when she got to town .
How she missed appointments to see the kids , missed court dates , switched lawyers and eventually agreed to a settlement that gave me physical custody of the girls .
History suggests that things turned out as they should have , but Anna ’s suggestion that I was not the obvious choice as the twins ’ custodial parent found significant traction when I went back and looked at the record .
I had won a tallest - midget contest with Anna , nothing more .
Each of us had a history of relapse , and mine was far more extensive .
The lie that I told myself  that I was made entirely new by my decision to lay off drugs  kept doubt at bay .
If I really examined my fitness in all of its dimensions , I would have been paralyzed .
It was a fairy tale that kept me alive and allowed me to make it come true .
Everything good and true about my life started on the day the twins became mine .
When a woman , any woman , has issues with substances , has kids out of wedlock and ends up struggling as a single parent , she is identified by many names : slut , loser , welfare mom , burden on society .
Take those same circumstances and array them over a man , and he becomes a crown prince .
See him doing that dad thing and , with a flick of the wrist , the mom thing too !
Why is it that the same series of overt acts committed by a male becomes somehow ennobled ?
I ’m not saying that raising children , especially by yourself , is a trip to Turks and Caicos , but single parenting is as old as reproduction .
Families declare themselves in all sorts of versions , and ours happened to be two adorable toddlers stapled to 250 pounds of large , white male .
Still , people who knew our circumstance marveled at its idiosyncrasy .
And people who knew me before the twins wondered all the more .
I had no idea what I was doing , but children teach you how to care for them .
Leave the house without an extra diaper , and they will have some brutal , smelly event at a McDonald’s .
Let them wheedle their way into your bed so you can get some rest , and you will be fighting them off every single night of their young lives .
Gradually , slowly , the three of us developed a routine at bedtime , with baths , prayers and stories  stuff I had been brought up on or seen on TV .
As we spent more time together , they began to know me , and I came to adore them  madly , deeply , truly .
We developed other rituals .
When it came time to actually turn out the light , I would sing a song of my own making .
The Army says it wants to build what could be the world 's most powerful solar power plant , as part of a far - reaching effort to cut back on the service 's dependence on fossil fuels .
The question is whether the Army will actually make good on its green promises .
Currently , the most powerful photovoltaic array in the country is at Nellis Air Force Base , outside of Las Vegas .
It generates about 15 megawatts of power .
Other plants are in the works in New Mexico , Arizona and California that could produce up to 300 megawatts .
Yesterday , the Army declared that it would " partner with the private sector to construct a 500 - megawatt solar thermal plant at Fort Irwin , California , in the Mojave
Desert , that will provide renewable power on the grid and provide the sprawling Army post with added energy security against disruption of power supply . "
The U.S. military has been making all sorts of bold declarations in recent years about the need to wean itself from fossil fuels .
It is " imperative " that the Department of Defense " apply new energy technologies that address alternative supply sources and efficient consumption across all aspects of military operations , " thundered one Pentagon report .
" Effectively immediately , "
shouted another , Pentagon planners must factor in " energy efficiency "
when designing " all tactical systems . "
That 's because the Defense
Department is not only one of the world 's largest consumers of oil and gas — slurping up " 110 million barrels of premium fuel and 3.8
billion kilowatts of electricity at a cost of $ 13.6 billion , " as * Defense News * notes .
But the stuff is ridiculously expensive : War - zone fuel prices can reach up to $ 400 per gallon .
The military 's record of answering those clarion calls has been uneven , however .
For every promising , isolated effort — wind - powered bases , garbage - munching generators in Baghdad — there have been disappointments , too .
Long - promised hybrid Humvees never materialized .
" Urgent " pleas from battlefield commanders for green power stations were negged by the Pentagon brass .
In a statement , the Army claims this effort will be different , because it 's putting in place a " Senior Energy Council to serve as a board of directors focusing on Army energy policy , programs and funding to leverage the Army 's nationwide energy - conservation efforts . "
The service also announced a number of " test " programs that the new council will oversee .
There 's the solar plant at Fort Irwin .
A
" geothermal project at Hawthorne Army Depot , Nevada , with the capability of producing 30 megawatts of clean power . "
Six more posts that will experiment with " biomass to fuel " efforts .
And the purchase of 4,000
electric vehicles " to replace gasoline - powered vehicles traditionally used by maintenance and operations staff for use on its posts . "
Whether any of these projects will actually be completed — or whether they add up to any kind of coherent alt - power , alt - fuel strategy — remains to be seen .
UPDATE : Check out Wired Science 's fascinating look at a whole new kind of solar array .
UPDATE 2 : As RK notes , Pacific Gas and Electric recently announced contracts for 800 megawatts of solar energy – including a 550 megawatt " solar farm " in San Luis Obispo County , California .
It 's slated to be on line by 2013 .
Take that , Army !

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - U.S. retailers ’ sales fell as much as 4 percent during the holiday season , as the weak economy and bad weather created one of the worst holiday shopping climates in modern times , according to data released on Thursday by SpendingPulse .
Last minute holiday shoppers walk past a sign at a retail establishment that has slashed prices by as much as 70 percent , in San Francisco , California December 24 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Robert Galbraith
The figures , from the retail data service of MasterCard Advisors , show the 2008 holiday shopping season was the weakest in decades , as U.S. consumers cut spending as they confront a yearlong recession , mounting job losses and tighter credit .
“ It ’s probably one of the most challenging holiday seasons we ’ve ever had in modern times , ” said Michael McNamara , vice president of Research and Analysis at MasterCard Advisors .
“ We had a very difficult economic environment .
Weather patterns were not favorable toward the end of season , and that resulted in one of the most challenging economic seasons we ’ve seen in decades . ”
The figures exclude auto and gas sales but include grocery , restaurant and specialty food sales .
Although SpendingPulse did not exempt the food prices , McNamara said the decline would have been steeper without them .
“ There ’s a lot of food that provide a buffer for the total retail sales numbers , ” he said .
SpendingPulse tracks sales activity in the MasterCard Inc payments network and couples that with estimates for all other payment forms , including cash and checks .
It has been tracking holiday spending figures since 2002 .
Exact comparisons beyond that year are difficult because of changes in measurements .
The holiday shopping season typically runs from the day after U.S. Thanksgiving , which occurs on the fourth Thursday of November , until Christmas Eve .
But this year Thanksgiving was a week later than last year .
To benchmark a comparison , SpendingPulse measured the season from November 1 through December 24 .
Sales fell 2 percent in November and 4 percent from December 1 through December 24 , according to SpendingPulse .
The holiday sales season can account for up to 40 percent of a retailer ’s annual revenue .
Sales at specialty apparel retailers like Gap Inc and Abercrombie & Fitch Co fell 19.7 percent this year , Spending Pulse said .
When factoring in department store results , sales fell about 20 percent , McNamara said .
Women ’s apparel sales fell 22.7 percent ; men ’s clothing sales were off 14.3 percent , and footwear sales fell 13.5 percent , Spending Pulse said .
This year , the higher the price , the more consumers did without , Spending Pulse said .
Sales at specialty electronics and appliance chains such as Best Buy Co Inc fell 26.7 percent , it said .
Luxury sales , which include sales at high - end department stores , leather goods boutiques , pricier jewelry stores and restaurants , fell 34.5 percent , Spending Pulse said .
Excluding jewelry , sales fell 21.2 percent .
“ There ’s a much different bonus environment , especially in New York and the financial services industry , ” McNamara said , of the traditional luxury good customer base .
“ But also , the deteriorating employment figures across multiple industries across the country look like they ’re having a more significant impact at the higher end , ” he said .
Online sales benefited from the bad weather seen in the northern United States within the last two weeks of the season .
E - commerce sales ended down 2.3 percent , but rose 1.8 percent in the final two weeks of the holiday season .
Nearly all retailers -- from department stores such as Macy ’s Inc and J.C. Penney Co Inc to specialty apparel chains like Aeropostale Inc and AnnTaylor Stores Corp -- offered aggressive discounts this holiday season to lure reticent shoppers .
SpendingPulse results do not include the post - Christmas spending activity , which has been growing with the popularity of gift cards that are typically redeemed after Christmas and post - holiday sales .

When a Colorado emergency room nurse fell gravely ill after treating a gas field worker , doctors struggled to figure out what was wrong with her .
Her liver , heart and lungs were failing , probably a result of inhaling ZetaFlow -- a substance used in natural - gas drilling -- from the patient ’s boots .
But doctors could find little treatment information in the medical texts or on the Internet because the fluid ’s formulation is a closely guarded trade secret .
“ Nobody knew exactly where to go , ” said nurse Cathy Behr , 56 , who since has recovered .
New regulations adopted this month to govern Colorado ’s booming oil and gas industry aim to make future incidents easier to handle by , among other things , requiring companies to disclose to doctors and emergency workers the ingredients they use .

Regarded as the most comprehensive in the country , the rules have been hailed by some as providing much - needed protections for the wildlife and environment , but they are assailed by others as punitive -- and potentially crippling -- for an industry critical to Colorado ’s economy .
“ We think these are the right regulations for Colorado , ” said Dave Neslin , acting director of the state ’s Oil and Gas Conservation Commission .
“ The oil and gas industry . . . has a large footprint within the state .
We think these rules strike an appropriate and sustainable balance . ”
The requirements come as Colorado is struggling to keep pace with a significant energy boom .
A decade ago , state officials issued 1,000 drilling permits per year ; this year , they are on pace to issue more than 7,600 , Neslin said .
The regulations :

Create a 300 - foot - wide protection zone around streams that provide drinking water .
Require operators to disclose information about their chemicals to emergency responders and physicians , although the information may not be released publicly .
Require emission controls on operations within a quarter of a mile of schools and homes in northwestern Colorado .
Allow state health and wildlife officials to review and provide input on applications for operations that could affect public health or wildlife habitat .

The Colorado Oil and Gas Assn. , an industry trade group , regards that last rule as particularly onerous .
“ As a result . . . this process becomes the most burdensome in the nation , ” said John Swartout , vice president of government and legislative affairs for the association .
Swartout said it already takes longer to apply for a permit in Colorado than in other gas - and oil - producing states -- an average of 65 days here , compared with two to seven days in other states .
Neslin acknowledged the process takes too long because commission staffing levels have n’t kept pace with the growing number of permits .

“ We face particular challenges here in Colorado , ” including drilling in areas of important wildlife habitat , he said .
“ In Colorado , it would be difficult to do a thorough review in two or three days . ”
The new regulatory climate could dissuade companies from operating in Colorado , Swartout warned .
“ You ’re going to see a significant drop in investment in the Rocky Mountains .
That equates to a loss of jobs in our state -- good - paying jobs with healthcare and benefits , ” he said .
Several Republican state lawmakers have echoed that concern , saying they intend to push for modifications to the rules .
“ We cannot afford to push the energy industry out of Colorado , given the current state of the economy , ” Colorado House Minority Leader Mike May told the Denver Post .
“ And many fear that the proposed rules will do just that . ”

Environmentalists counter that tourism is a far more important industry in Colorado and that it makes sense to protect the natural assets that draw visitors to the state .
Hunting , fishing and outdoor recreation “ are contingent on an environment that ’s thriving , ” said Pam Kiely , legislative director for Environment Colorado .
The argument that the rules will contribute to a worsening economy is flawed , said Elise Jones , executive director of the Colorado Environmental Coalition .
“ What affects the oil and gas industry is really the price of natural gas , which is set on the national market , ” Jones said .
“ It ’s influenced by things that have nothing to do with whether they have to line waste pits . ”
The White House and Congress are near a bailout for the “ Big Three ” auto manufacturers with a $ 15 billion loans .
This is supposed to be a bridge loan to tide them over until the market improves .
Will the market improve enough to pay back the loan or is this a bridge to nowhere ?
Daimler - Benz wrote Chrysler off their books and sold 80 % of Chrysler to Cerberus .
Cerberus is one of the largest private equity investment firms in the US with total assists over $ 24 billion , yet they lack the faith to make a loan to their own company .
Bankruptcy is still the best tool for restructuring any failing industry !
Business cycles are a necessary part of any free market economy .
Old industries and models must be replaced by new industries and ideas .
This requires a shift in both human and material resources .
New industries require new skills .
The government can best facilitate such a shift by easing reemployment of the workforce through realistic unemployment payments , education , investment in sustainable research and industry and a national health plan .
Healthcare , and pensions are a big part the Big Three ’s problem .
For every dollar paid as wages , more are spent on benefits for retired employees .
Portability of health and welfare with affordable housing can increase mobility of the workforce .
Government should not try to pick winner in the market place .
Old industry and models become entrenched into the government through lobbyist , influence pedaling , and just inertia .

Chrysler rose from the ashes of Maxwell Motors in 1915 by performance and safety innovations .
It was reborn in the late ’ 70 .
After suffering loses from Dodge and Plymouth , Chrysler hired Lee Iaccoca , the former Ford CEO , who had been fired by Henry Ford II over his plain to market compacts .
While Iaccoca got government backing for loans , changes at Chrysler were well underway .
He hired fellow renegades from Ford .
The K - car , Omni , and Horizon are automotive history .
It ’s been said that going to the moon was successful since it was a well - defined goal .
Our primary goal should be greater than any particular market .
It must represent a broad set of outcomes .
We stand on a technological threshold – a world industrial revolution .
Technology offers glimpses of an abundant future , but it offers warnings .
In the Great Depression many sat around asking , “ How can this be happening , when everyday we hear news of astonishing inventions ? ”
Change is coming .
How we handle it matters .
The bad side of business cycles is vicious circles such as unemployment - consumption .
Our goals must be global .
They must sustain individuals materially and spiritually by giving them realistic hope and opportunity .
These goals must be well defined and they must consider the whole .
The type of cars that we will be driving must be part of an integrated global energy policy .
For example , cars with rechargeable batteries can take power at anytime from the electric grid thus increasing the effectiveness of wind energy that is intermittent .
Cars should be one apart of our transportation .
Mass transit must be another .
Panic got us into the Iraqi War .
Good planning prevents panic .

An inflammatory article published by Richard Bennett in The Register makes the claim ' BitTorrent will kill the Internet ' , or at least VoIP and games .
However , are Bennett 's claims based in reality , or is it just another round in the FUD war that envelops the Internet ?
A lot of buzz around the net today has been generated by Richard Bennett , with his article “ BitTorrent declares war on VoIP , gamers ” .
There ’s just one problem with it – it ’s utter rubbish .
We ’ve mentioned Richard Bennett before , he was at the FCC hearing back in February , dealing with the Comcast - Sandvine issue .
At the time , as we noted , he made the statement “ If we ca n’t control network management , we ’ll have to shut down the Internet ” .
With uTorrent ’s new transfer protocol ( uTP ) that ’s currently being tested in an early Alpha release of the BitTorrent client , Bennett sees another potential threat .
In his article , a doom scenario is painted where the Internet may collapse , even though uTorrent ’s uTP is intended to reduce network congestion .
Thankfully , the readers at The Register are a little more diligent in their fact - checking , and pointed out that many of his statements were inaccurate , or simply flat - out ridiculous .
Statements like “ UDP was intended for real - time data transfers such as VoIP ” and “ Bulk data transfers are supposed to use TCP , in large part because it shoulders the burden of congestion control for the Internet ’s end - to - end layer ” , for example , are simply not true .
It is highly unlikely that when UDP was conceived , that VoIP was in the forefront of anyone ’s minds .
There is also nothing anywhere that can be found that states bulk data transfer is ‘ supposed ’ to use TCP over UDP .
It is preferred to use TCP , because if you ’re transferring a lot of data , you want it to be intact .
BitTorrent , however , uses several relatively small transfers , and has its own data checking system in place .
It does n’t need TCP ’s delivery control as well .
uTorrent Community Manager ‘ Firon ’ explained to TorrentFreak : “ We are using UDP for uTP because it is the only way to provide our own congestion control mechanism .
It is designed to better react to changing network conditions and throttle itself back , even with other TCP connections active , such as the user doing video streaming or VoIP while torrenting . ”
The BitTorrent protocol also has a handshake for P2P communications , so using UDP just removes a duplicate connection handshake .
Thus , in many ways , the move to UDP actually reduces traffic , hardly the way to cripple the net .
Bennett also made some other questionable statements , such as “ Upset about Bell Canada ’s system for allocating bandwidth fairly among Internet users , the developers of the uTorrent P2P application have decided to make the UDP protocol the default transport protocol for file transfers . ”
However , the truth is quite different .
“ uTP is not a response to Bell Canada , ” said Firon .
“ It ’s been in the works for a long time , since technically , since Ludde ( Ludvig Strigeus , the original coder of uTorrent ) was working on it . ”
In response to concerns from other client developers , Firon mentioned that the specs for uTP will eventually be open .
So , perhaps in time when all clients use this – and the Internet does n’t crash and burn – fearmongers like Bennett be ignored .
Of course , had Bennett any serious concerns he , like any of us , would probably have contacted someone at BitTorrent Inc. to express their concern .
“ No , he has n’t contacted anyone , ” said Firon , “ that ’s why his article is so blatantly wrong .
It is disappointing that his only interest was sensationalism . ”

When my mother arrived in England as a refugee from Nazi Germany , shortly before the outbreak of World War II , she found the people admirable , though not without the defects that corresponded to their virtues .
By the time she died , two - thirds of a century later , she found them rude , dishonest , and charmless .
They did not seem to her , moreover , to have any virtues to compensate for their unpleasant qualities .
I occasionally asked her to think of some , but she could n’t ; and neither , frankly , could I .
It was n’t simply that she had been robbed twice during her last five years , having never been the victim of a crime before — experiences that , at so advanced an age , would surely change anyone ’s opinion of one ’s fellow citizens .
Few things are more despicable , after all , or more indicative of moral nihilism , than a willingness to prey upon the old and frail .
No , even before she was robbed she had noticed that a transvaluation of all values seemed to have taken place in her adopted land .
The human qualities that people valued and inculcated when she arrived had become mocked , despised , and repudiated by the time she died .
The past really was a foreign country ; and they did do things differently there .
What , exactly , were the qualities that my mother had so admired ?
Above all , there was the people ’s manner .
The British seemed to her self - contained , self - controlled , law - abiding yet tolerant of others no matter how eccentric , and with a deeply ironic view of life that encouraged them to laugh at themselves and to appreciate their own unimportance in the scheme of things .
If Horace Walpole was right — that the world is a comedy to those who think and a tragedy to those who feel — the English were the most thoughtful people in the world .
They were polite and considerate , not pushy or boastful ; the self - confident took care not to humiliate the shy or timid ; and even the most accomplished was aware that his achievements were a drop in the ocean of possibility , and might have been much greater if he had tried harder or been more talented .
Those characteristics had undoubted drawbacks .
They could lead to complacency and philistinism , for if the world was a comedy , nothing was serious .
They could easily slide into arrogance : the rest of the world can teach us nothing .
The literary archetype of such arrogance was Mr. Podsnap in Dickens ’s Our Mutual Friend , a man convinced that all that was British was best , and who “ had even acquired a peculiar flourish of his right arm in often clearing the world of its most difficult problems , by sweeping them behind him . ”
Still , taken all in all , my mother found the British culture of the day possessed of a deep and seductive , if subtle and by no means transparent or obvious , charm .
My mother was not alone .
André Maurois , the great French Anglophile , for example , wrote a classic text about British character , Les silences du Colonel Bramble .
Maurois was a translator and liaison officer between the French and British armies during World War I and lived closely for many months with British officers and their men .
Les silences was the fruit of his observations .
Maurois found the British combination of social self - confidence and existential modesty attractive .
It was then a common French opinion that the British were less intelligent than the French ; and in the book , Maurois ’ fictional alter ego , Aurelle , discusses the matter with one of the British officers .
“ ‘ Do n’t you yourself find , ’ said Major Parker , ‘ that intelligence is valued by you at more than its worth ?
We are like the young Persians of whom Herodotus speaks , and who , until the age of twenty , learnt only three things : how to ride , archery and not to lie . ’ ”
Aurelle spots the paradox : “ You despise the academic , ” he replies , “ and you quote Herodotus .
Even better , I caught you the other day in flagrante , reading Xenophon .
. . .
Very few French , I assure you . . . ”
Parker quickly disavows any intellectual virtue in his choice of citations or reading matter .
“ That ’s very different , ” he says .
“ The Greeks and Romans interest us , not as an object of enquiry , but as our ancestors and as sportsmen .
I like Xenophon — he is the perfect example of a British gentleman . ”
Forty years later , in 1959 , another French writer , Tony Mayer , in his short book La vie anglaise , noticed the reluctance of the English to draw attention to their accomplishments , to blow their own trumpets : “ Conversation still plays an important role in England .
They speak a lot , but in general they say nothing .
As it is bad form to mention personal or professional matters which could lead to discussion , they prefer to speak in generalities . ”
The Franco - Romanian playwright Eugène Ionesco brilliantly parodied this tendency in his La cantatrice chauve ( The Bald Soprano ) , in which a respectable English couple has a long conversation at a dinner party .
At the end , after many pages of utter banalities , they realize that they are actually married , and have been for a long time .
Appearances in Britain could deceive .
The British , after all , despised intellectuals , but were long at the forefront of intellectual inquiry ; they were philistines , yet created a way of life in the countryside as graceful as any that has ever existed ; they had a state religion , but came to find religious enthusiasm bad form .
Mayer comments :
Even in the most ordinary places and circumstances , an accident happens .
You hit by chance upon a subject that you have long studied ; you go as far as allowing your interest in it to show .
And suddenly you realize that your interlocutor — so reserved , so polite — not only knows a hundred times more about this subject than you , but about an infinite number of other subjects as well .
This attractive modesty mixed also with a mild perfidy ( this is la perfide Albion we are talking of , after all ) : irony , understatement , and double meaning were everywhere , waiting to trap the unwary foreigner .
The British lived as if they had taken to heart the lines of America ’s greatest poet ( who , not coincidentally , lived her whole life in New England ) :
Tell all the Truth but tell it slant
Success in Circuit lies . . .
The habit of indirection in speech , combined with probity of action , gave English life its savor and its interest .
Mayer provided a brief interpretive key for the unwary :
I may be wrong — I am absolutely sure .
I do n’t know much about — I am a specialist in .
No trouble at all — What a burden !
We must keep in touch — Good - bye forever .
Must you go ?
— At last !
Not too bad — Absolutely wonderful .
The orderliness and restraint of political life in Britain also struck my refugee mother .
The British leaders were not giants among men but — much more important for someone fleeing Nazi Germany — they were not brutes , either .
They were civilized men ; the nearest they came to the exercise of arbitrary power was a sense of noblesse oblige , and the human breast is capable of far worse sentiments .
Politics was , to them and the voters , only part of life , and by no means the most important .
Maurois’ Dr. O’Grady describes to Aurelle what he calls “ the safety - valve of parliament ” : “ From now on , elected champions have our riots and coups d’état for us in the chamber , which leaves the rest of the nation the leisure to play cricket . ”
Major Parker takes up the theme , also addressing Aurelle : “ What good has it done you French to change government eight times in a century ?
The riot for you has become a national institution .
In England it would be impossible to make a revolution .
If people gathered near Westminster shouting slogans , a policeman would tell them to go away and they would go . ”
Many remarked upon the gentleness of British behavior in public .
Homicidal violence and street robberies were vanishingly rare .
But it was n’t only in the absence of crime that the gentleness made itself felt .
British pastimes were peaceful and reflective : gardening and the keeping of pigeons , for example .
Vast sporting crowds would gather in such good order that sporting events resembled church meetings , as both George Orwell and anthropologist Geoffrey Gorer ( writing in 1955 ) noted .
Newsreels of the time reinforce the point .
The faces of people in sports crowds did not contort in hatred , snarling and screaming , but were peaceful and good - humored , if a little pinched and obviously impoverished .
The crowds were almost self - regulating ; as late as the early sixties , the British read with incredulity reports that , on the Continent , wire barriers , police baton charges , and tear gas were often necessary to control crowds .
Incidents of crowd misbehavior in Britain were so unusual that when one did happen , it caused a sensation .
The English must have been the only people in the world for whom a typical response to someone who accidentally stepped on one ’s toes was to apologize oneself .
British behavior when ill or injured was stoic .
Aurelle recounts in Les silences du Colonel Bramble seeing an officer he knew on a stretcher , obviously near death from a terrible abdominal injury .
The officer says to him : “ Please say good - bye to the colonel for me and ask him to write home that I did n’t suffer too much .
I hope this is not too much trouble for you .
Thanks very much indeed . ”
Tony Mayer , too , says of the English that when they were ill they usually apologized : “ I ’m sorry to bother you , Doctor . ”
No culture changes suddenly , and the elderly often retained the attitudes of their youth .
I remember working for a short time in a general practice in a small country town where an old man called me to his house .
I found him very weak from chronic blood loss , unable to rise from his bed , and asked him why he had not called me earlier .
“ I did n’t like to disturb you , Doctor , ” he said .
“ I know you are a very busy man . ”
From a rational point of view , this was absurd .
What could I possibly need to do that was more important than attending to such an ill man ?
But I found his self - effacement deeply moving .
It was not the product of a lack of self - esteem , that psychological notion used to justify rampant egotism ; nor was it the result of having been downtrodden by a tyrannical government that accorded no worth to its citizens .
It was instead an existential , almost religious , modesty , an awareness that he was far from being all - important .
I experienced other instances of this modesty .
I used to pass the time of day with the husband of an elderly patient of mine who would accompany her to the hospital .
One day , I found him so jaundiced that he was almost orange .
At his age , it was overwhelmingly likely to mean one thing : inoperable cancer .
He was dying .
He knew it and I knew it ; he knew that I knew it .
I asked him how he was .
“ Not very well , ” he said .
“ I ’m very sorry to hear that , ” I replied .
“ Well , ” he said quietly , and with a slight smile , “ we shall just have to do the best we can , wo n’t we ? ”
Two weeks later , he was dead .
I often remember the nobility of this quite ordinary man ’s conduct and words .
He wanted an appropriate , but only an appropriate , degree of commiseration from me ; in his view , which was that of his generation and culture , it was a moral requirement that emotion and sentiment should be expressed proportionately , and not in an exaggerated or self - absorbed way .
My acquaintance with him was slight ; therefore my regret , while genuine , should be slight .
( Oddly enough , my regret has grown over the years , with the memory . )
Further , he considered it important that he should not embarrass me with any displays of emotion that might discomfit me .
A man has to think of others , even when he is dying .
My wife , also a doctor , worked solely among the old , and found them , as I did , considerate even when suffering , as well as humorous and lacking in self - importance .
Her patients were largely working - class — a refutation of the idea , commonly expressed , that the cultural ideal that I have described characterized only the upper echelons of society .
Gradually , but overwhelmingly , the culture and character of British restraint have changed into the exact opposite .
Extravagance of gesture , vehemence of expression , vainglorious boastfulness , self - exposure , and absence of inhibition are what we tend to admire now — and the old modesty is scorned .
It is as if the population became convinced of Blake ’s fatuous dictum that it is better to strangle a baby in the cradle than to let a desire remain unacted upon .
Certainly , many Britons under the age of 30 or even 40 now embrace a kind of sub- psychotherapeutic theory that desires , if not unleashed , will fester within and eventually manifest themselves in dangerous ways .
To control oneself for the sake of the social order , let alone for dignity or decorum ( a word that would either mean nothing to the British these days , or provoke peals of laughter ) , is thus both personally and socially harmful .
I have spoken with young British people who regularly drink themselves into oblivion , passing first through a prolonged phase of public nuisance .
To a man ( and woman ) , they believe that by doing so , they are getting rid of inhibitions that might otherwise do them psychological and even physical harm .
The same belief seems universal among those who spend hours at soccer games screaming abuse and making threatening gestures ( whose meaning many would put into practice , were those events not policed in military fashion ) .
Lack of self - control is just as character - forming as self - control : but it forms a different , and much worse and shallower , character .
Further , once self - control becomes neither second nature nor a desired goal , but rather a vice to avoid at all costs , there is no plumbing the depths to which people will sink .
The little town where I now live when in England transforms by night .
By day , it is delightful ; I live in a Queen Anne house that abuts a charming Elizabethan cottage near church grounds that look as if they materialized from an Anthony Trollope novel .
By night , however , the average age of the person on the street drops from 60 to 20 , with few older people venturing out .
Charm and delight vanish .
Not long ago , the neighborhood awoke to the sound of a young man nearly kicked to death by other young men , all of whom had spilled forth from a pub at 2 am .
The driver of a local car service , who does only prearranged pickups , tells me that it is now normal ( in the statistical sense ) for young women to emerge from the bars and try to entice him to drive them home by baring their breasts , even pushing them against his windows if for some reason he has to stop in town .
I laughed when hearing this , but in essence it is not funny .
The driver was talking not about an isolated transgressor of customs but about a whole manner of cultural comportment .
By no means coincidentally , the young British find themselves hated , feared , and despised throughout Europe , wherever they gather to have what they call “ a good time . ”
They turn entire Greek , Spanish , and Turkish resorts into B-movie Sodoms and Gomorrahs .
They cover sidewalks with vomit , rape one another , and indulge in casual drunken violence .
In one Greek resort , 12 young British women were arrested recently after indulging in “ an outdoor oral sex competition . ”
No person with the slightest apprehension of human psychology will be surprised to learn that as a consequence of this change in character , indictable crime has risen at least 900 percent since 1950 .
In the same period , the homicide rate has doubled — and would have gone up ten times , had it not been for improvements in trauma surgery and resuscitation techniques .
And all this despite the fact that the proportion of the population in the age group most likely to commit crimes has fallen considerably .
Two things are worth noting about this shift in national character : it is not the first such shift in British history ; and the change is not entirely spontaneous or the result of impersonal social forces .
Before the English and British became known for self - restraint and an ironic detachment from life , they had a reputation for high emotionalism and an inability to control their passions .
The German poet Heinrich Heine , among others , detested them as violent and vulgar .
It was only during the reign of William IV — “ Silly Billy , ” the king before Victoria — that they transformed into something approaching the restrained people whom I encountered as a child and sometimes as a doctor .
The main difference between the vulgar people whom Heine detested and the people loathed and feared throughout Europe ( and beyond ) today is that the earlier Britons often possessed talent and genius , and in some sense stood in the forefront of human endeavor ; we cannot say that of the British now .
But the second point is also important .
The moralization of the British in the first third of the nineteenth century — their transformation from a people lacking self - control into exemplars of restraint — was the product of intellectual and legislative activity .
So , too , was the reverse movement .
Consider in this light public drunkenness .
For 100 years or more in Britain , the popular view was that such drunkenness was reprehensible and the rightful object of repression .
( My heart leaps with joy when I see in France a public notice underscoring the provisions of the law “ for the suppression of public drunkenness . ” )
Several changes then came : officials halved the tax on alcohol ; intellectuals attacked the idea of self - restraint , making it culturally unacceptable ; universities unapologetically began to advertise themselves as places where students could get drunk often and regularly ; and finally , the government , noting that drunkenness was dramatically increasing , claimed that increasing the hours of availability of alcohol would encourage a more responsible , “ Mediterranean ” drinking culture , in which people would sip slowly , rather than gulp fast .
It is difficult not to suspect also the role of financial inducements to politicians in all this , for even they could hardly be so stupid .
Habits become character .
Perhaps they should n’t , but they do .
Therefore , when I hear that some American states seek to lower the drinking age from 21 to 18 , on the grounds that it is absurd that an 18 - year - old can join the army and die for his country but not drink a beer in a public bar , I experience a strong reaction .
It is a more important goal of government to uphold civilization than to find a general principle that will iron out all the apparent inconsistencies of the current dispensation .
Not long ago , I attended the graduation of a friend ’s son at an upstate New York university .
The night before , and the night after , I observed the students through the windows of their frat houses getting drunk .
They were behaving in a silly way , but they were not causing a public nuisance because they did not dare to step out of their houses .
If they did , the local police would arrest them ; or , if not , the university authorities would catch them and suspend them .
( This , incidentally , is powerful evidence that drunks do know what they are doing and that the law is absolutely right not to accept drunkenness as a negation of mens rea . )
No doubt the student drunkenness in the frat houses was unsatisfactory from an abstract point of view ; but from the point of view of upholding civilization , to say nothing of the quality of life of the townspeople , it was all highly satisfactory .
In England , that town would have been a nightmare at night that no decent person would have wanted to be out in .
So I say to Americans : if you want your young people to develop character , have the courage of your inconsistencies !
Excoriate sin , especially in public places , but turn a blind eye to it when necessary — as it often is .
Games That Defined The History of the PlayStation ( PS1 )

The Sony PlayStation essentially came out of nowhere in the mid 1990 ’s to take on both Nintendo and Sega in the heated console wars .
With some impressive technology , ease of development and a heavy marketing budget behind them , Sony rallied a number of the best game developers in the industry to create a powerhouse library of games – many of which laid a solid foundation for generations to come .
( See our technical comparison of the Sony Playstation vs the N64 and the Sega Saturn for more info )
This overview of the PS1 takes a look at the games that made the largest impact on the industry at the time and gave the Playstation its unique personality while overcoming its opponents ( as opposed to a standard list of “ the best ” PS1 games ) .
If you want to learn more about the actual Playstation hardware history , library , accessories , and how it fits into a retro gaming lifestyle today , check out our Playstation 101 Beginners Guide .
Due to the size of this article and the variety of games discussed , it quickly became a group project .
While Ack and I led this project , there were also many contributions from Daniel Primed , The Apprentice , Radarscope1 , Niode , Fastbilly1 , and BulletMagnet .
Thanks to all for their contributions and I hope everyone enjoys the results !
Final Fantasy Series
Before Sony made the bold move of taking on Sega and Nintendo in the ultra - competitive gaming industry , Sony had partnered with Nintendo to develop a CD add - on for the Super Nintendo .
After Nintendo breached the contract and ultimately decided to ditch the CD format , Sony decided to create the PlayStation on their own and make Nintendo regret their decision .
In addition to a new competitor in Sony , Nintendo suffered from the loss of Squaresoft as premier third party publisher .
Square , angry about Nintendo ’s decision to go with the cartridge format instead of CD , dropped all connections with the company and instead began producing titles exclusively for the PlayStation , including their beloved Final Fantasy series .
As the first Final Fantasy game to be presented in three dimensions , Final Fantasy VII was a milestone in the RPG genre .
For many impressionable youths in this new gaming generation , it was an introduction to the genre and was an early showcase of what could be done with computer generated cut - scenes and story - telling .
Even though it may not have been the greatest Final Fantasy in terms of game mechanics , it is definitely high on the food chain in terms of iconic characters and experiences from the 32 - bit era .
The PlayStation would also see highly - anticipated releases of Final Fantasy VIII and Final Fantasy IX – each of which was met with rave reviews and tremendous sales .
Final Fantasy VII finished up with 9.8 million copies worldwide and the sequels followed up with 6 million and 5.08 million respectively .
Final Fantasy VIII and IX really showed Square ’s growth in using high - quality music and graphics for storytelling .
The length of the games was also quite impressive .
Final Fantasy VII spanned multiple discs at it ’s release in 1997 in Japan , just over two years after the release of the console , using disc space to put 3D rendered characters on pre-rendered backgrounds , as well as featuring 3D combat and pre-rendered cut scenes .
Final Fantasy VIII and IX took it a step further by filling up four CDs each .
Indeed , the quality of CG would make Square even more famous then it had been after its success with Nintendo ’s previous consoles .
When the book was closed on these blockbusters , the huge revenue stream helped fund the company ’s attempts at breaking into other game genres .
While Square would not see nearly as much success in these areas , the games did endear more fans to the company , leading some to speculate that Squaresoft alone could pick which console would win the generation wars .

Metal Gear Solid
Hideo Kojima ’s career - spanning series , Metal Gear , broke into super - stardom on PlayStation with Metal Gear Solid .
Selling over 7 million copies during its lifespan , the game would become on of the highest selling games in the 32 - bit generation .
Of course , it also was the beginning of a franchise that would help sell millions PS2s and PS3s for years to come .
Metal Gear Solid ’s success comes as little surprise as it brought movie - like cut scenes , an incredible cast of characters , bizarre secrets , incredible audio , and more stealth action than one could shake a stick at .
The game mechanics came as such a pleasant surprise to mainstream gamers that Metal Gear Solid is often credited as having created the popularizing the Stealth genre that is now filled with many blockbuster titles .
Of course , what more could be expected from a title whose designers were out to “ literally make the best PlayStation game ever ” .
And despite some criticisms about the short length of the title , the constant cut scenes , and how easy it was to avoid enemies , some gamers could argue they did it , or at least came close .
Looking back at the 32 - bit era , it ’s easy to see that many of the early 3D games do n’t age especially well when compared to their newer counterparts .
However , Metal Gear Solid seems to be one of the few exceptions to the rule .
Kojima and Company did an outstanding job making use of the PlayStation ’s capabilities and made sure to push the limits of the things that matter most in the long - term : gameplay and story .
Even though the game was remade on the Gamecube , it is still strongly recommended that one play the original version of this classic on the PlayStation .

Crash Bandicoot Series
Originally created by famed developers , Naughty Dog , the Crash Bandicoot series would see five releases on the PlayStation before going multi-platform in 2001 .
While the Crash series has seen 14 titles , with over 20 million games sold worldwide , the PlayStation era yielded the largest impact .
Crash had a couple of things going for it during the 32 - bit era .
First of all , as Sony was trying to make its mark in the gaming industry , it unofficially embraced Crash as it ’s mascot – much like Nintendo ’s Mario and Sega ’s Sonic characters .
Just as Sega of America ’s advertising campaigns went down the tubes , Sony was airing numerous commercials featuring a guy in a giant Crash Bandicoot suit that seemed like something that the cutting - edge Sega would have run in the Genesis days ( including ones where Crash challenged Mario to a fight ) .
In addition to the advertising campaigns , Crash Bandicoot was one of the first 3D platforming games that were worth playing .
Sure , it was n’t quite as smooth or expansive as the revolutionary Super Mario 64 ( which came out just before Crash Bandicoot ) , but it was a leap above most of the rest of the competition – especially on the PlayStation .
The series would see annual releases up until 2000 , with the second and third games , Crash Bandicoot 2 : Cortex Strikes Back and Crash Bandicoot 3 : Warped , being released in 1997 and 1998 respectively .
Both continued being platformers , though introduced major changes for the better .
Indeed , Crash 3 is considered by many to be the best of the entire series , as well as one of the greatest platformers of all time .
From there , the series branched out , with the 1999 release of Crash Team Racing , a kart - racer like Mario Kart 64 .
It was Naughty Dog ’s last release before Eurocom took over the Crash franchise with Crash Bash , a party game that sold relatively well despite less than stellar reviews .

Gran Turismo Series
For racing junkies and PlayStation fans alike , Gran Turismo is recognized as one of the greatest high - speed series of all time .
Seeing only two releases on the PS1 , both titles serve as some of the best - selling racing games in history .
The original Gran Turismo holds the honor of being the highest selling PlayStation game in the world , with over 10.85 million copies sold worldwide and the sequel is n’t far behind at 9.37 million sold .
Of all things , perhaps Gran Turismo ’s greatest strengths are its realism and its size .
It was n’t quite as easy to dive into as your standard arcade racers , but it rewarded those who invested the time necessary to master it .
From the beginning of the series , the developers at Polyphony Digital were committed to make sure the models and handling of the vehicles were as true to life as possible with the technology at hand .
Everything from physical to accurate audio was taken into consideration .
In addition to having relatively accurate representations of each of the featured cars , players were able to tune the performance to their liking .
The first game featured over 170 selectable vehicles and 11 racetracks , as well as a soundtrack featuring the works of Chemical Brothers , Garbage , Feeder , and more .
Gran Turismo 2 continued this success , with nearly 650 playable vehicles and 27 tracks , as well as being released with a full soundtrack .
The game was so large that it required two disks , something unheard of in a racing game .

Tekken 3
While the Tekken series may have been one of the greatest selling 3D fighters on the PlayStation console , it is specifically Tekken 3 that deserves special attention .
Considered the pinnacle of the series , Tekken 3 brought over fifteen new characters , a revised combat system where moves were easier to combo , the z - axis and side - stepping were made key to avoiding attacks , and jumps were severely toned down .
When brought over from the arcade , mini - game modes like Tekken Force and Tekken Ball were added on top of the older modes from Tekken 2 .
Backgrounds became more limited and character models had frames of animation removed as well as lower polygon counts and fewer textures .
The game also was forced to a lower resolution .
The new gameplay was left largely intact , however , and including all unlockables , the roster held an impressive 23 characters .
At its release , changes to the combat engine were happily accepted and the game was considered almost perfect by reviewers .
Three out of four reviewers at Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the game a 10 out of 10 , with the last giving a 9 .
Years later , the game is still considered one of the best , appearing on Top 10 lists .
As of this writing , Game Rankings rates Tekken 3 as the 10th highest rated game of all time , much to the ire of Virtua Fighter fans everywhere .

Tomb Raider Series
The Tomb Raider games may seem like standard fare now , but back in 1996 , the series was revolutionary in more ways than one .
First of all , Tomb Raider was one of the first 3D action adventure games on the market and had excellent use of 3D environments in an era when most developers were still trying to wrap their brains around truly 3D game design .
In addition to the relatively expansive and innovative game design , Tomb Raider was also a trailblazer in terms of character design .
Even though Nintendo ’s Metroid series was the first to have a strong female character as a lead , most gamers would never have known it at the time .
However , it was hard to ignore the fact that Lara Croft was not your typical game protagonist .
While the extra curvy character design raised some eyebrows and attracted some extra attention from young male gamers , Lara was more than a pretty face .
The Tomb Raider series focuses on Lara ’s archaeological exploits in various tombs around the world and how they often turn sour , due to animal attacks , traps , puzzles , or nefarious forces attempting to steal said artifacts .
Once gamers played the games , it was obvious that Lara Croft was more of a female Indiana Jones - meets - James Bond than a stereotypical pin-up girl .
Developed by the relatively small team at Core Design ( which was newly acquired by Eidos ) , Tomb Raider was a quite ambitious project , but the early hype and the large sales impact the game had at the 1996 launch took the team by surprise .
Though originally being released on the Sega Saturn , the first Tomb Raider would see great success on the PlayStation console , leading to further success on Sony ’s console and easily becoming a top - seller .
After blowing the gaming industry away , Eidos pushed Core to have Tomb Raider II ready to ship by the holiday season of 1997 .
Even under such a tight deadline ( development was finished in nine months ) , Tomb Raider II was a solid product that adequately improved over the original with superior graphics , twice the scope , more flexible controls , and the ability to use vehicles .
This time it was n’t much of a surprise that Tomb Raider II was heavily anticipated and had amazing sales numbers .
In the end , Core Design pumped out five solid , blockbuster games in as many years and gave not only the PlayStation , but also the entire gaming industry one of the most iconic characters of a generation .
The series did n’t have a huge evolution within itself , but it definitely inspired many other developers to create many of the more advanced 3D adventures that we enjoy to this day .

Resident Evil Series
Capcom had a lot to offer when it came to two - dimensional games , but with the rise of the PlayStation and the demand for the 3D games , Capcom needed to reinvent itself a bit to stay ahead of the competition .
Its first successful 3D title , Resident Evil ( known as “ Biohazard ” in Japan ) was a new direction for the company and helped popularize the “ survival horror ” genre .
The Resident Evil games typically followed the exploits of two characters as they end up ensnared in a diabolical plot by the Umbrella Corporation , a leading pharmaceuticals company .
Umbrella produces biological weapons which turn people into zombies , and said zombies then attack other people , making them zombies and propagating Umbrella ’s weapon .
The main objectives of the games were to conserve ammunition and health items while dealing with limited inventory space , bizarre puzzles and fetch quests , and attempting to avoid such enemies as zombies , dogs , giant spiders , and other creatures that will make you jump out of your seat .
The PlayStation - era Resident
Evil games were n’t as fully three - dimensional as some other titles out there , but instead featured 3D characters moving against pre-rendered backgrounds .
They were also known for their tank - like character controls .
Modern gamers might be a bit put off by the control scheme , but it ’s fun to look back on them and see how much the series has evolved .
Something Resident Evil has never shied away from is violence .
The large amounts of violence , bloodshed , and gore began a trend that continues into modern gaming , where Sony was given the image of catering towards a more adult crowd while Nintendo added to its image of being the “ kiddy ” game company .
The Resident Evil series would eventually see three installments on the PlayStation in addition to a Director ’s Cut of the original game .
While all three games would later see re-releases or remakes on other platforms , the PS1 was the place to play them when they were cutting - edge .
The Resident Evil series has remained tremendously successful , seeing multiple spin - off titles , sequels , prequels , numerous game - based merchandising , ports and remakes , as well as comic lines , book series , and films .

Ridge Racer Series
The mid-1990s saw an arms race on the arcade scene , with more and more powerful graphics engines being developed in response to waning player interest and increasingly popular home consoles .
The result was a huge gap between arcade games and console ports in many cases .
So when new PlayStation owners popped in this disc and saw Ridge Racer running smooth and playing even smoother on their TV at home , it was enough to change the mind of even the most skeptical gamer about whether Sony was worthy of entering the home market .
Even though Ridge Racer was in the arcades for about two years before it was ported to the PS1 , it did n’t make it any less impressive when it was released .
While many Ridge Racer reviews lead one to believe that the PS1 port is “ arcade perfect ” – the textures are much lower resolution than the arcade version , and there ’s good deal of tearing at the seams if you go back and play it today .
Two other aspects of the game held up perfectly , however – the gameplay and the audio .
The visceral drifting action at the heart of the game was unchanged , and the sound ( annoying announcer and all ) was the type of thing that simply could n’t be done on the cartridge - based systems of the time .
Ridge Racer on the PlayStation was actually a fairly light on content , though it did go beyond what the coin - op machine offered .
There was essentially a single track that also had an extension section filled with hairpin turns on the harder difficulties .
Coming in first on all four races ( beginner , medium , expert and time trial ) unlocked the reverse courses .
A little trick ( running through the wall behind the starting block at more than 60 mph ) also unlocked mirror courses , for a total of 16 ways to race the track .
Beating a Galaxian mini - game during the load sequence unlocked eight more cars in addition to the original four , and beating the impossibly fast # 13 black car on the time trial unlocked it as well .
Ridge Racer was also notable because it was the first Namco game on the PlayStation .
Namco went on to become a huge force the system .
It rarely published games on other consoles , and essentially became a defacto second party developer for Sony , much like Squaresoft did for Nintendo in the 16 - bit era .
It supported the PlayStation with dozens of games , include three more Ridge Racer titles .

Final Fantasy Tactics
Mentioned separate from the Final Fantasy series specifically to make a point , Final Fantasy Tactics was the first truly successful strategy RPG released in America .
It was not the first , with titles like Ogre Battle : March of the Black Queen being released on Super Nintendo , but it sold significantly more units and brought tactical RPGs to the masses .
Of course the similarities between the Ogre games and Final Fantasy Tactics was n’t a coincidence .
Tactics actually shared much of the same team that made Ogre Battle and Tactics Ogre .
What ’s also interesting about Final Fantasy Tactics is how different it was from the other Final Fantasy games in the 32 - bit era .
Instead of pushing 3D graphics and focusing on visual story - telling , Tactics took an old - school approach with sprites and a rotating , isometric playing field .
The classic combat gameplay found in Tactics is just as outstanding and is really the star of the show .
The game features a complex “ job ” system , first introduced in Final Fantasy V. Much like a game of chess , Tactics forces players to think carefully about each move , to plan ahead , and to bring the best possible strategies to duke it out against many challenging opponents .
Many games , since its time , have attempted to copy and improve on its formula , but none have managed to do so with the same dramatic flair and unusual style as Final Fantasy Tactics .
Indeed , probably the greatest problem Final Fantasy Tactics had would also be the thing that would make it popular : it ’s featuring the Final Fantasy name .
While this likely led many fans of the Final Fantasy series to pick it up , it also led to its inevitable overshadowing by Final Fantasy VII , released only a few months before it .
However , Tactics was still quite successful , selling about 2.3 million copies on the PlayStation .
It also saw a handful of spin - offs / sequels on portable platforms , but none has received quite as much praise as the PlayStation original .
When all was said and done , Final Fantasy Tactics is one of the most involved , serious , and well - rounded strategy RPGs out there .
Despite being more than 6 years old , it remains as playable and fascinating as ever .

Tactics is notable for its well - crafted storyline , which might actually be one of the best in the Final Fantasy series .

Spyro the Dragon Series
While Crash Bandicoot would be the closest any character would come to being the PlayStation ’s mascot , Spyro the Dragon was a close second .
The Spyro the Dragon games are cartoonish 3D platformers that were quite popular with the younger crowd , but also had enough substance to keep established gamers entertained as well .
And like Crash Bandicoot , the Spyro games were some of the few non-Nintendo platforming games that did well in 3D .
The Spyro games each featured free - roaming 3D environments , fantasy and futuristic locales , and even crossed over to the Crash Bandicoot series from time to time .
( In fact , several of the later PlayStation Crash games would feature demo discs for Spyro titles , and vice versa . )
Of course , the games each centered around Spyro , a cocky little purple dragon that is a bit on the curious side .
When enemies come and invade the various fantasy worlds that Spyro inhabits , he inevitably must go out and solve the problem , usually with the help of a group of friends .
Though Spyro would branch out in later years to different consoles and handhelds , three titles were released on PlayStation .
These three were the only three designed by Insomniac Games , and are often considered the best of the series .
On a side note , all of the original PlayStation ’s releases feature music by Stewart Copeland , better known as the drummer from the band The Police .
It is often compared to Mutato Muzika ’s music from the Crash Bandicoot games .

Castlevania : Symphony of the Night
Symphony of the Night would mark a turning point in the history of all Castlevania games .
It would follow the son of Dracula , Alucard , instead of a Belmont clan member .
Instead of a level - by - level design that previous titles had stuck to , Symphony of the Night featured a more open - ended play style for traversing Dracula ’s castle , as well as a leveling and equipment system similar to RPGs .
While these ideas had been tried in passing in Castlevania II : Simon ’s Quest , they would really be explored on this PlayStation hit , and would become mainstays to the series afterwards .
The controls were also opened up a bit , allowing for abilities like double - jumping , as well as magic spells and a series of transformations the player could gain , allowing Alucard access to new areas of Dracula ’s castle .
Perhaps one of the most important features of the game is its 2D style .
On a console known for 3D games , Symphony of the Night shined as a model of what 2D could be like in the 32 - bit era , with excellent backgrounds and sprite designs that hold up well years later .
The musical score also featured a large variety of musical styles , ranging from jazz to metal to techno , and received much praise from fans .
Because of its success , almost all following Castlevanias would feature a similar format and Symphony of the Night is still the standard by which all future Castlevania games are measured .

Twisted Metal Series
While most European and Japanese fans may not remember the Twisted Metal series due to its lack of release anywhere but the United States , American gamers will never forget how awesome a game about vehicular combat could be .
The Twisted Metal series was synonymous with the PlayStation almost from day one , seeing it ’s first game put out in just under two months after the North American PlayStation ’s release .
The series would become known for its large cast of kooky characters , its outrageous storyline and ending sequences , its explosive combat , and its exclusivity .
( Twisted Metal games have only ever appeared on Sony consoles and PCs ) .
And what ’s not to love about a series where the player can select a hearse or a biker to bring untold destruction upon a dune buggy or a police car ?
Sure , the drivers sometimes change vehicles between games , and the cast fluctuates with each new title , but the old favorites almost always find some way of returning .
And though the series would see five releases on the PlayStation alone , the gameplay was always one giant destruction derby battle royale to the last man standing .

Tony Hawk ’s Pro Skater Series
Before the Tony Hawk series plummeted into mediocrity , its first four installments broke new ground in a crowded market by offering unique gameplay , intuitive controls , and customization .
The series first two titles were best known for their PlayStation releases , and rightly so ; the PlayStation ports were superior to the Nintendo 64 versions and outsold the Dreamcast ports .
What makes Tony Hawk ’s Pro Skater so revolutionary ?
When the game was released in 1999 , it was almost alone in its genre since many previously released skateboarding games were commercial failures .
The game made a terrific first impression however and game store demo kiosks were often surrounded by gamers waiting to play it .
It offered a unique control scheme that offered steaming , smooth combos allowing gamers to skate realistically for the first time , and the skating environments were ingeniously designed to allow for maximum replay value .
The second game upped the ante with an expanded arsenal of tricks at the player ’s disposal , improved graphics , and a skater and level creator , which was a real novelty at the time .
The third and fourth installments also expanded the gameplay and allowed for greater replay value , although these games were also given superior releases on next - generation consoles .
Slowing sales might have influenced the game designers , judging by the later levels of Tony Hawk ’s Pro Skater 4 , which are unpolished and glitch plagued .
Despite these issues , all four of the PlayStation releases are technical achievements for the console and are worth playing today .

PaRappa the Rapper
One of the first groundbreaking rhythm games , PaRappa the Rapper was also one of the most bizarre and interesting .
Players follow PaRappa , a rapping dog who wants to win the affection of a girl named Sunny Funny by doing such tasks as learning to drive and baking a cake – oh and , of course , he has to show off his rapping skills in the process .
That ’s where gameplay actually comes in .
To rap , the player must press certain buttons in the right rhythm to get higher ratings .
Screw up , and lyrics come out as unintelligible gibberish .
Do well enough , and PaRappa gets to go nuts and freestyle .
While not overly complex , the title attracted fans with its story , its style , and its art .
The entire game features 2D flat characters on 3D backgrounds , similar to Paper Mario .
While not nearly as popular as other titles on the list , PaRappa the Rapper did receive a sequel on the PlayStation 2 , as well as a spin - off game , UmJammer Lammy .
It also spawned an animated series in Japan , PaRappa Rappa .
The title would also serve as a view of things to come , as rhythm games would soon after be a major draw in arcades around the world .

Dance Dance Revolution Series
Created by the same team at Konami that designed Beatmania a year before , Dance Dance Revolution ( often - abbreviated DDR ) would begin taking the arcade world by storm in the late 1990s .
The title is a rhythm game that requires the player to press arrow buttons with their feet in time with the arcade cabinet ’s screen , a concept that seems simple enough until the actual speed of the game and the various potential foot maneuvers are taken into account .
The console release would see floor pads that were similar in design in function , keeping the arcade feel of the game in the home .
While most nations would n’t see much in the way of console releases until late in the PlayStation ’s life , Japanese gamers would see thirteen different DDR games released for their home consoles , with different tracks or remixes and slightly tweaked rules upon each release .
DDR eventually became one of the few games in the US that would keep the few remaining arcades open .
Die - hard rhythm fans would practice on their PlayStations at home before showing off their skills in the public venue .
Eventually Disney would get in touch with Konami , leading to titles like Dance Dance Revolution Disney Mix .
It would also spread to the next two generations of consoles , DVD games , television games , the PC , and cell phones .

Chrono Cross
The Super Nintendo ’s Chrono Trigger was a fantastic journey that served as one of the best role - playing experiences of all time .
However , considering that Chrono Cross did n’t have the full “ Dream Team ” of developers behind it ( only Hironobu Sakaguchi returned ) , this sequel had a lot to live up to .
A lot of things have changed from Chrono Trigger , especially the characters we grew to love .
In Chrono Cross , our hero is Serge , a teenage boy who shows up in an alternate world in which he had already passed away mysteriously over ten years ago .
Of course , he teams up with a number of other characters along the way ( the game features forty - five playable characters ) in order to find the Frozen Flame , which will allow them the bend space and time and ultimately help them find out what is really going on .
Much like Chrono Trigger , the whole “ parallel dimensions ” thing plays a very large role in the story and gameplay , so there are a lot of parallel concepts between the two games .
However , since the storylines are not directly connected , you can play Chrono Cross before Chrono Trigger without feeling lost or being dragged down with the feeling that you ’re missing out on a back - story .
While some fans were a bit disappointed that it was n’t as much of a direct sequel as they would have liked , the general consensus was quite positive and is typically regarded as one of the premier games in an already impressive selection of Playstation RPGs .

Xenogears
What happens when you take many of Squaresoft ’s best and brightest from the 1990s , give them a piece of an epic six - part series , and tell them to add in anime cutscenes directed by Koichi Mahimo ( known for his work on Ghost in the Shell and Neon Genesis Evangelion ) ?
You get Xenogears , a title many refer to as one of Square ’s greatest works .
Xenogears , part five of the six - part Xenogears Perfect Works book series , combined an epic storyline , lengthy amounts of anime cutscenes , a combat system that featured both mech combat and fighting game mechanics in an RPG , and even an ending theme with vocals by Joanne Hog .
Not bad for a title that almost did n’t see a stateside release due to “ sensitive religious issues ” ( and European gamers still have n’t seen an official release ) .
While the game ’s amount of questions may leave some people scratching their heads , the combat system was something very unique for its time .
Random encounters were fought either in giant mechs , called Gears in the game , where actions are controlled by fuel , or on the ground in between the player ’s party and various NPCs .
In this mode , characters use various combinations of buttons to attack with , varying in power and point value .
Use a combination enough and a special move may be unlocked , allowing you to use that ability when you attack .
These moves are generally impressive to watch , and some of the later ones are actually quite breathtaking , though by that point players are usually fighting in Gears .
The second disc is also usually frowned upon by gamers as being too short and linear , possibly due to the developers being rushed .
Even with its weaknesses , Xenogears often finds itself listed as one of the best RPGs on the PlayStation , which is no small feat considering the large number of them .
If nothing else , it ’s definitely worth a look by any RPG fan .

Dragon Warrior VII
The Final Fantasy series may get much of the RPG love around the world , but it ’s actually the Dragon Warrior series ( known in Japan as Dragon Quest ) that is the big seller in is native country .
Dragon Warrior VII , however was the first game in the series to be released outside of Japan since Dragon Warrior IV ( which was on the NES nearly a decade earlier )
Dragon Warrior VII is probably best remembered for its more than 100 hours of gameplay – which can be both a blessing and a curse .
Most people will agree that most of that time is quite enjoyable , but others will claim that it requires quite a bit of patience to make it through the journey .
Dragon Warrior VII ultimately became the eighth best - selling video game ever in Japan at 4.12 million in Japan alone – which puts it right up there with the worldwide sales of games like Spyro and Tekken 3 and ranked it as the eighth best - selling game ever in Japan .
Of course , in the US the sales were limited more to the diehard RPG crowd , but it is definitely one of the more prolific RPGs in the PS1 impressive role - playing library .

Silent Hill
Considered by many to be one of , if not the , scariest game of all time , and definitely the scariest title at its release in 1999 , Silent Hill showed the world just how adult the PlayStation could really be .
While Nintendo was busy trying to stave off an image of being “ kiddy , ” Silent Hill would continue to build on a foundation set in place by the likes of Resident Evil .
A gloomy setting combined with bizarre puzzles and creatures designed to make the skin crawl would serve to cement its place as the beginning of a long and well - respected survival horror series .
But the title is also remembered for its quality .
While it would n’t go on to become a million seller like other titles on this list , it did sell enough to gain a “ Greatest Hits ” release .
Many reviewers at the time also gave it high marks for avoiding Resident Evil - style scares of making the player jump , instead going for atmosphere and mood .
The creative team behind the title has claimed inspiration came from such varied places as the works of David Lynch , The Wizard of Oz , the plays of Kobo Abe , Alice ’s Adventures in Wonderland , and even the music of groups such as Sonic Youth or the Moonriders .
The series is also of note as it eventually become popular enough to garner a movie that audiences actually seemed to enjoy , a rarity amongst video game - based movies .
Also , in an interesting bit of censorship , the Grey Child enemy was edited in the United States release .
Originally looking similar to nude children , designers thought the idea of beating them down with a metal pipe would be too much , and changed them to look more demonic .
In the PAL version , the Grey Child was removed completely .

Syphon Filter Series
Syphon Filter , both the original game and the series as a whole has always had the uncomfortable pleasure of being compared and contrasted with the PlayStation ’s grand opus : Metal Gear Solid .
While both games strike their own merits , the comparisons are understandable .
Both games are key PlayStation franchises , wrapped in fictional spy-movie inspired attires , released only a few months apart .
It ’s unfortunate then that we must crown one a “ winner ” and the other a “ loser ” when both franchises are such interesting titles , likening themselves to different styles of spy based fiction .
With this mindset , Syphon Filter feels more like a Van Damne than a Schwarzenegger but at the same time , packs it where it counts .
Most Syphon
Filter fans would think that I am talking about gadgets and weapons , but the game actually thrives on variety and balancing the momentum of play .
Each mission is divided up into a series of stereotypical spy tasks such as rescuing hostages and taking out Russians .
The trick is that you are never doing something long enough for it to become tiresome .
The basic shooting works well , due to the aforementioned weapons which are both vast and highly satisfying to use ( especially the air taser ) but even when you ’ve done enough of that , you ’ll be moving onto something different .
Each quantifiable element of Syphon Filter is well polished which goes a long way to keep you playing .
This is the key to what makes playing Syphon Filter feel so apt title ; quality , variety and balance .
Later games in the series , slowly lost sight of this balance but introduced some additions , which made the games retain the original ’s qualities .
While not an overall momentous series in contrast to say Metal Gear Solid or Resident Evil , there is no doubt that Syphon Filter is significant franchise , which helped solidify the PlayStation as a strong gaming platform .

Wipeout Series
If the technical racing of Gran Turismo is n’t your thing , perhaps you would enjoy the high - speed futuristic racing that the Wipeout series has to offer .
Considering it was released in 1995 , its impressive how much fast and smooth this racer ran on the PlayStation hardware .
The game was also released on the Saturn , but because the developers struggled with the dual - processor setup of Sega ’s machine , did n’t have quite the graphical flair of the PS1 version .
In addition to the adrenaline - pumping speed , Wipeout was also known for its audio quality and soundtrack .
The techno tracks from The Chemical Brothers , Orbital , CoLD SToRAGE , and other artists propelled Wipeout to the top of many gamers favorite soundtrack lists .
Wipeout XL ( known as Wipeout 2097 outside of the US ) was released a year later .
As expected , the sequel added a few things here and there such as new tracks , crafts , and weapons .
It also made it a bit easier for beginners to pick up and play while still giving experienced players a challenge .
The game was criticized for not having slip - screen multiplayer , but it did offer PS1 owners to link two PlayStations together for networked play .

Driver Series
Driver , developed by Reflections Interactive ( creators of the successful Destruction Derby series ) has you adopt the role of Tanner , an NYPD undercover detective tasked with infiltrating an underworld syndicate of crime gangs as a wheelman .
Your wheelman role has you fulfilling several roles , such as getaway driver , delivery man and car thief or in one particular amusing mission , intimidating a particular taxi customer into disclosing lucrative information through reckless driving .
The game was designed to be faithful to 60s and 70s car chase films such as Bullitt or the TV show Starksy and Hutch .
Characters are dressed in 70s getup and the music has chicken scratch guitar and grooving basslines synonymous with that period .
The game ’s ‘ Director ’s Mode ’ was highly praised by critics and gamers at the time of release for it ’s unique ability to fully edit and sequence camera angles during replays of your missions ( or just general driving around in ‘ City ’ mode . )
Hours could be spent tweaking your replays into seamless 70s action sequences .
This added longevity to the game despite its lack of multiplayer mode .
The games story is split into four main cities , each city tasking you with missions for the three different gangs in the game .
The cities are Miami ( the city you receive your first real mission after you finish the punishing training mission ) , San Francisco , Los Angeles and New York City .
Missions can occur at anytime of day and some missions are set at night with some impressive ( for the PlayStation ) lighting on the cars and roads .
The game was met with mostly positive feedback and acclaim upon its launch .
Most criticism about the game was regarding its lack of multiplayer and somewhat punishing driving mechanic .
Many people found that they could not get further than the training mission in the parking garage at the beginning of the game .
This particular mission had you demonstrate your driving skills to a gang of thugs without damaging your car .
Certain objectives were a little obscured such as the slalom through the pillars of the garage requiring you to do a 180 and go back through them and the infamous J - turn maneuver ( reverse 180 ) all within a strict time limit .
Street Fighter Alpha 3
Even though 3D games were all the rage on the PlayStation , there were still a number of beloved 2D fighters on the platform as well .
Franchises from both Capcom and SNK made their mark on the PlayStation , but Street Fighter Alpha 3 is probably the most treasured out of the bunch .
Gamers love the combination of the Street Fighter world and large character rosters , so Street Fighter Alpha 3 received a great deal of praise by merging the Alpha 2 cast with some beloved characters from Street Fighter 2 and in addition to some completely new contenders .
The games also had a wonderful blend of fresh sprites , great combos , and a fighting system that was easy to play , but difficult to master .
It also allowed great flexibility in choosing your fighting style , resulting in some great dorm - room matchups back in the day .
In most cases , the PlayStation was at a huge disadvantage to the Sega Saturn when it game to 2D fighters .
The Saturn was a 2D powerhouse with lots of RAM .
The PlayStation , on the other hand usually had stripped - down ports of the arcade favorites .
However , Street Fighter Alpha 3 for the PS1 was actually a superb arcade port that also offered a number of extra game modes .
The end result was one of the best 2D Games that Pushed the Playstation to Its Limits .

Einhander ( and the rest of the Shmup library )
In addition to 2D fighting games , the PlayStation was also a haven for fans of 2D shooters .
There are a ton of good arcade ports in addition to some PlayStation exclusives .
As was the case with the far more ill - fated Sega Saturn , many of the shooters on the PlayStation never saw release outside of Japan , and remain veiled in obscurity to this day .
One such game , however , that nearly any player of the era has at least heard of , is this uncharacteristic Squaresoft production .
Having been catapulted out of the niche market in the West by the runaway success of Final Fantasy VII , the company was riding high , and eager to spread its wings farther outside of the RPG and Strategy genres than usual ; in addition , it was less afraid to take the risk of localization , giving foreign gamers a shot at some of its more unusual titles .
Thus Einhander , unlike so many of its kin , was both widely - available ( except in Europe , unfortunately ) and well - received enough to become , arguably , the shooter that defined the PS1 .
Of course , the unusual - by - default nature of an old - fashioned shooter released in that era , as well as the suddenly - desirable Square label on the cover , were n’t the only things to garner the title so much attention , though they certainly were factors .
Its graphics certainly did n’t hurt its cause either – while we are talking 32 - bit polygons here , the designs and details ( your craft is especially nifty - looking ) were top - notch back in the day , and actually still hold up rather well over ten years later .
The cliché but solid techno - laden soundtrack and plot ( in a bit of a twist , you ’re actually the “ invader ” , sent by a moon colony to attack Earth ) round out the presentation .
Once you pick up the controller , in many ways the title plays like a “ typical ” side - scroller , but with a unique power - up system – with the exception of your default pea-shooter , the only weapons you ’re going to get are the ones you can salvage directly from defeated enemies .
This being the case , you ’re required to aim carefully during battles , so as to blast rivals ’ weapons off of them before bringing them down – if done properly , you can gingerly swoop in to collect their arms , and thereafter use them yourself .
Despite its sometimes being labeled as an example of a “ modern ” shooter , the game actually comes across as far more of an “ old - school ” tribute after spending some time with it , since it does n’t hesitate to make you memorize its layout to succeed ( let alone score well ) , not to mention send your sorry carcass back to a checkpoint with all your collected weapons gone after being shot down .
As such , while the trimmings are most likely to appeal to curious newcomers to the genre , it will likely be the long - time shmuppers who will be most at home after becoming acquainted with its inner workings .
All told , Einhander stands as an appealing , if slightly intimidating , blend of old and new , and the PS1 ’s most famous foray into the shooter realm .
The game was recently put up for download on the PS3 via the Japanese PlayStation Network , so if you ’re unwilling to fight over an original copy on eBay this might be your chance to see what all the fuss is about .

BBC Radiophonic Music BBC Radiophonic Music [ REISSUED AGAIN ]
BBC Radiophonic Music , affectionately known as ' The Pink Record ' , was originally a BBC internal library disc , and then a commercial LP release in 1971 ( BBC Records , REC25M ) .
What this release best demonstrates ( in no less than 9 tracks of the 31 on offer ) is Delia 's versatility and mastery of her medium .
Pot au
Feu is a pounding , fantastically rhythmic track - it 's unsettling enough to have a speedfreak running for the breadknives in the kitchen .
Ziw - zih Ziw - zih oo - oo - oo drags you along in the unrelenting tow of the lascivious tapeloop swiped from her own Science and Nature .
Sitting between these two storms lies the fragility of Blue Veils and Golden Sands and The Delian Mode .
Elsewhere , Delia will charm your socks off with Door to Door ( which reduced her to fits of giggles when played during a BBC Radio Scotland interview ) and show a far defter touch than Wendy Carlos with classical material ( Air ... which she dismissed as " rubbish " , though it has a fair number of admirers ) .
Other Delia tracks are Mattachin , Towards Tomorrow and Quiz Time .
The CD release features two bonus Delia tracks ( Happy Birthday and Time to Go ) , plus a twelve page colour booklet by Mark Ayres , who also remastered the material for reissue .

Doctor Who 2 Doctor Who Volume 2 : New Beginnings
The second of the recent Doctor Who compilations features two of Delia Derbyshire 's most unworldly and beautiful tracks : Blue Veils and Golden Sands and The Delian Mode .
Few could disagree with Delia 's own remark on recently hearing Blue Veils : " Does n't it just melt you ! "
Neither track was intended for use in Doctor Who - recorded in 1967 , they were taken off an internal library record for use in the series in 1970 .
Also featured on the CD are overdubbed and edited versions of her Doctor Who theme , including the version released as a single in 1973 ( the first time Delia would be credited by name for her production of what remains one of the most famous TV themes of all time ) .
Familiarity with the theme may cause us to underestimate just how different and unconventional Delia 's work was then , but subsequent versions never hard quite the same magic as the original .
Delia attributed this to the handmade nature of the 1963 version .

An Electric Storm The White Noise : An Electric Storm
White Noise , the brainchild of Delia Derbyshire and David Vorhaus , was one of the first all - electronic groups ever , and contempories of the equally legendary Silver Apples .
Their first and only true LP was one of the emerging Island Records early album releases and , along with Traffic , one of their first alternative signings ( a distinct change from their blue beat fair ) .
Whatever Island honcho Chris Blackwell saw in the demos of the sublime Firebird and symphonically psychedelic Love Without Sound ( both used on the record ) we shall never know , but he stumped up the cash for the pair to go back to their Kaleidophon Studio , situated opposite London psychedelic centre The RoundHouse .
Derbyshire had set the ante for purely electronic pop with her seminal recording of the original Doctor Who theme .
But White Noise , and their strange blend of the Medieval and Futuristic music was to become one of Island 's early best sellers and a student favourite for decades .

Dennis Leary firefighters show to tackle 9/11 conspiracy theories Ron Brynaert
Published : Thursday December 4 , 2008
Print This Email This Dennis Leary , famous for his biting , sarcastic comedy and his religious chain smoking , revealed to a fan at a Los Angeles book signing that his critically acclaimed FX show " Rescue Me " about NYC firefighters will tackle 9/11 conspiracy theories in the coming season .
" When asked by a hesitant fan as to whether or not the actor thought there should be a reinvestigation into the events leading up to and surrounding the 9/11 tragedy , Leary 's eyes lit up as he revealed that conspiracy and reinvestigation into 9/11 are , in fact , major plot lines in the first 10 episodes of Rescue Me season 5 , set to premiere in April 2009 for a 22 - episode run on FX , " Erin Broadley reported for LA Weekly .
Broadley continues , " But when another fan pushed it too far and asked Leary 's personal opinion about the conspiracy surrounding Building 7's collapse , the actor and author was quick with his response .
' You guys do n't want to get into that with me , ' Leary said , suddenly serious as he explained that he ' knew several of the guys who had been there working to hold that building up . '
Leary then paused , politely changed the subject and returned to meeting fans . "
Writing for conspiracy site Prison Planet , Paul Joseph Watson complains , " The L.A .
Weekly failed to report what happened at the end of the conversation .
After the question about Building 7 , security thugs stepped in , blocked the camera and proceeded to kick the protagonists out of the bookstore .
There was no hostility or impoliteness on the part of the 9/11 truthers , but apparently Learys security thinks it necessary to physically eject anyone who expresses an opinion different to his . "
" Break out the tin-foil hats , " Don Kaplan mocked in Wednesday 's New York Post .
Prison Planet notes that one of Leary 's co-stars , Daniel Sunjata , " has been a vocal advocate for the 9/11 truth movement in questioning 9/11 and he likely had a massive influence on the decision of the script writers to dramatize the issue . "
Sunjata even wore a shirt to an awards ceremony in April of 2007 brandishing the message , " 9/11 was an inside job . "
" The prevalence of 9/11 truth in a plethora of different mediums is exactly what is required to spread the truth and wake up people who would not necessarily come into contact with this information through the usual channels , " Watson writes for Prison Planet .
" We applaud the staff of Rescue Me for having the fortitude to tackle this vital issue . "
A video of the encounter , taken from the website Framing the World , can be seen below :
NATO Pessimism The West Is at a Loss in Afghanistan
More and more military and civilian leaders are voicing pessimism when it comes to the NATO mission in Afghanistan .
As the fight continues , ideas for how to break through the ongoing stalemate are few .
Some are beginning to think that victory -- for either side -- is impossible .
The McCain campaign , in a continuing effort to link Barack Obama to domestic terrorism , released a statement Wednesday from a New York supporter , recounting how his family home was firebombed by the radical 1960s group founded by Obama supporter William Ayers .
But the McCain supporter , John M. Murtagh , has his own ties to radical protesters :
He served as a lawyer for a Catholic priest who led protests at an abortion clinic that turned violent .
Mr ....
In the middle of last year , we finished our decade - long project to reinvent Mathematica , and we released Mathematica 6 .
We introduced a great many highly visible innovations in Mathematica 6 — like dynamic interactivity and computable data .
But we were also building a quite unprecedented platform for developing software .
And even long before Mathematica 6 was released , we were already working on versions of Mathematica well beyond 6 .
And something remarkable was happening .
There ’d been all sorts of areas we ’d talked about someday being in Mathematica .
But they ’d always seemed far off .
Well , now , suddenly , lots of them seemed like they were within reach .
It seemed as if everything we ’d built into Mathematica was coming together to make a huge number of new things possible .
All over our company , efforts were starting up to build remarkable things .
It was crucial that over the years , we ’d invested a huge amount in creating long - term systems for organizing our software development efforts .
So we were able to take those remarkable things that were being built , and flow them into Mathematica .
And at some point , we realized we just could n’t wait any longer .
Even though Mathematica 6 had come out only last year , we had assembled so much new functionality that we just had to release Mathematica 7 .
So 18 months after the release of Mathematica 6 , I ’m happy to be able to announce that today Mathematica 7 is released !
You can find lots of details of what ’s new in Mathematica 7 on the web .
I think it ’s pretty impressive .
One metric is that Mathematica 7 introduces about 500 new functions .
Some of them are pretty trivial , but a remarkable number are “ superfunctions ” that automate huge areas of functionality , and each of those contains many separate large algorithms .
The plot below is quite striking , too .
It shows the growth in the number of functions in Mathematica over the past 20 years .
Watching our development process from the inside , I ’ve definitely had the feeling in the past few years that we ’ve been entering a new regime of growth .
That everything we ’ve integrated into Mathematica is interacting to let us somehow build almost exponentially more .
And the plot above suggests that something like that is really happening .
But what ’s perhaps most striking is that even as the number of functions and the breadth of functionality have been growing so dramatically , we ’ve succeeded in maintaining the unity of Mathematica — and of making sure that every piece of the system fits together in a coherent way .
That ’s not been easy , of course .
It ’s the result of our long - term company culture and of a lot of systems that we ’ve built up over the course of more than 20 years .
( As well as thousands of hours of personal work by me . )
It ’s very satisfying , though .
Because it means that the things we so carefully built five , ten , twenty years ago are still there today , making possible our new achievements .
From the very beginning , I always thought that the underlying symbolic paradigm of Mathematica was a powerful one .
But it seems like every version of Mathematica proves that it ’s even more powerful than I ever imagined .
And Mathematica 7 is no exception .
For in Mathematica 7 there are a whole collection of new constructs that are represented as symbolic expressions — and so can be completely integrated into the system .
One example is images .
Mathematica 7 lets you drag an image from anywhere into Mathematica , then start computing with it .
Mathematica now has all sorts of highly efficient image processing functionality built in .
But what ’s really powerful is how deeply images are integrated into the whole system .
You can make lists of images ; you can use an image — inline — as an argument to a function .
You can apply all the power of Mathematica to images .
This kind of extreme integration is one of the unique strengths — and guiding principles — of Mathematica .
Another guiding principle is automation .
The idea that we , as humans , should just be able to specify what we want Mathematica to do , and then Mathematica should automate the process of doing it in the best possible way .
In Mathematica 7 we ’ve brought automation to all sorts of new areas .
Automatically picking the best algorithms for solving delay differential equations , or for simplifying huge Boolean expressions , or for plotting streamlines of a complicated vector field .
Quite often what we ’re automating includes how results are going to be presented .
Doing what we call computational aesthetics : having Mathematica automatically choose the best way to present things .
And in Mathematica 7 we ’re doing that a lot , not only when we work with images , but also with enhancements in typesetting large expressions , and with many new forms of graphics and information visualization .
Another thing we ’re automating in a major way is parallel computation .
Most computers one buys these days have multicore CPUs .
And in Mathematica 7 you can automatically make use of those cores by using the new parallel computing primitives that we ’ve built into Mathematica .
Many times in my life I ’ve wanted to do parallel computation .
And occasionally with great effort I ’ve managed to do it .
But with Mathematica 7 I can now just do it immediately — right inside Mathematica .
So for the first time ever , I ’m actually doing parallel computation routinely , every day .
And within our company I ’ve seen the number of internal software systems that use parallelism skyrocket .
Another new area in Mathematica 7 is automated charting .
Bar charts , pie charts , and all that .
There ’ve been packages for creating these kinds of graphics in Mathematica forever .
But in Mathematica 7 we ’ve taken the whole idea of charting and information visualization to a new level .
It ’s kind of interesting .
One might not have thought that charting would be an area where the symbolic character of Mathematica would be important .
But it is .
The key idea is that one can use symbolic wrappers to encode features of data — like how a particular element should be labeled , or styled , or what dynamic behavior it should have .
And this lets one immediately organize charting in a new , more streamlined way .
And both interactively and programmatically go much further than before .
With Mathematica 6 we launched our concept of computable data : of making real - world data immediately available in computable form directly inside Mathematica .
In the last couple of years , we ’ve greatly expanded our in - house data curation effort — updating our existing data , and bringing in large amounts of additional data .
In Mathematica 7 we ’ve added several new areas — like genomic data and weather data .
I ’ve always had a wonderful time making abstract discoveries with Mathematica .
But with our computable data it ’s now possible to make discoveries directly about real - world things , right from within Mathematica .
Talking of discoveries : there are lots of people at our company who are involved with discovering new algorithms .
And in Mathematica 7 there are some pretty spectacular achievements in that area .
One that particularly impressed me is transcendental roots .
There ’s a whole lot of great mathematics done on roots of polynomial equations .
But when it comes to transcendental equations , there ’ve really only been fragmentary results , scattered over the past several centuries .
And I ’d assumed that that was just the way it had to be .
But a few years ago we discovered that it is n’t — and we invented a whole algorithmic theory of transcendental roots , which is now implemented and running in Mathematica 7 .
Perhaps even more interesting are the new differential and difference root constructs .
That symbolically represent solutions to differential and difference equations — and in effect allow us to vastly generalize the notion of special functions .
There ’ve been lots of big mathematical and algorithmic projects for Mathematica 7 .
Another is implementing discrete calculus .
If there ’s one thing everyone knows about Mathematica , it ’s that it can do calculus — integrals , derivatives , and so on .
Well , for hundreds of years people have also talked about discrete calculus — the discrete analog of ordinary continuous calculus , with sums and differences and so on .
And these days , with more and more things we care about being discrete and digital , discrete calculus is becoming more and more important .
So for Mathematica 7 we ’ve done for discrete calculus what we did for continuous calculus in Mathematica 1 : we ’ve systematically automated it .
There ’s a long list of algorithmic achievements in Mathematica 7 .
And sometimes it begins to seem almost bizarre .
As what seems to us like a fairly minor part of the new Mathematica ends up being as big and deep as some whole existing other software system .
But that ’s what happens when we let loose the kind of R&D teams we have , and they get to do long - term development with the extremely integrated system we ’ve been steadily building for the past two decades .
I ’ve of course been using versions of Mathematica 7 for some time now .
And great though Mathematica 6 is , it already looks horribly dated to me .
I ca n’t imagine not being able to do image processing immediately .
Or automated charting .
Or parallel computation .
Or taking advantage of all those little innovations in the user interface .
There ’s lots in Mathematica 7 for every kind of potential user .
And the compatibility with Mathematica 6 is perfect ( except , of course , that there are many new functions ) .
So … enjoy Mathematica 7 !
We ’re already hard at work on Mathematica 8 , Mathematica 9 , and beyond .
We ’ve got a very impressive R&D pipeline going .
With lots of exciting stuff coming .
Including , I think it ’s fair to say , some serious future surprises .
Which I look forward to writing about …
When Timothy stumbled across a function that had a vague name , no comments , and variables , he took a few minutes to try to break it down in his head .
static char * nice_num ( long n ) { int neg = 0 , d = 3 ; char * buffer = prtbuf ; int bufsize = 20 ; if ( n < 0 ) { neg = 1 ; n = - n ; } buffer += bufsize ; *-- buffer = ' \0 ' ; do { *-- buffer = ' 0 ' + ( n % 10 ) ; n /= 10 ; if ( - - d == 0 ) { d = 3 ; *-- buffer = ' , ' ; } } while ( n ) ; if ( * buffer == ' , ' ) ++ buffer ; if ( neg ) *-- buffer = '- ' ; return buffer ; }
Got that ?
Yeah , it takes a few minutes to figure out .
The function that this , er , function is trying to accomplish is to add commas at the thousands , millions , etc. places .
It works backwards , starting with the string terminator , then setting the one , ten , hundred , etc. digits using goofy modulus math .
The function divides by ten with each iteration ( rather than 1,000 for some reason ) , stopping at every third to stick a comma in .
And if it was negative to begin with , it mashes a minus sign back on to the string before returning it .
Personally , I would 've called the function " nice_num , horrible_implementation " , but I 'm pretty sure commas are n't legal in C++ function names .

CHICAGO , Nov 13 ( Reuters ) - Sen. Hillary Clinton emerged on Thursday as a candidate to be U.S. secretary of state for Barack Obama , months after he defeated her in an intense contest for the Democratic presidential nomination .
Putting Clinton , wife of former President Bill Clinton , in the position could help heal whatever lingering divisions remain in the Democratic Party after her bitter battle with Obama .
Obama passed over Clinton as his vice presidential running mate in favor of Sen .
Joe Biden , a decision that angered her ardent supporters and widened a rift in the party that Obama and Clinton later worked hard to heal .
Her selection as top U.S. diplomat could also mean a more hawkish foreign policy than that advocated by Obama during his presidential campaign .
On the campaign trail , Clinton was more reluctant than Obama to commit to a firm timetable for withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq .
But both Obama and Clinton were adamant about improving the image of the United States abroad and correcting what they considered the “ failed policies ” of the outgoing Bush administration .
NBC News quoted an adviser as saying Clinton had flown to Chicago , where Obama has an office , on Thursday on personal business .
Her office would say only that she had no official business on Thursday .
Neither her aides nor aides to President - elect Obama would say whether she was interviewed for the job by Obama , who spent a great part of the day behind closed doors in transition meetings in Chicago .
“ Any speculation about cabinet or other administration appointments is really for President - elect Obama ’s transition team to address , ” said Clinton ’s senior adviser , Philippe Reines .
NBC News and The Washington Post reported that Clinton was under consideration for the top U.S. diplomatic position .
EXPANDED SEARCH ?
This would mean Obama was expanding his search beyond other candidates mentioned for the job , such as Massachusetts Sen .
John Kerry , a Democrat who lost the 2004 presidential election to George W. Bush , and Nebraska Sen. Chuck Hagel , a Republican who backed Obama over Republican John McCain this year .
CNN reported that on Monday night , while walking into an awards ceremony in New York , Clinton was asked if she would consider taking a post in the Obama administration .
It did not sound like she ruled it out .
“ I am happy being a senator from New York , I love this state and this city .
I am looking at the long list of things I have to catch up on and do .
But I want to be a good partner and I want to do everything I can to make sure his agenda is going to be successful , ” Clinton said .
The former first lady had argued during the Democratic primary campaign that Obama was too inexperienced to be president .
But they mended fences and during the Democratic National Convention in Denver , she declared that “ Barack Obama is my candidate and he must be our president . ”
Analyst Paul Light of New York University ’s John Brademas Center for the Study of Congress said picking Clinton would mean Obama was serious about reaching across the party divide .
On the other hand , he said : “ To put her in the competition with several others and pick somebody other than Hillary Clinton after you ’ve floated her name is to have a repeat of the spring and summer division and raise questions about Obama ’s seriousness about healing the division within the party . ”
Clinton was at first considered the shoo - in to win the Democratic nomination only to watch the 47 - year - old Illinois senator defeat her in a series of decisive battles .
Whether Clinton would want the position was immediately debated on cable television talk shows .
After all , she wanted to be president , and why would she settle for anything less ?
“ I think she has her sights set higher than that , ” said Stephen Hayes , a columnist for the Weekly Standard Magazine , on CNN .
On the other hand , Obama won election over McCain decisively and if he is successful in his first term , he very well could win again in 2012 , probably putting the presidency out of reach for Clinton , who is now 61 .
As U.S. first lady Clinton devoted a great deal of time to the rights of women around the world , often traveling the globe with her daughter , Chelsea .
As a presidential candidate , she argued for putting greater U.S. emphasis on defeating the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan and in ensuring nuclear weapons do not spread .
WASHINGTON -- Leaders from major advanced and developing countries pledged Saturday to broaden efforts to contain the financial crisis and revive the world economy , though they cautioned against policies that could be counterproductive to either domestic economies or the global system as a whole .
U.S. President George W. Bush said Saturday the Group of 20 financial summit was successful and marks the beginning of a dialogue among world leaders to resolve the financial crisis .
G - 20 leaders gathering in Washington to address the worst crisis since the Great Depression vowed bold action and urged individual countries to use fiscal and monetary policies " as deemed appropriate " to support growth and stability .
" Against this background of deteriorating economic conditions worldwide , we agreed that a broader policy response is needed , based on closer macroeconomic cooperation , to restore growth , avoid negative spillovers and support emerging market economies and developing countries , " the final communique said .

Just a quickie thats been kicking around in my head for a while now .
I liked the idea of bitter chocolate tarts ever since having one at Divido in Mt Hawthorn a while back .
I ’m not a huge fan of really sweet desserts , so the idea of the bitter chocolate appealed to my savoury sensibilities quite strongly .
I ’d been sitting on a block of dark ( 80 % ) Spanish cooking chocolate for a while , waiting for the next outbreak of the war on terror to hit and send my stocks through the roof .
Fortunately that has n’t happened yet ( although the current one is bad enough ) , and so my resource speculation will have to take a back seat to my baking .
I picked the chocolate up while visiting the lovely lady at Spanish Flavours in Wembley ( who i’ll call Maria for the sake of cultural stereotypes ) , it ’s a great store full of all sorts of Spanish and Latin flavoured products .
Anyone familiar with “ Steve Do n’t Eat It ” ( go there , its good ) will be glad to know there is a place where you can find your very own can of Cuitlacoche to play with .
So Maria pointed me in the direction of this chocolate and said it was just the stuff for baking all kinds of delicious desserts “ But not for drinking ! ”
She said … “ I got a nice one for you to try for drinking ” .
So after being softened up by a mug of free hot chocolate , that looked more like chocolate yoghurt in consistency , I made the purchase and was on my merry way .
Now with my recent tart making success during the Moroccan dinner under my belt , it was time to roll onto the next tart based challenge .
So here we have …
Bitter Chocolate Tarts
Pastry Crust :
1 1/2 cups plain flour
100g butter
75g caster sugar
Pinch of salt
1 large egg yolk
2 tablespoons whipping cream
Bitter Chocolate Filling :
300 mL thickened or whipping cream
200g dark chocolate ( 80 per cent )
50g butter , chopped
2 tablespoons Baileys Irish Cream
2 tablespoons Butterscotch schapps
half a cup of sugar ( if you ca n’t take the bitterness )
How I Made Mine
For the crust , combine the flour , sugar , and salt together in a food processor .
Mix it all around and then add the butter by cutting it up into small pieces and dropped in a piece at a time until the mixture turns into a rough mixture .
Add the egg and cream while the processor is still going at which point it should all come together and turn into a big ball that sticks together quite well .
Take the ball out of the processor and onto a floured surface .
Knead it a little and when it seems to be a good consistency that is both soft and a little crumbly , but does n’t completely fall apart , work it into the shape you ’re after and press it into your baking dish .
In this case I made a bunch of little tarts .
So I broke off small balls of dough and pressed them into discs before lining them into a texas muffin tin .
Then prick the bottom of the tarts all over with a fork and put them into the freezer for about 20 minutes before cooking .
When they ’re mostly solid and have a good shape after being in the freezer , pop them into a preheated oven at 180C and bake for 15 - 20 minutes until they ’re golden brown .
Take them out and let them cool .
For the filling I heated the cream until just below boiling point and then transferred it into a bowl along with the chocolate that had been shaved finely so it would melt quickly .
Then let that sit for a minute before stirring in the butter and bringing it all together with the baileys and butterscotch schnapps ( which you can quite happily omit if you do n’t like cowboys ) .
At this point please taste the mixture …
I was going along happily and then I had a taste and realised it was too bitter even for my espresso loving palate ( although do n’t get me started on the bitterness in espresso debate ) .
So i added a half a cup or so of caster sugar to the mixture and stirred it through to lighten the soul destroying bitterness that was currently lurking in the bowl .
Once it ’s cooled , pour it into the waiting tart shells and pop it into the freezer or fridge for a good few hours until solid .
Take them out and serve with a good dollop of cream or ice cream to add in the digestive process .
Incidentally , mine were still really bitter when I took them out of the fridge the night I made them , but after a couple of days they seem to have mellowed .
Do n’t ask me how … perhaps all the sugar and alcohol settled at the bottom of the bowl and all got poured into one of the tarts , but either way they tasted great .
The best thing is that if no - one else likes them you can just criticise them for having woefully unsophisticated palates and still come out looking good :)
Tasty .

I just had a bowl of cereal , in a palm leaf .
No I ’m not on a tropical island .
Nor am I on a eco commune .
I ’m here in snowy Grass Valley , trying out the new line of compostable serviceware from Verterra .
And I have to say I ’m very impressed .
I ’ve used quite a lot of eco friendly compostable & biodegradable plates , utensils , cups , etc. in my time , and these are the best I ’ve come across .
[ social_buttons ]
Why ?
They are both aesthetically interesting and durable .
Verterra ca n’t say it , but I can :
They ’re reusable .
Since their surface is one piece of material , rather than a composite of several fibers , as in how how paper is made , they have greater structural integrity .
That means that they do n’t fall apart .
This is the second set of samples I ’ve gotten from them , these being from their soon to be released Signature line , and so far I ’ve been able to reuse a bowl four times .
Some who are familiar with the original Indian plates these take their inspiration from may ask , what ’s so different about these ?
To start , they ’re UV sterilized .
They are steam and chill treated , enabling them to be shaped in numerous interesting forms , including their new bowls , and with this process , akin to tempering , they are made quite sturdy .
The manufacturing process is done by employees paid a living wage , with access to health care , in a highly energy efficient factory .
And in something I ’ve not seen elsewhere , they can be used in an oven for 45 minutes at 350 degrees F .
Verterra grew out of CEO Michael Dwork ’s travels through India , where he saw street vendors serving food on plates they made on the spot , pressing in waffle iron like devices , to be eaten off of and disposed of with no waste issue to contend with , as they ’d naturally biodegrade , being leaves .
He set about to make them durable , water resistant , and attractive to the modern American eye .
After much testing , they settled on a proprietary layering of different parts of the palm leaf , so that they were water resistant where food and liquid met the surface , eliminating the need for coating them , and the sappy quality of the middle layer served to glue all three layers together , without the need for synthetic or otherwise external glues or binders .
The results have been impressive .
I already was a fan of the first line that came out earlier this year , but now , they have simplified and refined the execution , and somehow found a way to make them stronger .
And the line has greatly expanded , with two different bowls , platters , and plates that range from the drink or party snack friendly 4 ″ x4 ″ square plates to 14 ″ x 16 ″ platters .
As a catering friend said , these would be a boon , comparably priced to renting serviceware , and eliminating the need for washing afterwords , sans the guilt of disposing of them , since they biodegrade , even if thrown away , and compost in 2 months in a consumer level ( as in non professional ) compost environment .
And for anybody doing an event that wants a little something different , made from what would have otherwise been agricultural waste , burnt , these are a great option .
Readers :
What other bio based serviceware have you tried , like ?
Where else have you seen what would have been “ waste ” put to use in creative , useful ways ?
Ever used Verterra yourself ?
What ’s been your experience ?

In all this talk about GM ’s financial health , the most important element of any potential turnaround has been woefully neglected : the company ’s corporate culture .
GM ’s is so utterly dysfunctional that it makes John Wayne Gacey ’s home life seem like Peter Brady ’s .
There is no way – no way whatsoever — that GM can recover with its current management .
Be that as it is , I ’ve been contacting recently “ liberated ” GM employees to get a glimpse of life inside the belly of the beast .
And pretty it ’s not .
“ I remember walking my dogs and literally dropping to my knees and praying to God I would get out of GM , ” one ex-exec told me .
“ I ’ve seen people throwing - up in the bathrooms because of the overwhelming atmosphere of fear , terror and panic …
It ’s the most warped and bizarre thing I ’ve ever seen in my life . ”
This from an employee with over 20 - years of industry experience in several large companies .
Our man tells us that GM ’s incestuous culture is stuffed with spies– people employed by management ( e.g. supplier supremo Bo Anderson ) whose main function is to secretly uncover and report dissension in the ranks .
Dissent ?
“ There is no dissent allowed , ” he reports flatly .
“ None .
Only good news is reported upwards .
You ’d think it would be different now that GM ’s admitted its problems to Congress .
It is n’t .
It ’s worse . ”
Our contact tells us that the culture stifles creativity on every level .
And “ nothing less than a complete regime change can fix this .
Nothing .
They all have to go .
Wagoner , Lutz , Henderson , all of them . ”
I asked the longtime TTAC reader why he did n’t come forward sooner , and why he does n’t use his real name given that he ’s recently severed his employment with GM .
“ These people are vindictive .
I ’ve seen them go after pensions and benefits of people they ’ve fired .
I ’ve seen careers clubbed like baby seals . ”

Bart Simpson 's Worst Nightmare :
Sideshow Bob Carved From Mexican Turnip
Though it's hard to believe that The Simpsons has been on the air for nearly twenty years , my devotion to the show has not waned .
I 've been a fan for all of those years , following the ups and downs of this simple yellow family and their community .
And yet , there was one character that always seemed a bit underrated to me .
One man who could change the tone of an entire episode with a wink , a nod , and a witty retort .
That man , of course , is Sideshow Bob .
Voiced by the peerless Kelsey Grammer , Bob shows up periodically to torment Bart , frequently comes awfully close to destroying the show 's very foundation , and then disappears for another year or two until his next visit .
Quite an accomplishment , I 'd say .
This , then , is my tribute to Mr. Bob .
If I 'm to continue following this show for the next twenty years , I 'm going to demand a healthy dose of him .
In exchange , each time a Sideshow Bob episode airs , I 'll agree to cook up one of these Spicy Salmon Salads and share it with friends .
Revenge , after all , is best served family style .
Recipe for a Killer Salad
Jicama -- aka the " Mexican Turnip " -- is your best bet for beginning food sculpture .
It 's easy to carve , stays moist and is huge -- giving you lots of room to make mistakes .
Also , if you screw up and want to re-attach an appendage or two , you can just stick a toothpick in it to hold two pieces together .
You 'll need two jicamas for this project -- one for the hair and one for the head .
As far as tools go , nothing fancy is needed .
I used a Kershaw Leek knife for most of the carving and an old Swiss Army knife for the details .
Then I used one of my fancy Shun Knives for serving him ( you can see that picture later ) .
You 'll also need toothpicks to attach the eyes and a paintbrush for applying the food coloring .
I used McCormick 's food coloring since that 's what they had at my local grocery store .
I 'm sure any type would do just fine .
Crafting the Creature
The hardest part of making Bob is keeping the hair from falling apart .
Once the jicama gets spindly , pieces of it start to break off .
The good news is that large chunks can be reattached with toothpicks .
Just make sure you take them out before serving !
Step one is to peel the jicama .
Once you 've done that , you can start shaping the tufts of hair .
Progressively refine them until you 're happy with the basic shape .
You may want to make a few extra in case they fall off .
Also , though you can always do some fine - tuning later , it 's best to get the majority of the carving done before you apply the dye .
Once you 've carved the hair , apply the food coloring liberally with a paintbrush .
You 'll want to leave it ample time to dry since , otherwise , the red coloring will run down onto the face .
I let mine dry overnight .
Once you 've got the hair done , you 're in great shape .
The face is fairly generic , with the only tricky part being the eyes .
I used an un -dyed jicama ball , attached to the eye socket with a toothpick .
A peppercorn in the center completes the look .
Simply push the peppercorn into the eyeball before attaching to the face .
The Perfect Snack ... For Revenge !
I followed this recipe for a Santa Fe Salmon Salad , simply omitting the Jicama and replacing it with my sculpture .
Warning : it 's pretty spicy .
I thought that would be appropriate for this type of project .
Die , Bob , Die !
You 'll need to invite intrepid guests to this party .
I suggest you leave a few sharp knives lying around and then stand back to watch the fun begin .
Of course , Bob would n't be caught dead with a knife as small as a paring knife .
Bring out a large Chef 's knife for the occasion .
Below you 'll see the final product -- a single serving of Sideshow Bob Spicy Salmon Salad .
Give him some time to soak up the jalapeno dressing and you 'll forget all about his creepy look and garish colors .
Mmmmm ... Delicious !
Bart and Lisa would be so proud .

If so , drop me a line so we can compare notes .
Or leave a comment below and let me know what you think .
Max Tegmark observed that we have three independent reasons to believe we live in a Big World : A universe which is large relative to the space of possibilities .
For example , on current physics , the universe appears to be spatially infinite ( though I 'm not clear on how strongly this is implied by the standard model ) .
If the universe is spatially infinite , then , on average , we should expect that no more than 10 ^10 ^ 29 meters away is an exact duplicate of you .
If you 're looking for an exact duplicate of a Hubble volume - an object the size of our observable universe - then you should still on average only need to look 10 ^ 10 ^115 lightyears .
( These are numbers based on a highly conservative counting of " physically possible " states , e.g. packing the whole Hubble volume with potential protons at maximum density given by the Pauli Exclusion principle , and then allowing each proton to be present or absent . )
The most popular cosmological theories also call for an " inflationary " scenario in which many different universes would be eternally budding off , our own universe being only one bud .
And finally there are the alternative decoherent branches of the grand quantum distribution , aka " many worlds " , whose presence is unambiguously implied by the simplest mathematics that fits our quantum experiments .
Ever since I realized that physics seems to tell us straight out that we live in a Big World , I 've become much less focused on creating lots of people , and much more focused on ensuring the welfare of people who are already alive .
If your decision to not create a person means that person will never exist at all , then you might , indeed , be moved to create them , for their sakes .
But if you 're just deciding whether or not to create a new person here , in your own Hubble volume and Everett branch , then it may make sense to have relatively lower populations within each causal volume , living higher qualities of life .
It 's not like anyone will actually fail to be born on account of that decision - they 'll just be born predominantly into regions with higher standards of living .
Am I sure that this statement , that I have just emitted , actually makes sense ?
Not really .
It dabbles in the dark arts of anthropics , and the Dark Arts do n't get much murkier than that .
Or to say it without the chaotic inversion : I am stupid with respect to anthropics .
But to apply the test of simplifiability - it seems in some raw intuitive sense , that if the universe is large enough for everyone to exist somewhere , then we should mainly be worried about giving babies nice futures rather than trying to " ensure they get born " .
Imagine taking a survey of the whole universe .
Every plausible baby gets a little checkmark in the " exists " box - everyone is born somewhere .
In fact , the total population count for each baby is something - or - other , some large number that may or may not be " infinite " -
( I should mention at this point that I am an infinite set atheist , and my main hope for being able to maintain this in the face of a spatially infinite universe is to suggest that identical Hubble volumes add in the same way as any other identical configuration of particles .
So in this case the universe would be exponentially large , the size of the branched decoherent distribution , but the spatial infinity would just fold into that very large but finite object .
And I could still be an infinite set atheist .
I am not a physicist so my fond hope may be ruled out for some reason of which I am not aware . )
- so the first question , anthropically speaking , is whether multiple realizations of the exact same physical process count as more than one person .
Let 's say you 've got an upload running on a computer .
If you look inside the computer and realize that it contains triply redundant processors running in exact synchrony , is that three people or one person ?
How about if the processor is a flat sheet - if that sheet is twice as thick , is there twice as much person inside it ?
If we split the sheet and put it back together again without desynchronizing it , have we created a person and killed them ?
I suppose the answer could be yes ; I have confessed myself stupid about anthropics .
Still : I , as I sit here , am frantically branching into exponentially vast numbers of quantum worlds .
I 've come to terms with that .
It all adds up to normality , after all .
But I do n't see myself as having a little utility counter that frantically increases at an exponential rate , just from my sitting here and splitting .
The thought of splitting at a faster rate does not much appeal to me , even if such a thing could be arranged .
What I do want for myself , is for the largest possible proportion of my future selves to lead eudaimonic existences , that is , to be happy .
This is the " probability " of a good outcome in my expected utility maximization .
I 'm not concerned with having more of me - really , there are plenty of me already - but I do want most of me to be having fun .
I 'm not sure whether or not there exists an imperative for moral civilizations to try to create lots of happy people so as to ensure that most babies born will be happy .
But suppose that you started off with 1 baby existing in unhappy regions for every 999 babies existing in happy regions .
Would it make sense for the happy regions to create ten times as many babies leading one - tenth the quality of life , so that the universe was " 99.99 % sorta happy and 0.01 % unhappy " instead of " 99.9 % really happy and 0.1 % unhappy " ?
On the face of it , I 'd have to answer " No . " ( Though it depends on how unhappy the unhappy regions are ; and if we start off with the universe mostly unhappy , well , that 's a pretty unpleasant possibility ... )
But on the whole , it looks to me like if we decide to implement a policy of routinely killing off citizens to replace them with happier babies , or if we lower standards of living to create more people , then we are n't giving the " gift of existence " to babies who would n't otherwise have it .
We 're just setting up the universe to contain the same babies , born predominantly into regions where they lead short lifespans not containing much happiness .
Once someone has been born into your Hubble volume and your Everett branch , you can't undo that ; it becomes the responsibility of your region of existence to give them a happy future .
You can't hand them back by killing them .
That just makes their average lifespan shorter .
It seems to me that in a Big World , the people who already exist in your region have a much stronger claim on your charity than babies who have not yet been born into your region in particular .
And that 's why , when there is research to be done , I do it not just for all the future babies who will be born - but , yes , for the people who already exist in our local region , who are already our responsibility .
For the good of all of us , except the ones who are dead .
Fears that scores of supermarket suppliers will go bust next year have led the country 's major chains to draw up emergency plans to replace them , The Observer can reveal .
Separately , on the high street , bailiffs are getting ready for their busiest Christmas ever , with a slew of retailers expected to go into administration .
Supermarket chain Asda , led by Andy Bond , is working on ' worst - case scenarios ' across the board - combing its supplier base and examining alternatives to them .
' Suppliers are under a lot of pressure and there will be casualties , ' said a senior executive at another store chain , which has already stepped in to pay troubled suppliers ahead of schedule .
' We need each other , it is not a zero - sum game . '
The need for alternative supply lines has been brought into focus by the collapse of Woolworths and its distribution arm , EUK , which supplied the supermarkets as well as Zavvi , the former Virgin Megastores , with CDs .
However , cracks have been showing in other areas , with milk processor Dairy Farmers of Britain in the midst of a restructuring that will see two dairies close and up to 640 jobs lost .
The damage a collapsed supplier can do is laid bare at Zavvi , which has been destabilised during the most important sales weeks of the year .
It has been forced to suspend its website with former parent Virgin stumping up a £ 5 m ' fighting fund ' to keep shelves filled in the key trading days left between now and Christmas .
But with no obvious successor to step into the void left by EUK , Zavvi faces a grim outlook in 2009 .
Tesco said it was supporting suppliers that needed extra help by giving an indication of future orders .
' The worst thing for a supermarket is for a supplier to go under , because you are left with a big hole and investing in a new one is a big deal , ' said a Tesco spokesman .
Analysts say the supply of ready meals is vulnerable .
Major players include the heavily indebted Premier Foods and Icelandic group Bakkavor .
The latter has £ 140 m trapped in collapsed Icelandic bank Kaupthing , although it says its UK operation , which supplies all the major grocers , is not affected .
Relationships between supermarkets and suppliers are often tense at the best of times .
Suppliers hoping for additional protection from the powerful supermarkets - who have been accused of making unreasonable demands in price negotiations - look set to be disappointed as the Competition Commission 's plan to create an ombudsman looks doomed .
Asda will not sign up to the scheme , so the matter looks set for referral to the government 's business department in the new year .
The collapse of Woolworths has come to symbolise the dire state of the high street , where retailers are facing the worst trading conditions in a generation .
And with a spate of administrations expected early in the new year , bailiffs are gearing up for a festive feeding frenzy around ' quarter day ' - when even struggling retailers must find three months ' rent - which falls on Christmas Day .
' We have had more instructions than ever before and I 've been in this career for 21 years , ' said Jon Dawkins , chief executive of bailiffs ' firm Dawkins , whose clients include the Crown Estate , Transport for London , asset managers Prudential and Threadneedle , as well as all the major property agents .
Landlords want to get their cash while retailers still have money in the tills after the Christmas rush - and before administrators are called in and cash is ringfenced for secured creditors .
Gold Red Alert - Gold Price Backwardation first time in History !
December 2 , 2008 , was a landmark in the saga of the collapsing international monetary system , yet it did not deserve to be reported in the press : gold went to backwardation for the first time ever in history .
The facts are as follows : on December 2nd , at the Comex in New York , December gold futures ( last delivery : December 31 ) were quoted at 1.98 % discount to spot , while February gold futures ( last delivery : February 27 , 2009 ) were quoted at 0.14 % discount to spot .
( All percentages annualized . )
The condition got worse on December 3rd , when the corresponding figures were 2 % and 0.29 % .
This means that the gold basis has turned negative , and the condition of backwardation persisted for at least 48 hours .
I am writing this in the wee hours of December 4th , when trading of gold futures has not yet started in New York .
According to the December 3rd Comex delivery report , there are 11,759 notices to take delivery .
This represents 1.1759 million ounces of gold , while the Comex - approved warehouses hold 2.9 million ounces .
Thus 40 % of the total amount will have to be delivered by December 31st .
Since not all the gold in the warehouses is available for delivery , Comex supply of gold falls far short of the demand at present rates .
Futures markets in gold are breaking down .
Paper gold is progressively being discredited .
Already there was a slight backwardation in gold at the expiry of a previous active contract month , but it never spilled over to the next active contract month , as it does now : backwardation in the December contract is spilling over to the February contract which at last reading was 0.36 % .
Silver is also in backwardation , with the discount on silver futures being about twice that on gold futures .
As those who attended my seminar on the gold basis in Canberra last month know , the gold basis is a pristine , incorruptible measure of trust , or the lack of it in case it turns negative , in paper money .
Of course , it is too early to say whether gold has gone to permanent backwardation , or whether the condition will rectify itself ( it probably will ) .
Be that as it may , it does not matter .
The fact that it has happened is the coup de grâce for the regime of irredeemable currency .
It will bleed to death , maybe rather slowly , even if no other hits , blows , or shocks are dealt to the system .
Very few people realize what is going on and , of course , official sources and the news media wo n't be helpful to them to explain the significance of all this .
I am trying to be helpful to the discriminating reader .
Gold going to permanent backwardation means that gold is no longer for sale at any price , whether it is quoted in dollars , yens , euros , or Swiss francs .
The situation is exactly the same as it has been for years : gold is not for sale at any price quoted in Zimbabwe currency , however high the quote is .
To put it differently , all offers to sell gold are being withdrawn , whether it concerns newly mined gold , scrap gold , bullion gold or coined gold .
I dubbed this event that has cast its long shadow forward for many a year , the last contango in Washington ― contango being the name for the condition opposite to backwardation ( namely , that of a positive basis ) , and Washington being the city where the Paper - mill of the Potomac , the Federal Reserve Board , is located .
This is a tongue - in - cheek way of saying that the jig in Washington is up .
The music has stopped on the players of ‘ musical chairs ' .
Those who have no gold in hand are out of luck .
They wo n't get it now through the regular channels .
If they want it , they will have to go to the black market .
I founded Gold Standard University Live ( GSUL ) two years ago and dedicated it to research of monetary issues that are pointedly ignored by universities , government think - tanks , and the financial press , centered around the question of long - term viability of the regime of irredeemable currency .
Historical experiments with that type of currency were many but all of them , without exception , have ended in ignominious failure accompanied with great economic pain , unless the experiment was called off in good time and the authorities returned to monetary rectitude , that is , to a metallic monetary standard .
It is also worth pointing out that the present experiment is unique in that all countries of the world indulge in it .
Not one country is on a metallic monetary standard , under which the Treasury and the Central Bank are subject to the same contract law as ordinary citizens .
They cannot issue irredeemable promises to pay and keep them in monetary circulation through a conspiracy known as check - kiting .
Not one country will be spared from the fire and brimstone that once rained on the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah as a punishment of God for immoral behavior .
In all previous episodes there were some countries around that did not listen to the siren song and stayed on the gold standard .
They could give a helping hand to the deviant ones , thus limiting economic pain .
Today there are no such countries .
If you want to be saved , you must be prepared to save yourself .
You cannot understand the process whereby a fiat money system self - destructs without understanding the gold and silver basis .
The Quantity Theory of Money does not provide an explanation , because deflation may well precede hyperinflation , as it appears to be the case right now .
For these reasons I placed the study of the gold and silver basis on the top of the list of research topics for GSUL .
These can serve as an early warning system that will signal the beginning of the end .
The end is approaching with the inevitability of the climax in a Greek tragedy , as the heroes and heroines are drawn to their own destruction .
The present reactionary experiment with paper money is entering its death - throes .
GSUL has had five sessions and could have established itself as an important , and even the only , source of information about this cataclysmic event : the confrontation of the Titanic ( representing the international monetary system ) with the iceberg ( representing gold and its vanishing basis ) as the latter is emerging from the fog too late to avoid collision .
Unfortunately , this was not meant to be : GSUL has to terminate its operations due to a decision made by Mr. Eric Sprott , of Sprott Asset Management , to terminate sponsoring GSUL , saying that “ results do not justify the expense . ”
I sincerely regret that our activities did not live up to the expectations of Mr. Sprott , but I am very proud of the fact that our research is still the only source of information on the vanishing gold basis and its corollary , the seizing up of the paper money system that threatens the world , as it does , with a Great Depression eclipsing that of the 1930's .
Let me summarize the salient points of discussion during the last two sessions of GSUL for the benefit of those who wanted to attend but could n't .
The gold basis is the difference between the futures and the cash price of gold .
More precisely it is the price of the nearby active futures contract in the gold futures market minus the cash price of physical gold in the spot market .
Historically it has been positive ever since gold futures trading started at the Winnipeg Commodity Exchange in 1972 ( except for some rare hiccups at the triple - witching hour .
Such deviations have been called ‘ logistical ' in nature , having to do with the simultaneous expiry of gold futures and the put and call option contracts on them .
In all these instances the anomaly of a negative basis resolved itself in a matter of a few hours . )
In the commodity futures markets the terminus technicus for a positive basis is contango ; that for a negative one , backwardation .
Contango implies the existence of a healthy supply of the commodity in the warehouses available for immediate delivery , while backwardation implies shortages and conjures up the scraping of the bottom of the barrel .
The basis is limited on the upside by the carrying charges ; but there is no limit on the downside as it can fall to any negative value ( meaning that the cash price may exceed the futures price by any amount , however large ) .
Contango whereby the futures price of gold is quoted at a premium to the spot price is the normal condition for the gold market , and for a very good reason , too .
The supply of monetary gold in the world is very large relatively speaking .
Babbling about the ‘ scarcity of gold ' reflects the opinion of uninformed or badly informed people .
In terms of the ratio of stocks to flows the supply of gold is far and away greater than that of any commodity .
Silver is second only to gold .
It is this fact that makes the two of them the only monetary metals .
The impact on the gold price of a discovery of an extremely rich gold field , or the coming on stream of an extremely rich gold mine , is minimal ― in view of the large existing stocks .
Paradoxically , what makes gold valuable is not its scarcity but its relative abundance , which evokes that superb confidence in the steadiness of the value of gold that will not be decreased by a banner production year , nor can it be increased by withdrawing gold coins from circulation .
For this reason there is no better fly - wheel regulator for the value of currency than gold .
The same goes , albeit to a lesser degree , for silver .
Here is the fundamental difference between the monetary metal , gold , and other commodities .
Backwardation will pull in stocks from the moon as it were , if need be .
The cure for the backwardation of any commodity is more backwardation .
For gold , there is no cure .
Backwardation in gold is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon : it is a reminder of the incurable pathology of paper money .
It dramatizes the decay of the regime of irredeemable currency .
It can only get worse .
As confidence in the value of fiat money is a fragile thing , it will not get better .
It depicts the paper dollar as Humpty Dumpty who sat on a wall and had a great fall and , now , “ all the king 's horses and all the king 's men could not put Humpty Dumpty together again . ”
To paraphrase a proverb , give paper currency a bad name , you might as well scrap it .
Once entrenched , backwardation in gold means that the cancer of the dollar has reached its terminal stages .
The progressively evaporating trust in the value of the irredeemable dollar can no longer be stopped .
Negative basis ( backwardation ) means that people controlling the supply of monetary gold cannot be persuaded to part with it , regardless of the bait .
These people are no speculators .
They are neither Scrooges nor Shylocks .
They are highly capable businessmen with a conservative frame of mind .
They are determined to preserve their capital come hell or high water , for saner times , so they can re-deploy it under a saner government and a saner monetary system .
Their instrument is the ownership of monetary gold .
They blithely ignore the siren song promising risk - free profits .
Indeed , they could sell their physical gold in the spot market and buy it back at a discount in the futures market for delivery in 30 days .
In any other commodity , traders controlling supply would jump at the opportunity .
The lure of risk - free profits would be irresistible .
Not so in the case of gold .
Owners refuse to be coaxed out of their gold holdings , however large the bait may be .
Why ?
Well , they do n't believe that the physical gold will be there and available for delivery in 30 days ' time .
They do n't want to be stuck with paper gold , which is useless for their purposes of capital preservation .
December 2 is a landmark , because before that date the monetary system could have been saved by opening the U.S.
Mint to gold .
Now , given the fact of gold backwardation , it is too late .
The last chance to avoid disaster has been missed .
The proverbial last straw has broken the back of the camel .
I have often been told that the U.S. Mint is already open to gold , witness the Eagle and Buffalo gold coins .
But these issues were neither unlimited , nor were they coined free of seigniorage .
They were sold at a premium over bullion content .
They were a red herring , dropped to make people believe that gold coins can always be obtained from the U.S. Mint , and from other government mints of the world .
However , as the experience of the past two or three months shows , one mint after another stopped taking orders for gold coins and suspended their gold operations .
The reason is that the flow of gold to the mints has become erratic .
It may dry up altogether .
This shows that the foreboding has been evoked by the looming gold backwardation , way ahead of the event .
Now the truth is out : you can no longer coax gold out of hiding with paper profits .
If the governments of the great trading nations had really wanted to save the world from a catastrophic collapse of world trade , then they should have opened their mints to gold .
Now gold backwardation has caught up with us and shut down the free flow of gold in the system .
This will have catastrophic consequences .
Few people realize that the shutting down of the gold trade , which is what is happening , means the shutting down of world trade .
This is a financial earthquake measuring ten on the Greenspan scale , with epicenter at the Comex in New York , where the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center once stood .
It is no exaggeration to say that this event will trigger a tsunami wiping out the prosperity of the world .

The technology put to work in a bike fitting is often an attention - grabber .
Lasers , cameras , data readouts and computer imagery that can be manipulated to be seen from multiple views add a certain sizzle to a process that was previously , more often than not , an eyeball estimation .
A system called Retül , for instance , uses three - dimensional motion - capture technology .
Eight light - emitting diodes are placed at various key points on a cyclist ’s body .
When the cyclist gets on the bike and pedals , they flash every 2.1 milliseconds reportedly to deliver 29 full sets of body data " to a central computer .
And yet , according to the very best bike fitters in business , it is the experience level of the technician , not the technology or the cost of the service , that most accurately determines fitting quality .

“ We like to say that you can give a monkey a machine gun , but that does n’t mean he ’ll know how to use it , ” said Sean Madsen , a biomechanist at the Boulder Center for Sports Medicine in Colorado , which is considered to be among the best fitters in the country .
Colin O’Brien , the owner of Cronometro , a custom bike shop in Madison , Wis. , that charges $ 240 to $ 290 for its biodynamic bike fit , said : “ There are probably about 12 to 15 bike fitters in North America that have elevated the bike - fitting process to an art form .
Then there are the between 50 to 100 that offer upper grade fittings , and thousands more who have gone through the bike fit classes offered by Specialized and Serotta , ” the bike makers .
Hot foot .
Tingling toes .
Hand numbness .
Lower - back soreness .
Hamstring discomfort .
The alleviation of those types of pain complaints , all common among cyclists , is the usual justification offered for the time and money spent on this type of fitting .
To the trained eye of a bike fitter , there are certain clearly recognizable alterations that can be made to eliminate pain that , as Mr. O’Brien said , “ you should n’t be feeling . ”
Knee pain in the patella is often alleviated by moving the seat forward or backward .
Neck discomfort can be resolved by moving up the handlebars .
Lower - back pain is sometimes lessened by marginally lowering the seat .
The significance of these seemingly inconsequential alterations , Mr. O’Brien said , becomes clear when one is reminded that , over the course of a two - hour ride , a cyclist will make about 10,000 pedal revolutions .
The pain and discomfort may be dull at the outset , but it can gradually intensify .
In one of the largest and most brazen attacks of its kind , suspected Taliban insurgents with heavy weapons attacked two truck stops in northwest Pakistan on Sunday , destroying more than 150 vehicles carrying supplies bound for U.S. - led troops in Afghanistan .
The predawn attack on the outskirts of the city of Peshawar left the grounds of the truck terminals littered with the burned - out shells of Humvees and other military vehicles being transported by private truckers .
At least one guard was reported killed .
Early today , a second attack on Western supplies was reported in the same area .
A security guard said 50 containers had been burned and some vehicles destroyed by rocket fire .
The guard said that militants stormed a truck terminal and fought a light gun-battle with security personnel , who surrendered .
The militants told the guards to stop working for NATO , and then poured gasoline over the containers and lit them .

Peshawar abuts Pakistan ’s barely governed tribal areas , which are rife with violence .
With attention focused on tensions between India and Pakistan in the wake of the attacks in Mumbai last month , U.S. officials are concerned that the government in Islamabad will throttle back on its confrontation with militants in the tribal areas , opening the door to more such strikes .
U.S. military officials in Afghanistan declined to specify the number of vehicles destroyed in Sunday ’s attack , but described the losses as militarily insignificant .
The bold assault underscored the vulnerability of supplies moving by road through Pakistan .
About three - quarters of the supplies bound for U.S. and North Atlantic Treaty Organization troops in Afghanistan -- fuel , food and equipment -- travel by road through perilous mountain passes after being shipped to the port of Karachi .
Afghanistan has no sea access .
Militant attacks on Western supply convoys here have been gaining force in recent weeks .
Most of the assaults have occurred as they moved through the tribal areas on their way to the historic Khyber Pass that leads into Afghanistan .

Nearly a month ago , militants hijacked a convoy of more than a dozen vehicles .
Then last week , 22 trucks were torched at a truck stop .
Witnesses to the Sunday assault said the attackers fired rocket - propelled grenades before overrunning the two depots and burning dozens of trucks .
Pakistani police did not arrive at the scene until about 40 minutes later , they said .
Pakistan briefly closed the Khyber Pass to military traffic after the Nov. 10 hijacking , but later reopened it , saying convoys would be guarded by Pakistani paramilitary troops .
Peshawar itself is also on edge .
The death toll in a car bombing Friday in the crowded city center rose to 29 .
Authorities said the blast might have been the result of sectarian tensions , but no group claimed responsibility .

Small devices could soon be powered with nothing more than ambient sound Engineers have doubled the efficiency of piezoelectric devices that harvest energy from movement and vibration .
The trick lies purely in the size of the devices : a narrow range of thicknesses around 5,000 times thinner than a human hair .
The result means that " self - powered " devices , such as phones that charge when you speak into them , are one step closer to reality .
The research was reported in the journal Physical Review B .
The piezoelectric effect occurs in some crystalline and ceramic materials .
Stretching or compressing them causes a separation of electric charge across their width , and that sets up a voltage that can be put to use .
Such piezoelectric materials have been in use for years in devices such as electronic lighters and microphones , where pressure from a thumb or even a sound wave is harvested .
More recently , plans to engineer piezoelectrics that collect energy from footsteps or the motion of clothing have made it to the drawing board .
Several clubs even incorporate piezoelectrics into their dance floors , recycling a small part of the energy imparted by clubgoers .
Size matters
However , the behaviour of materials in comparatively large devices can change radically when pared down to the nanometre scale .
What Tahir Cagin and his colleagues at Texas A&M University have found is that when piezoelectric materials are made in a narrow size range around 20 nanometres ( billionths of a metre ) , a new effect comes into play .
A piezo layer below this dancefloor makes clubbing more green
This " flexoelectric effect " produces a voltage from twisting and bending , instead of the uniform compression or stretching as in piezoelectricity .
The researchers proved that the effect can be maximised in nano - scale cantilevers - beams like tiny diving boards that generate a voltage - by tailoring the cantilevers ' shape .
The theoretical study shows that the effect could as much as triple the amount of electricity available , gram for gram , from piezoelectric materials .
Piezoelectric materials have long been used in microphones and pick - ups for acoustic instruments , with the pressure wave of sound or simple vibration creating an electric signal .
The new results mean that such sounds or vibrations produce significantly more charge that can be gathered up and put to use .
" Even the disturbances in the form of sound waves ... may be harvested for powering nano - and micro-devices of the future if these materials are processed and manufactured appropriately for this purpose , " Professor Cagin said .
That means that instead of the tiny electric signal produced in a microphone , piezoelectrics tailored at the nano - scale could directly power small devices or charge a battery .

Flashback : Rove Threatened GOP IT Guru If He Does Not ‘ Take the Fall ’ for Election Fraud in Ohio , Says Attorney
Michael Connell , the Bush IT expert who has been directly implicated in the rigging of George Bush ’s 2000 and 2004 elections , was killed last night when his single engine plane crashed three miles short of the Akron airport .
Velvet Revolution ( “ VR ” ) , a non-profit that has been investigating Mr. Connell ’s activities for the past two years , can now reveal that a person close to Mr. Connell has recently been discussing with a VR investigator how he can tell all about his work for George Bush .
Mr. Connell told a close associate that he was afraid that George Bush and Dick Cheney would “ throw [ him ] under the bus . ”
A tipster close to the McCain campaign disclosed to VR in July that Mr. Connell ’s life was in jeopardy and that Karl Rove had threatened him and his wife , Heather .
VR ’s attorney , Cliff Arnebeck , notified the United States Attorney General , Ohio law enforcement and the federal court about these threats and insisted that Mr. Connell be placed in protective custody .
VR also told a close associate of Mr. Connell ’s not to fly his plane because of another tip that the plane could be sabotaged .
Mr. Connell , a very experienced pilot , has had to abandon at least two flights in the past two months because of suspicious problems with his plane .
On December 18 , 2008 , Mr. Connell flew to a small airport outside of Washington DC to meet some people .
It was on his return flight the next day that he crashed .
On October 31 , Mr. Connell appeared before a federal judge in Ohio after being subpoenaed in a federal lawsuit investigating the rigging of the 2004 election under the direction of Karl Rove .
The judge ordered Mr. Connell to testify under oath at a deposition on November 3rd , the day before the presidential election .
Velvet Revolution received confidential information that the White House was extremely concerned about Mr. Connell talking about his illegal work for the White House and two Bush / Cheney 04 attorneys were dispatched to represent him .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
An associate of Mr. Connell ’s told VR that Mr. Connell was involved with the destruction of the White House emails and the setting up of the off - grid White House email system .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Mr. Connell handled all of John McCain ’s computer work in the recent presidential campaign .
VR has received direct evidence that the McCain campaign kept abreast of the legal developments against Mr. Connell by reading the VR dedicated website , www.rovecybergate.com.
VR demands that the Ohio Attorney General and the United States Justice Department conduct a complete investigation into the activities of Mr. Connell and determine whether there was any foul play in his death .
VR demands that federal law enforcement officials place the following people under protective custody pending this investigation .
Heather Connell who is the owner of GovTech Solutions , Randy Cole , the former President of GovTech Solutions , and Jeff Averbeck , the CEO of SmartTech in Chattanooga , Tennessee .
Both GovTech and SmartTech have been implicated in the rigging of the 2000 and 2004 elections and the White House email scandal .
Our prior request to have Mr. Connell protected went unheeded and now he is dead .
American International Group Inc. , the insurer that vowed to temper spending after hosting a conference at a California resort amid a federal bailout , plans to sponsor a similar event at a $ 400 - a- night hotel .
Next week 's conference is to be held at the Ritz - Carlton in California 's Half Moon Bay , said spokesman Nicholas Ashooh .
The White House , Congress and Barack Obama castigated AIG this week for spending $ 440,000 last month at the St. Regis resort in Monarch Beach .
" Whether the company 's behavior is wrong on an absolute basis does n't really matter right now , " said Heather Elms , a business professor at the Kogod School of Business at American University in Washington .
" It 's become a question of perception , and it seems that they 're being viewed as behaving unethically . "
AIG , which got an $ 85 billion loan from the U.S. government last month , borrowed another $ 37.8 billion from the Federal Reserve yesterday to " replenish liquidity , " the Fed said .
Chief Executive Officer Edward Liddy told Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson yesterday that the company will rethink expenses .
" We understand that our company is now facing very different challenges , " Liddy wrote in a letter to Paulson .
" We owe our employees and the American public new standards and approaches . "
Next week 's event aims to " motivate and educate " about 150 independent agents who sell AIG coverage to high - end clients , said spokesman Nicholas Ashooh .
' Bad idea '
AIG considered buying advertisements to explain its position , only to be told by its public - relations consultant , George Sard , that it would be " a really bad idea . "
" To spend the taxpayer 's money on an expensive ad campaign to apologize for how you used taxpayer money leaves you open to further attacks , " Sard wrote in an e-mail to Ashooh .
Sard , chief executive officer of New York - based Sard Verbinnen & Co. , said the message was a private e-mail mistakenly sent to Bloomberg and was n't intended to be a public statement .
" Anyone who knows the financial industry knows there is excess , even in normal times , " said Bruce Kogut , an ethics professor at Columbia Business School in New York .
" These are not normal times . "
White House spokeswoman Dana Perino called " despicable " expenses from the first gathering , a weeklong conference at the St. Regis Resort in Monarch Beach that began days after the U.S. agreed to give AIG the $ 85 billion .
Those costs included $ 23,000 for spa services , according to Representative Henry Waxman , chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee .
AIG should repay
Obama , the Democratic presidential nominee , said during last night 's debate with Republican candidate John McCain that AIG should repay the U.S. Treasury for the costs of the event .
" The Treasury should demand that money back and those executives should be fired , " Obama said .
In his letter to Paulson , Liddy said the St. Regis gathering was planned " many months " before the Fed 's initial loan to AIG .
Next week 's meeting was also planned before the loan , Ashooh said .
" This sort of gathering has been standard practice in our industry for many years , " Liddy wrote .
" Let me assure you that we are reevaluating the costs of all aspects of our operations in light of the new circumstances in which we are all operating . "
About 50 AIG employees will also attend the Half Moon Bay meeting .
Ashooh said he did n't know the cost of the event or how long it would last .
Next week 's meeting has more of an educational component than the St. Regis event , he said .
Receipts provided by Waxman for the earlier conference at the St. Regis were dated Sept. 22 through Sept. 30 .
AIG agreed to the $ 85 billion loan from the government on Sept. 16 , ceding a 79.9 percent ownership interest to the U.S. government .
Red Sox owner John
Henry e-mailed several media members late tonight with a stunning twist in the team ’s pursuit of free - agent first baseman Mark Teixeira .
Henry ’s words : “ We met with Mr. Teixeira and were very much impressed with him .
After hearing about his other offers , however , it seems clear that we are not going to be a factor . ”
Earlier tonight , multiple news outlets reported the Red Sox had traveled to Texas to meet with Teixeira and his agent , Scott Boras , in the hopes of trying to finalize a deal .
WCVB -TV Channel 5 reported that the Red Sox had offered Teixeira an eight - year deal worth $ 184 million ( an average of $ 23 million per season ) .
Advertisement
Five teams have been in the hunt for Teixeira to some extent — the Sox , Angels , Yankees , Orioles , and Nationals — and all indications had been pointing to the Red Sox as the frontrunners .
Henry ’s reference to the “ other offers ” leaves open the possibility he is calling the bluff of Boras , who has been known to inflate the value of offers and the number of suitors pursuing his client .
Boras represented former Red Sox center fielder Johnny Damon , who signed with the New York Yankees in 2005 after the Boston brass apparently refused to believe that the offer from their archrivals was real .
Earlier this week , Henry had expressed concern about granting a player a contract of eight years or more .
“ We all have limits , ” he wrote the AP on Wednesday .
“ Eight years is a very long time in baseball and everywhere else . ”
He also said the amount the team is willing to spend on a free agent “ depends on both ” the economy and the player being sought .
“ Baseball as a whole has not yet been hit by the financial crisis , but it will , ” Henry said .
“ The degree is in question and wo n’t be answered for a while . ”
Additionally , Henry wrote in an e-mail to the Herald that the Red Sox would not give a 10 - year contract to any free agent .

Teixeira hit .308 with 33 homers and 121 RBIs last season , including .358 with 13 homers and 43 RBIs in 54 games with the Angels .

Can Wal - Mart save U.S. healthcare ?
A great article by Chris Brown for the Mises Institute on the U.S. healthcare system .
Brown correctly points out that in America we DO NOT have a free market in the health care industry .
In fact , one of the most startling facts in the article is mentioned in this paragraph :
" ... the US government accounted for over 45 % of all US healthcare expenditures in 2006 ; it spends almost 20 % of GDP on healthcare ; indeed , it spends more per capita than any other OECD country , including those with socialist , government - funded healthcare .
In short , this is not a free market . "
Did you hear that Canada ?
The U.S. government spends more per person on health care than you !
You 'll have to increase your spending , lest ye be outdone by the coldhearted " free market " U.S. !
( Notice thick sarcasm )
The truth is our health care industry in America is a mess of regulations , subsidies , taxes , and bureaucracy .
It is a managed cartel .
Industry players have lobbied hard to get into monopoly positions and exclude competition .
Fortunately for consumers , you just can't keep those pesky entrepreneurs down .
Brown describes how Wal - Mart is leading the way in offering cheap , quick , quality health care to more and more consumers , despite all the government obstacles and industry insiders seeking to limit the provision of care to themselves .
" Wal - Mart now offers walk - in , inexpensive healthcare services by leasing store space to private health clinics .
This service , combined with an in - store pharmacy that offers $ 4 prescriptions , will offer these services to millions of people , and there is no requirement to have health insurance .
Consider this : Wal - Mart 's $ 4 prescription program has saved customers over $ 1 billion dollars since its inception .
Prices are a flat fee of around $ 45 per visit , and are well advertised , i.e. , there is no guess work , and price transparency exists .
Contrast this with a typical doctor 's visit where you might not know what you are paying until three months later . "
See where serving the customer gets you with the big government loving cartels and monopolies :
" ... some physicians are ( correctly ) worried since they will have to struggle to compete with Wal - Mart 's healthcare .
Most physicians earn their revenue from " quick " visits — the " simpler " the illness , the quicker the visit — which means more customers , and more revenue .
Wal - Mart will now be treating those patients and receiving revenue from customers , which formerly would have gone to physicians .
Similarly , the AMA cartel could receive a " prescription " from Wal - Mart on learning how to foster innovation , as opposed to stagnation , to maintain relevance .
Other organizations , such as the American Academy of Pediatrics , instead of attempting to compete , intransigently and stubbornly cling to their antediluvian practices by merely writing position papers opposing retail clinics such as Wal - Mart . "
None of this is because Wal - Mart is benevolent and the cartels are greedy .
Both parties are self interested ( ALL parties are self interested ... that means you too ) .
But as Adam Smith so deftly explained in The Wealth of Nations some 232 years ago , competition is the only way to keep our economic self - interest in check , and indeed , in a free - market each person 's self interest is led , " As if by an invisible hand " to the benefit of everyone .
Wal - Mart is helping more and more people ( particularly those with low incomes ) get health care because they want to be more profitable and be better than their competition .
Freedom leads them to offer what their customers want .
Customers are the only ones with the dollars they seek , and to get those dollars they must please the customers - customers are their master .
The cartels and government sanctioned monopolies on the other hand will seek to beat their competition not by pleasing consumers of their services , but by pleasing their masters - government .
If you want better health care ( or better anything ) , do n't let government become the master of the industry .
It 's a lot better for you when you 're the master .
In February , Western Standard general manager Kalim Kassam argued that Wal - Mart founder Sam Walton deserves the Nobel Peace Prize .

BTW - you Canadians do realize the data revealed above severely limits your bragging rights about how much more socialist your country is than mine .
Who 's fighting for liberty in the more hostile environment now !
What 's that ?
You 're government spends how much per person on health care ?
That 's what I thought .
Complain about how socialist your country is when you can keep up with the massive government in mine !
Ha !

Competition drives the market .
The government controls it .
Health care may be over - regulated now , but I hate to see what it will be like under the pending new administration .
Free markets are exactly that -- free .
Within the confines of current regulatory restrictions from state to state , healthcare providers , insurance companies and others in the medical community must navigate a host of laws to make money .
Everyone knows the basics of Economics 101 .
When a business does not make money , it goes out of business .
As the health care industry struggles to find consistency , profitability , transparency , and functionality in an ever - increasing suffocating government sanctioned legislative morass , Americans suffer in the mean time with costs that have spiraled ever upward to pay for those who choose to have " free " health care .
Americans deserve the privilege to have multiple options for health care .
Competition drives price .
When their is a monopoly , everyone pays more , including taxpayers who must bear the cost .
Universal health care is not the answer .
Companies like Wal - Mart understand that cheaper is sometimes better .
And consumers understand that keeping more of their money is better than giving it away to the government or to health care providers who charge too much .

Is n't the invisible hand of the free market what Alan Greenspan was depending on ?
http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/24/business/economy/24panel.html
Regulation in and of itself is not a bad thing .
I am sure we are all happy that there are drug and food regulations .
The real question in healthcare is n't competition .
Do you really decide based on the lowest price for a doctor when your children are sick ?
Access is the most important one thing for healthcare .
You can slag Canada and the rest of the world all you want , statistically they live longer and more healthy than the U.S .

Maybe Tyrrell , but it has nothing to do with our socialist system .
And yes , sometimes you do decide on the cheapest doctor , rather than the best .
But atleast you get access to a qualified physician .
Canada has shown that great doctors leave a socialist health care system .
The doctor I had as a kid went on to be a Floridian surgeon .
Your kids are left with nothing but the cheapest doctors , because all the good ones have left the country .
If you look at Soviet Socialism , everyone either jumped the fence or became alcoholics .
Read Atlas Shrugged .

Your 8 - months pregnant girlfriend starts bleeding , you 're going to take her to Wal - Mart , right ?
You loose a finger in some industrial machine , and Wal - Mart will sow it back ?
Oh , but you were talking about cheap medicine , let 's talk about it then .
Cheap medicine is sold to stupid people in need of a placebo since they just wo n't drink glasses of water and go to bed early to help themselves .
4 $ for diabetes - control pills , high blood pressure regulators ?
Good for you if this is the case ... but I 've seen americans in remote areas who seemingly did not have a ' Mart nearby ; they were all waiting for some health - care help helicopters to lend and volunteers to set " clinic camps " so that they could see a doctor , a dentist , an optician ... the founder of the organisation said : " My volunteers and me use to work in third - world countries ... we realized we were just as needed here in the poorest parts of America " .

Dozens of children left messages on the page claiming to have carried out attacks on " National Kick a Ginger Day " on Thursday , Nov 20 , and a girl in Alberta , Canada claimed that she and her 13 - year - old sister were punched and kicked by pupils at their school .
Maybe the polls are wrong , and John McCain is about to pull off the biggest election upset in American history .
But right now the Democrats seem poised both to win the White House and to greatly expand their majorities in both houses of Congress .
Most of the post-election discussion will presumably be about what the Democrats should and will do with their mandate .
But let me ask a different question that will also be important for the nation ’s future :
What will defeat do to the Republicans ?
You might think , perhaps hope , that Republicans will engage in some soul - searching , that they ’ll ask themselves whether and how they lost touch with the national mainstream .
But my prediction is that this wo n’t happen any time soon .
Instead , the Republican rump , the party that ’s left after the election , will be the party that attends Sarah Palin ’s rallies , where crowds chant “ Vote McCain , not Hussein ! ”
It will be the party of Saxby Chambliss , the senator from Georgia , who , observing large - scale early voting by African - Americans , warns his supporters that “ the other folks are voting . ”
It will be the party that harbors menacing fantasies about Barack Obama ’s Marxist  or was that Islamic ?
 roots .
Daily Cal Columnist
If you 're reading this column you probably live somewhere in the vicinity of UC Berkeley , a university that is famous ( or infamous ) for a few things .
One would be deeply depressed nerds bawling over their latest midterm - a stereotype I see a great deal ( in the mirror ) .
Another may be the amazing scientific research that goes on in the laboratories all around campus , or the infectious activist spirit , the large homeless population , a fantastic academic environment and last , but certainly not least , marijuana .
Yes , everyone from Berkeley has almost certainly come in contact with Cal 's favorite plant somehow , most likely by walking down Telegraph Avenue .
I never really enjoy it when I 'm out for a stroll and the unmistakable smell mauls my nostrils , but in the end it 's just another one of those lovable Berkeley quirks .
However , marijuana outside of Berkeley and similarly � umm � " mellow " towns is a tricky subject .
Many people have a very negative association with the drug or just do n't want to get caught up in the legalities involved .
The federal government has a strong ban on any cannabis product , classifying it as a Schedule 1 drug .
This means that , according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency , marijuana can do severe damage to the human body , is highly addictive and does not have any medical purposes .
Funny how science disagrees with all three of those statements , as does the state of California .
Under state law , marijuana is legally obtainable for a documented medical condition that may cause excessive pain , nausea and other uncomfortable effects .
Right now many people in California with diseases like cancer , multiple sclerosis and chronic back pain need marijuana to be able to function and are technically in violation of federal law because of it .
Yay federalism and its effectiveness !
Another unpleasant side effect of the federal government 's ban is the lack of testing that can be done with cannabis and its derivatives .
New research in other countries has suggested that marijuana products can be applied to shrink tumors and even reduce neurological damage done by AIDS and Alzheimer's .
Drugs derived from cannabis are in late clinical trials in Europe and one drug is already on the market in Canada , according to an article on slate.com .
The United States , however , is making far less headway with marijuana research .
Now we Americans have to ask ourselves if an age - old stigma is blocking serious research into curing the diseases of potentially millions of people .
By now , some people may have a hippie warning siren going off in their head .
Conservative fathers everywhere are putting my name on a blacklist in case I ever try to date their daughters , further reducing my chances with women .
I assure you I 'm not advocating any sort of mass legalization of marijuana - that of course would have the horrible consequence of , well , nothing really .
But I digress .
My main point is simply that we must decriminalize marijuana at least a little bit , just down to a level where we can legally test it for medical applications .
You hear that , right - wing nut jobs ?
Just a little bit of decriminalization , that 's all !
The idea that THC / cannabis / marijuana has no medical purpose is absurd and consistently shot down by scientific studies across the globe .
The negative effects of the drug , while definitely real , are also greatly exaggerated .
In fact , the history of cannabis products is much more based on political fear than any sort of objectivity or science .
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled against state medical marijuana laws in 2001 , furthering the overkill of the War on Drugs declared in the 1980s under the Reagan and Bush ( Sr. ) administrations .
This is why , in the eyes of the federal government , marijuana is lumped in with drugs like heroin and LSD .
Some also feel that the criminalization of marijuana earlier in the 20th century emerged from racism toward cannabis - smoking immigrants when they started to take jobs away from Americans during the Great Depression .
Yet again , no one seems to care at all about facts , science or being rational .
Every day people in hospitals around the globe have to take morphine for pain , one of the most addictive substances known to mankind .
This is accepted and legal , yet we can't put aside some hard feelings to try to develop an alternative drug for our ill ?
That 's pretty uptight , man .
If only we had some way to make you more relaxed �
Let ’s Implement a Clear Cut Ban !
Encouraged by reading about heroes who have taken direct action through non-violent resistance , I recently contacted the California ’s North Coast chapter of Earth First ! to volunteer my services .
You can imagine my surprise when they explained to me that their top foe , the Maxxam Company , was recently taken over by the Humboldt Redwood Company and the Mendocino Redwood Company.[social_buttons ]
In direct contrast to its predecessor , HRC has committed itself to preserving the remaining old growth forest on its property .
Now , North Coast Earth First !
is focusing on introducing a bill that will ban clear cutting in all of California .
Research quickly revealed assembly bill 2926 , a bill proposed by Sally Lieber last April but killed in committee after heavy opposition from timber lobbyists .
I checked the Humboldt Redwood Company ’s web page but the site was under construction under the some sections like forest management and issues & policies .
I also checked Mendocino Redwood Company after hearing about positive reformation from them too from NCEF .
It turns out that the media is in a flare about this and many people seem convinced , much like election of Obama , that this is the chance for a positive change .
However , I could n’t help but remain similarly hesitant to resist skepticism , despite the obvious massive change in a more positive direction .
Greenwashing is ubiquitous in marketing our resources , and though there are many resources , such as greenwashingindex.com to sift through much of it , it ’s still important to attend to how things pan out ; preservation has progressed but still has a distance to go to .
Greenwash abounds in stealth .
Whether things swing forward towards more progress or backwards again remains to be seen .
I found an article in Mother Jones that details the struggle between Maxaam and the people who protected them – and the forests that the company destroyed .
The article highlights a meeting between the head of the Environmental Protection Information Center and a forester from HRC .
I was glad to see the shared terseness from the rep. from the EPIC .
They are a northwestern California based activist center .
The push in an opposite direction is enacted for now , it appears , in a highly publicized and historical conflict between the forests and industrialists in a region of northwest California .
But why not keep this ball rolling and attempt to try to pass another bill similar to last April ’s assembly bill 2926 – if it ’s a good idea , that is , and not just greenwashing ?
Overall , I ’m with NCEF .
A statewide ban on clear cutting would be a strong wave initiated from a small ripple .
So I ’m rattling away on how to write a bill like 2926 .
Anybody have an idea on how to get things like that through a committee ?
I ’d suppose it would n’t matter if it were a statewide ballot .
Ambitious , is n’t it ?
Do you think it would have a good chance – or any chance - at passing , despite lobbyists ?

inverted aeropressing for better coffee [ Update August , '08 -- photo sequence at bottom of this page ]
The problem The Aeropress gives its user unprecedented control over brewing variables , yielding a great cup of coffee .
But there 's trouble in paradise .
It has a shortcoming .
Fans of the venerable French press would understand immediately , because they are accustomed to a cup that offers the complex flavors of the coffee 's natural oils .
These are lost in paper filtration systems like the Aeropress .
On the other hand , many people ( like me ) do not enjoy the fines that a French press delivers with the brew .
They embitter the bottom of the cup as they cause overextraction there , and they have a bad mouthfeel .
So we 're caught between a rock and a hard place .
To get one thing we like , we need to stomach something else we do n't like .
Or live without what we do like .
Bother .
But there 's a way out of this dilemma !
Call it " better filter media . "
For some background , see the photographs in this thread at coffeegeek.com , and here and here as well .
A picture showing oils in the cup is here .
Edits to this page in green
The material Five micron ( nominal ) polyester felt filtering media is some elegant material , and it 's not very expensive .
Anyone wishing to buy their own and cut 2.5 " rounds to fit the Aeropress can enjoy 5 cent filters that can be used for a week or more .
Available from many vendors , it 's a bit harder to find FDA grade material that 's sure to be free of surfactants and other manufacturing and processing contaminants .
Even so , I 've found that non-FDA grade material works suitably for filtering .
Only recently have I switched exclusively to FDA grade material , but for a different reason that will be explained further on .
There are two main classes of filtering media that relate to practical coffee filtering .
Paper and metal filters are surface filters , meaning that they have holes in them and the particles press up against the surface , and liquid passes through the pores in the material .
Another class of materials filters at depth , which means the particles do n't merely abut a surface and find they can go no further ; rather , they get tangled in a web that has depth ; they go as far as they can through a surface that provides a gradient of porosity that gets finer the deeper the material goes .
The polyester felt is a depth filtering media .
The specific material I 've settled on is about a millimeter thick , and easily compresses in a caliper to half that .
One effect is that it seals excellently in an Aeropress cap .
The upshot of this depth for filtering coffee is twofold .
First , the flow rate is excellent .
Filtrate passes through the filter very rapidly .
Second , particulate size ratings for any given felt are statistical , not absolute .
Five micron nominal polyester felt material does not pass 4 micron particles and bar passage of 6 micron particles .
Rather , it will pass a range of particles beginning with some well larger than that , and it will bar passage of many particles far smaller than that .
I have tried several rated felts , and found that the 5 micron felt passes no fines , per se .
After many uses , such material sometimes will result in some sediment in the cup , but it rarely embitters even the last sip .
My expertise in the boundary of solubility of coffee solids is lacking , to say the least , so my superstitious mind has dubbed this stuff " near - solubles . "
Since it does n't taste bitter nor imparts the mouthfeel of " fines " , I do not find it offensive in the small quantities sometimes seen .
Again , I 've found this only in filters that have been re-used several times .
Such material is used in many industrial and food applications , and yes , one of them is coffee .
Among other things , the material is used in cold brew applications involving 50 gallon batches of coffee ( or more ) .
The material is usually formed and sold as filter bags , for use in established industrial systems .
Often these are two feet long and a foot in diameter ; here 's a shot of a small one you might use to filter coffee for an evening party . ;-)
Aside from freedom from contamination , FDA grade material has another feature .
The downstream side of the material has been slightly heated to gently melt the fibers , bonding them together .
This eliminates the prospect of stray fibers parting from the material and ending up in the filtrate .
Polyester is entirely non -toxic , but this feature of the material prevents anyone thinking " there 's a hair in my coffee ! " ;-)
Here are microscope shots of both sides of the material .
See if you can tell which side is the " downstream " side ( away from the grind ) .
You 'll need to click the pictures to see them in detail .
Note : the color is an artifact of the micrographic exposure using a standard digital camera ; the filter was unused and is actually quite white .
Aeropressing : Extraction column issues
The problem with using this material in an Aeropress is the felt 's superb flow rate .
If you do a normal Aeropressing , the water rushes through the material almost immediately .
You 'll have superb clarity in your well - filtered cup , but it will look more like apple juice than coffee .
But that does n't really matter , since the purpose of using polyester is to get the oils and other fine near - solubles , while eliminating fines .
To get oils , you must invert the Aeropress .
Why ?
Awareness of a couple further issues will help the reader understand the dynamics that make inverted use of the Aeropress such a great thing .
Fresh coffee grind generally exhibits a " bloom " in the brewing device .
The grinds roil and fulminate , exuding CO2 and creating a foam that makes us all WISH it were crema .
It 's not .
It 's full of oils , but it 's also mucked up with grounds .
The oils naturally rise to the surface of a brew slurry , so they get sucked into the foaming bloom and there they stay .
If you do n't believe it , stick your finger in a bloom ( " ow ! it 's hot ! " ) and rinse your finger .
Oil all over your finger .
Reach for the soap .
When you press an Aero normally , the flow and pressure work together to form a puck at the bottom of the extraction column .
This puck passes all the filtrate through it , but the last thing to pass through is the bloom .
Even if you were using polyester in this normal orientation of the Aeropress , it 's not likely you 'd get a lot of oil in the cup .
Passing through the by - then - full - sized puck and devoid of much liquid , the bloom ends up distributing its scant goodness throughout the puck .
The puck filters out the oils , and you end up throwing them in the trash .
How tragic !
Furthermore , with large blooms there 's a substantial proportion of the grind that 's suspending in the bloom , and does n't get extracted very well .
If this grind could be forced into the liquid portion of the extraction column , the process would work better .
This is why we stir the heck out of our Aerobrews , to see to it that the bloom 's contents are better distributed .
Nah .
Just invert it .
The first benefit of the method is that the bloom is dissipated and suspended grounds are returned to the liquid immersion .
And this also solves the problem of bloom loss in the puck , because the bloom is the first thing to go through the filter , before the puck can form .
Procedure First , cut out a round of felt .
Or buy one .
Maybe from me someday soon , I dunno .
Use a normal Aero filter as a guide ; I 'd suggest making it ever so slightly larger .
If you make it too small . . . well , read on .
Second , you may need to slightly file the bayonet mounts on your Aero 's black cap .
Try screwing it onto the body of the press with a poly filter in place ; if it 's quite difficult , this will ease things .
You need n't remove much material at all .
Second , insert the plunger into the Aero , as usual , about an inch .
Maybe more .
The idea here is to be careful because the danged two pieces will want to lose their longitudial alignment ; if they fall apart early in the process you 'll have a hot mess .
I suggest adding some hot water -- a half inch or so -- at the bottom , before adding the grind .
Then add the remaining water -- or at least , most of it .
If the bloom makes that impossible , just stir the slurry until the bloom is a bit tamed , then add the rest of your water .
And use more water than normal .
You 'll end up with an extraction column ready to have the cap mounted .
Mount the cap .
If you cut the poly too small , be aware that it might fall into the tube as you 're tipping the cap over and atop the tube to turn it on .
If you do n't notice such an occurence , you 're in for an amusing and dangerously hot mess .
Be sure the bayonet mounts are well on , and begin your press -- slowly ( remember , this stuff has a great flow rate ) .
When you have enough coffee emerging from the cap that you wonder why I ever talked you into trying this , " revert " the Aeropress onto a cup , capturing the liquid you 've pressed while inverted .
( I apologise for the poor focus on this just - before - reverting shot , but it 's darned hard to do this step and get a good picture too ) .
Note : Aeropress caps vary in one sad respect for this purpose : some are a bit convex .
That makes this harder .
If you have such a cap , it 's not defective for normal Aeropress use but it will be more difficult to avoid a mess with this approach .
I 've concluded that it 's not really necessary to get a maximum amount of brew through the filter in the inverted position , to get most of the oils .
By the time the brew begins to emerge from the holes , enough of the oil - laden bloom or upper portion has been brought through or at least into the filter media , to do the trick .
In other words , it 's possible to get an optimal or at least a sufficient amount through .
When you " revert " the press and continue pressing , whatever oils remains in the filter media will finish coming through to the cup .
I had once thought that some kind of tubular extension to the surface of the cap would be nice -- and it would be , but it 's not absolutely necessary and if Aerobie did add such a thing , it would n't need to be much more than an 1/8 " ridge around the outer edge of the bottom of the cap .
[ Later edit still : just hold the danged thing at a slight angle over your cup and press most of the bloom through .
You wo n't spill a drop if you 're deft .
If you 're daft , that 's another story ;-]
At this point , the bloom and upper portion of the extraction column -- where all the oils were -- have been passed through the filter into your cup .
The main goal has been achieved , but the polyester 's properties will remain helpful for the remainder of the press .
With the Aeropress now in its customary position , your column will have no air in it at all .
You can continue pressing ; if it gets difficult to press , withdraw the plunger an inch or two and air will percolate up through the slurry , breaking up the forming puck and allowing for easier pressing .
If too much of the puck has already formed , you may create " chunks " floating about -- an irritating defeat of this pressing tweak .
My experience is that frequent " pumping " during a press will make for a fast , efficient , satisfying press .
You 're basically back - flushing the filter with air .
It can help your press , but discovering the method 's best use will require practice .
I do this less frequently of late .
After " reverting " the inverted press , I generally press another second or two with no air in the column , then do a brief backflush of air .
I then finish the press normally with no further backflushing .
This seems a good " average " use of this method which yields a cup that does n't seem improved by other technique tweaks -- as good as it gets .
Although this description is lengthy , the press generally takes much less time than with a normal paper filter .
In my case , I generally end up with the plunger near the top of the column and a puck in the bottom , with a lot of air in between .
This allows one last tweak that I time my extraction for : I withdraw the plunger , add a bit more water , and press .
This moves fresh water ( which I do n't care about ) into the puck , removing the last of the good extraction -- which I hate to leave enpucked . ;-)
That 's the inverted method in a nutshell -- at least , the inverted method that seeks to do more than just avoid wash - through .
Getting the oils is key , and the polyester material -- specificaly , 5 micron polyester felt -- is essential .
You might wish to try 1 micron , which works if you file the bayonets quite a bit .
If you think 1 micron would have flow problems -- nope .
Counterintuitive , I know , but it works about the same as the 5 .
My preference for 5 micron is because it 's sufficient and not as thick .
Go to 10 micron and you get fines .
Finally , understand that I 'm not a filtering expert who brings a lot of knowledge to this .
I 've spoken with filtering experts , and I 've experimented .
What I 'm urging is based on that empirical work , and it 'll get the reader deep into the ballpark .
I 'm sure others will learn far more and come up with even cooler variations and new approaches .
Be sure and let me know !
Cleanup
As noted , it 's possible to re-use the filters .
I 've discovered that the filtering is a bit different with successive uses , but I have n't reached any conclusions I could easily describe .
I have found no reason to use filters only once .
However , cleaning them is more difficult than cleaning paper Aeropress filters for re-use -- because they are not surface filters !
Small particles work their way a bit into the material .
Here 's a trick I 've found useful .
I turn the filter around in the cap so that the cleaner side is faced upward .
I then press the cap against the kitchen faucet , rotating and pressing , rotating and pressing , working toward the center as well .
This forces particulates out the back side of the material , though only most effectively where the material is backed by the holes in the cap .
Some users -- including me -- have found that using the seared side of the filter toward the grind makes cleaning easier .
It changes the filtering dynamic slightly , but it 's not a bad idea at all .
Thinking about it this way , it may be that using the filter " in both directions " might allow for further repeated uses .
That 's not obvious yet .
Thanks to several folks for the feedback !
I 'd suggest letting the filter dry whenever possible , ideally in the sun that shines on your window sill over the sink . ;-)
[ Yet another update : put the used filter in a small Ziploc and store it in the freezer .
This prolongs the life of the filter substantially .
How long does a filter last ?
Sniff it before use .
If you pick up a trace of staleness , chuck it . ]
Updated section ( Aug '08 q )
OK , here 's the procedure as I do it .
Note that I 'm using poly .
That material 's throughput makes this procedure work ; YMWV if you 're using paper .
First , I preheat the Aero .
Then I pour this water through the polyester felt , which I generally store in the freezer in a small ziplock between uses .
This pour serves a couple purposes .
One issue with the felt is , of course , that regardless of how well you rinse it between uses it does retain some tiny amount of grind and oils .
So this rinse through the felt with hot water has the effect of leeching out any additional stuff before brewing .
The second purpose is to preheat the cup .
So really , this preheat of the Aero serves three purposes in all , with little time or effort expended .
I 'm generally grinding the coffee with the other hand while doing this .
Next I add some brewing water to the Aero and add the coffee .
I like to add brewing water both before and after adding the grind .
That way I do n't have to spend time stirring the dry - but - getting - wet grind off the plunger , which happens if you add the grind before any water is present .
Now I add more water , and stir .
How much water ?
However much the bloom will allow .
I stir with a spoon , which is possible because there 's no paper to worry about mangling ( the Aero 's stirrer is darned brilliant in that regard , for conventional use ) .
If the bloom goes down , I add more water before pressing .
Remember , with polyester felt the press goes fast , so I do n't have the worry about how long it would take to press more water , as I 'd have if I were using paper .
Now I cap the Aero , and press inverted through the poly .
With just a little practice , it 's possible to do this without spilling any coffee outside the cup .
Not as messy as it might appear .
Yes , it 's a bit of an isometric exercise .
Another reason to use poly .
The bloom is easily pressed through the poly in short order , getting all the oils in the cup .
Notice , though , that this also removes all air from the Aeropress column .
Next I " revert " the press over the cup , but before finishing the press I draw upwards on the plunger to suck air in the bottom of the press .
This would n't be possible with paper .
Once the air is introduced , I can finish the press and take advantage of the way this head of air evacuates the puck of several more grams of coffee .
That 's it .
That 's the inverted method .
Simple !

A couple summers ago , I had the pleasure of visiting the Ankor Wat temples in Siem Reap , Cambodia .
It is the most spiritual place I 've ever visited and the most impressive ancient ruins I 've ever seen .
There are over one thousand temples in the Angkor area including the magnificent Angkor Wat , said to be the world 's largest single religious monument .
The temple complex was built for the king Suryavarman II in the early 12th century as his state temple and capital city .
Below are some HDR enhanced photos from an amazing photographer , Trey Ratcliff .
These are by far the best photos of Angkor I have ever seen .
The main Angkor Wat temple .
Monks strolling around .
The temples in Angkor are smack dab in the middle of the forest .
This temple was unique because it was embedded in the roots of a huge tree .
All the temples are special in their own ways , but the Bayon temple was my favorite and the spookiest .
With huge carved faces , Imagine the kinds of shadows you would see during sunset .
Security is almost non-existent yet the detail of the temples is unreal .
Angkor is truly majectic and spiritual .

Husøy - a peculiar fishing village located on a small island
Husøy ( the House Island ) is a small island about 1000 meters long and 500 meters wide located on the far north of the island of Senja .
The island is connected to the surrounding world by a 300 meter long pier and road .
People started to move to the island around 1950 and the 200 living there today is just as dependent on the fisheries as they were 50 years ago .
The houses are almost built wall to wall and this create a good fellowship , which may be needed in such a harsh climate where even the the roofs have backstays .
Everything is nearby on Husøy ; the local store , the fish processing industry , the school , the cafe , everything is within a 5 minutes walk no matter where you might be on the island !
Why are we asking this question now ?
The Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution has just published a report on novel materials and has looked at the case of nanotechnology , which describes the science of the very small .
Nanotechnology covers those man-made materials or objects that are about a thousand times smaller than the microtechnology we use routinely , such as the silicon chips of computers .
Nanotechnology derives its name from the nanometre , which is a billionth of a metre .
To get some measure of the scale of the materials and devices we are talking about , a human hair is about 80,000 nanometres wide .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Should we be concerned about nanotechnology ?
The Royal Commission found no evidence of harm to health or the environment from nanomaterials , but this " absence of evidence " is not being taken as " evidence of absence " .
In other words , just because there are no apparent problems , this is not to say that here is no risk now or in the future .
The Commission is concerned about the pace at which we are inventing and adopting new nanomaterials , which could result in future problems that we are ill - equipped to understand or even detect with current testing methods .
The Commission 's broad conclusion is that the speed of development in the field of nanotechnology " is beyond the capacity of existing testing and regulatory arrangements to control the potential environmental impacts adequately " .
In summary , not enough is known about the effect that these very small devices and materials will have on human health or the environment , and the tests that could tell us about them are either not available or not being used .
What is covered by the term nanotechnology ?
There are about 600 consumer products already on the market that use nanotechnology .
They include nanoparticles of titanium dioxide added to sun creams to make them transparent instead of white , or tiny fragments of silver that are added to sports equipment to make them odour - free – the silver acts as a powerful anti-bacterial agent .
Nanomedicine are also being developed to fight cancer and other fatal diseases .
So nanotechnology is not all bad , but the point is , the ability to make such fine particles and materials is getting better all the time .
As a result , many companies are taking up the opportunity of using them in products with little or no knowledge of how they may have an impact human health or the environment .
The silver particles in sports clothing might end up killing off bacteria in sewage systems for example .
Is everything at the nano scale artificial ?
No .
A molecule of DNA is an example of a natural nano - scale substance with the diameter of its double helix structure measuring about one nanometre .
A typical virus , meanwhile , is about 100 nanometres wide .
This is the range of nanoscale objects in nature that roughly covers the field of synthetic nanotechnology .
So the human body and nature at large is well used to nanoscale objects and materials .
Why might there be risks ?
One of the chief concerns is that when you make something very small out of a well known material , you may actually change the functionality of that material even if the chemical composition remains the same .
Indeed , the Commission emphasised this point : " It is not the particle size or mode of production of a material that should concern us , but its functionality . "
Take gold , for instance , which is a famously inert substance , and valuable because of it .
It does n't rust or corrode because it does n't interact with water or oxygen , for instance .
However , a particle of gold that is between 2 and 5 nanometres in diameter becomes highly reactive .
This is not due to a change in chemical composition , but because of a change in the physical size of the gold particles .
How can this result in a change of function ?

One reason is to do with surface area .
Nanoparticles have a much bigger surface area - to - volume ratio than microparticles a thousand times bigger .
It is like trying to compare the surface area of a basketball with the combined surface area of pea-sized balls with the same total weight of the single basketball .
The pea-sized balls have a surface area many hundreds , indeed thousands of times bigger than the basketball , and this allows them to interact more easily with the environment .
It is this increased interactivity that can change their functionality – and so make them potentially more dangerous to health or the environment .
" As many chemical reactions occur at surfaces , this means that nanomaterials may be relatively much more reactive than a similar mass of conventional materials in bulk form , " the Royal Commission said .
This suggests that the emphasis on weight alone in terms of toxicity thresholds may not apply for nanomaterials , it added .
Are there precedents ?
The Commission cites several examples of health problems caused by the introduction of novel materials .
Asbestos , for instance , was an infamous example of a material that provided tremendous benefits as a fire retardant , but when asbestos fibres were inhaled , it resulted in highly malignant cancer mesothelioma .
Lead additives in petrol have been linked with harmful effects on children 's mental development , supposedly inert gases called chlorofluorocarbons in refrigeration are now known to have depleted the protective ozone layer of the atmosphere , and the antifouling agent tributyltin in paint has been found to change the sex of marine organisms .
More recently , tiny particles called PM10s in exhaust fumes have been linked with lung and heart problems caused by pollution .
Where did the idea of these dangers emerge ?
The first scientist to see the potential of nanotechnology was the American physicist Richard Feynman who gave a famous 1959 lecture to the American Physical Society entitled " there is plenty of room at the bottom " .
Although it was Feynman who first talked about the potential advantages of technology on the small scale , it was an American engineer and author called Eric Drexler who coined the term " nanotechnology " in his 1986 book Engines of Creation .
It was also Drexler who first warned of the risk .
He described a future in which tiny , self - replicating robots would take over the world – a view he has since disowned .
But that did not stop Michael Crichton building on the idea in his novel Prey , which portrayed a future threatened by minuscule , self - replicating machines that could devour the world in a form of " grey goo " .
More recently , Prince Charles has spoken out about the potential dangers of nanotechnology and his concerns led to a scientific investigation by the Royal Society , which concluded that there is serious cause for concern .
It recommended that the Government should take action by funding research into the potential risks .
Is the Government taking this issue seriously ?
It says that it is .
It is working with European bodies to ensure that consumers are properly protected against products and materials containing nanotechnology .
The Government has also promised a public dialogue on the subject .
However , the real issue is whether it can actually fund the research that can assess the risks and work out what needs to be done – if anything .
Should the Government call a moratorium on nanotechnology ?
Yes ...
* The risks are simply too great to carry on business as usual until we know more
* We have managed perfectly well so far without nanotechnology , so why take the chance ?
* If there is any doubt at all , it would do no harm to call a temporary halt until we know more
No ...
* We already enjoy too many benefits from nanotechnology to be able to straightforwardly stop now
* The risks are hypothetical and it would be a mistake to stop without harder evidence that the risk is real
* The potential benefits that are just around the corner far outweigh any possible risks
The NBA released their initial list of All - Star fan voting results this afternoon .
Among the starters , there were n’t really any surprises .
In the East , you have Allen Iverson , Dwyane Wade , LeBron James , Kevin Garnett , and Dwight Howard .
In the West , you ’ve got Chris Paul , Kobe Bryant , Amare Stoudemire , Tim Duncan , and Yao Ming .
Pretty much chalk .
Some may find it a little surprising on first impressions to see Dwight Howard leading the NBA in total votes , but when you look a little closer at what ’s going on here , you ’ll see that fans feel there is no alternative to voting for Dwight Howard at Center in the East .
In the West , Yao has Shaq , Bynum , and Okur stealing a decent number of votes .
In the East , Howard has no rival .
But if you look closer at the fan voting in the East , you ’ll see something unbelievably disturbing .
Take a look at the results for Centers in the Eastern Conference :
Dwight Howard ( 775,933 ) Samuel Dalembert ( 116,708 ) Rasheed Wallace ( 88,885 ) Jermaine O’Neal ( 75,324 ) Al Horford ( 45,284 ) Ben Wallace ( 40,799 ) Andrew Bogut ( 36,479 ) Zydrunas Ilgauskas ( 28,022 ) Kendrick Perkins ( 24,777 ) Emeka Okafor ( 15,323 )
That ’s right , Zydrunas Ilgauskas is eighth in voting for centers in the East .
You even have one guy who does n’t play center ( Ben Wallace ) getting more votes to play center in the All - Star game than Big Z .
If you took everyone who voted for Z , you could barely fill up Quicken Loans Arena .
28,000 votes for the guy who is by far the 2nd best center in the East this season .
It ’s a disturbing show of the lack of respect Big Z has among NBA fans , and it ’s really unfortunate more fans ca n’t appreciate Ilgauskas and the things he can do on the court .
Now , to be certain , Dwight Howard is the best center in the NBA .
It ’s not even close .
He has no rival .
He deserves to be the leading vote getter , and he deserves to start .
But lets make the argument for why Z deserves to be the 2nd leading vote getter among Eastern Conference centers .
First of all , despite being 10th amongst centers in the East in minutes per game ( a result of both Mike Brown consciously wanting to limit his minutes in the regular season and the huge blowouts the Cavs have had this season , thus reducing the need for Z to play in the 4th quarter ) , Ilgauskas is still 2nd among centers in points per game at 14.8 ppg .
He is 2nd among all centers in the entire NBA in PER at 23.44 , just 4 points behind Dwight Howard .
Right now , Z is at 14.8 ppg , 7.6 rpg , and 1.2 bpg .
Look at some of the guys who are ahead of him .
Samuel Dalembert ( 5.8 ppg , 7.9 rpg , 1.3 bpg ) , Rasheed Wallace ( 12.9 ppg , 8.0 rpg , 1.4 bpg ) , Jermaine O’Neal ( 12.6 ppg , 7.8 rpg , 1.7 bpg ) , Al Horford ( 11.2 ppg , 8.1 rpg , 1.6 bpg ) , and Andrew Bogut ( 10.9 ppg , 10.4 rpg , 1.0 bpg ) .
Out of those guys , the only guy to play fewer minutes per game than Zydrunas is Dalembert , and yet Bogut is the only one to average more than 0.5 rebounds per game higher than Ilgauskas .
None of them average more than 0.5 blocks per game above him .
And yet Z averages more points per game than all of them .
His efficiency rating is higher than all of them .
A new thing people like to do is add up points , assists , and rebounds as a way to measure and compare players across positions like LeBron , Kobe , and Chris Paul .
Well , what happens if we add up points , rebounds , and blocks for these centers ?
The list looks like so :
Dwight Howard – 37.5 Emeka Okafor – 24.1 Zydrunas Ilgauskas – 23.6 Rasheed Wallace – 22.3 Andrew Bogut – 22.3 Jermaine O’Neal – 22.2 Al Horford – 20.9 Kendrick Perkins – 17.9 Samuel Dalembert – 15.0 Ben Wallace – 12.1
This list looks pretty dramatically different from the corresponding list of votes .
But what happens when we normalize these numbers for minutes by adjusting them to a per 48 minute basis ?
Take a look :
Dwight Howard – 50.8 Zydrunas Ilgauskas – 43.6 Jermaine O’Neal – 36.6 Andrew Bogut – 34.9 Jermaine O’Neal – 34.4 Al Horford – 31.2 Rasheed Wallace – 30.8 Kendrick Perkins – 30.8 Samuel Dalembert – 28.5 Ben Wallace – 24.8
No matter how you look at it , I find it hard to comprehend how a player like Zydrunas Ilgauskas , having easily the best and most efficient season of his entire career , can be so low in voting despite outplaying everyone else at his position in the Eastern Conference this season other than Dwight Howard .
I realize none of this really matters because the fans vote for the starters only , so this really only affects Dwight Howard , and he is without doubt the deserving starter at center .
But this is more about respect , or a lack thereof , for one of the genuine great guys in the NBA having a great season .
It ’s about a player having such a great season at this later stage of his career getting some recognition for his accomplishments .
It ’s about the fans showing a little bit of knowledge about the voting process .
Maybe I ’m reading too much into this .
Who knows why fans vote the way they do .
There are many possible reasons for this .
Some are legit , some are not .
Maybe it ’s just that Cavalier fans lack the passion to show their support for one of their own .
Or , maybe it ’s just that Cleveland fans have more knowledge about the game in general and thus vote for the most deserving guys rather than cast homer votes down party lines .
No matter what the reason for these results , it ’s an absolute joke that Ilgauskas is eighth in the Eastern Conference among centers .
He deserves better from NBA fans .

After using ActiveRecord for a while , some questions keep coming up when performing operations that are more complicated than the standard create , read , update , delete .
1. Does ActiveRecord track if an attribute is has been modified ?
Does it track dirty state on an object or attribute basis ?
Yes , but not for attributes so far as I can tell .
Rails provides these great helper methods ( examples given for a person sample object ) .
person.new_record ?
person.changed ?
person.name_changed ?
person.name_was person.name = ' bob ' person.
changed # => [ ' name ' ] person.
changes # => { ' name ' => [ ' Bill ' , ' bob ' ] }
Documentation on Rails ActiveRecord dirty state methods
note that changed ?
does not capture if a collection has changed ( nor seem to work for a collection )
2. Does ActiveRecord automatically set the reference pointers on both sides of a has_many relationship ?
Surprisingly , no .
For example
p = Person.new e = EmailAddress.new e.person = p p. email_addresses # => [ ]
even though EmailAddress belongs_to : person
the reverse is also true
e2 = EmailAddress.new p.email_addresses.push ( e2 ) e2.entity # => nil
Also , this is the case even if p and e have been previously saved to the database .
3 . Are objects automatically persisted when you insert into a collection ?
Yes .
From the documentation : “ Adding an object to a collection ( has_many or has_and_belongs_to_many ) automatically saves that object , except if the parent object ( the owner of the collection ) is not yet stored in the database . ”
You can add an object to a collection without automatically saving it by using the my_collection .
build method
4 . How does it handle database sessions , is there support for transactions ?
I do n’t see any support for sessions ( in the “ Hibernate ” sense , where you can make a number of object changes , then dump those to the database all at once ) .
However , simple transactions are definitely supported .

Nike , Starbucks , Levi Strauss , Sun Microsystems , And Timberland Demand That Congress Act Now On Climate Policy
[ social_buttons ]
Five leading companies joined Ceres today to announce a business coalition demanding stronger U.S. climate and energy legislation as early as 2009 .
The team includes Nike , Starbucks , Levi Strauss , Sun Microsystems , Timberland And Ceres and is going by the moniker BICEP – I am thinking Nike had something to do with that one .
BICEP ’s — or the Business for Innovative Climate and Energy Policy — key principles include stimulating renewable energy , promoting energy efficiency and green jobs , requiring 100 percent auction of carbon allowances , and limiting new coal - fired power plants to those that capture and store carbon emissions .
The hope is that these key “ green ” initiatives will ripple across all sectors of the economy :
“ These companies have a clear message for next year ’s Congress : move quickly on climate change to kick - start a transition to a prosperous clean energy economy fueled by green jobs , ” said Mindy S. Lubber , president of Ceres , which helped organize BICEP .
“ Climate change is a threat to any business that relies on an agricultural product like we do with coffee , ” said Ben Packard , Starbucks vice president , global responsibility .
“ Starbucks believes that addressing climate change will help companies like ours reduce operating costs and mitigate future economic instability due to extreme weather conditions and agricultural loss . ”
“ Nike understands the value of investing in innovative solutions to address the challenges of sustainability , so we are proud to be part of a coalition of companies that believes legislative action on climate change and clean energy is not only urgent but imperative to creating positive , long - term change , ” added Sarah Severn , Director of Horizons , corporate responsibility at Nike .
I call a bit of greenwashing but hey , if they can actually pull it off – nice !
BICEP hopes to work both with the business community and members of Congress to pass meaningful energy and climate change legislation consistent with the following eight core principles :
Raise greenhouse gas reduction targets to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
Establish an economy - wide GHG cap - and - trade system
Create aggressive energy efficiency policies
Promote fuel - efficient vehicles and transit - oriented development .
Increase investment in energy efficiency
Stimulate job growth with “ green - collar ” jobs in low - income communities
Demand a national renewable portfolio standard requiring 30 percent by 2030 .
Limit construction of new coal - fired power plants

( CNN ) --
Winter travelers trek thousands of miles to the frozen north each year seeking the sky's " dancing lights , " which provoke awe , excitement and , some say , sex .
CNN iReporter Bruce Barrett shot this rare red aurora in Canada 's Whitehorse , Yukon .

Scientists call the natural phenomenon aurora borealis : cascading beams of greens , yellows , blues , purples or reds -- which paint a breathtaking backdrop across the wilderness and attract thousands of tourists annually .
" Usually it starts slowly as kind of a hazy greenish color -- like a mist -- building up in frequency dancing across the sky ... and to me that 's religion , " said photographer Dave Brosha of Yellowknife , Northwest Territories , who 's seen more than 100 Canadian auroras .
" It 's just one of the most incredible feelings a person can have -- sitting there watching that . "
To the west in Canada 's Yukon province , tour operator Torsten Eder likes to tell a story about a marriage that was forged under the glowing curtains of light .
See spectacular photos of auroras »
" I had one guy from Mexico , and he wanted to surprise his girlfriend by proposing marriage with a ring under the northern lights , " said Eder from his office in Whitehorse .
" We got lucky and the lights were visible ... so our guest went down on his knee and proposed to his girlfriend and she was totally blown away .
The funny thing was -- she would n't wear gloves for the first three days -- so she could show the ring off . "
The otherworldly lights also have provided inspiration for almost sacred pilgrimages , Eder said .
Guests who said they were going blind or battling cancer told him they wanted to view the auroras at least once in their lives .

" It puts enormous pressure on us , " said Eder .
" You can't guarantee that the lights will be visible because it's a natural phenomenon . "
The display is generally visible at least every three days , he said .
Scientists say the northern lights are created by the sun 's super hot atmosphere , which blasts particles into the protective magnetic field surrounding the Earth .
The magnetic field forces the particles toward the north and south poles .
About 60 to 200 miles overhead , the particles bump into the Earth 's atmosphere and become electrically " excited " -- throwing off light of various colors , said Prof.
Dirk Lummerzheim of the University of Alaska , Fairbanks .
" The forecast for this winter is a continued quiet sun , in general , " he said .
The sun is on the upswing of an 11 - year cycle .
" Maybe we will have a few periods once a month where the aurora can get a little bit more active . "
Although the phenomenon occurs around the clock , the lights are only visible at night .
The best time of year to see them is during winter , when darkness in the upper latitudes stretches up to 24 hours .

Eder 's Northern
Tales tour company picks up guests at their hotels about 10 p.m. and takes them to an area about 20 minutes outside Whitehorse 's city lights .
There , travelers can enjoy nature 's colorful show from a heated , walled tent until around 2 a.m .
" We almost take it for granted sometimes , " said Brosha .
" No matter how many times you 've seen the aurora borealis -- when they really dance , when you get some really unique colors -- you just kind of say , ' Wow , I 'm so lucky to see that . ' "
A warmer way to enjoy the northern lights is a shallow , natural rock lake at Chena Hot Springs outside Fairbanks , Alaska , which allows bikini - clad guests to enjoy the lights in temperatures of 106 degrees Fahrenheit .
" I mean , honestly , it 's the best way to see them , " said spokeswoman Denise Ferree .
" Because you 're warm and toasty and you 're watching the northern lights above . "
Chena 's owner , Bernie Karl -- who 's often as colorful as the lights themselves -- said the auroras sometimes spark the libido .
" Having sex under the northern lights -- it 's an awesome experience , " Karl said .
" Have you ever been out in nature at 35 below zero with northern lights bouncing over your head and your bare ass ?
Well , you need to try it . "
If the hot springs are n't for you , Chena also takes guests up a nearby mountain to observe the auroras from heated Mongolian - style tents called yurts .
The resort prides itself on its environmental initiative , which has led to the generation of clean electricity from geothermal heat produced by the hot spring .
" Iceland is probably one of the best places to see the northern lights , " said Reykjavik tour guide Arni Magnusson of AM Tours .
That 's especially true as the U.S. dollar gains value against the Icelandic krona -- offering some attractive hotel and shopping opportunities .
Guests are picked up at their hotel for a 20 - minute drive outside the city to view the lights from higher elevations .
" People say they feel closer to Earth and to the forces of nature , " said Magnusson .
" The lights totally overwhelm them . "
Dan Hershman 's life changed dramatically after he photographed a spectacular aurora in Washington state in 2000 , which was a peak year in the solar cycle .
" These things are just dynamic and they seem just alive and organic , " said Hershman , who at the time was a high school music teacher .
The photo was unique enough to attract the attention of NASA , which ran the image on its Web site , Hershman said .
This spurred his interest in photography and soon , as Hershman put it , " my hobby became my profession and my profession became my hobby . "
Now Hershman performs as principal bassoonist in local orchestras as a hobby -- and he teaches high school photography in Federal Way , Washington , as his profession .
The trick to photographing the auroras , Hershman said , is choosing to take the picture when the lights are n't moving as much .
" Otherwise it looks like nothing but a big blob , " he said .

What was hoped to halt the spread of the B.C. mountain pine beetle may actually be hazardous to human health .
B.C.'s Ministry of Forests is testing thousands of trees in the Okanagan - Shuswap region near Penticton to see if they contain a dangerous concentration of arsenic .
For two decades , ending in 2004 , as many as 100,000 trees throughout the Interior were treated with monosodium methane arsenate ( MSMA ) in a bid to stop the spread of the mountain pine beetle .
Also known by its trade name , Glowon , MSMA 's active ingredient is arsenic .
Health Canada de-registered MSMA for use in 2005 when the manufacturer declined to have the product recertified .
The ministry is warning loggers and firewood cutters to avoid the treated trees .
The mountain pine beetle has devastated nearly half of B.C. 's marketable pine forest -- an area more than four times the size of Vancouver Island .
The infestation has been another hit to the province 's beleaguered forestry industry , and swaths of trees have turned from green to a rusty red .
While scientists say its expansion through B.C. is slowing because it is running out of new trees to infest , the beetle is now pushing east past the Rocky Mountains and into Alberta .

This is a couple of days old now , so forgive me for writing this post a little late .
I did start it over the weekend when i got news of the release but did n’t finish my blog post until today .
Saturday saw the release of Syndk8 ’s Auto Pligg Submitter , for those who are n’t aware , Syndk8 is pretty much the top black forum on the net and Pligg is a sort of content management system which is effectively a clone of the much loved Digg.com .
Pligg allows members to submit news stories about various topics and then vote and comment on said stories .
This in turn effects what shows up on the front page , and how long for , its a social media news site .
The Pligg Auto submitter is being sold for $ 189 which for what it actually does is peanuts .
Basically the software will allow you to mass spam almost any Pligg based site out in the wild .
You would be forgiven in thinking that it is n’t a big deal until you realise that some high profile sites such as Sphinn.com are using the Pligg engine .
Lets look at some of the features that the Pligg spammer ( i mean auto submitter ) has …
Automatically register for accounts .
Even breaks CAPTCHAs !!
Create UNLIMITED profiles and identities
Submit stories and comment to 1000 ’s of sites
Automated pinging after each submission
Stats to show succesful submissions
Proxy support
So as you can see , it ’s a pretty rounded product , and the big thing here is that it can break captcha ’s which is a pretty big deal in the world of spamming .
Basically you are getting a piece of software which can automate the posting of hundreds of stories and links back to your site without you hardly lifting a finger .
So lets look at this from the point of spamming and building your site up , you could spend $ 180 on this product and be able to spam a hell of a lot of sites and get some decent links in or you could spend $ 180 one ok quility link .
If you do a Google Search for “ powered by pligg ” you can see that the results number in the 1,380,000 range .
Even if you assume that 25 % of those sites no longer exist then you still have a massive amount of sites at your disposal to spam .
Lets also check out the number of Google Searches going on at the moment …
As you can see from the image above , even though this software has only been out for four days , the amount of people searching for “ powered by pligg ” to spam the sites is pretty high , so what can webmasters do about it ?
Remove the “ powered by pligg ” footprint in your template
Take a look at using ReCaptcha instead of Pliggs built in Captcha system , there is a ( sort of ) guide on the Pligg forum
Add in another layer of capture which asks a questions such as “ is water a liquid or gas ? ”
Ensure that you monitor the number of users in the admin area , if you see this number shooting up then its safe to say that you are being targetted
Like the above point , watch to see the number of stories being submitted , if they jump up then you are probably being targetted
I would imagine that within the next couple of releases Pligg will probably address a lot of the loopholes that the auto submitter is using to work , however it seems that this is an on going project from Syndk8 so it looks like this battle will last for some time .
I must admit the Pligg development cycle can be a bit hit and miss so only time will tell what will happen .
In closing , i have tried to write this post from both the positive view points of a spammer and also the negative viewpoints of a Pligg admin , who knows , i may even use this software to promote my own Pligg based site 🙂

When it comes to web development , AJAX did n't change everything it just seems like it did .
By delivering to users the responsiveness of native applications and providing developers with a better UI and standardized data retrieval , AJAX ushered in a more interactive and rich web experience .
And in the spirit of imitation being the sincerest form of flattery , the word around the lunchtable at this year 's RailsConf conference proving once again that software developers can talk and chew sandwiches at the same time was that Microsoft will be rolling out a Ruby - based AJAX look - alike called " ARAX " ( short for " Asynchronous Ruby and XML " ) and the Python based " APAX " ( short for " Asynchronous Python with XML " .
With ARAX and APAX , developers who prefer Ruby or Python can build AJAX - like applications without having to deal with JavaScript .
Of course , ARAX and APAX are n't Microsoft 's first foray into the world of little dynamic languages that do things at runtime other languages do during compilation .
IronRuby ( www.ironruby.net) and IronPython ( www.ironpython.net) are .NET implementations of Ruby and Python , respectively , that leverage Microsoft 's Dynamic Language Runtime ( DLR ) , a subset of .
NET 's Common Language Runtime ( CLR ) that provides shared language services , such as frameworks , libraries , and tool integration .
However , the DLR adds features to the CLR that specifically address the needs of dynamic languages a shared dynamic type system , a standard hosting model , support to generating fast dynamic code .
In the process , dynamic languages like Ruby and Python ( among others ) can freely share code with each other , as well as with static languages like VB.NET and C#. IronRuby is designed for building server - based applications that run on top of ASP .
NET or ASP .
NET MVC , as well as building client applications that run on top of WPF or Silverlight .
You can also run Ruby code inside your web browser and have it interact with Ruby code that 's on your web server .
That 's pretty cool .
Microsoft is n't the only outfit fooling around with dynamic languages like Ruby .
As it turns out , Yahoo !
provides a Ruby interpreter in its BrowserPlus software ( browserplus.yahoo.com ) .
According to Yahoo ! , BrowserPlus is " software that extends the capabilities of your web browser to make richer web experiences possible . "
( Hmmm , sounds familiar . )
" Different websites can use Browser Plus to support things like drag and drop from the desktop , easier file uploads , more efficient and secure acquisition of feeds and information , and native desktop notifications ... so that developers can build more exciting web applications and so end - users can get more done inside their web browser . "
Actually , this does sound interesting .
( And no , Microsoft could n't possibly have wanted Yahoo ! for BrowserPlus - like technology alone .
No , no way ... )
Not to be outdone , Sun Microsystems is also in the dynamic language fray with its NetBeans Ruby plug-ins ( wiki.netbeans.org / Ruby ) that provide an IDE for building , running , testing , and debugging Ruby and Ruby on Rails applications .
You can download a Ruby - only version of the NetBeans IDE 6.0 or add Ruby support to a NetBeans IDE 6.0 download .
Of course , one place you 'd expect to see Ruby pop up is in the world of web services and you wo n't be disappointed .
Amazon Web Services ( developer.amazonwebservices.com ) , for example , has embraced the language by supporting Ruby interfaces from RightScale to Amazon Web Services ( AWS ) such as Elastic Compute Cloud ( EC2 ) , Amazon Simple Storage Service ( S3 ) , and Amazon Simple Queue Service ( SQS ) , among others .
And then there 's Ruby / AWS ( www.caliban.org/ruby/ruby-aws), a Ruby language library written by Ian Macdonald for access to Amazon sites via the AWS API .
But little languages like Ruby , Python , Lua , REBOL , and others have things in common other than they 're dynamic .
Almost all of them spring forth from the genius of a single individual ( or two ) Ruby from Yukihiro Matsumoto , Python from Guido van Rossum , Lua from Roberto Ierusalimschy , Luiz Henrique de Figueiredo , and Waldemar Celes .
And I 'd bet that David Betz has cranked out a dynamic little language or two .
Another thing these dynamic languages have in common is that their adoption by large organizations have been from the bottom - up , not top - down .
For instance , it was Nokia developers not management who pushed Python into the official toolchain , while over at Microsoft , John Lam has almost single - handedly brought Ruby to Redmond .
The bottom line is that it is people , not products , and individuals , not corporations , who are changing the face of software development .
Give a smart person a little leeway , and you 'll be amazed at the results .

Enlarge By Jae C. Hong , AP Photos of Dr. Jeffry Life hang on the wall in his office at the Cenegenics Medical Institute in Las Vegas .
The clinic specializes in " age management . "

Get wellness tips , medical study roundups and news for healthy living here , including info on ... • Fitness and nutrition
• Parenting / kids ' health
• Watercooler - worthy bits LAS VEGAS 
It 's one of those photos that make you do a double - take .
Dr. Jeffry Life stands in jeans , his shirt off .
His face is that of a distinguished - looking grandpa ; his head is balding , and what hair there is is white .
But his 69 - year - old body looks like it belongs to a muscle - bound 30 - year - old .
The photo regularly runs in ads for the Cenegenics Medical Institute , a Las Vegas - based clinic that specializes in " age management , " a growing field in a society obsessed with staying young .
Life , who swears that 's his real last name , also keeps a framed copy of the photo on his office wall at Cenegenics .
BETTER LIFE : Senior health care news and more on aging " He 's the man ! " patient Ed Detwiler says teasingly , pointing to the photo of the doctor who , in many ways , has become his role model .
Detwiler , 47 , has been Life 's patient for more than three years .
In that time , he has adopted the regimen that his doctor also follows — drastically changing his exercise and eating habits and injecting himself each day with human growth hormone .
He also receives weekly testosterone injections .
He does it because it makes him feel better , more energetic , clear - minded .
He does it because he wants to live a long , healthy life .
" If I were stooped over and bedridden , what kind of quality of life is that ? " asks Detwiler , a real estate developer in suburban Las Vegas who says he 's doing this , in part , for his wife , who is nine years younger .
" If I can get out and be active and travel and see the world and be able to make a difference in other people 's lives , then yes , I would want to have as long an existence as possible . "
It is a common sentiment in a society where many of us strive to look and feel decades younger — to prove to ourselves and the world that we are healthier and more vital than our parents were at our age .
We 've all heard it : 60 is the new 50 , the new 40 and so on .
But often , we need a little help .
Sometimes , a lot of help .
As the baby boomers march toward retirement , Botox , wrinkle fillers and hormones of various kinds have become big business .
Medco 's latest drug trend report shows , for instance , that human growth hormone use grew almost 6 % in 2007 .
The list for age - defying tactics is endless .
Want six - pack abs ?
There 's a surgical procedure to create fake ones .
How about drastically cutting your calorie intake to slow the aging process ?
There 's a group of die - hards that swears by it .
This search for eternal youthfulness certainly is n't new .
" In 1,500 B.C. people were ingesting tiger gonads to rejuvenate them , " says Dr. Gene Cohen , a George Washington University expert on aging .
But for a generation of adults who 've been weaned on the modern marketing message — that for a price , you can have it all — the quest is taking on a new urgency .
There is , of course , much to be said for taking good care of yourself .
Eating healthy and exercising your body and your brain regularly are considered tried - and - true tactics for staying young .
Protecting yourself from harmful sun rays is another .
Even flossing teeth is a habit that , according to research on people who live to 100 , might extend life .
But that 's generally where the consensus ends .
Many in mainstream medicine and elsewhere worry that we 're becoming too focused on treatments with short - term benefits that have potentially dangerous side effects and scant , if any , evidence that they 'll help in the long run .
In doing so , they wonder if some people are actually jeopardizing their chance at a long , healthy life , both physically and emotionally .
" The quest to live forever and the desire to avoid diseases and not suffer " is understandable , says S. Jay Olshansky , a public health professor and longevity researcher at the University of Illinois at Chicago .
But it can make people vulnerable to far - fetched and potentially dangerous scams , he said , with some of the more bizarre including fetal cell injections , inhaling radon gas , even cutting off testicles , an ancient practice meant to reduce overexposure to reproductive hormones .
" There 's a large industry of people trying to sell to people what does n't yet exist and they 're making gobs of money doing it — much to the dismay of those of us who are vigilant about protecting public health , " he says .
There also are concerns that this obsession is sending the wrong message to younger generations .
Surveys from cosmetic surgery trade groups suggest that sizable numbers of people , even in their 20s , are getting cosmetic procedures .
And a fall 2007 survey from TRU , a research firm that specializes in the teenage demographic , found that a quarter of young people , 12 to 19 — and a third of girls in that age group — are interested in having cosmetic surgery to improve their appearance .
Michael Wood , vice president and director of syndicated research at TRU , was a bit startled by the results .
" There 's no doubt that the celebration of youth and looking younger has certainly accelerated in the last 10 years , five years even , " Wood says .
" And this is a generation that 's growing up with that at a very young age . "
The effect has been palpable , says Neil Howe , a respected generational expert who has written extensively about " millennials , " young people who are coming of age in this century .
" I guess even young is n't enough anymore , " Howe says .
" It 's got to be ' perfect ' young . "
Alex Sabbag , a 23 - year - old Chicagoan , has felt the pressure , both self - imposed and societal .
" I 'll age until I 'm 25 .
Then I 'm over it , " she said to co-workers during a lunchroom conversation that turned to the topic of Botox .
She was only partly serious .
But she says she 's also accepted that we live in a society where being well put - together and youthful gives you status .
" We all buy into it , " Sabbag says .
And plastic surgery and other cosmetic procedures are part of it .
She 's never had anything done , though would n't rule it out in the future .
She also vividly recalls how her mother left home for several days , when Sabbag was in elementary school , and returned after having a facelift .
" I think it gives women and men alike worlds of confidence that ultimately makes them better people , " Sabbag says .
" Yes , it is a vain practice ... but I think there comes a point for people when hard work is n't enough to kick the last bit of belly fat or gravity has become entirely too unbeatable , and so a little nip - tuck of the forehead needs to happen . "
Detwiler , Life 's patient at Cenegenics , is not looking for the appearance of youth .
He 's looking to extend his youthfulness , and his life .
He knows about human growth hormone and its controversies in sports .
But this , he and his doctor insist , is different .
While it is illegal for these kinds of hormones to be dispensed for anti-aging purposes , he takes relatively low doses prescribed for " hormone deficiency . "
The idea is to bring his levels back up to those of a young man in his 20s .
" My friends say , ' Oh , Ed's on steroids , ' " says Detwiler , who has watched as muscle has replaced fat on his belly and elsewhere .
" No , I 'm not .
Look at me .
Do I look like I 'm on steroids ? "
He holds out his arms to indicate that his body is fit- looking , but not monstrous .
" I 'm not .
I 'm on hormone therapy , " he says of a regimen that costs him more than $ 1,000 a month .
Besides human growth hormone , testosterone , and an adrenal hormone known as DHEA , his diet now largely consists of things like hard - boiled eggs , fruits , nuts , Greek yogurt , salads and palm - sized pieces of fish , chicken or low - fat beef .
He also exercises regularly , alternating between intense cardio workouts and weight - resistance training .
" I ca n't tell you in words how great I feel , " says the man who used to crack open a Pepsi to get him through the day .
For a group known as the Calorie Restriction Society , youthfulness is n't found in hormones .
It 's reducing food intake to , in some cases , near - starvation levels .
But the claims are much the same — " lots of energy " and feeling " sharp , " says Brian Delaney , a 45 - year - old California - born writer now living in Sweden .
He 's the president of the group that claims about 2,000 members worldwide and many more followers who use the method in hopes of markedly increasing their longevity .
By cutting daily calories to about 1,900 , roughly half the recommended amount for someone his height and age , and exercising every day , Delaney has shrunk himself to about 140 pounds .
He says his blood pressure , cholesterol and blood sugar levels have improved dramatically .
At 5 foot 11 , he admits he's " scrawny , " which he calls the main drawback .
Hunger and wearing extra clothes to stay warm — because of little body fat or , he claims , an effect of slowed aging — are barely annoyances for Delaney .
He says he eats sensibly , replacing junk food with lots of fruits and vegetables , no meat , and two meals daily — no lunch .
Breakfast is often " a hearty bowl " of granola , with fruit , nuts and soy milk ; while dinner could be fish , rice , beans , a large salad and red wine .
Other than " tons of fine wrinkles " he blames on too much sun as a kid , Delaney says in most respects , " I look much younger " than 45 .
It is a bragging right many strive for .
" When we were younger , we 'd talk about someone who was 60 and that was old .
And now my gym is full of women over 60 and they look phenomenal , " says Renee Young , a 48 - year - old businesswoman in New Rochelle , N.Y .
" They do n't want to be categorized as old . "
But there 's more to it than that .
Youthfulness , she says frankly , is also a means of survival in the business world , including in her line of work , public relations .
" It feels like you 're put out to pasture .
No one wants to feel that how they look means that their ability to do anything is decreased , " Young says .
" If you have a younger look , you feel healthier .
You feel that you 're still in the game . "
In the back of her mind is the fact that her own mother died when she was only 56 .
So five or six mornings a week , even when she 'd rather pull the covers over her head , Young gets up and puts in two hours at the gym .
That 's more than double the hour or so a day generally recommended for optimal health .
And still , for her , that was n't enough .
She recently spent nearly $ 20,000 on a tummy tuck because , as she puts it , no number of abdominal crunches was going to make her as trim as she wanted to be .
The result has been a makeover for her entire sense of self , she says .
" I made a commitment this summer .
If I was going to go through all this surgery , then it was going to have to be part of a complete program , " says Young , who 's also getting more rest and eating healthier .
" I can definitely see the result . "
She , too , says she has not felt this good in years .
Using a cosmetic procedure as a motivator is worthwhile , and lucrative , to say the least , says Dr. Jonathan Lippitz .
He 's an emergency room physician in suburban Chicago who does cosmetic procedures , such as Botox and skin fillers , in a separate practice .
But it 's also a " very slippery slope , " with patients sometimes willing to take more risk than they should and some doctors who'll accommodate .
" They 'll always find somebody willing to do it , " he says .
In his own practice , he says he finds himself continually walking a fine line in deciding which procedures he 'll do — and which ones he wo n't .
" We all say , ' I want my hair different .
I want my eyes different , ' " Lippitz says .
" This idea of being perfect is a problem , though , because it 's not reality .
" I have people coming in and saying ' I want these lips . '
I say , ' You ca n't have these lips . '
" I say , ' We 'll work with what you have . ' "
But what if what they have is just fine ?
These are the sorts of questions that trouble Dr. Michael Morgan , a dentist who does cosmetic work in another Chicago suburb .
He 's been seeing more young , female clients walking through his doors .
And even his own 13 - year - old daughter asked if he would whiten her teeth , something he did n't think she needed .
Nor did he consider it safe for her young teeth or " age appropriate . "
" There 's a consciousness about it .
They are much more concerned with the appearance of their face .
But there 's also a social pressure , " he says of the younger generation for whom he 'll do the most conservative procedures , but no more .
He sounds a little sad when he talks about it .
" There 's nothing wrong with wanting to look better .
We want to look young .
We want to look great , " he says .
" But part of that feeling has to come from within . "
For those going to even greater lengths to try to keep aging — and ultimately death — at bay , there also are no guarantees .
Calorie restriction guru Dr. Roy Walford succumbed to complications from Lou Gehrig 's disease at age 79 , closer to the average than the " extraordinarily long life " his followers talk about on their website .
Meanwhile , Dr. Alan Mintz , founder of Cenegenics , died at the relatively young age of 69 due to complications during a brain biopsy .
Some research has suggested that human growth hormone injections can cause cancer .
They 've also been linked with nerve pain , elevated cholesterol and increased risks for diabetes .
Even so , Life , now the chief medical officer at Cenegenics , remains steadfast .
Among other things , he points to studies that suggest that human growth hormone in low doses poses no cancer risk if there is no preexisting cancer .
" Within the next 10 years , maybe less , this is going to be thought of as mainstream medicine — preventing disease , slowing the aging process down , preventing people from losing their ability to take care of themselves when they get older and ending up in nursing homes , " Life says .
" This is really the cutting edge of medicine . "
Detwiler is betting on that .
" There are those who might think I 'm cheating God 's way .
I do n't know , " he says .
" But I do n't want to regress .
Why should I ? "
He says his overall body fat has dropped from nearly 17 % to less than 10 % .
He can't remember the last time he had a cold or the flu .
And he says he's had the stamina to work long hours , putting him on pace to earn more than a million dollars this year .
That 's what he knows now .
The future , he says , will be anyone 's guess .
" People might ask , ' Hey , what 's happened to these people ?
Was it cutting edge ?
Or did it cut it short ? ' " he says , as he walks into a gym for another workout .
" I think only time will tell . "

Mark Malone was sentenced to a minimum term of 30 years in prison A homophobic man has been jailed for life for stabbing to death an accountant in a public toilet .
Mark Malone , 30 , of Clement Road , Walton - on - Thames , was sentenced to a minimum of 30 years at the Old Bailey .
He was found guilty of the murder of 50 - year - old Jeff Akers near a beauty spot in Walton - on - Thames in February , following a trial in November .
Mr Akers , formerly of south Wales , died in hospital after he staggered from the toilet with a large knife in his back .
' Unhealthy interest ' Sentencing Malone , Judge David Paget said : " You murdered him in a particularly savage way , stabbing him in the back with a carving knife with such force that it completely severed the eighth rib and punctured his right lung .
" The knife went into his back up to the hilt .
The knife had an eight - inch blade .
You did this simply because he was gay .
" I am satisfied that you took that knife and went into those public lavatories looking for someone you thought was gay to stab . "
He added : " You clearly have an unhealthy interest in knives and very clearly have a hatred of homosexuals .
" You will have to be regarded , therefore , as posing a significant risk of serious harm to members of the public , in particular gay men , in the future , " The court was told that in September 2007 Malone attacked a Brazilian man in a cubicle at the same location .
Jeff
Akers died in hospital after being stabbed in the back
He was jailed for three months five years ago for punching an autistic man twice he thought was gay because he believed he was staring and winking at him on a bus in Helston , Cornwall .
Following last month 's verdict , Mr Akers ' brother , Richard , said justice had been done .
Mr Akers was described as a " wonderful , caring and loving son " by his parents .
Originally from Barry , south Wales , Mr Akers had lived with his partner , Mike Drew , for 22 years , in Wallington , south London .
During the trial , Ann Cotcher QC , prosecuting , said the only possible motive for Malone 's unprovoked attack had been " a dislike of homosexuals " .
The court was told the toilet was a well - known meeting place for gay men and Malone , a married father , had earlier been seen in the area waving a knife .
Malone eventually handed himself in , claiming he knew the toilet was a popular spot for gay men " but that he had no issues with the gay community " and " was not an angry person " .
But after the hearing Surrey Police said it was a " vicious , unprovoked homophobic attack by Mark Malone on a harmless , innocent man " .

For years , progressive groups and their causes have been in the political wilderness .
Now , with Barack Obama preparing to take the White House and Democrats tightening their hold on Congress , the party ’s liberal constituencies can see their way to a promised land .
Their vision includes federal laws banning job discrimination against gays ; expanded hate - crime laws ; public land protections from logging and oil drilling ; and easier union organizing of workers .
Labor unions , environmentalists and other liberal groups are eagerly preparing for new confrontations with business and conservative interests .
They feel secure in having allies in Washington ’s power centers , 14 years after Democrats last controlled Congress and the White House .
( And some consider the exile even longer , dating from Ronald Reagan ’s 1980 election , because President Clinton ’s course was largely centrist and he had only two years with a Democratic majority in Congress . )
“ Everybody is seeing the energy that has been unleashed in this election cycle , ” said Eli Pariser , executive director of MoveOn.org , a liberal activist group .

Obama , who will have the largest Democratic congressional majority since the 1970s , won election on a platform that embraced causes dear to the party ’s liberal wing : withdrawal of troops from Iraq , a national healthcare plan and a big investment in clean energy .
“ Every interest group , every group in the party , has a list , ” said Democratic strategist Steve Elmendorf .
Some wish lists may be relatively easy to fulfill .
An expanded federal hate - crimes law -- a priority of civil rights and gay rights groups -- cleared Congress but was vetoed by President Bush .
The Fair Pay Act -- a priority for women ’s groups that removes obstacles to pay - discrimination lawsuits -- came within four votes of overcoming a filibuster .
Other challenges are bigger : a pathway to citizenship for illegal workers , for example ; or the union - backed Employee Free Choice
Act legislation , vigorously opposed by business groups , that would make labor organizing easier .
Advertisement
And liberal groups already have an eye on the economic stimulus plan that the Obama administration and Congress will take up .
Unions want the stimulus to include a large infrastructure building program to create jobs for construction workers .
Some want to include renovation of dilapidated schools .
Civil rights groups and advocates for low - income families want the legislation to allow bankruptcy judges to alter repayment terms for mortgages .
Gay and lesbian activists want equal job access and protection for homosexuals .
Advertisement
Environmentalists want the stimulus to include “ green jobs ” through alternative - energy development .
In fact , environmental groups -- which tangled with the Bush administration over policies minor and major , including protections for air , water , wildlife , and forests and other public lands -- expect swift and sweeping action from Obama on nearly every issue that matters to them .
Environmentalists expect Obama to “ hit the reset button , ” as the Sierra Club ’s Josh Dorner put it , on a host of regulations that Bush weakened .
They expect more input from scientists in framing environmental policy and more action from the Environmental Protection Agency in limiting greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act , in keeping with a Supreme Court ruling from last year .
On the campaign trail , Obama pledged to regulate carbon emissions through a “ cap and trade ” system and to spend $ 150 billion over 10 years to boost alternative fuels .

Goodwill on the left has largely prevented activists from publicly complaining when Obama has distanced himself from campaign commitments .
Labor ’s response was muted , for example , when he said that before acting on a campaign promise to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement , he ’d order a study of NAFTA .
And there was little outcry when he signaled in September that he would delay delivering on a promise to end the “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell ” policy for gays in the military .
“ People are willing to wait a little while , ” said Elmendorf , the Democratic strategist .
Progressives say the Obama transition team ’s appointments and meetings with interest groups indicate that the welcome mat will be out at the White House .
“ It feels like there ’s an air of transparency , ” said Rea Carey , executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force .
“ It is this different feeling , that the door is not closed -- the door is opening . ”

Moore :
Tell the Big 3 automakers ' we 're going to own your ass ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday December 4 , 2008
Print This Email This Michael Moore is furious about the disrespectful way the Detroit automakers have been treated in Washington , but he is equally angry at the automobile manufacturers themselves .
" When the automaker chiefs went to Washington , they were treated like errant schoolchildren and then sent back to Detroit to write an essay on ' Why we should get free cash , ' " Moore told MSNBC's Keith Olbermann on Wednesday .
" When the Wall Street bankers and thieves came down there back in October , it was just the opposite .
... " ' Just step right up boys !
Oh yeah , big finance , just great , we love that . '"
Despite his anger at Washington , however , Moore was no more sparing of the automakers , who were back before Congress on Thursday to insist that if they are not given $ 34 billion right now , they risk going out of business by the end of the month .
" Any money given to the current management is just going to be money that 's being flushed right down the toilet , " Moore insisted .
" They do n't have a clue about how to run these companies . "
Moore pointed out that " GM wants $ 18 billion .
The total worth of all the common stock in GM right now is a little less than $ 3 billion .
...
Why would we give them $ 18 billion ? "
He believes that if the government bails out the auto firms , it needs to receive a degree of control over their operations in return .
" This new president and this Congress has to say to the Big Three , ' I 'm sorry , but this car thing is n't working out , " Moore suggested .
" We 're running out of oil , so you need to build hybrids , electrics , and we need mass transportation .
...
If we give you $ 34 billion , we 're going to own your ass . "
" These geniuses thought that everybody would want to buy a Hummer and that somehow there was an untold amount of oil under the earth , " Moore concluded sarcastically .
" Why would we reward them ? "

Boffins at Britain 's Ministry of Defence have invented an electric ' force field ' designed to protect armoured vehicles against anti-tank grenades .
The ' electrical armour ' is designed to vaporise copper projectiles released from grenades on impact before they are able to penetrate a tank 's inner hull , the Daily Telegraph reports .
The idea is to make tanks less vulnerable to anti-tank launchers , such the RPG - 7 , which is commonly and cheaply available in the world 's trouble spots , such as Afghanistan .
When armaments like RPG - 7 grenades hit a tank , a " shaped - charge " warhead blasts a jet of hot copper into a target at around 1,000 mph - capable of slicing through a foot of conventional solid steel armour .
The new electric armour is based on a highly charged capacitor connected to two separate metal plates on the tank 's exterior .
The outer ( armour - plated ) plate is earthed while the insulated inner plate is live .
When the crew of a tank feel they are under danger , they switch on current to the inner plate , using the tank 's internal power supply .
If the tank is unfortunate enough to be hit by a grenade , the jet of copper produced will penetrate both the outer plate and the insulation of the inner plate completing a circuit , which results in the discharge of the capacitor and the vaporisation of most of the copper .
The Telegraph reports that despite the high charge generated by the system , the " electrical load on the battery is no more than that caused by starting the engine on a cold morning " .
It sounds bizarre , but the paper reports that in a recent demonstration an armoured personnel carrier protected by the system withstood repeated attacks by rocket grenades that would normally have destroyed it many times over .
Boffins hope to develop the armour further and fit it in Britain 's next generation of tanks and armoured personnel carrier .
The Pentagon is also reportedly showing a keen interest in work on the technology . ®

The open - source , cross- platform music player Songbird was supposed to do for your tunes what Firefox did for your web browsing : free you from the claws of iTunes and offer extensibility and general awesomeness .
Back in November , the first release candidate of Songbird did n't quite deliver , but the final 1.0 release this week absolutely did , now that the bird plays iTunes Store purchases and ironed out its major wrinkles .
Songbird was the application most readers cried foul about for being excluded on our first list of best apps in 2008 .

The most impressive prototype that came out of Mozilla Labs this year , the Ubiquity Firefox extension is an ambitious attempt at offering smart and extensible keyboard access to data between applications , so you can , for example , include a Google map to an address inside a new Gmail message without ever switching tabs .
Users have complained that the still - fetal Ubiquity prototype slows down Firefox , but the Quicksilver - like concept behind Ubiquity is way impressive .
Hopefully we 'll see a more fleshed - out and speedy implementation in the coming year .

You know how you never turn your computer off ?
You know how you have guilty pangs of conscious because you know you are wasting electricity ?
Well now you can feel a little better about wasting all those electrons .
IBM and researchers from Harvard University are launching a new World Community Grid project to discover organic materials to create a more efficient and lower cost solar cell .
The path - breaking effort will use idle computer power from volunteers to create large supplies of new clean energy .
Clean energy sources like solar could supply a vast amount of the worldâ€™s energy and help eliminate our dependence on fossil fuels , the cause of global warming , they could do so even faster if they were more efficient and could be developed at lower cost .
Current silicon based solar cells are only about 20 per cent efficient and cost about $ 3 per watt of electricity generated .
A newer form of solar powered cells being developed is plastic not silicon based .
It holds great promise because it is flexible , lightweight and most significant is much less costly to produce .
IBM will also pilot World Community Grid on a new IBM internal cloud , a network of services and software , when the cloud is not being fully used to provide more computing power to the grid .
In the future , IBM plans to expand this capability to clients of IBM cloud computing services if they choose , so that they can become part of this humanitarian research .
“ World Community Grid members will make this research possible because of the incredibly large amount of free computing power we will receive ” said Alan Aspuru - Guzik , the principal investigator and a professor in the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology , at Harvard .
“ It would take us about 100 days of computational time to screen each of the thousands of compounds for electronic properties without the power of World Community Grid .
Yet with World Community Gridâ€™s free computing power , augmented by cloud computing , the project is estimated to complete in 2 years what would have taken 22 years to run on a regular scientific cluster ”
The research hopes to discover and isolate organic molecules that when combined can convert more sunlight into electricity and thus produce solar cells much more inexpensively .
“ IBM believes that this important new study powered by World Community Grid could provide the planet with a smarter solution to the problem of low cost solar technology ” Stanley Litow , Vice President , IBM , Corporate Citizenship and Corporate Affairs and President of the IBM International Foundation .
“ This project marks an expanded direction to help our society by reducing our dependence on fossil fuels to make a lasting impact by hopefully finding new sources of clean energy ”
World Community Grid is the largest public humanitarian grid in existence with more than 413,000 - plus members who represent more than 200 countries and links to more than one million computers .
It is the volunteers that help make the difference because as each one shares their computer time , scientists are able to conduct their research faster .
For example ,
* The Nutritious Rice for the World has already returned 10 million transactions and 9,000 years of compute time .
* The AfricanClimate@Home just completed its data collection and research analysis will now begin .
* Help Defeat Cancer received a $ 2.5 million grant from NIH to further deploy its system for cancer research .
* FightAIDS@Home completed five years of HIV / AIDS research in just six months .
To become of member of World Community Grid and donate unused computer time , individuals register on www.worldcommunitygrid.org and install a free , small , secure software program onto their computers .
When computers are idle , data is requested from World Community Gridâ€™s server .
These computers then perform the computations , and send the results back to the server , prompting it for a new piece of work .
A screen saver will tell individuals when their computers are being used .

Being dumb has its benefits .
Scottish soldiers who survived the second world war were less intelligent than men who gave their lives defeating the Third Reich , a new study of British government records concludes .
The 491 Scots who died and had taken IQ tests at age 11 achieved an average IQ score of 100.8 .
Several thousand survivors who had taken the same test – which was administered to all Scottish children born in 1921 – averaged 97.4 .
The unprecedented demands of the second world war – fought more with brains than with brawn compared with previous wars – might account for the skew , says Ian Deary , a psychologist at the University of Edinburgh , who led the study .
Dozens of other studies have shown that smart people normally live longer than their less intelligent peers .

“ We wonder whether more skilled men were required at the front line , as warfare became more technical , ” Dear says .
His team ’s study melds records from Scottish army units with results of national tests performed by all 11 - year - olds in 1932 .
The tests assessed verbal reasoning , mathematics and spatial skills .
“ No other country has ever done such a whole - population test of the mental ability of its population , ” Deary says .
Other studies have found that childhood IQs accurately predict intelligence later in life .
Equal intelligence
A previous study found a fall in intelligence among Scottish men after the war , and at the time Deary ’s team theorised that less intelligent men were more likely to be rejected for military service .
The new study appears to refute that suggestion .
Men who did n’t serve were more intelligent than surviving veterans , and of equal intelligence to those who died .
Analysing their data by rank offers some insight .
Low - ranking soldiers accounted for three - fifths of all deaths , and their IQs measured by their childhood tests averaged 95.3 .
Officers and non-commissioned officers made up for about 7 % and 20 % of war deaths respectively .
Officers scored 121.9 , bringing up the average IQ for those who died .
Non-commissioned officers scored an average of 106.7 .
“ We also wondered whether there was an overall small tendency for more intelligent soldiers to want to do the job well , perhaps meaning they ended up in more threatening situations , ” Deary says .
Phil Batterham , an epidemiologist at Australian National University in Canberra , wonders what aspects of intelligence made soldiers more likely to die in the war .
“ One could hypothesise that the association between greater intelligence and higher war - related mortality might be driven by the more crystallised verbal abilities , leading to greater leadership roles , ” as opposed to other forms of intelligence , he says .

thank you for reading ill be here all night
So on Friday my friend informed me that she visited the re-opened spot and her first reaction was that the interior design looked like a bad 80s diner complete with sad looking lobsters on display to greet you in the front .
So starving on a Sunday night I decided to check out my old haunt , and things had changed a bit — but maybe not for the worst .
The old Kellogg 's Diner was a local landmark for one reason : it was the only place on this side of the river where you could find a diner that was open 24/ 7 no matter what .
The flip side of this was everything else — the food was terrible , the service was non-existent , they had health code violations and even the shabby non-chic decor was hard on the eyes .
That said beggars can't be choosers and it was what it was .
The first nice thing that I noticed was that they were serving appetizers !
Not only that but the quality was n't that bad — they started off with fresh bread that was slightly toasted .
But then they went the extra mile and included olives in olive oil which were great .
Were they the best I 've ever had ?
No !
Were they great for a diner ?
Yes !
Having gone for dinner I was given a " dinner menu " which upset me a first because it was quite limited in scope and scale .
However I was informed by the manger that the menu was going to be expanded and the scaled back version was for this soft opening of the diner .
I was also told that while for this week ( and maybe next ) they'd be down for two hours a night that they would be back up and running in 24/7 mode shortly .
I was also given a look at the full menu which did have all the breakfast food that you 'd expect .
This next brings me to the service :
They were still getting their act together , but frankly it was another universe from the previous incarnation of the diner .
Being a vegetarian the entree that I would up ordering was the spinach pie .
The presentation was great , in fact I would n't think of it as diner food in this context .
The pie was perfect — in fact it was one of the better ones that I 've had in a while .
My only letdown was that it came solo , at the very least I 'd sort of expect some sort of optional side dish liked a baked potato or salad .
The price was around $ 13 which is slightly above average — but I was still left feeling a bit hungry after which is n't a good sign .
On the other hand I was looking at some of the other dishes being served like the burgers and the plates seemed a bit more full .
For a drink I order an ice tea without sugar , but then I was told that they did n't have that which is more than fair given that they are getting started up .
Thinking quickly I ordered a large orange juice , which tasted great but cost about $ 4 .
So my total damage was about $ 20 which was a bit higher than what I 'd expect for something that left me hungry which does n't happen at most diners .
But small flaws aside I have to say that I 'm very happy with what I found there .
In the old Kellogg 's you 'd always had that dread of getting the wrong thing or waiting for hours to get the wrong thing that did n't taste so good .
So to me this is a vast improvement and I 'll defiantly be returning on late night .
The reality is starting to settle in that while the rate cuts and cash injections were positive , they still ca n’t prevent the inevitable recession that is in motion .
Asian markets were battered as the Nikkei plunged more than 11 percent and South Korea tumbled 9.4 percent , as oil prices dropped to a one - year low Thursday after downbeat U.S. economic data spread fears of a more protracted and sharp global slowdown than initially expected .
Europe is opening down roughly 5 % but it ’s only just starting .
Watching this for the first time , as opposed to reading it , it 's very clear that Palin has never heard of the Bush doctrine on pre-emption , perhaps the most significant element of his disastrous legacy in foreign policy :
She is clearly out of her depth .
And no hard questions about her record have yet been asked - let alone the questions that have been asked at every water - cooler in the country .
I reserve judgment on the whole interview until I 've seen the whole thing .
But this exchange is a classic example of how she tends to lie reflexively when caught in an uncomfortable part of her record :
GIBSON : You said recently , in your old church , " Our national leaders are sending U.S. soldiers on a task that is from God . "
Are we fighting a holy war ?
PALIN : You know , I do n't know if that was my exact quote .
GIBSON : Exact words .
So far , clearly able to recite talking points imprinted on her by Randy Scheueneman et al .
But no actual understanding of the issues involved .
She has met no foreign leaders ever , but she has been in touch with Randy Scheuneman 's former client , the somewhat nutty Saakashvili .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

“ YOU only find out who is swimming naked when the tide goes out ” , Warren Buffett famously observed .
In 2008 , the financial tide went out further than anyone expected , revealing a multitude of skinny - dippers .
To help them cover up their embarrassment , Business.view is proud to announce the following winners of the 2008 “ naked shorts ” awards :
Scoundrel of the year :
Too many contenders to mention , but the last minute entrant has won by a landslide : Bernie Madoff , who is providing a helpful demonstration of the difference between a financial collapse due to management incompetence ( most of this year 's banking failures ) and a genuine 100 % fraud .
AP
Bernie Madoff , scoundrel of the year
Outstanding Public Relations :
No question , the decision of the bosses of Detroit 's shrinking Big Three car makers to fly in separate corporate jets to appeal to Congress for a bail - out .
What better way to tell the public that the leaders of corporate America are out of touch ?
Runner up : John
Thain , boss of Merrill Lynch , who looked like a hero for saving his firm , only to blow it by demanding his bonus .
Greatest sovereign risk :
In a year of meltdown , Iceland is a fitting winner .
Rumble in the jungle : Dick “ the Gorilla ” Fuld versus Lehman “ Nameless ” Employee .
The boss who presided over Lehman 's demise was allegedly knocked out with a single punch in the investment bank 's gym , by an angry employee .
Gift horse : Mr Fuld wins again , for reportedly turning down multiple offers of life - saving investment in Lehman .
Honourable mentions to the bosses of Deutsche Bank , Barclays and Ford , who all publicly said they did not need an injection of state funds , but may live to regret it .
The Andrew Mellon award for incompetence as Treasury Secretary : Hank Paulson , whose lack of strategy and catastrophic decision to let Lehman Brothers fail made a bad situation far worse .
Best letter : Runner up , for its undisguised Schadenfreude , was Congressman Henry Waxman 's letter to the heads of Wall Street firms after the government bought some of their shares , demanding to know the salaries of their top earners , their bonuses and how these were calculated .
But the lifetime achievement award goes to the letter A , as in “ triple - A rating ” , which is now entering long - overdue retirement .
Most convincing Jekyll - and - Hyde impersonation : Scary sovereign - wealth funds were going to buy up the world .
Then they were heroically going to rescue the banking system .
Now they are in hiding , counting their massive losses and wondering where all their money went .
In second place , and closely related , oil : expensive one moment , cheap the next .
Most dismal scientist : Nouriel Roubini and George Soros battled it out for the role of scarily - accented Dr Doom in the next James Bond movie , “ A Quantum of Funds ” , but nobody put the dismal science into economics more effectively than the Republican vice - presidential candidate , Sarah Palin , during her unforgettable interview with Katie Couric .
As she explained : “ That 's why I say I , like every American I 'm speaking with , we 're ill about this position that we have been put in .
Where it is the taxpayers looking to bail out .
But ultimately , what the bailout does is help those who are concerned about the health care reform that is needed to help shore up our economy .
Um , helping , oh , it 's got to be about job creation , too .
Shoring up our economy , and putting it back on the right track .
So health care reform and reducing taxes and reining in spending has got to accompany tax reductions , and tax relief for Americans , and trade — we have got to see trade as opportunity , not as , uh , competitive , um , scary thing , but one in five jobs created in the trade sector today .
We 've got to look at that as more opportunity .
All of those things under the umbrella of job creation . ”
Indeed .
Perhaps best enjoyed in the Tina Fey version from Saturday Night Live .
Client of the Year : Client Number Nine , aka Eliot Spitzer .
Wall Street had little to cheer about in 2008 , but the fall of its former persecutor in a sex scandal was one of them .
Happily for former New York Governor Spitzer , America 's tradition of giving failures a second chance is alive and well .
Starting soon , he will write a regular column in Slate , an online magazine .
Best supporting abbreviation : Last year , it was SIV ( structured - investment vehicle ) .
This year , the winner is TARP , which stands for troubled asset relief programme — better known as a blank cheque for Mr Paulson .
Runner up : IOU .
Most oligarchic oligarch : Two strong entries : Mikhail Frydman , Len Blavatnik and Viktor Vekselberg ( collectively ) , for driving out Robert Dudley , the boss of the joint - venture between TNK and BP ; and the winner , Oleg Deripaska , for embarrassing first Britain 's government and main opposition by inviting two leading members onto his yacht , and then himself by falling foul of the credit crunch .
Party of the year :
The $ 86,000 partridge - hunting trip funded by AIG , a government - rescued insurance firm , for some top clients .
They had fun , but the public outcry was such that lots of other firms cancelled their holiday parties lest they be accused of wasting money in tough times .
Cheers !
Badly - timed nickname : Awarded jointly to Whole Foods Market and Starbucks .
Being known , respectively , as Whole Paycheck and Fourbucks is fine when the going is good , but not when consumers are obsessed with value for money .
Both of these pricey retailers have had a miserable year .
Whole Foods ' shares are down by 75 % so far in 2008 , and shares in Starbucks are down by over half .
In memoriam : A posthumous award for this year 's notable departures .
Contenders include Alan Greenspan 's reputation as a great central banker ; investment banks ; the newspaper industry ; sport-utility vehicles ; fiscal prudence ; the inexorable rise of BRIC economies and the theory that BRICs had “ decoupled ” from rich world economies ; pay increases ; and capitalism .
But the winner is economic growth — gone , though one hopes not forever .
Flash Gordon award for saving the universe : Gordon Brown , Britain 's prime minister , would have won , but the self - proclaimed mastermind of the great global banking bail - out claims only to have been saving the world .
The winner is Warren Buffett , whose timely investments seem to have rescued both General Electric and Goldman Sachs , home of the financial Masters of the Universe .
Comeback kid :
Not everyone had a bad year .
Some of the business winners in 2008 include the value - shopper 's favourite , Wal - Mart , whose chief executive Lee Scott is leaving on a high ; Ken Lewis , boss of Bank of America , which now has enough of the country 's money to deserve its name ; Paul Volcker , who has replaced Alan Greenspan as everyone 's favourite ex-central banker ; bankruptcy lawyers and corporate restructuring experts ; sucking up to your boss to keep your job ; and nationalisation .
But the winner is cash , which once again is king .
Hot favourite for next year 's comeback kid award ?
The Great Depression .
" Perhaps freedom is not universal .

For weeks , there ’s been a growing chorus — from the incoming Obama team to community - welfare campaigners and environmental bloggers — pushing for building the economic revival around “ green jobs . ”
So far the focus seems to be mainly on rebuilding physical infrastructure : insulating leaky low - income housing , building wind turbines , improving the clunky electrical grid and the like .
These are , by almost any measure , logical starting points for an effort to cut America ’s energy bill and carbon dioxide emissions while restoring prosperity .
But for such an initiative to be green at a scale sufficient for the atmosphere to notice , my sense is it will need to focus just as much on rebuilding the country ’s intellectual infrastructure .
I ’m not quite sure I ’ve heard any leader yet describe the sustained , aggressive “ energy quest ” that would be required to lead the world toward a future with non-polluting energy choices sufficient to empower more or less 9 billion people — and how that quest would have to extend from the living room to the boardroom , from the laboratory to the classroom , to be transformational .
[ UPDATE 12/10 , A call for a cabinet - level Department of Innovation . ]
As our ongoing Energy Challenge series and plenty of independent studies have made clear , the country and world are still not engaged seriously in advancing non-polluting energy technologies , from solar cells to the elusive notion of capturing carbon dioxide from power plants at a large scale and stashing it somewhere .
( One phrase that reverberates almost as much as green jobs these days in climate - energy discussions , with far less credibility , is “ clean coal . ” )
The latest overview of science and engineering trends from the National Science Foundation includes lots of warning signs .
In the meantime , above you can see the latest graphical portrait of taxpayer investments in basic research in arenas that have mattered over the last half century .
( The graph was updated for me by Kei Koizumi of the American Association for the Advancement of Science from the version I used in the recent post examining what an “ energy moon shot ” might look like . )
In the graph , you can see the Apollo moon shot ( yellow ) , the war on cancer ( blue ) , and the dribble of research on energy through Republican and Democratic eras ( with a bit of an uptick of late ) .
Below , for comparison , is federal spending on military research compared to the entire portfolio above .
Spending on basic R and D for military projects has hit about $ 80 billion a year , far more than the country spends on all other basic R and D combined .
What might happen if a president sought not to shrink the military research pie , but simply devote more of it to transformational technologies related to harvesting , storing , or moving energy ( something I put on the recent Dot Earth list of low - budget ways a president might improve the planet ) ?
After all , the Pentagon has already concluded that improved energy technology and efficiency are prime objectives , along with reducing turmoil in dangerous regions ( one way possibly would be to offer cheap , renewable energy choices ) .
A host of experts in technological innovation agree that research money , alone , is insufficient .
But without it , there ’s no pipeline of ideas for entrepreneurs and investors to turn into products .
A case in point :
At the recent Bioneeers conference , there was a fascinating session on biomimicry , in which hints from nature shape industrial designs or architecture .
A presentation by a vice president of WhalePower , a Canadian company designing efficient turbine and fan blades with knobbly edges , inspired by humpback whale tails , mentioned in passing that the basic research was paid for by the Pentagon ( seeking streamlined submarine designs ) .
There was a time when such a program might have won a “ Golden Fleece Award ” for wasteful spending .
Can Congress and the public accept the idea that such work is as central to a sustainable energy future as painting roofs white ?
Will the push for a green economy include a boost for those priming the innovation pump ?
There are signs that President - elect Barack Obama gets it .
When Tom Brokaw asked him during his “ Meet the Press ” interview about who might visit the White House starting next year , Mr. Obama spoke of both children and scientists ( an important combination if ever there was one ) :
“ We want to invite kids from local schools into the White House .
When it comes to science , elevating science once again , and having lectures in the White House where people are talking about traveling to the stars or breaking down atoms , inspiring our youth to get a sense of what discovery is all about . ”
I ’ve got to add one final note about a fairly subtle point in that National Science Foundation report on science and engineering — the distinction between the two components of R and D — basic research and development work on promising ideas .
The political tendency is to spend on development , while the report notes that breakthroughs come mainly from blue - sky basic research .
This excerpt explains why Switzerland has such an outsize profile in the breakthrough business :
Basic research plays a special role in developing new technologies .
Basic research generally has low short - term returns but builds intellectual capital and lays the groundwork for future advances … .
Among O.E.C.D. countries with available data , Switzerland has the highest basic research / GDP ratio at 0.8 % , significantly above the U.S. and Japanese ratios of 0.5 % and 0.4 % .
The report notes adds that Switzerland “ boasts the highest number of Nobel prize winners , patents , and science citations per capita worldwide . ”
Enough said ?
Government criticised as clashes between riot police and protesters continue
guardian.co.uk
Greece 's main opposition party has accused the government of failing to protect the country as it experiences the worst unrest in decades .
The Socialist opposition leader , George Papandreou , speaking after emergency talks with the prime minister , Costas Karamanlis , said Greeks had lost trust in the government after three days of disorder across the country , triggered when a schoolboy was shot dead by police .
" The country does n't have a government to protect it , " he said .
" Citizens are experiencing a multiple crisis : a social crisis , a crisis of values .
People have lost trust in the government . "
Karamanlis today began emergency talks with top politicians , urging them to unite against the face of civil unrest , as he struggles to reassert his authority .
" We wo n't show any leniency , " he said .
" No one has the right to use this tragic incident as an excuse for acts of violence .
At this critical time , the political world must unite to condemn those responsible for this disaster and isolate them . "
It is unclear what measures the government is considering after a third night of chaos in Greek cities after the death of 15 - year - old Alexandros Grigoropoulos on Saturday .
His funeral today could inflame an already volatile situation .
With a general strike over economic policy planned for tomorrow , the government 's position is looking increasingly precarious .
Hundreds of protesters threw stones and bottles at lines of riot police outside the Greek parliament today as the region entered its fourth day of anti-government clashes .
Karamanlis 's party holds a one - seat majority in parliament and was already trailing the opposition Socialists by more than five percentage points before the riots .
The government has denied reports it will declare a state of emergency , but last night the interior minister , Prokopis Pavlopoulos , signalled the authorities would take a firmer stance against rioters in the worst disturbances to hit the country since the collapse of military rule in 1974 .
Emerging from a three - hour emergency cabinet meeting , he said : " What is happening both for the economy of our country and our democracy is unacceptable .
We will not tolerate these events .
We will do what we must . "
But thousands took to the streets again , burning shops and buildings and even setting alight a Christmas tree in the centre of Athens .
One hotel 's windows were smashed and guests evacuated .
The four - storey Olympic Airways office in central Athens was completely burned , as well as a bank and more than 130 shops .
Rioters threw rocks and petrol bombs at riot police and set up barricades across downtown streets .
Smoke rose above the city centre , mingling with clouds of teargas .
Broken glass littered the streets .
The disturbances also intensified in the country 's second - largest city , Salonika , where masked and hooded youths threw rocks and petrol bombs at riot police , who responded with teargas .
Rioting also broke out in Trikala , a city in the country 's agricultural heartland .
Demonstrators occupied the Greek consulate in Berlin , and in London five men were arrested after protesters clashed with police outside the Greek embassy .
The riots were triggered by an incident late on Saturday in which Grigoropoulos was shot dead by a policeman , allegedly at point - blank range , after youths were said to have thrown objects at a patrolling police car in the gritty Athenian district of Exarchia .
Earlier yesterday , Karamanlis , accused " extremists " of exploiting the shooting and pledged to take " immediate " action to compensate those whose properties had been destroyed , saying : " The state has a duty to protect society and the citizen . "
But the sheer scale of the destruction has put the ruling New Democrats on the defensive .
" It is as if the state [ machinery ] , the government , has collapsed , " said Ioannis Rougissis , a spokesman for the opposition Pasok party .
Papandreou lashed out at the New Democrats - who are in power with a wafer - thin majority - for being out of touch with reality .
" The whole country , every citizen , is exasperated with a government that does n't understand the real problems of the people , " he said .
" Everyone is saying enough is enough . "
The shooting of the schoolboy on Saturday quickly laid bare the simmering tensions between the police and members of alleged anarchist groups , who retaliated by going on the rampage .
But the teenager 's death has given vent to a deeper anger that has also been mounting in Greece .
With many struggling to make ends meet , and one in five living below the poverty line , there is growing anger at the tough fiscal policies of a government determined to reach the prescriptive benchmarks set out by Brussels and rein in budget deficits .
The disaffection has been exacerbated by allegations of corruption and a series of scandals implicating members of Karamanlis 's inner circle .
High school students have rushed to join the protests , throwing stones at police in clashes in front of the Athens parliament yesterday , and on islands and mainland towns nationwide .
" A lot of teenagers identify with Grigoropoulos , " said Christos Mazanitis , an Athenian journalist .
" There 's a whole generation out there who see their parents in debt and feel they have nothing to look forward to in the future .
Fear and despair are what these riots are about . "
" There was no point in panicking , " Mrs McCabe told the Herald .
" I knew I had to get control of the situation or become a victim myself . "
Police say they were called to the apartment block in Iron Street , North Parramatta after a resident rang to say a 48 - year - old woman , believed to have a history of mental illness , was threatening the man with a knife .
They say the woman then turned the knife on police and could not be subdued with capsicum spray .
A female constable shot at her twice and last night she was in a serious but stable condition in intensive care at Westmead Hospital .
Police said the man was also treated at the hospital for a cut to his neck .
But Mrs McCabe , described by neighbours as " terribly immobile " , tells a different story .
A former drug and alcohol counsellor with the Sydney City Mission , she said she had been about to retire for the night when she heard a man and woman screaming and opened her door to see them arguing on the driveway .
" He was yelling at her , " Mrs McCabe said .
Rather than his being the victim , she said , the man was aggressive .
" I quickly rang triple - 0 .
" She ran towards the main door of my unit block and into the stairwell , but he pushed the door open and followed her .
I was standing at my open door and … I told him to leave her be , to let her go … but at that moment the police arrived and sprayed him with capsicum spray .
I ingested some of it as well and stepped back from the door .
That 's when I heard two shots . "
Mrs McCabe said the man , who had a shaved head with a black plait and was wearing black army boots , then burst into her apartment , pushing her aside .
" He was a huge man .
And very angry and aggressive .
I told him to sit down on the lounge and take deep breaths .
I 'm not the type to panic .
" He asked me if he could take his jacket off and if he could wash the spray off in the sink .
I let him wash himself in the kitchen . "
Mrs McCabe said a neighbour from across the hall repeatedly yelled at police , warning them the man was in her apartment .
" She must have screamed 20 times , 'he 's in her apartment ,
he 's in her apartment .
Get him out . '
But they left me with him for 10 minutes .
I had to go out and tell them to come and get him .
When they came in they made him sit on a kitchen chair and wanted to handcuff him .
He got quite volatile . "
Neighbours said the shot woman was known always to carry a fork and lived not far from the scene .
The two had been seen arguing further down the street about half an hour before police were called .
Mrs McCabe said she did not see the woman wielding a knife or fork and did not see any injuries on the man .
" He took his jacket off while he was sitting on the lounge and there was n't any blood .
He had a red mark on his head but he did n't appear to be cut at all …
We do n't understand why the police are saying she was the attacker and that she had a knife . "
Police refused to comment on Mrs McCabe 's version , saying a critical incident investigation team had been formed .
But they said they had no intention of charging the man .
However , a spokesman for Westmead Hospital said the man was not treated there .
" I can confirm the woman is in intensive care but we did not see a man who was involved at all , " he said .
Another neighbour , Marian Baker , who lives opposite Mrs McCabe , said she was woken by the couple screaming and then heard two shots .
" But I am completely flummoxed as to why the couple was here , " she said .
" They are not residents and we do n't get a lot of trouble around here . "
The acting assistant police commissioner , Karen Webb , said the officer who shot the woman , who is believed to have been in the force for less than two years , was not qualified to use a stun gun , even though the weapons were available at the station .
" There were n't officers on duty last night that were trained in the Taser … and certified , " she said .
" Tasers have been issued to each of the 80 local area commands across the state and it's a question of those police that have been trained and certified being available at the time to be able to use them . "
Ms Webb would not comment on how many times the gun was fired or where the woman was shot .
The matter is being investigated by the critical incident team and the police officer is expected to return to duty soon .
" She 's gone home to rest as she was on night shift and there 's no indication that she wo n't be returning to duty in the near future , " Ms Webb said .
The secretary of the NSW Police Association , Peter Remfrey , said all frontline police should have access to stun guns because shootings presented an " incalculable human cost to the police officer and the person who has been shot … the system is putting an intolerable burden on supervisors to make these life and death decisions quickly and all police need to have access to the full range of tactical options . "
But the Premier , Nathan Rees , said stun guns would not be rushed in without a proper trial .
Mrs McCabe 's family rallied around her .
" She is amazing , " her daughter , Antoinette Hogan , said .
" She rang me as soon as it happened and told me everything was under control so I did n't come over until this morning - and that 's when I found out what really happened .
She 's had a lot of experience with people in these sort of situations through her hostel work but she 's been retired for a very long time now so I am just stunned at this . " with AAP
HONG KONG , Dec. 13 ( UPI ) --
Police searched without success Saturday for whoever threw two large bottles of acid down on a Hong Kong street filled with holiday shoppers , injuring dozens .
One man told the South China Morning Post he saw one of the two white bottles , about 750 milliliters , hit the ground about 5 p.m. and the liquid burst out .

" A bottle came down , " he said .
" It looked like an ordinary bottle of water , and the crowd began to disperse .
Then I saw people with red faces and eyes in pain . "
Once those splattered realized the liquid was acid they rushed to find water to wash it from their faces and hands , the Post said .
Some covered their eyes in pain as they got into ambulances .
Others had holes in their clothing or backpacks .
Police said 46 people suffered acid burns but all were released by 10 p.m .
Five hours of searching by police failed to turn up any suspects , the Post reported .
" Judging by the traces and the positions of the two bottles , this is not an accident , " Superintendent Annie Fonda of the Kowloon West regional police headquarters said .
" We believe someone intentionally hurled them from a height . "

THE speed with which clouds of economic gloom and even despair have gathered over the global economy has been startling everywhere .
But the change has been especially sudden in the world 's two most populous countries : China and India .
Until quite recently , the world 's fastest - growing big economies both felt themselves largely immune from the contagion afflicting the rich world .
Optimists even hoped that these huge emerging markets might provide the engines that could pull the world out of recession .
Now some fear the reverse : that the global downturn is going to drag China and India down with it , bringing massive unemployment to two countries that are , for all their success , still poor — India is home to some two - fifths of the world 's malnourished children .
The pessimism may be overdone .
These are still the most dynamic parts of the world economy .
But both countries face daunting economic and political difficulties .
In India 's case , its newly positive self - image has suffered a double blow : from the economic buffeting , and from the bullets of the terrorists who attacked Mumbai last month .
As our special report makes clear , India 's recent self - confidence had two roots .
One was a sustained spurt in economic growth to a five - year annual average of 8.8 % .
The other was the concomitant rise in India 's global stature and influence .
No longer , its politicians gloated , was India “ hyphenated ” with Pakistan as one half of a potential nuclear maelstrom .
Rather it had become part of “ Chindia ” — a fast - growing success story .
The Mumbai attacks , blamed on terrorist groups based in Pakistan and bringing calls for punitive military action , have revived fears of regional conflict .
A hyphen has reappeared over India 's western border , just as the scale of the economic setback hitting India is becoming apparent .
Exports in October fell by 12 % compared with the same month last year ; hundreds of small textile firms have gone out of business ; even some of the stars of Indian manufacturing of recent years , in the automotive industry , have suspended production .
The central bank has revised its estimate of economic growth this year downwards , to 7.5 - 8 % , which is still optimistic .
Next year the rate may well fall to 5.5 % or less , the lowest since 2002 .
Still faster after all these years
If China 's growth rate were to fall to that level , it would be regarded as a disaster at home and abroad .
The country is this month celebrating the 30th anniversary of the event seen as marking the launch of its policies of “ reform and opening ” , since when its economy has grown at an annual average of 9.8 % .
The event was a meeting of the Communist Party 's Central Committee at which Deng Xiaoping gained control .
Tentatively at first but with greater radicalism in the 1990s , the party dismantled most of the monolithic Maoist edifice — parcelling out collective farmland , sucking in vast amounts of foreign investment and allowing private enterprise to thrive .
The anniversary may be a bogus milestone , but it is easy to understand why the party should want to trumpet the achievements of the past 30 years ( see article ) .
They have witnessed the most astonishing economic transformation in human history .
In a country that is home to one - fifth of humanity some 200 m people have been lifted out of poverty .
Yet in China , too , the present downturn is jangling nerves .
The country is a statistical haze , but the trade figures for last month — with exports 2 % lower than in November 2007 and imports 18 % down — were shocking .
Power generation , generally a reliable number , fell by 7 % .
Even though the World Bank and other forecasters still expect China 's GDP to grow by 7.5 % in 2009 , that is below the 8 % level regarded , almost superstitiously , as essential if huge social dislocation is to be avoided .
Just this month a senior party researcher gave warning of what he called , in party - speak , “ a reactive situation of mass - scale social turmoil ” .
Indeed , demonstrations and protests , always common in China , are proliferating , as laid - off factory - workers join dispossessed farmers , environmental campaigners and victims of police harassment in taking to the streets .
The gap between mouth and trouser
One worry is that China 's rulers will try to push the yuan down to help exporters .
That would be a terrible idea , not least because the government has the resources to ease the pain in less dangerous ways : it is running a budget surplus and has little debt .
Last month it announced a huge 4 trillion yuan ( nearly $ 600 billion ) fiscal - stimulus package .
Some who have crunched the numbers argue that this was all mouth and no trousers — much of it made up by old budget commitments , double - counting and empty promises .
It was thus mainly propaganda , to convince China 's own people and the outside world that the government was serious about stimulating demand at home .
That may yet prove to be unfair : what matters is when infrastructure money is spent , not when it is announced .
Yet there is little sign that the regime is ready to take radical steps in the two areas that would do most to persuade the rural majority to spend its money rather than hoard it : giving farmers better rights over their land ; and providing a decent social safety - net , especially in health care .
Still , China does at least have trousers , with deep pockets .
India , in contrast , is not seen as a big potential part of the answer to the world 's economic problems .
Not only is its economy far smaller ; its government 's finances are also a mess .
Its budget deficit — some 8 % of GDP — inhibits it from offering a bigger stimulus that might mitigate the downturn ( see article ) .
This is alarming .
If China reckons it needs 8 % annual growth to provide jobs for the 7 m or so new members of its workforce each year , how is India to cope ?
A younger country , its workforce is increasing by about 14 m a year — ie , about one - quarter of the world 's new workers .
And , perversely , its great successes of recent years have been in industries that rely not on vast supplies of cheap labour but on smaller numbers of highly educated engineers — such as its computer - services businesses and capital - intensive manufacturing .
In two respects , however , India has a big advantage over China in coping with an economic slowdown .
It has all - too extensive experience in it ; and it has a political system that can cope with disgruntlement without suffering existential doubts .
India pays an economic price for its democracy .
Decision - making is cumbersome .
And as in China , unrest and even insurgency are widespread .
But the political system has a resilience and flexibility that China 's own leaders , it seems , believe they lack .
They are worrying about how to cope with protests .
India 's have their eyes on a looming election .
It used to be a platitude of Western — and Marxist — analysis of China that wrenching economic change would demand political reform .
Yet China 's economy boomed with little sign of any serious political liberalisation to match the economic free - for - all .
The cliché fell into disuse .
Indeed , many , even in democratic bastions such as India , began to fall for the Chinese Communist Party 's argument that dictatorship was good for growth , whereas Indian democracy was a luxury paid for by the poor , in the indefinite extension of their poverty .
But as China enters a trying year of anniversaries — the 50th of the suppression of an uprising in Tibet ; the 20th of the quashing of the Tiananmen Square protests ; the 60th of the founding of the People 's Republic itself — it may be worth remembering that the winter of 1978 - 79 saw not only a party Central Committee plenum but also the “ Democracy Wall ” movement in Beijing .
It was a brief flowering of the freedom of expression , quite remarkable after the xenophobic isolation of the Cultural Revolution .
Deng , like Mao Zedong before him , tolerated the dissident movement as long as it served his ends , and then stamped it out .
In so doing he thwarted what Wei Jingsheng , the most famous of the wall - writers , had dubbed “ the fifth modernisation ” : democracy .
China still needs it .

Spit or Swallow ?
You 're Missing the Point !

There is not much difference in your STD risk between spitting and swallowing -- it 's the sucking on an unwrapped penis ( or un- dental - damned vagina ) that 's risky when it comes to STDs !
Exposing yourself to skin - to - skin contact and body fluids ( whether they are spit out or swallowed ) during oral sex is how you can get STDs like herpes , gonorrhea and HIV .
( Even the wording " swallowing sperm " is inaccurate , as if you could separate the sperm from the ejaculate -- just as Portia proved you can't separate a pound of flesh from the blood coursing through it , so it is with sperm and spunk . )

There 's been a lot of talk about how it 's hilarious , how it 's gross , how you 'd never get that kind of sex ed here , whether or not it 's fake , why it seems like she 's holding a quart in there *....

Last Saturday , we told you the story of Adam Jackson , who pointed a Web camera out the window of his Tenderloin apartment and created a hot Internet site .
Today , we tell you how it all went wrong , from a flurry of death threats to being targeted by cyberbullies .
But just when it looked like the thugs had bullied Jackson into taking down his site , the community rallied behind the concept of neighborhood cameras .
In fact , the interest may be stronger than ever .
There are lots of lessons here .
For starters , Jackson has learned about privacy on the Internet :
There is n't any .
Second , neighborhood cameras work - for better or worse , they focus attention on life on the street .
And third , did you ever wonder why it is so difficult to get people to step up and try to make things better in troubled neighborhoods ?
It 's because there are always some self - appointed guardians of the status quo who make it as difficult as possible .
One week ago , adamsblock.com was a cool new Web site that was picking up additional viewers every day .
It consisted of two cameras on Taylor Street that aired 24 - hour views of the street .
A microphone picked up street sounds , and a chat board allowed regulars to talk about what they were seeing .
They counted buses , raced each other to post the numbers written on taxis , and developed a little culture of their own .
The site was a hit not only with viewers from all over the world , but with neighborhood groups .
They realized that when they saw crimes occur , they could immediately report them to the police , and that 's just what they did .
" I assumed the community would be against it , " Jackson said Friday .
" But the community embraced it . "
The guys who did n't like it are members of a graffiti group .
When they found the site , they made a banner advertising their Web site and held it up in front of the camera .
Jackson decided the banner was meant to encourage graffiti and deleted it .
The group took that as an affront .
" Their argument was free speech , " Jackson said .
" My feeling was it 's my camera .
I can do what I want . "
And that 's when he ran into the real problem .
As Jackson admits , he was remarkably naive about posting his personal information .
He not only included his e-mail address , but the address of his apartment and which floor he was on .
His phone number was also available .
Jackson began to get e-mailed threats .
Someone posted photos of Jackson and his girlfriend on their own Web site .
Somebody called his employer to say Jackson was a pedophile .
" We just wanted you to know that we know we are being watched , " said one message , " and we do n't like it . "
When Jackson called the police about some letters being spray - painted on the street , the harassment intensified .
He was a snitch .
Anonymous thugs threw rocks at his window at night , and he was followed to work by a group of guys in hooded sweatshirts .
" It was n't like I was crazy , " Jackson said .
" This was guys walking up behind you , staring at you . "
This Web camera was n't a crusade by Jackson , it was just an idea he had that he thought would make things safer and quieter in the neighborhood .
He was even planning an Internet fundraiser for Glide Memorial Church .
But it quickly turned into more trouble than it was worth .
He 'd already made the mistake of revealing too much - now he just wanted to make it stop .
The first offer the bullies made was so outlandish even Jackson , worried about his safety , turned it down .
" They said unless I videotaped myself admitting all this and got it played on the local TV news , they would come after me , " Jackson said .
The alternative was that Jackson post an apology written by the group , which included phrases like " ... what a racist and ignorant human being that I am ... "
Jackson did that .
He also arranged to move out of his apartment and to take down the cameras .
So the bullies won ?
Not so fast .
Neville Gittens , spokesman for the San Francisco Police Department said , " We want to follow up on this .
We 're going to reach out to him to encourage him to make a police report . "
And , with his apology , Jackson announced something else .
The site will continue , but not under his direction .
An unnamed party already has a camera up at a different Tenderloin street corner .
Jackson said at least three other sites have sprung up independently , and there has been interest in linking all of them together through ourblock.com .
It is possible that neighborhoods all over the city will have 24 - hour cameras .
That was Jackson 's idea all along .
" People have already started doing this themselves , " Jackson said .
" There 's no way to stop it now . "
The FBI today challenged anyone in the online community to break a cipher code on its site .
The code was created by FBI cryptanalysts .
The bureau invited hackers to a similar code - cracking challenge last year and got tens of thousands of responses it said .
A number of sites host such cipher challenges , including this one at the University of South Hampton .
The FBI offers a few primers on the subject including :
A relatively basic form of substitution cipher is the Caesar Cipher , named for its Roman origins .
The Caesar Cipher involves writing two alphabets , one above the other .
The lower alphabet is shifted by one or more characters to the right or left and is used as the cipher text to represent the plain text letter in the alphabet above it .
Plain Text
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
Cipher Text
B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z A
In this example , the plain text K is enciphered with the cipher text L. The phrase ' Lucky Dog ' would be enciphered as follows :
Plain Text : L U C K Y D O G
Cipher Text : M V D L Z E P H
Ciphers can be made more secure by using a keyword to scramble one of the alphabets .
Keywords can be placed in the plain text , the cipher text , or both , and any word can be used as a key if repeated letters are dropped .
Here the word SECRETLY ( minus the second E ) is used as the plain text keyword .
Plain Text
S E C R T L Y A B D F G H I J K M N O P Q U V W X Z
Cipher Text
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
The FBI of course does n't always invite folks to break code on its site .
In fact last spring a consultant managed to access the bureau 's National Crime Information Center database .

Francis Bacon was an English scientist , Christian , politician , and polymath during the Age of Exploration who lived from 1561 to 1626 and promoted research based on experimentation .
In addition to his scientific work he wrote many books , and some have even suggested that he was the true author of William Shakespeare 's plays .
[ 1]
He died from hypothermia sustained from stuffing a snow - packed chicken inside his shirt .
Bacon is famous for his role in the Scientific Revolution , promoting scientific experimentation as a way of glorifying God and fulfilling scripture .
He is also famous as a politician in Elizabethan England , as he held the office of Lord Chancellor .
He also was against the splintering within Christianity , believing that it would ultimately lead to the creation of atheism as a dominant worldview , as indicated with his quote that " The causes of atheism are : divisions in religion , if they be many ; for any one main division , addeth zeal to both sides ; but many divisions introduce atheism . " [ 2 ]
His views also proved influential to the Encyclopédistes , with D'Alembert and Diderot specifically crediting him with their creation of the Encyclopedie . [ 3 ]
Though as noted above , it was extremely unlikely that Bacon would have ever approved of the Encyclopedistes ' usage of his scientific reasoning in the book due to their trying to promote atheism .

He is not to be confused with the 20th Century Anglo - Irish painter ( 1909 - 1992 ) [ 4 ] of the same name , although the artist Francis Bacon was what is known as a ' collateral descendant ' of his earlier namesake . [ 5 ]
Quotes
Knowledge is power .
A bad man is worse when he pretends to be a saint .
There are two books laid before us to study , to prevent our falling into error ; first , the volume of the Scriptures , which reveal the will of God ; then the volume of the Creatures , which express His power .
There never was found , in any age of the world , either religion or law that did so highly exalt the public good as the Bible .
" A good name is like precious ointment " ; it filleth all round about , and will not easily away ; for the odors of ointments are more durable than those of flowers .
A man shall see , where there is a house full of children , one or two of the eldest restricted , and the youngest ruined by indulgence ; but in the midst , some that are , as it were , forgotten , who many times , nevertheless , prove the best .
A man that studieth revenge keeps his own wounds green , which otherwise would heal and do well .
A man that hath no virtue in himself ever envieth virtue in others ; for men's minds will either feed upon their own good or upon others ' evil ; and who wanteth the one will prey upon the other .
A man would do well to carry a pencil in his pocket , and write down the thoughts of the moment .
Those that come unsought for are commonly the most valuable , and should be secured , because they seldom return .
A just fear of an imminent danger , though there be no blow given , is a lawful cause of war .
A steady hand in military affairs is more requisite than in peace , because an error committed in war may prove irremediable .
All the crimes on earth do not destroy so many of the human race , nor alienate so much property , as drunkenness . [ 6 ]

Ruby Implementation Shootout : A Bright Future for Ruby Performance !
By Peter Cooper
Back in December 2007 , Antonio Cangiano presented The Great Ruby Shootout , a large set of benchmarks of then - current Ruby implementations ( Ruby 1.8.5 , YARV - early Ruby 1.9 , JRuby , Ruby .
NET , Rubinius , XRuby , and Cardinal ) .
Even then , despite Ruby 1.9's infancy and experimental nature , Ruby 1.9 came out as about three times faster than Ruby 1.8.5 - while other implementations were barely faster than 1.8.5 .
Now .. for 2008 : Ruby 1.9.1 is the winner ..!
Now Antonio has put together an all new December 2008 Great Ruby Shootout !
There 's a lot of reading to do but the results are very exciting .
JRuby 's performance has come along in leaps and bounds and Ruby 1.9.1 is around five times faster than Ruby 1.8.7 .
Phusion 's Ruby Enterprise Edition ( basically an amended fork of 1.8.6 ) also comes in at a surprising two - times faster than 1.8.7 !
Remember that Antonio's benchmarks are by no means representative of how your application might be using Ruby , but these numbers are extremely encouraging .
As well as comparing JRuby , Ruby 1.8.7 , Ruby 1.9.1 , Rubinius and REE , separate benchmarks were run for Maglev , MacRuby and IronRuby - all still reasonably experimental implementations .
Maglev worked out at about twice the speed of 1.8 ( though some operations were far slower ) , MacRuby offered performance equivalent to 1.8 ( at this point ) , and IronRuby was a little slower due to its focus on .NET integration and matching the Ruby spec more closely ( versus working on performance and optimizations ) .
Make sure to head over to the article for the full results .
Antonio sums it up pretty well :
Overall I think these are great results .
Ruby 1.8 ( MRI ) , with its slowness and memory leaks , belongs to the past .
It ’s time for the community to move forward and on to something better and faster - and we do n’t lack interesting alternatives to do so at this stage .
Could Ruby 1.9.1 be about to beat Python , Perl or PHP ?
Now all we need is for Ruby 1.9.1 to reach final release and to see how it stacks up on the Alioth Shootout .
Currently Ruby 1.8 is at the very bottom and an earlyish build of Ruby 1.9 is 9th from bottom just below Python , Perl and PHP .
If the performance of Ruby 1.9 can go from 28 times slower than compiled C++ to just 18 times slower , Ruby will leapfrog these three strong competitors and one of the biggest criticisms of Ruby will become extinct .
( As an aside - is anyone familiar enough with the Alioth Shootout to run the benchmarks for the latest Ruby 1.9.1 build to see how it compares so far ? )

MUSIC NEWS -
After her departure from Sony Music and with plans to go indie ; Tori Amos has now announced that she will release her next studio album , her 10th , on Universal Republic Records !
It 's due in the late spring or early summer of 2009 .
Reports are that Amos and Universal have entered into a unique venture with a different approach to the artist / label arrangement .
With the new business relationship , Universal and Amos will jointly work on other projects " in tandem with Ms. Amos ' prolific creative output . "
( OK , we 're curious ! )
One of the first projects will be her release of a " groundbreaking new visual component " along with her new album , according to a press release issued on 12/ 2 .
Each song on the album will feature a corresponding documentary - like " visualette " that was shot in HD and Super 8 over the past year .
In the statement , Amos ' manager , John Witherspoon , said , " The intricate development of this unique Audio Visual component to Tori 's musical presentation , which she has been crafting through her own Galactic Media company , is indicative of the outlier creative and strategic opportunities both Tori and Universal Republic hope to build upon this extraordinary relationship . "
Ms. Amos ' most recent album , American Doll Posse , was released in 2007 .
Ms. Amos has been working on a musical for London 's British National Theatre called The Light Princess tentatively scheduled to debut in 2010 .
The Bank of England underestimated the severity of the current financial crisis , according to its deputy governor , who has admitted that interest rates are only a " blunt instrument " with which to control the economy .
Sir John Gieve told the BBC's Panorama programme , to be screened tonight , that new tools were needed to complement interest rates .
He also admitted that the Bank knew " crazy borrowing " was taking place and the price of houses and other assets was rising unsustainably , but did not fully understand the problem .
" We did n't think it was going to be anything like as severe as it's turned out to be , " said Gieve , who is in charge of financial stability at the Bank .
" Why did n't we see that it was so serious ?
I think that 's because we , perhaps , we had n't kept pace with the extent of globalisation .
So the upswing here did n't involve the big increases in earnings and consumption and activity which we saw in previous booms .
We saw the credit , we saw the house prices , but we did see a fairly stable pattern of earnings , prices and output . "
Tim Besley , another member of the Bank 's monetary policy committee , was quoted in the Daily Mail as saying there was " no quick or easy fix " to deal with the fall - out from the credit crunch and that measures other than monetary policy were needed .
Sterling fell to a fresh record low against a trade - weighted basket of major currencies after the comments , hit by worries that British interest rates need to come down much further as recession bites .
The euro climbed 1.5 % to 94.72 p , taking it close to its recent record high of 95.56 p , which has led to the expectation that the two currencies will soon reach parity .
More powers needed
Explaining why the Bank did not raise interest rates to curb the lending and house price boom , Gieve said : " If we 'd used interest rates to try and address this asset - price credit growth , we would have been holding down the level of activity elsewhere in the economy , in manufacturing , in other services , holding down the level of employment at a time when consumer price inflation and earnings were stable and reasonably low .
And people would have said , you know , ' this is a wilful reduction in the prosperity of the country ' . "
The Bank could not rely only on interest rates to control the economy , Gieve argued .
" One of the main lessons from this is that we need to develop some new instruments which sit somewhere between interest rates , which affect the whole economy and activity , and individual supervision and regulation of individual banks , " he said .
" Maybe we need to develop something which bridges that gap and directly addresses the financial cycle and prevents the financial cycle and the credit cycle getting out of hand ...
I think we need to complement interest rates , which are a blunt instrument – you set one interest rate for the whole economy – with something which is more financial - sector specific . "
Philip Shaw , chief economist at Investec , said the comments suggested that the " authorities recognise that more needs to be done to restrain borrowing booms because they are potentially destabilising . "
He noted that there had been numerous comments by Bank officials previously stating that interest rates could not be used to rein in borrowing because they were mainly designed to keep inflation on target .
Among the measures being considered by the government – to be adopted once the economy recovers – is a requirement for banks to hold more capital during good times .
Other measures could include legislation or guidelines on lending to households , Shaw said .
Gieve defended the Bank 's performance in the crisis , which he called " a major storm we have n't seen the like of for 100 years " .
" It would be very surprising if we were n't learning lessons from it and we are , " he added .
Gieve also cast doubt on whether the Treasury would get all of the money back that it had poured into the banking sector , pointing to a " level of defaults " in the books of nationalised lenders Northern Rock and Bradford & Bingley , which were now held by the taxpayer .
Speaking on the same programme , John Varley , the chief executive of Barclays , predicted that consumers and businesses would struggle to get access to credit for the next one to two years .
MEXICO CITY ( Reuters ) - Mexican President Felipe Calderon vowed on Monday not to back down from the fight against powerful drug cartels who decapitated eight soldiers in the most serious blow to the army in a 2 - year - old offensive .
Members of a drug gang are shown to the media at the Attorney General 's office in the suburb of Escobedo , on the outskirts of Monterrey December 20 , 2008 .

Police found the beheaded and tortured bodies tied up in the city of Chilpancingo , about an hour north of Acapulco , during the weekend .
The heads were stuffed in a black plastic bag and tossed outside a shopping center with a note saying , “ For every one of us you kill , we are going to kill 10 , ” Mexican media reported .
An ex-police commander , also without a head , was found with the soldiers .
The gruesome attack was the worst against the army since Calderon deployed some 45,000 troops to take on drug gangs after coming to office in 2006 .
“ We are committed to this fight with all of its consequences , ” Calderon said at an event honoring a military hero .
“ We will not stand down and there will be no truce with enemies of the state , ” he said .
Calderon ’s assault against drug gangs has netted several major smugglers wanted in the United States , but violence in Mexico has worsened .
More than 5,300 people have died this year , over twice as many as in 2007 , as traffickers fight each other and the government over drug smuggling routes .
Washington , which has promised Mexico hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to buy equipment and provide security training , now sees Mexican cartels as its No. 1 drug threat .
It was not clear which faction was behind the beheadings .
The main drug gangs are the Gulf cartel from northeastern Mexico and a federation of smugglers run out of the northwestern state of Sinaloa by Mexico ’s most wanted man , Joaquin “ Shorty ” Guzman .
The violence threatens to scare away investors and hit Mexico ’s economy , already shaky from the global financial crisis .
Mexican cartels are increasingly taking the place of the Colombian organizations who once ruled the international cocaine trade .
Colombians have ceded many traditional trafficking routes to the United States to the Mexican gangs , preferring lower profile roles or focusing on Europe .
“ There are no drug trafficking organizations left in Colombia that think they can go toe - to - toe with the nation - state ; the cartels up in Mexico actually think that they can , ” a senior Drug Enforcement Administration official based in Colombia told Reuters .
Calderon deployed the soldiers to fight organized crime in part because they are seen as less corrupt than police .
But military men from generals to foot soldiers have said they too are being offered thousands of dollars to turn a blind eye to shipments or call off anti-drugs operations .
Here are a six great pictures that should remind everyone that no one should spend their life working at a job they hate .
Life is too short after all , so why waste it doing meaningless work ?

IMAGINE , suggests Philipp Blom , that a “ voracious but highly selective plague of bookworms ” had deprived us of all knowledge of 20th - century history after 1914 .
How would the early years of the last century look when taken on their own , rather than overshadowed by the cataclysm of the first global war ?
Seen against the backdrop of what followed , the period 1900 - 14 was a golden evening of civilisation : a time of social stability , peaceful international relations , political reform and economic integration , leavened by startling technological and cultural progress .
Yet as Mr Blom argues in his masterly and panoramic history of Europe in the pre-war years , to the “ nervous generation ” actually living through it , the era felt rather different .
For them it was a time of jarring uncertainties , when solid 19th - century conceptions were corroded and eroded .
Rudyard Kipling had mourned the already visible ( to him at least ) fading of British imperial power in his hugely popular “ Recessional ” .
Matthew Arnold , whom Mr Blom quotes in the same passage , wrote of “ the long , withdrawing roar ” of declining religious faith in his poem “ Dover Beach ” .
Scientific notions such as radioactivity , and the spooky new business of X - rays , were turning things upside down too .
So were philosophers such as Bertrand Russell and Ludwig von Wittgenstein .
“ If scientific analysis made the world fall apart , philosophical reason poured acid over the remaining truths , ” argues Mr Blom .
But out of those uncertainties came the age in which we live now .
Mr Blom musters a rich array of details and sources to bolster his argument .
His book gives a chapter to each year , stitching together developments in the German - speaking world ( his forte ) as well as neurotic France , reactionary Russia and self - confident Britain .
His themes range from sex to science , from high politics to gruesome crime , from advanced art to popular literature , all dotted with entertaining nuggets of court and other gossip .
As the reader reaches the economic and social decline of the English aristocracy after the death of Queen Victoria , it helps to be told that the libidinous King Edward VII was known as “ Edward the Caresser ” by his disrespectful subjects .
Fans of Marcel Proust will be intrigued to know that the French literary titan was obsessed with motorcars : what would now be termed a “ petrolhead ” .
And who will see Walt Disney 's “ Bambi ” with the same eyes in the knowledge , waspishly passed on by Mr Blom , that his creator , Felix Salten , was the anonymous author of a notorious pornographic novel ?
It is a slight weakness of the book that smaller countries are almost ignored .
As the narrative sweeps between the great powers of Europe , the reader is left wondering what happened in , say , the Netherlands ( then still an empire ) , in Sweden or in Italy .
A second criticism is a possible over - emphasis on sex .
The era was indeed marked by an unbuttoning of Victorian sexual mores , by the activities of some brave if marginal feminists ( such as the British campaigners for women 's suffrage ) , by increasing female employment and by a decline in the importance of male muscular strength .
It is interesting to see problems ranging from naval shipbuilding to public health viewed through the prism of sexual angst .
But it is quite a leap to maintain , as the Vienna - based Mr Blom does , that “ all instinct is ultimately sexual . ”
A third and more substantial point is that much of the then newfangled thinking that Mr Blom describes would have been regarded by most people at the time as deranged , freakish or irrelevant .
Sigmund Freud , Friedrich Nietzsche , Virginia Woolf and Rudolf Steiner all had their followings ; their popularity casts revealing light on the cultural and intellectual needs of the time .
Their ideas are interesting even today .
Yet in his excitement to portray the shock of the new , Mr Blom risks neglecting the fact that the previous century had left a solid legacy .
For most people , it was that world — orderly , patriarchal and even devout — that still dominated daily life .
That should not deter the reader from enjoying Mr Blom 's impressive and thought - provoking book .
His particular gift is to encapsulate complex historical and biographical events pithily and in an illuminating context .
The story of Belgium 's monarchical colonists in the Congo is a gruesome tale of inhumanity ( the bit about children 's hands being amputated to punish their parents for slow work is not easily forgotten ) .
It is aptly compared with German and British behaviour in southern Africa .
But it also gives the chance to explain how Edward Morel and Roger Casement launched what was , in effect , the first international human - rights campaign , using the mass media to bring an unstoppable torrent of public criticism to bear on the Belgian authorities .
The book brings the fears , enthusiasms and blindspots of the period brilliantly to life .
If civilisation lasts another 100 years , perhaps an equally talented historian will one day compare the first decade of this century to its dizzying counterpart before 1914 .
If so , Mr Blom 's book is unlikely to be bettered as a source .
So you 've got some spare airmiles and want to impress on a date but you 're struggling to think of a place to go which is unique and romantic at the same time .

BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) --
Thousands of people marched in central Baghdad on Saturday to protest a proposed U.S. - Iraqi security agreement that would extend the presence of U.S. troops in the country after the end of the year .
Thousands staged a mass march through Baghdad , Iraq , on Saturday to protest a planned U.S. - Iraq security deal .
The political party of Iraqi cleric Muqtada al - Sadr called for the rally .
At one point , several speakers at a podium addressed the mass of people , urging the Iraqi government to reject the proposal .
" End the U.S. occupation of Iraq ! " one speaker shouted in English .
Hazem al - Araji , a senior al - Sadr aide , told protesters their voices would be heard in America .
" Thanks to you , to these voices and the millions of voices , George Bush will hear these millions of calls in his ' Black House ' -- in which you shouted out , ' No , no , America ! ' " he said .
Watch protesters wave flags , swarm street »
" This talk and these words are that of the leader , Muqtada al - Sadr : Baghdad is free , free !
America , get out .
This voice does not reach the Green Zone .
We want to hear everyone who is occupied in that area saying Baghdad is free , free , America get out ! " al - Araji exclaimed .
Protesters clogged several streets in the capital , waving Iraqi flags and kicking up dust .
The demonstration , the largest in Baghdad in several months , was largely peaceful .
Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said in Washington on Thursday a draft status - of - forces agreement authorizing the U.S. troop presence in Iraq had " been agreed upon by U.S. and Iraqi negotiators " and was being reviewed by the two governments .
A U.N. mandate authorizing the U.S. troop presence in Iraq expires December 31 , and U.S. officials are examining " contingencies " in case the Iraqi government is unable to sell the status - of - forces deal to the country 's various factions , a senior Bush administration official said this week .
The same official said negotiations on the pact had finished and the text was final .
The official said the " final " draft calls for U.S. troops to be out of Iraqi cities by June 2009 and out of Iraq by the end of 2011 unless the Iraqis ask the United States to stay .
The U.S. official , speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the discussions , said negotiators had also " reached a compromise " on the issue of U.S. troops remaining immune from Iraqi law -- an issue that was a major hurdle in the talks .
Baghdad has sought the power to arrest and try Americans accused of crimes not related to official military operations , plus jurisdiction over troops and contractors who commit grave mistakes in the course of their duties .
The United States has insisted its troops and contractors remain immune from Iraqi law .

ACPO eats its words
Previous Slide ◀ Next Slide ▶ ACPO has gone back on claims they made against motorcycles 1 of 1
Police chiefs have made a humiliating climb - down over proposals to ban motorcycles , following pressure from MCN .
The Association of Chief Police Officers ( ACPO ) has admitted to MPs that basic claims backing up the proposal were untrue .
ACPO had told the commons transport committee motorcycles may not belong on UK roads but has now accepted : ‘ Motorcycling is a viable and necessary part of our transport infra-structure . ’
Crucially , the association had claimed many production motorcycles did over 200 mph but has now admitted this was completely wrong .
ACPO has also climbed down over claims motorcyclists dodge road tax on a ‘ massive scale ’ .
It now admits : ‘ The level of vehicle excise evasion on motorcycles is not significantly greater than that of other vehicles ’
The association had originally recommended : ‘ Production machines are readily available for use on our roads with top speeds in excess of 200 mph .
Motorcycles are seen in the UK to be , in the majority of instances , vehicles of choice rather than necessity and one might consider if our congested roads are any longer fit for purpose for these motorised toys . ’
MCN highlighted ACPO ’s false claims and challenged it to name a single production motorcycle capable of over 200 mph .
We also challenged the claim on tax evasion , pointing out Government research shows only 6.5 % of motorcycles are untaxed .
A new letter from the association to the committee now admits : ‘ ACPO has acknowledged that , without modification , production motorcycles in the UK are not capable of over 200 mph , but are capable of speeds approaching that number .
‘ The phrase “ motorised toys ” was intended to refer to a relatively small number of very high powered sports machines ridden by a minority of riders in an inconsiderate way , causing danger to themselves and other road users .
This was not intended to describe the vast majority of motorcycles used for both leisure and business purposes . ’
On tax evasion , the new letter states : ‘ At the time of the submission , the available evidence suggested that vehicle evasion by motorcyclists was a significant issue .
Research has since indicated that the level of vehicle excise evasion on motorcycles is not significantly greater than that of other vehicles . ’
On the suggestion that bikes may not belong on the roads , the letter claims : ‘ Discussions within ACPO surrounded off - road vehicles in particularly environmentally sensitive areas where noise and environmental damage have arisen as a concern to communities .
This statement was not intended to suggest restrictions on the access of law - abiding road - using motorcyclists . ’
David Griffin , Humberside deputy chief constable and ACPO ’s lead on motorcycle safety , said the letter hoped to “ clarify its position ” .
In fact it seems likely to leave the committee as confused as motorcyclists about what ACPO wants and why it made such extreme recommendations in the first place .

With his investment bank facing a near - certain failure , Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. 's chief executive officer , Richard Fuld Jr. , placed yet another phone call to the man he thought could save him .
Mr. Fuld was already effectively out of options by the afternoon of Sunday , Sept. 14 .
The U.S. government said it would n't fund a bailout for Lehman , the country 's oldest investment bank .
Britain 's Barclays PLC had agreed in principle to buy the loss - wracked firm , but the deal fell apart .
Bank of America Corp. , initially seen as Lehman 's most likely buyer , had said two days earlier that it could n't do a deal without federal aid -- and by Sunday was deep in secret negotiations to take over Lehman rival Merrill Lynch & Co .
Desperate to avoid steering his 25,000 - person company into bankruptcy proceedings , Mr. Fuld dialed the Charlotte , N.C. , home of Bank of America Chairman Kenneth D. Lewis .
His calls so far that weekend had gone unreturned .
This time , Mr. Lewis 's wife , Donna , again picked up , and told the boss of Lehman Brothers : If Mr. Lewis wanted to call back , he would call back .
Mr. Fuld paused , then apologized for bothering her .
" I am so sorry , " he said .
His lament could also have been for the investment - banking model that had come to embody the words " Wall Street . "
Within hours of his call , Lehman announced it would file for bankruptcy protection .
Within a week , Wall Street as it was known -- loosely regulated , daringly risky and lavishly rewarded -- was dead .
Over a third of China ’s land is being scoured by erosion that is putting its crops and water supplies at risk , a three - year nationwide survey finds .
Soil is being washed and blown away not only in remote rural areas , but near mines , factories and even in cities , according to the country ’s official Xinhua news agency .
The agency is citing a report compiled by China ’s bio-environment security research team – the largest on soil conservation since the communist party took control of China in 1949 .
The team found that since 2000 , erosion has cost China 200 billion yuan ( $ 29 billion ) in economic losses .
Each year some 4.5 billion tonnes of soil are lost , threatening the country ’s ability to feed itself .
If erosion continues at this rate , harvests in China ’s north - eastern breadbasket could fall by 40 % in 50 years .
The Chinese findings tie into another report published this week : the US National Intelligence Council review , which is issued every four years .
According to this year ’s report , the world could see the return of battles over resources – raising the possibility of resource conflict between China and India .

“ China has a more dire situation than India , Japan , the United States , Australia and many other countries suffering from soil erosion , ” China ’s bio-environment security research team told Xinhua .
Beijing has long been worried about the desertification of its northern grasslands , and scaled back logging after rain rushing down denuded mountainsides caused massive flooding along the Yangtze in the late 1990s .
But around 1.6 million square kilometres of the country ’s surface is being degraded by water erosion , with almost every river basin affected .
Another 2 million square kilometres are under attack from wind .
Scientists at the University of Michigan College of Engineering are developing a six - inch robotic spy plane , modeled after a bat .
Its purpose is gathering data such as sights , sounds , and smells in urban combat zones and transmitting the information back to combatants in real time .
A $ 10 million grant was given for this project , which is being developed in the Center for Objective Microelectronics and Biomimetic Advanced Technology .
The robotic bat is planned to perform short - term surveillance missions supporting advancing troops in the battlefield .
It could perch at a street corner and send data regarding its immediate surroundings , or could land on a building for longer surveillance assignments .
Real - time reports of its activity will constantly be sent to the commanding unit .
Kamal Sarabandi , Director of the Center for Objective Microelectronics and Biomimetic Advanced Technology ( COM - BAT ) , commented on the project : “ We ’re trying to push the edge of our technologies to achieve functionality that was not possible before . ”
The University of California at Berkeley and the University of New Mexico are also involved in the COM - BAT project .
All of the scientists joined forces in order to implement the vision of a small , robotic aircraft capable of sensing and communicating .
Each university is responsible for developing a certain subsystem of the robotic bat .
The University of Michigan researchers are focusing on the microelectronics .
They will develop sensors , communication tools , and batteries for the new “ Bat ” micro-aerial vehicle .
Engineers envision tiny cameras for stereo vision , an array of mini microphones that could home in on sounds from different directions , and small detectors for nuclear radiation and poisonous gases .
The robotic bat will also have the ability to navigate at night , using low - power miniaturized radar and a very sensitive navigation system .
Its lithium battery will recharge using solar energy , wind , and vibrations , and the bat will communicate with the troops using radio signals .
“ Bats have a highly - attuned echolocation sense providing high - resolution navigation and sensing ability even in the dark , just as our sensor must be able to do , ” Sarabandi said .
Echolocation allows bats to navigate by emitting sounds and detecting the echoes .
By basing the robotic bat on an audio navigation system , the scientists can avoid the difficulties encountered when using vision - based systems .
The robot ’s body is designed to be about six inches long and to weigh about a quarter of a pound .
Its expected energy consumption will be 1W .
University of Michigan researchers intend to improve the technologies currently in use .
They will work to develop quantum dot solar cells that double the efficiency of current solar cells .
Furthermore , they expect their autonomous navigation system , which would allow the robot to direct its own movements , to be 1,000 times smaller and more energy efficient than systems in use today .
If the planned improvements will indeed be successful , the researchers believe they will provide the bat with a communication system ten times smaller , lighter and more energy efficient than currently available systems .
“ Throughout this research , we expect to make technological breakthroughs and have a much wider range of applications for other types of engineering problems , from medical to industrial , ” Sarabandi said .
TFOT has covered a micro robotic fly developed by researchers at Harvard University .
Other robots recently covered by TFOT are the rat robot , which is designed to aid in rescuing missions , and the Lemur , a robot developed by NASA in order to assist in space missions .
For more information on the robotic reconnaissance bat see the dedicated University of Michigan website .

The Hard Rock Cafe is known for a few things : dithering over the minimum wage , selling something called Joe Perry 's Rock Your World Quesadillas , and cabinet displays of gold discs for Boston 's More Than A Feeling , as well as Peter Frampton 's favourite frightwigs .
What it 's less known for is its range of merchandise which - while we 're not saying it 's tacky and ugly - makes that picture of Jordan in her shocking pink dressage look classy .
The newest addition is Goth Punk Barbie , which looks like a cross between the Distlillers ' Brody Dalle and one - time Corrie goth Rosie .
To quote the description on Hard Rock 's website , it " features a short ruffled skirt , fishnet stockings , fingerless gloves and a lace - up corset " .
Oh , and an electric guitar .
While we 're still reeling from the existence of the Katy Perry doll ( perhaps they could , you know , kiss each other .
I Kissed A Post - Feminist Icon Of Sublimation , anyone ? ) , this is just another example of big business ( Mattel , in this case ) learning that in 2008 , goth - tween ( " gween " ? ) can pay .
The movie version of emo teen - lit fave Twilight is topping the US box office .
And who could forget Diana Vickers 's various kohl - heavy " looks " on this year 's X Factor ?
OK , she could be singing Boom Bang - a - Bang , but the goth intent was clearly there .
Elsewhere , Disney has even made its latest star Demi Lovato in the image of Avril Lavigne ( the queen of faux goth - punk ) .
And to symbolise the passing on of the skull and crossbones - emblazoned baton to the younger generation , Avril joined Lovato and the Jonas Brothers onstage earlier this year for a version of , appropriately enough , My Happy Ending .
It 's amazing to think that Lavigne - who elevated faux punk to an artform with the simple line " He was a punk / She did ballet / What more can I say ? " - could birth a whole cultural movement .
Truly the day when the person who said , " I created punk for this day and age .
Do you see Britney walking around wearing ties and singing punk ?
Hell no ! " can wield so much influence is a great one .
But wait , Goth Punk Barbie , there 's trouble on the horizon .
With the Daily Mail at the height of its powers following its post - Sachsgate victory , surely the newspaper which hilariously called emo a " sinister cult " will campaign to have Goth Punk Barbie taken off the shelves .
Perhaps it will see to it that Barbie stops " going through this silly phase " and gets back to doing what she does best : feigning a toothy grin despite chronic back pain ( brought on from her oversized breasts ) and a split personality disorder ( from pretending to be a doctor , vet and / or ballerina astronaut ) .
Just wait until the paper finds out that Goth Punk Ken is a My Chemical Romance fan .
No sooner can you say " Suicide death cult toy somehow linked with death of Diana " than it will be removed from all Hard Rock Cafes the country over , only to reappear a few years later in Bride Of Chucky 2 : The College Years .
Hugh Hefner 's Sons Want to Change Playboy ( Photos )
Eighteen year oldand seventeen year oldmay some day take over the legacy of Playboy magazine from their father
They 've given it some thought and it sounds like they just may have what it takes .
Hef 's boys want to bring ' classy ' back with an edgier editorial feel .
Marston believes that they could still appeal to more forward thinking people .
Cooper said , " I 'd want the girls to be presented more as they were in the pictorials back in the 1950s and 1960s -- kind of artsy , classy .
I would like to bring back that retro-class feel . "
This year Playboy has scaled back its workforce by 14 percent and plans an aggressive approach in 2009 with more cuts .
Hef 's daughter Christie Hefner , 56 , announced she will step down from her position as Chairman and CEO at the end of January , after spending two decades helping ' good old dad ' run the empire .
The boys were brought up by their mother , former playmate Kimberly Conrad Hefner .
The three live next door to the Playboy mansion .
Sadly ,
Hef 's sons described him as a " hands off dad " who was too busy with his work to take on a parental role .
The men's magazine just came out with it 's 55th Anniversary issue which features Dasha Astafieva on the cover and Carmen Electra within the pages of the special edition .

You will be shocked if she cheated or her stuff is all gone .
You may feel empowered or a sense of rage and confidence .
This will only last for so long and when that enthusiasm dies , so you will feel like when you realise you are alone .
If she cheated , you may feel thrown away .
If the relationship just fizzled out , you will feel recycled .
Remember I am speaking to those gentlemen that let them self go in a matter of speaking .
I am talking to those guys that did n't listen to their partner 's needs , too dependent on their partner , talked a good game but in the end , that 's all it was and your partner lost interest and trust in what you were all about .

TBILISI ( AFP ) -- President Mikheil Saakashvili on Friday rejected criticism of Georgia 's August attack on the breakaway region of South Ossetia , saying it was necessary to ensure the security of his country .
" " Yes , we decided to undertake military actions in Tskhinvali , " " he said in testimony before a parliamentary probe into the conflict , referring to the South Ossetian capital . "
" We took this decision , it was a difficult decision that any responsible government would have taken to ensure the security of its citizens , " " he said .
Saakashvili has in recent weeks come under mounting criticism at home and abroad for his decision to send in troops , only to see them routed by Russian forces .
Saakashvili said the decision was taken after nearby Georgian villages came under " " heavy bombardment " " from South Ossetia and from the vicinity of Russian peacekeeping positions in the region .
He said " " hundreds of ( Russian ) tanks and heavy vehicles " " were on the border with Georgia and there was clear evidence that they had already started moving into the country on the August night that Tbilisi launched the attack . " " Under these conditions , if you ask me whether Georgia had to undertake military actions against these firing positions , the answer is yes , " " Saakashvili said .
A senior Russian military official rejected Saakashvili 's accusation that Russian forces were already on Georgian soil when Tbilisi launched the attack .
Saakashvili's appearance came after Erosi Kitsmarishvili , Georgia 's former envoy to Russia , claimed before the commission this week that Tbilisi had been planning assaults on South Ossetia and another rebel region , Abkhazia , for months .
Kitsmarishvili , who was ambassador to Moscow in the months before the war , also alleged that senior officials in Tbilisi believed they had received a green light from Washington to launch an assault .
Saakashvili denied this during his testimony , saying : " " We did not seek a green light from anyone . "
" The decision was taken by us independently , without asking for permission from anyone , " " he said .
Kitsmarishvili resumed his attacks on the government Friday , telling journalists that Georgian authorities could have avoided the war but failed .
Russian troops and tanks poured into Georgia on August 8 to repel the Georgian move on South Ossetia , which had received extensive backing from Moscow for years .
Russian forces occupied swathes of the country , but later withdrew to within South Ossetia and Abkhazia , which Moscow recognized as independent states .
In a conference call with journalists later , Saakashvili insisted that the United States was still pushing for Georgia to join the NATO military alliance , despite the U.S. dropping support for a membership plan .
"
" The Americans are pushing even harder than in April , " " Saakashvili said , in reference to the alliance summit earlier this year when NATO leaders refused to grant Georgia and Ukraine a Membership Action Plan ( MAP ) despite U.S. lobbying . "
" Hopefully we can get some kind of compromise where Georgia and Ukraine will continue to progress towards membership , " " he said .
" " How we get membership ... is secondary . " " Tbilisi had hoped to be granted MAP at a NATO ministerial meeting in Brussels next week , but on Wednesday U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said the plan was off the table for both Georgia and Ukraine .
Analysts say the U.S. has cooled its support amid opposition not just from Russia but also from Germany and France .
